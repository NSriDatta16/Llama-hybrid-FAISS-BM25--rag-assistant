You are asking for a complete web page with your Ajax call, and you're getting one back. It's working as designed, as they say. The problem is not with your Ajax, but with what you are returning from the server. You should be returning search results data, not a web page that happens to have search results data on it. Make the display of the static HTML elements on the page conditional on the method used to get the page. For instance, if the Ajax call looked like this: xmlhttp.open("GET","toy_search.jsp?query="+str+"&format=fragment",true); you would hide the HTML because of the &format=fragment part of the URL, leaving you with only the HTML that should be injected into the results div. In normal (non-Ajax) use, where the page is either being opened initially or there is a direct link to search results, the &format=fragment portion of the URL would not be present, and the user would load the entire page.
