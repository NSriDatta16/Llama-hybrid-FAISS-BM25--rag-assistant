Mac/Cocoa: Embed a terminal window in my app

Anyone found out if it's possible to "embed" an instance of Terminal into an app? It would be awesome if it also just inherited the tab functionality and drag-drop-ness as well. I saw a couple similar questions on here that mentioned iTerm but it seems like there should be an easier way. Like a NSTerminal object I can pop into a view. I asked the Panic guys about this. They have a terminal window in Coda that for all intents and purposes looks/functions exactly like Terminal.app running standalone on the desktop. However, their response was that they had to write that themselves from scratch. I'm hoping someone has figured out a better way! Thanks!
