How do you make an NN for image classification invariant to translation **and** rotation?

CNN are (I think) invariant to small translations of the input image, i.e., they will classify to the same class an image $X$ and an image $X'$ such that all pixels have been translated along a vector $\mathbf{v}$ by some "small" distance $d$. They're not, however, invariant to rotation. I.e., if $X'$ is obtained by $X$ applying a rotation of arbitrary degree $\theta$ around an axis $z$ orthogonal to the plane of the image, they won't necessarily classify it to the same class as $X$. Practitioners usually solve this by data augmentation, but this is unnecessarily wasteful and anyway not an option in my case. Is there a way to make the NN architecture invariant to both isometries? I don't have to use a CNN, but since CNN already enjoy some sort of translation invariance, I figured it would be easier to modify them to get rotational invariance , than to use a completely different architecture.
