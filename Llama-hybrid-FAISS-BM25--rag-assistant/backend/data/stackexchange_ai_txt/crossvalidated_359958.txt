Python np.lognormal gives infinite results for big average and St Dev

I am trying to draw the lognormal distribution for my data. using the following code : mu, sigma = 136519., 50405. # mean and standard deviation hs = np.random.lognormal(mu, sigma, 1000) #mean, s dev , Size count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(hs, 100, normed=True) x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000) pdf = (math.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))) plt.plot(x, pdf, linewidth=2, color='r') plt.axis('tight') As you can see, my maean and sigma are big values, it creates the problem that hs goes to infinity that gives error . while if I put something like mu =3 and sigma =1, it works, any suggestions for big numbers?
