Probably not. And you may need to clarify what performance you mean...possibilities include: Server side performance (perhaps databinding) Actual bandwidth (amount of html and extra scripts/styles/images etc) required Client side performance (events and what not) post backs? ajax? It would be quite hard to do performance comparisons because it depends a lot on what features you require of the controls. Some of the Infragistics web controls now give you the option of only loading the javascript for features that you will use as well which would complicate things...I suppose also, a lot of the third party controls exist because there isn't an asp.net default equivalent. You really perhaps need to try the controls, or set a target level of performance and measure whether it meets this...the asp.net may well perform faster but both meet your performance requirements...or expectedly don't meet your performance requirements but provide you more features...
