This hybrid demo can not only be run as either an applet or application, but be launched direct from the command line using the source in the applet viewer. E.G. prompt> javac HybridApplet.java prompt> java HybridApplication // Note the 'Application' prompt> appletviewer HybridApplet.java // Note the '.java' Exiting the applet in the browser should redirect to the source. It will have no effect in the applet viewer. Applet viewer does not support showDocument(), unlike Appleteer , which does ;). Edit: Note though, that many things designed as applets leverage methods & classes useful to applets - getClip(), getDocumentBase().. These are for convenience and mostly have equivalents in other non-applet classes.
