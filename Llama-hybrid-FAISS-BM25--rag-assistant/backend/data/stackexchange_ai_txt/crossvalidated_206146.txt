How to report standard deviation while averaging a dataset multiple times?

This question appears simple but it may not be. I have a year long, 1 degree, daily, 3-d global climate data set (temperature) representing different latitude, longitude, and days. That means the data set has a size of 180*360*365. First, I calculated the longitudinally-averaged mean by averaging the data along the second dimension. That means I now have a data of size 180*365. I then again averaged the data along the latitude which gave me a globally averaged time-series data having 365 data. So my question is, how do I report the standard deviation of this final global mean that I calculated? Or better posed, how do I characterize the uncertainty of this global mean data that I calculated? At each step of averaging along longitude and latitude, I obviously have corresponding standard deviations. I am not expecting an ambiguous answer with all the mathematical details but a clear answer with insights into the problem.
