Multilevel models provide us with a few benefits when compared to logistic regression. Here are a few I can think of without being too pedantic: Shrinkage Suppose you are estimating the mean/proportion of a response variable per group. Sometimes a group can have a mean too high just because that group has fewer samples on it (just think of thumbs-up reviews on a product that is not very popular on an e-commerce website). You know you can't trust the review number on those instances, so instead of removing them from the analysis, you "shrink" the estimates towards the gran mean/proportion in an "if I don't trust your estimate because of your sample size I consider you close to the gran estimate" rationale. This shrinking effect will happen for all of the parameters you estimate, ie: per group intercepts and slopes. Variance components Whenever we try to fit models to test a statistical hypothesis, the goal is to have as little variance around the estimates of parameters of interest so we can test them, have p-values, etc. Adding covariates, for example, if they help explain part of the variability of the response variable together with the parameters of interest will usually aid in reducing the variability around the estimates of the parameters of interest. In multilevel models, we get "extra" variance parameters, each for the groups of random slopes/effects and intercepts, since those have distributions tied to them as well. This helps us distribute explainable variance of the response variable toward those new components in a way that allows for that type of justification of "grouped observations are usually similar" meaning they have their own variance component. Usually less prediction error Now, this is due to the shrinkage and variance components we have in those models. Usually, since we make the parameters closer to the grand mean, we have less quadratic error overall. The read more about this type of relationship between shrinkage and prediction error, search for Stein's Paradox. Allow for finding interesting between patterns in groups Now again due to the shrinkage and individual groups parameters, we can have some discussions like: "even though variable X effect is overall tied to such and such changes in the response variable, we can see that in group A the effect is zero (or even opposite) to the overall trend". Some further reading I think you will be interested in reading a bit more about those modeling techniques. And from your question, I think you will be able to follow those texts with no trouble at all. Gelman et al's text has some really nice examples of the type of conclusions you can get from the multilevel models and does a superb job of explaining the math around those. Singer et al's text has some nice intro chapters explaining the why's and how to perform exploratory/descriptive analysis around those Multilevel models.
