@andrew : I've tried Phing and ended up with phpUnderControl. The problem with Phing is that to manage code coverage, it has to actually include all the files in you project, which for our project just does not do it. The approach of CruiseControl worked better for us. Give them a try, they are both easy to setup - the hard work is to build the tests....
