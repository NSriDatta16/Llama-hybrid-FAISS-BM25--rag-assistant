Reconciling regression to the mean with the independence of with-replacement sampling

Say we monitor a ski jumper's consecutive jumps (distance jumped), and we assume it is a combination (sum) of the skier's skills, + luck (modelled by a random variable). We also assume that the distance jumped at trial $_N$ is independent of that jumped at trial $_{N-1}$ . By some accounts (e.g., Daniel Kahneman, in his book Thinking Fast and Slow, p.178), after a very good first jump (i.e. above the skier's base-rate average, assuming luck=neutral), the regression to the mean principle gives us reason to believe the second is going to be worse (below average), simply because on average we have to get closer to the mean. But this seems to contradict the principle whereby consecutive samples (with replacement) are independent, i.e. same base-rate probability for each sampling. For instance, if we roll a die and it lands on 5, there is (I think) no reason to believe that the second roll should be below average (i.e. 1, 2 or 3) just because the first roll was above-average. Is this in fact underlied/formalised by a broader statistical principle that I am missing here?
