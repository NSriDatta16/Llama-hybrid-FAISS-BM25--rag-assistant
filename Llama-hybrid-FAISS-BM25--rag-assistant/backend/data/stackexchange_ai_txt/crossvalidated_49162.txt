Which SVM kernel to use for a binary classification problem?

I'm a beginner when it comes to support vector machines. Are there some guidelines that say which kernel (e.g. linear, polynomial) is best suited for a specific problem? In my case, I have to classify webpages according to whether they contain some specific information or not, i.e. I have a binary classification problem. Can you say in general which kernel is best suited for this task? Or do I have to try several of them on my specific dataset to find the best one? By the way, I'm using the Python library scikit-learn that makes use of the libSVM library.
