I agree with Anurag. If you have a button elsewhere on your client that is hosting MyControl you may be able to attach the button event to your control by changing Click="Hello_Click" to Button.Click="Hello_Click". But you would need to have a button further down the logical hierachy so its event could bubble up to your control. The error suggests that MyControl does not subclass Button.
