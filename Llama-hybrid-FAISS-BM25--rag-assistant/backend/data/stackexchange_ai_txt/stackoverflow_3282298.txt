The way I do it is a bit more pragmatic. Get algorithm - Either you already know an algorithm or you find one online or you create it yourself. Emulate the algorithm in your mind Increase the size of your set (n) by a gazillion Emulate it in your mind again, would the time increase by a gazillion? then it's O(n), did it increase by gazillion * log gazillion, then it's O(n log n) The only other way I know of, is if you actually find the theoretical complexity of your problem and perform an asymptotic analysis.
