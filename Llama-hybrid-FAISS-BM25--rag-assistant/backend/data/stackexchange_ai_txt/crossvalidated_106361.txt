I am not sure what you mean by "a valid data set". Are you sure what you mean by it? There are reasons why, in a single or in multiple time series consecutive missingness would be irrelevant to the validity of an analysis, and reasons why it would be lethal to valid inference. However, Honaker and King are at the head of practical multiple imputation within a time-series context: Honaker, J. and King, G. (2010). What to do about missing values in time-series cross-section data . American Journal of Political Science , 54(2):561â€“581. (See also, the related R package Amelia II on CRAN ) It is not clear how familiar you are with multiple imputation, but it has two aims (1) to support inference that is unbiased by MAR and MCAR (i.e. to impute a set of reasonable values), and (2) in doing so to incorporate the additional uncertainty in one's analysis that is due to the presence of missing data (i.e. to incorporate the extra variation resulting from imputed values not all agreeing with one another).
