@MGriesbach:Actually PDT(Eclipse) does have this function (under Source->Format) @Sergei: Eclipse doesn't have this problem, but this sounds like something is wrong with your config. Are you sure you looked through all the options? You may also send an email to the Zend team, this sounds like a pretty trivial bug on heir side, as it encourages developers to write code not indented correctly. -- edit-- My bad, Eclipse PDT does have this problem but i just got used to it:) The problem dissapears if i press tab, so it will indent the first line. The other lines will follow correctly.
