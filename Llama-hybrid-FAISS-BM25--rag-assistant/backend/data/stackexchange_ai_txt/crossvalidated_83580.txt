Off the cuff, I presume one could proceed as in logistic regression: a generalisation to $K>2$ categories and base category $K$ would be to set the $i$-th correction term to be $$\log \frac{(r_i p_K)}{(r_K p_i)}$$ corresponding to the $i$ vs $K$ contrast. For $K=2$, $p_1$ is as before and $p_K = p_2 = 1-p_1$, so it reduces to $$\log \frac{r_1 (1-p_1)}{(1-r_1) p_1}.$$ However, I'd be happy to be corrected on this one.
