I just had a similar issue with a dataset which contains only 115 elements and only one single feature (international airline data). The solution was to scale the data. What I missed in answers so far was the usage of a Pipeline: from sklearn.svm import SVR from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler model = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('svr', SVR(kernel='linear'))]) You can train model like a usual classification / regression model and evaluate it the same way. Nothing changes, only the definition of the model.
