If you initially get the string from the date() function, then pass on formatting arguments to the date-function instead: date('Y-m-d') instead of converting the string once again. EDIT: If you need to keep track of the actual timestamp, then store it as a timestamp: // Store the timestamp in a variable. This is just an integer, unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) $time = time(); // output ISO8601 (maybe insert to database? whatever) echo date('Y-m-d H:i', $time); // output your readable format echo date('j-M-Y', $time); Using strtotime() is convinient but unessecary parsing and storage of a timerepresentation is a stupid idea.
