How would one use Cocos2d to create a game like this

http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D6 So I am getting started with this all game dev thing on iphone and I decided that I will start playing with Cocos2d as my starting engine. Now just so i have a goal in mind, I picked angry birds as my initial target of what sort of game play would I like to learn to build. This is not going to be a market release game. This is totally going to be learning purposes only. So to start off my question is: Would something like this be achievable using Cocos2d? How would I go about building the physics for this? How can one do a screen scroll like the way they do in cocos2d? (any example code would be great) This is just to start off. If you have any particular questions please do add to this question. Few more things that I am wondering about: animated sprites. How does one create that? Is that a Cocos2d feature or i can use UIImageView? drag and drop support. How do they detect that I am dragging the bird? More of a graphics question: how do they animate the "band stretch" effect? cheers Progress So i have been able to setup a world in Cocos2d along with box2d and now i have a few blocks that collide and simulate physics. Now I am having issues that I think can be resolved by further hints/help/tutorials. How do I make a sprite move in an arc? Like when u throw the bird it moves along a curve. How can I calculate that? where does that logic go? (built-in or needs to be coded?) How do I create a world (maps) where certain blocks are static and certain are breakable? Should I look into SVG support in cocos2d? How do I simulate collision like they do in angrybirds? cheers.
