You could take a look at the any mapping. With the 'any' mapping, you can define a polymorphic association. Check this (paragraph 5.2.4) Anyway , I 'm not familiar with your 'domain', but I think Jim has a point as well. Perhaps you should review your datamodel and domainmodel (if possible), and see if some kind of inheritance isn't appropriate here.
