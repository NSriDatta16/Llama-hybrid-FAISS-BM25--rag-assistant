I'm not familiar with the way the sample code works, but crashing without an error might be a memory issue. Are you trying to load very large files, or do you have a memory leak? Try looking in the device logs in the Organizer (Window -> Organizer in Xcode), and try running your app with the Allocations and Leaks tools in Instruments.
