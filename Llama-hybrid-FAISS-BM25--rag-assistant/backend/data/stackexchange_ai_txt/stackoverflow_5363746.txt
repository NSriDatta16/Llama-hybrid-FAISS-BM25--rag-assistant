You can do this by declaring server-side cursors, with the DECLARE command: DECLARE my_cursor CURSOR FOR select * from foo; And then read its results using the FETCH command repeatedly: FETCH 10 FROM my_cursor; By sleeping between the FETCH command, you're effectively limiting how fast the query can execute. After you're done with it, you can get rid of the cursor by calling COMMIT , ROLLBACK , or CLOSE my_cursor Do note that some kinds of queries cannot be directly streamed via a cursor, but will be ran to completion before they produce the first row of output. Queries with hash aggregates and large non-indexed sorts are an example. You can lower the cursor_tuple_fraction setting (default 0.1) to discourage the planner to choose these sorts of plans, but it's not always possible.
