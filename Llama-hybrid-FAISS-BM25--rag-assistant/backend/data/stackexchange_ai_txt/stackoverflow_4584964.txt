See this gist: https://gist.github.com/652819 Its pretty much an entire NodeJS app using the Express framework, Redis for session storage, Couchdb as the database and written in CoffeeScript. However, you are asking for code organization. That depends from developer to developer. I personally prefer Express. However if you prefer MVC style then see Geddy.
