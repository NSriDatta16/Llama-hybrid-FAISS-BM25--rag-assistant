Maybe the most prominent of Java NoSQL solutions is Cassandra . It has some features beyond Voldemort (Order-Preserving Partitioner which allows range queries; BigTable style structure for values); and is missing others (no alternate storage backends or version clocks for versioning). Its performance is more optimal for fast writes, but its biggest strength is probably ease at which it can be horizontally scaled by adding new nodes (something where V is bit more static). Compared to, say, MongoDB, its data model is quite simple and often there's no point in using much more than key/value abstraction (that is, handle data mapping on client side, store serialized objects). It has full replication and distribution, unlike some k/v stores (couchdb, from what I understand).
