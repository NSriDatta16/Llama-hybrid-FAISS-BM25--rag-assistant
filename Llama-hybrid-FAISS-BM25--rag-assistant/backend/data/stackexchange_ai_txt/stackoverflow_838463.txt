You want to use a structure like a Quad tree, or an RTree. These are multidimensional index structures. The key is using a good "space filling curve", which is what helps define the nearness of points. A simple space filling curve is a Zorder, but you would be more interested in something like a hilbert curve. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_filling_curve I don't know of any prepackaged implementations of this stuff. I recently implemented my own RTree in 2 dimensions that only supports bulk loading and searches (via a provided bounding box). One drawback here is that your points have to be contained in a finite region. There know there are space filling curves that work for spaces that are not finite, but I do not know anything about them.
