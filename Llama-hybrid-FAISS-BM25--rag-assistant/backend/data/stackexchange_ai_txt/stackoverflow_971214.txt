with the full set of JavaEE plugins in Eclipse, it's trivial to control/deploy to glassfish. Grab the JavaEE version of Eclipse and follow the wizard for creating a new enterprise application. Generally speaking, unless you're debugging the only intergration you really need is: start, stop, deploy. You can make almost any IDE/script/buildfile do that. Stick with the IDE you're most productive in.
