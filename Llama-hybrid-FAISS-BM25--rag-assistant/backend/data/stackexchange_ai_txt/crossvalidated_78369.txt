I think I'm a year too late to this party... (and I feel like this question might belong in stackoverflow, instead) The issue seems to be that the jags() function treats n.burnin as the number of adaptation steps. Not all models require adaptation, which is why Baoyue has seen two progress bars for some models, but not for the example here. I'm not sure if jags() has options for true burn-in (i.e. discard the initial portion of the MCMC run), so you might have to pad n.iter and manually discard. Alternatively, use rjags (written by the author of JAGS) instead.
