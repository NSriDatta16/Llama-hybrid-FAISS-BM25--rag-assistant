Ways to workaround whole page caching in ASP.NET MVC

Currently ASP.NET MVC's OutputCache attribute has a huge downfall. If you want to cache parts of your site you have to use a workaround due to the limitation of ASP.NET's pipeline that MVC relies on. Say you have a page that has a statistics module that you surface through RenderAction you can't cache just that part of the page out of the box. My question is, what ways have you found to get around this limitation that are elegant and easy to use? I've personally found 2 of them neither I'm particularly happy with. Though they work they seem to just feel wrong when building an app around them. Solution 1 - Sub Controllers http://mhinze.com/subcontrollers-in-aspnet-mvc/ Solution 2 - Partial requests http://blog.codeville.net/2008/10/14/partial-requests-in-aspnet-mvc/ So if you have another solution or maybe even a way you've used one of these solutions elegantly I'd love some ideas on design and/or usage.
