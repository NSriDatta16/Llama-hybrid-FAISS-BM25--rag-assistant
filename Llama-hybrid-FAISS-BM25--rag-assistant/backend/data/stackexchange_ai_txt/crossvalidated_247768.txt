The answer to this question is that this will work fine as long as your model order is correctly specified, as then the errors from your model will be independent. This paper here shows that if a model has poor cross-validation will underestimate how poor it actually is. In all other cases the cross-validation will do a good job, in particular, a better job than the out-of-sample evaluation usually used in the time series context.
