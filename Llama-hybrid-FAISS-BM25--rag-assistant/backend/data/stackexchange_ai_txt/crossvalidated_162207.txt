Dealing with zero-inflation if the data are not count data type

In the literature I found that for the count data with a lot of zeros so-called zero-inflated distributions (models) and so-called hurdle-at-zero distributions (models) could be used. The differences between those two are well described on stackexchange What is the difference between zero-inflated and hurdle distributions (models)? But what kind of models could be used if the data are not count data type (positive integer) but still zero inflated? Like for example exploring the coverage (%) of lichens on pre-defined part of tree trunk.
