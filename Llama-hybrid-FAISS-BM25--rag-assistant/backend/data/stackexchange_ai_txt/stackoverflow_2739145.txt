Hmm.. as Ragoczy points out, its better to use FileSystemWatcher to monitor the files. However, since you have additional operations, you may think in terms of multithreading. But beware, no matter how many processers you have, there is a limit to it's capacity. You may not want to create as many threads as the number of concurrent users, for the simple reason that your number of agents can increase.
