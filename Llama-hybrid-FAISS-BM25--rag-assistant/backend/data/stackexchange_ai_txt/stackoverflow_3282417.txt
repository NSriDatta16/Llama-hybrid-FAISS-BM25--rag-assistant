What are canonical examples of parallel computation?

I am writing a paper to test a new application that will demonstrate the benefits of parallelized computation (compared to the traditional serialized version of this application). I want to use the canonical examples for parallel computation in my paper. My first example is the parallel computation of pi . I would ideally like an example where each iteration is very time consuming (because of the additional overhead associated with parallelizing); my first thought is a Bayesian simulation with MCMC and Gibbs sampling. What other problems are typically discussed in this context? What are good examples of large embarassingly parallel problems?
