Best way to diagnose this is to post the compiler invocation line, not just the error (you can just drag and drop the line from the Build Results window that says "Compiling foo.m"). My expectation is that you don't have a Frameworks Search Path set up for the location of the framework. Xcode usually adds that manually when you add the framework, but if you put it in certain kinds of places, or added it in certain ways, you need to manually point your target's Framework Search Paths at its directory.
