Although I have never used it, the quantregForest package seems to do what you want. Here is the description: Quantile Regression Forests is a tree-based ensemble method for estimation of conditional quantiles. It is particularly well suited for high-dimensional data. Predictor variables of mixed classes can be handled. The package is dependent on the package randomForests, written by Andy Liaw. There is also an article accompanying the quantregForest package: Meinshausen N (2006). “Quantile Regression Forests.” Journal of Machine Learning Research , 7, 983–999.
