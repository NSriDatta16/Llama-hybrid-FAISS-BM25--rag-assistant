If you want to classify members into two gangs, you should use a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. A regression algorithm is used to predict values for members, while a classification algorithm is used to predict class membership (i.e. which gang would a person who commits these crimes likely belong to?). Which classification algorithm should you use? Two models immediately come to mind: Logistic regression (yes, called "regression" but it's a classification algorithm) and Support Vector Machines. Both models will give you probabilities for a person who has committed certain crimes belonging to either gang. Both models will give you weights for the features. The Support Vector Machine will create a decision boundary (hyperplane, like the line you drew separating the classes in the picture) based on the data points, with a few points (support vectors) that influence the position and direction of the hyperplane. You can use these to get an equation for the hyperplane. Logistic regression will give you an equation as well, one that is easily interpretable for the effects each feature has on predicting the gang. How do you decide which to use? Run both and see if their results make sense and give you the appropriate information.
