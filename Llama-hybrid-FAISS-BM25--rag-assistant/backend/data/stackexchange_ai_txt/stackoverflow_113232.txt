I have developed a system for a client which kept track of hits against the web server and dynamically banned IP addresses at the operating system/firewall level for variable periods of time for certain offenses, so, yes, this is definitely possible. As Owen said, firewall rules are a much better place to do this sort of thing than in the web server. (Unfortunately, the client chose to hold a tight copyright on this code, so I am not at liberty to share it.) I generally work in Perl rather than PHP, but, so long as you have a command-line interface to your firewall rules engine (like, say, /sbin/iptables), you should be able to do this fairly easily from any language which has the ability to execute system commands.
