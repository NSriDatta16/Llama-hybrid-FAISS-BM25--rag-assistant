In your code, when inserting relationships into table, follow a convention. issueSQLQuery("INSERT INTO relationships (friend1, friend2) VALUES (?, ?)", min(friend_1_ID, friend_2_ID), max(friend_1_ID, friend_2_ID)) Do similarly for retrievals, as well. Of course, this could be done in a stored procedure.
