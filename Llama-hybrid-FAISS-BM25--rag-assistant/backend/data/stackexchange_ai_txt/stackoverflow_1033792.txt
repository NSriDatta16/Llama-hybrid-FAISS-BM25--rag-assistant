I did it the way you described. I already had a oledb connection manager defined so I used an OLE DB Source and used the SQL Command data access mode. I used a simple query: select getdate() as dt ...just to get it out of the way. Now I know the date of my variable pull. Then I used a Derived Column Transform to make my package variables available and wrote it out to a flat file. Elegant? No, but it gets the job done.
