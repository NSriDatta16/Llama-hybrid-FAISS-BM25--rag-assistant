LDA for feature extraction with more than one feature

I know that LDA (linear discriminant analysis) is a way for feature extraction, but the dimension of LDA is one less than number of classes in problem (in two classes, the dimension of the result space is 1), so the number of features by LDA is always 1 (in 2 classes case). Is there anyway to extract more than 1 feature with LDA? (When we use PCA we can select n top eigen-vectors for more than 1 feature, but I couldn't find similar way for LDA)
