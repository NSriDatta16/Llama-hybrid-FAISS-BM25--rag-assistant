Processing just HTML fragment and returning it

When I do the following with Nokogiri: some_html = ' test ' f = Nokogiri::HTML(some_html) #do some processing puts f It will print the whole XHTML doc structure with the upper code in it. How can I just print/return/get the html part which is in some_html variable? No. f will return: " \n \n test \n \n" I only want the inner/fragment part: test
