I would argue that being able to test private methods is a 'con', as it can encourage accretion of new code within an existing class. If the private logic is so complex that it needs dedicated tests (beyond what's publicly accessible), then there's a lot of value in pulling out that logic as a separate class with a publicly testable interface. For borderline cases, I cautiously agree with Jon's approach of using internal methods (just be careful how much the internals expose.) That said, I've occasionally made a class unsealed specifically so that I could write tests that used virtual method calls for sensing of effects, which is loosely related to the partial class approach. This always feels a bit dirty to me and I sometimes wished there were a way to mark a class as "internal unsealed".
