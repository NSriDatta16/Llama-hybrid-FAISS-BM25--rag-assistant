What's the most efficient way to get the horizontal average in a MySQL query?

I have the following MySQL-table Id | One | Two | Three ---------------------------- 1 | 10 | 30 | 20 2 | 50 | 60 | 20 3 | 60 | NULL | 40 Edit: Of course the table doesn't need to be NULL by default, but I don't want it to affect the average (so the average is calculated as 50 and not 33,33). I want that to look like this, with a MySQL query: Id | Average ------------ 1 | 20 2 | 43,33 3 | 50 What is the most efficient way to achieve this?
