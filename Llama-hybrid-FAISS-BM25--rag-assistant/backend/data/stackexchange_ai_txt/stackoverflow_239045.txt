How do we modify HQL transformer while loading a specific parent or another mapped entity property?

This is an important addition especially to solve performance issues while being able to write efficient dynamic HQL queries. But, how do we modify the HQL transformer in case of loading a specific parent or another mapped entity property? The following code: session.createQuery( "select st.stNumber as stNumber, st.stDate as stDate " + " from SomeTable st " + " where st.someTableId works fine, but what if I want to load some of its parents' properties only? For example, let's say, SomeTable has a parent called SomedParent and I want to access one of the fields of this parent only? session.createQuery( "select st.stNumber as stNumber, st.stDate as stDate, st.someParent.someParentField as someParentField " + " from SomeTable st " + " where st.someTableId So any ideas?
