Yes I agree that do while loops can be rewritten to a while loop, however I disagree that always using a while loop is better. do while always get run at least once and that is a very useful property (most typical example being input checking (from keyboard)) #include int main() { char c; do { printf("enter a number"); scanf("%c", &c); } while (c '9'); } This can of course be rewritten to a while loop, but this is usually viewed as a much more elegant solution.
