Start with time and sex . Ignoring the other variables for now, your line of best fit is precuneus.dvr = 1.148 + 0.00222 * time + 0.03073 * sex + 0.00417 * time * sex + ... The more time between visits, the higher the predicted value of precuneus.dvr , but the line for female participants ( sex = 0 ) is 1.148 + 0.00222 * time whereas for male participants ( sex = 1 ) it is (1.148 + 0.03073) + (0.00222 + 0.00417) * time i.e. the two lines have different intercepts and different slopes. Males start from a higher level and the line is steeper (bigger effect as time increases). You can interpret the interaction of race_binary and time in a similar way. The variables Cage and NFLz are not binary, so we interpret their interaction with time a little differently, but the idea is the same. For example, the older the participant, the steeper the slope of time . Centering the variable the way you did (so that Cage = 0 corresponds to average) is a sensible idea, as we can then interpret the value of 2.224e-02 as the slope of time for a participant of average age.
