I agree with Nicolas in regards to separating the algorithmic questions from the actual language questions. One thing that you might want to consider is giving them a couple simple algorithm questions that they can write up the pseudo code for on the white board (ex. "Explain to me the Bubble sort and show me the pseudo code for it." Then once they have demonstrated their algorithmic knowledge you can move on to the Java questions. Since some people work better in front of a computer than in front of the whiteboard, I would give them something simple, but leveraging their knowledge of Java, that they can implement in 30 minutes or so in using the same IDE that you are using at the company. This way if they claim to know the IDE you can also get an idea of how well they know it.
