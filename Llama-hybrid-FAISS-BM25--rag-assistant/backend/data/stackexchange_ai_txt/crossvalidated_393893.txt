Anova of a mixed effect model (lmr) shows no significant interaction while tukey (emmeans) does?

I have run a linear mixed-effects model using lmer package. I'm using year sampled (1990s or 2017), field(1967 or 1984), and treatment (open or closed) to determine differences in native herbaceous percent cover. I am using this model since I have two data points (year.sampled: 90s and 2017). Model code: model2 Year.Sampled Field+(1|HerbPC$Plot),data = HerbPC) I have set my plot names as my random effect. The model runs successfully and a run an anova on the model. anova(model2) and I receive As you can see the interaction between the variables treatment and year sampled (Treatment:Year.Sampled) is not significant at 0.566. When I run a post hoc tukey on this interaction using emmeans(object=model2, pairwise~Treatment*Year.Sampled, adjust="tukey") I receive As you can see this emmeans tukey is showing 4 different significant pairwise interactions. I am wondering why my anova of the model shows no significance of treatment and year sampled while my tukey shows multiple significant pairwise interactions of these variables? I see that the emmeans tukey results are averaged over the levels "Fields" variable. Is the difference because the anova of treatment:year.sampled interactions is independent of fields, while the emmeans tukey is not? Thanks for the help.
