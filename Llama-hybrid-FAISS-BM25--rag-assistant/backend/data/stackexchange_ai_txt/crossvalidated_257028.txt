A nice reference is Dimensionality Reduction A Short Tutorial by Ali Ghodsi. It covers PCA, Locally Linear Embedding, Multidimensional Scaling and Isomap. Dan Ventura provides us with some nice worked examples of Manifold Learning - specifically, PCA, LLE and ISOMAP Kilian Weinberger has a nice web page devoted to Manifold Learning There is a high-level overview of Feature Engineering at Machine Learning Mastery that also has some references. Lawrence Cayton has an overview paper on Algorithms for Manifold Learning Even though it is mostly about supervised feature extraction, I hate to omit mention of the work of Isabelle Guyon. She has a nice paper An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection slides from a KDD Tutorial and her book on Feature Extraction . All links checked as of 18 Jan 2017
