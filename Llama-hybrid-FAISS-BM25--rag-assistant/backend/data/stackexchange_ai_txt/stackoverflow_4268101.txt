Magento Configure Products + Simple Products

Current Magento setup : Configure Products + Simple Products Problem : Configurable product from 2000 simple products is causing an issue as Magento stops responding if i make configurable products from more than 500 simple products Error Message: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 2186999 bytes) in /homepages/3/d347795961/htdocs/magento/lib/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php on line 228 product name = test Type= configurable Associated products = 696 simple products Error Message: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 311296 bytes) in /homepages/3/d347795961/htdocs/magento/app/design/frontend/default/flp/template/catalog/product/price.phtml on line 290 Operating System: 1&1 Dual Core – L Dedicated Server CPU: Opteron1216 Clock Rate: 2 x 2.4 GHz Ram: 2GB (RAID 1 Software) Memory: 40m Comments : I have been told by my developer that if i obtain a server with 312m memory or more – he recommended a company called www.bluehost.com – this should solve the problem? I have 3 products with numerous size variants in each – adding up to 2000 possibilities between the 3 different products. I also have 2 more products with approx 1500 size variants or possible combinations, which we have not even attempted to load yet due to the aforementioned. My developer is now offering “Simple products with custom option” as a solution http://s347795977.websitehome.co.uk/magento/index.php/test-product-4158.html - this will however doing it this way will apparently not allow me to check stock – which will have direct bearing of trying to integrate Magento into the Sage Accounting package.......I am also not sure of what other problems or restrictions it will raise i.e changing pricing easily Questions : - Is it possible to have numerous variations (size combinations) on a specific product using Configure Products + Simple Products Setup - This being the case, if i swop to another server package offering 312m or more – will this solve the problem – and more importantly allow me to lead the additional 1500 products on over and above the 2000 i am currently having a problem with. Any advice or assistance regarding this matter would greatly be appreciated.
