Use an intent from another Android application or use code?

I am writing an Android application that uses some functionality that has been published under the Apache 2.0 license. The functionality is available in 2 ways: As java code As an intent in an Android application. Being the typical developer that I am, I don't want to make the user install a separate application so that they can use my own application - because it would definitely put me off using the application if I had to. On the other hand, doing the work to get the application up and running using the Java code will take much longer. My questions are thus: What are most developers doing now? Are they using intents from other apps? Does it matter to the average consumer that they need to download a separate application to make it work?
