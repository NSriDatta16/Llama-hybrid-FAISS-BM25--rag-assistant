It's difficult to imagine how it could be made more elegant: using a hypothetical built-in function ... swap_sequence_elements(arr, first, second) elegant? maybe, but this is in YAGGI territory -- you aren't going to get it ;-) -- and the function call overhead would/should put you off implementing it yourself. What you have is much more elegant than the alternative in-line way: temp = arr[first] arr[first] = arr[second] arr[second] = temp and (bonus!) is faster too (on the not unreasonable assumption that a bytecode ROT_TWO is faster than a LOAD_FAST plus a STORE_FAST ).
