I believe there is no such implementation, but decision trees are so simple to implement that you shouldn't have any problems with writing such program on your own. On the other hand I don't think the idea of counting features on the fly can increase speed, because even if some feature was used to make some previous split, it still must be considered on the rest of them, so for many records it would be recalculated many times (it may save memory though). This could make sense in case of random forest, where only a random, limited subset of features is considered on each split -- still RF is usable only as a classifier, it won't build you nice, human-interpretable decision trees.
