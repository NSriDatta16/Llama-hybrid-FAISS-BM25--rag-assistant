Reduce Subjectivity by Developing a Measuring Tool for yourself. My Criteria are for Business Software: Feature Rich - handle lots of Business Rules Flexible - Selectable Features via Parameters & Configuration Stable - Few, if any bugs causing malfunction such as crashes Well Documented - User and technical Documentation User Friendly - as attested and recommended by users Robust - Not very much fazed by events such as power failures and erroneous user input. Installs & Runs "out of the box". Take all the Criteria and place it in a spreadsheet with columns rating from 0 - 5 and do a rating by ticking the column corresponding to your rating of each criteria. If overall score is 25 or better then the software is mature. If the score is 15 to 24 then the software is average. If below 15 then the software is immature.
