Difference between homoscedastic and homogenic-variance data

I have a doubt regarding two tests: Breuschâ€“Pagan test , to detect heteroscedasticity in a series, and Bartlett's test , to test for equal variances for samples from $k$ populations. What are the difference betwen those two tests? Are not those tests highly related? How could a homoscedastic data give no homogeneity in the variance?
