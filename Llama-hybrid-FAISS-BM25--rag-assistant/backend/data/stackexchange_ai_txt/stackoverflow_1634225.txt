There are three main ways to call a static function: $object->static_method() Classname->static_method() Classname::static_method() You could define your function like this: # callable as $object->static_method() or Classname->static_method() sub static_method { my $class = shift; # ignore; not needed # ... } or like this, which works in all three calling scenarios, and doesn't incur any overhead on the caller's side like Robert P's solution does: use UNIVERSAL qw(isa); sub static_method { my $class = shift if $_[0] and isa($_[0], __PACKAGE__); # ... }
