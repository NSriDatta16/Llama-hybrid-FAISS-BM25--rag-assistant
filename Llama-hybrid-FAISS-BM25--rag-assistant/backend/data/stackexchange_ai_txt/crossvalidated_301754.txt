How to calculate transformed data coordinates with probabilistic PCA?

PPCA models data with $$X = W Y + \mu + \epsilon$$ where $X$ is data matrix of $n \times p$ size, $Y$ is "hidden" or transformed data coordinates while $W$ and $\mu$ are parameters of the model. As far as I understand, $\epsilon$ is normally distributed noise. So, to transform $X$ to $Y$ I do $$X - \mu - \epsilon = WY$$ $$W^{-1} (X - \mu - \epsilon) = Y$$ which for centered data and ignoring noise gives $$W^{-1} X = Y$$ On the other hand, in conventional PCA we have $X = USV^T$ where $V$ is matrix from principal directions, hence $Y = XV$ this implies, that $W^{-1}X = XV$ Is this correct relation? Can I really compute transformation into hidden space by both products?
