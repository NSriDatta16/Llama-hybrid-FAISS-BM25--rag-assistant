To get an idea, set a breakpoint on some interesting code, and then go to the CPU window. If you are interested in more, it is easier to compile short fragments with Free Pascal using the -al parameter. FPC allows to output the generated assembler in a multitude of assembler formats (TASM,MASM,GAS ) using the -A parameter, and you can have the original pascal code interleaved in comments (and more) for easy crossreference. Because it is compiler generated assembler, as opposed to assembler from disassembled .exe, it is more symbolic and easier to follow.
