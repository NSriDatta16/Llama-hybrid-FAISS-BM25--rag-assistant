WPF: Dragging an Element via Touch is pretty choppy

I have a Rectangle which can be dragged within some boundaries. This works perfect with the mouse. As soon as I set IsManipulationEnabled to true the mouse-events don't work anymore. However I need this to get touch-events on the rectangle. Therefore I set it to true. I'm trying to compute all changes in the ManipulationDelta-event like in the following function. Scaling works already pretty good, but moving the object via dragging it with the finger is very choppy + plus sometimes the Rectangle jumps back and forth. private void UserControl_ManipulationDelta(object sender, ManipulationDeltaEventArgs e) { //Scaling works already pretty good RangeBar.Width *= e.DeltaManipulation.Scale.X; //Moving the element is very choppy, what am I doing wrong here? this.startX = this.startX + e.DeltaManipulation.Translation.X; RangeBar.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, startX); }
