Is this the right approach for structuring codebase?

We have a Java codebase that is currently one Web-based Netbeans project. As our organization and codebase grows it seems obvious that we should partition the various independent pieces of our system into individual jars. So one Jar library for the data access layer, one for a general lib, one for a specialized knowledge access, etc. Then we'd have a separate project for the web application, and could have one for a command line tools app, another web app eventually, etc. What is the recommended practice for doing and managing this? Is it Maven? Can it all be effectively done with just Netbeans alone by simply creating individual projects and setting the dependecies of one project on the jar files of the others?
