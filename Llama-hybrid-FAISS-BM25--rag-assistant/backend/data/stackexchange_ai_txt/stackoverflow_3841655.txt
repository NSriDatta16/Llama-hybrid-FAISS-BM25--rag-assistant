VS2010: Problem with a test's Setup Script in VS2010 Test Settings

In the VS2010 Test Settings file, I've specified a .bat file that invokes a powershell script. Running the .bat file from a command prompt works just fine and the .bat returns in less than 5 secs. However, if I try to run a test, the run eventually reports a 'not executed' result and reports an error "The setup batch file on agent machine [machinename] exceeded the execution timeout period" (which is 100s by default). I am running the test locally (no seperate controller) using VS2010 Ultimate. Has anyone run into this?
