What is the difference between split() and explode()?

The PHP manual for split() says This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged...Use explode() instead. But I can't find a difference between split() and explode() . join() hasn't been deprecated, so what gives?
