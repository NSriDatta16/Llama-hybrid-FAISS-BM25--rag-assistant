As all reasonable mail agent, gnus won't destroy (or expire) mail unless you ask it to do it. It will hide them, so when entering a group (mailbox/folder) it will only show you mail that are unread or ticked. But if you enter a group with C-u RET , or if you use C-u M-g in the summary buffer, all hidden message will be shown. If you really want to have all article all the time, you could use (defun rv-gnus-topic-select-group () (gnus-topic-select-group t)) (eval-after-load 'gnus-topic (gnus-define-keys gnus-topic-mode-map "\r" rv-gnus-topic-select-group)) But you'd better do as gnus does, and tick message you use often, and use the prefix arg when you want more. (this is untested code, but it could work)
