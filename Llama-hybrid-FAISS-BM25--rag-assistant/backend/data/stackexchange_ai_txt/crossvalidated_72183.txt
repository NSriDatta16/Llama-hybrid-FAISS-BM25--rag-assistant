Why not just use the sample average: $\bar{X} = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. In your first example their average would be $7/5 = 1.4$. For 5 'factors' this average ranges from $-2$ to $2$. This average does not distinguish the factors in any way (perhaps 'speed' should contribute more to 'power' than 'body build'?) In that case you can use a weighted average and weight your 'factors' according to your beliefs on how much they contribute to 'power'. The weights just have to sum to 1.
