How do you find out release, mailing list statistics information on open source projects

We are interested in finding out some statistics of various frameworks Mailing list activity on say richfaces . Much similar to what is available on http://code.google.com (Low, Medium, High) + average number of emails per day | per month. Number of releases made in a year including patch, minor, major releases. We did look at the maven repositories but that wasn't very useful either. We did look at ohloh , but didn't get the desired information. Any other ideas on where to get this information (any maven-2 plugins)?
