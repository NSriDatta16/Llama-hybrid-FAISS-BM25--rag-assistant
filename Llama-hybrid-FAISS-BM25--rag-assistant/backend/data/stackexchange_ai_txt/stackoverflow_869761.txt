WPF: Implementing a MediaPlayer Audio / Video Seeker

I am currently working on an MP3 player (in a WPF application) with a WPF MediaPlayer and basically, I want to implement a Song Seeker which moves along with the current playing song. I already implemented a song slider (from Sacha Barber's application ) and it works when the user drags the seeker manually (as in, the song continues from that position) but I cannot figure out how to make the seeker move according to the current position in the song. Trouble is I don't think there is a way to check when the Position property of the MediaPlayer has changed, so I'm stumped as to how I should implement this feature. Any ideas on how to go about such an issue? [Update] As regards incrementing the seeker with a timer, I actually thought of using the reason I didn't try it yet is because I think there is a better way to implement this using the MediaTimeline ...but I'm yet to figure out how.
