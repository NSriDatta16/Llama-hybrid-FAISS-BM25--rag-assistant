writing a simple linear (and logistic) regression equation that incorporates survey weights

I am running a basic linear (and then logistic) regression that incorporates basic survey weights. I would like to specify the general regression equation with the survey weights for a manuscript. But I cannot find an easily interpretable article that shows what a regression line of the form $y=a+xb+u$ looks like with notation with a survey weight added. Basic general linear model with a survey weight. That's all. Can anyone point me in the right direction? For a logistic regression as well.
