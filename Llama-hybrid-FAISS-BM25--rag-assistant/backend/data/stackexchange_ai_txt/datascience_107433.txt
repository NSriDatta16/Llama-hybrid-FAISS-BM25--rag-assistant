How can I build a model to suggest a person's next meal?

I'm new to machine learning, and I'm trying to think of a way to build a model that can suggest to a user if their next meal should be healthy or unhealthy. For instance, a user can set a goal: "Within 14 days, I want to have 70% healthy meals". As the user begins to record whether their current meal is healthy or unhealthy, the model will then suggest to the user if their next meal should be healthy or unhealthy in order for the user to achieve his/her goal. How can I build a model to help achieve that? I was thinking of either using a time series or a decision tree, but I'm not sure if there are better ways to go about this. Appreciate any suggestions :)
