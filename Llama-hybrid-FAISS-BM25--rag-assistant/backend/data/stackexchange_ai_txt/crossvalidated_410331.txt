With such a small data set, I would consider a few options: Neural network with some transfer learning if you can find a larger well-labeled data set to complement what you have A semi-supervised approach if you can find a large source of unlabeled data to complement your data Bayes net if you are able to reasonably hand craft some priors Adding regularization to your model It's tough to say exactly what is best without understanding the dataset and the operating goals of your model. Typically, you're better off spending your effort improving your data sources than your model with this little data though if you hope to generalize well in the real world
