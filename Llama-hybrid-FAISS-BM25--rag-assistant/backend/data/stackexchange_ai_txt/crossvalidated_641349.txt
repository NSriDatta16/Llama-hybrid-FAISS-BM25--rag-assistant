Almost sure convergence of $\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} X_i X_j$

I'm trying to prove that: Given a sequence $(X_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of independent and identically distributed random variables, $E(X_i^2) for all $i \geq 1$ , then $$\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_{1 \leq i My solution so far is to write $$\sum\limits_{1 \leq i then using the strong law of large numbers: $$\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} X_k \xrightarrow[n \to +\infty]{} E(X) \;\; \text{a.s}$$ so $$\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} X_k\right)^2 \xrightarrow[n \to +\infty]{} E(X)^2 \;\; \text{a.s}$$ and $$\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} X_k^2 \xrightarrow[n \to +\infty]{} E(X^2) \;\; \text{a.s}$$ Then $$\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_{1 \leq i But I find this solution is not natural since it strictly depends on the identity $$\sum\limits_{1 \leq i then it would not work for another kind of sum. Moreover, I found from a question on this site that there is a more general result $$\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_{1 \leq i but the answer requires a theorem of $U$ -statistics that is beyond my knowledge. So my question is: is there simpler solution for my original problem (i.e. the case of $h(X_i, X_j) = X_i X_j$ )? Edit: this question has been posted at Math.SE but didn't capture much attention.
