Using jQuery UI, give each row in the table an indication of what row it is and use the accept option of droppable to limit where a specific draggable can be dropped. In this example div elements are draggable, placed inside td elements of the table. Each tr has it's id attribute set to row-x where x is the row number. The accept function checks if the droppable td element's row number is the same as the row number the draggable comes from. $("div").draggable({ revert: 'invalid' }); $("td").droppable({ accept: function(draggable) { var droppable_row = $(this).parent().attr("id").split("-")[1]; var draggable_row = draggable.parent().parent().attr("id").split("-")[1]; return droppable_row == draggable_row; } }); Here's a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/EHA46/
