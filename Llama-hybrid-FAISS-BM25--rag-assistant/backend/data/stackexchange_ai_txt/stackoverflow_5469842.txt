I refactored the program in http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDiagramDesigner_Part1.aspx In the code I just remark //Canvas.SetTop(designerItem, top + e.VerticalChange); And remain Canvas.SetLeft(designerItem, left + e.HorizontalChange); Delete almost everything, replaced image with rectangle, And now the verical and horizontal lines drag and drop lines work, Now I am searching how to do the diagonal line drag and drop (I tried to do it with path/line control, I had the problem that if I add the diagonal line, it capture all the mouse event, and I can't move the other lines) Help still needed
