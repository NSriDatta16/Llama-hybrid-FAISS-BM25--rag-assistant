Generally, you want your training and validation data sets be separate as much as possible. Ideally, the validation set data would have been obtained only after the model has been trained. If you perform dimensionality reduction before splitting your data to separate sets, you break this isolation between the training and the validation and you won't be sure whether the dimensionality reduction process was over-fitted until your model is tested in real life. Having said that, there are cases, where efficient separation to training, testing and validation sets is not feasible and other sampling techniques, such as cross validation, leave k out etc are used. In these cases reducing the dimensionality before the sampling might be the right approach.
