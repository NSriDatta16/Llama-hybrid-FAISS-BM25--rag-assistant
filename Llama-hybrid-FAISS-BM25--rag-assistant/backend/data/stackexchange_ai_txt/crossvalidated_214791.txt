I would start with some games: give the person you want to teach many continuous numbers which represent a group of people's weight, and ask him/her to predict next. I would say, the person is very likely to use average of all numbers for the prediction. Ask the person why. Try to plant a seed to say using mean is essentially to have a predictor: $y=\beta_0$ Now, we will go to next game: in addition to only give the person predicting target, i.e., weight, give him/her additional information: height. Apparently height is very useful, in most cases, the taller suggests heavier. But the question is: what is the predictor / formula. You can give him/her some formula got from the regression, such as $y=\beta_0+\beta_1x$ and let the him/her to use this for prediction. I think him/her will like the idea. When him/her ask you how did you get the formula, you can tell the whole "linear regression" story, i.e., what the $\beta_0$,$\beta_1$ represent for and how to get them.
