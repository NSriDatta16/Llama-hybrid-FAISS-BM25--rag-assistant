It matters in a few subtle ways. functions defined in the header file (your "way 1") may (In my experience, usually are) be declared inline (though, just as with inline, if the function is large it might not actually be inline by the compiler). This can cause problems, especially when dealing with abstract classes. The reason for this is that the vtable will be included in the compilation unit (.o file) where the first non-inline function is found. If all of the functions are inlined, the v-table will not be found and your code will fail to link. (There are ways around this, but thats for another topic.) So, use way 2 for more organized code, especially for classes with lots of member functions and/or long member functions, and in cases where you have inheritance and virtual functions floating around. Use way 1 for very short classes (where the entire header file will be less than around 100-200 lines).
