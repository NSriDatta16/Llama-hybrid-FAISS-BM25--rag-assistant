How do you evaluate/test accuracy of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models?

As the title implies... For instance, for Machine Translation, we have BLEU. For categorization, we have categorical crossentropy, for binary categorization, we have binary crossentropy, etc. etc. For machine learning methods, I'm not sure what we can use to measure accuracy of TTS models.
