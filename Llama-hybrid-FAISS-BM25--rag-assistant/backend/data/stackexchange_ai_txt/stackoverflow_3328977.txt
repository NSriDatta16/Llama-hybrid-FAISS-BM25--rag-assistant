Syntactically, there is no alternative way but just a few techniques that might help you regarding query performance with very large volumes of data: If applicable and the number of columns returned by the query are not many you can use INTERSECT, EXCEPT OR UNION If the query is very complex and is of many steps on very large volumes of data, divide and conquer with temp tables. If the query is back to a report presenting some information that could be of yesterday's image of the data you can use sql server agent jobs to calculate and save the result in a table to be used as a back for the report instead of the query or as an alternative use indexed views to get the result. If some information like count of rows in a table takes too long to get you can use the metadata tables of the table to get such piece of information.This is not only for the count of rows in a table.You can get a lot of information from the metadata with no need to calculate it.(Keep in touch with this site )
