PCA vs SVD - understanding difference and preference of SVD over PCA

I understand that PCA and SVD are similar - PCA removes the mean and SVD doesn't? I think I have an understanding of PCA - you would use it to reduce dimensions of data and separate it out into linear combinations of variables that explain the largest variance of the SS. But I can't grasp that same concept for SVD - and especially can't understand when you would use SVD over PCA if they are supposed to be very similar. Can someone explain in very basic terms why I would pick SVD vs PCA, and how SVD works? What is a real world application where SVD is better than PCA?
