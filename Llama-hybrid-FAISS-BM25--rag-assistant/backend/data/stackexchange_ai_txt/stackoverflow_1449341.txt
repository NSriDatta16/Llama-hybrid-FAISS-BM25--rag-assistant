This may or may not be ideal, but I'm assuming you can't perform any math on the function generating the waveform (or the function is not available) - I would sample the wave at intervals that are significantly less than the period. This is probably difficult - you'll need to know for certain that the wave's peirod is greater than the sampling interval, but you won't want it to be too small or it will take forever to finish a few cycles of the wave. Perhaps you could start sampling with some minimal value, and ramp it up until the value changes at some acceptable rate. If you do this, then you can shift the wave to center on the X-axis (by subtracting or adding the average value) and determine 1) Min/max values, which provides an amplitude and 2) X-intercepts, which provides the period.
