All of the concerns you describe are handled by the mail transfer agent (i.e. sendmail, postfix, Exchange, etc) thanks to the Good 'Ole Days when the Internet was designed to survive nuclear war and 300 baud modems. There is no need for a library that adds them, because they're already there. All MTA's will buffer their messages in a spool file or some other data store and automatically retry any recoverable failures. This is required by RFC 2821 (Section 4.5.4): ...while mail that cannot be transmitted immediately MUST be queued and periodically retried by the sender [...] Retries continue until the message is transmitted or the sender gives up; the give-up time generally needs to be at least 4-5 days. The parameters to the retry algorithm MUST be configurable. Any MTA is able report the problems it encounters, this is just common decency. They'll typically write to the syslog facility of the host operating system, which can be monitored in any number of ways. I suppose not all of them implement rate limitation , but a very quick Google search suggests that the three I mentioned are all able to.
