1. A very common way of performing this type of analysis is to simply determine the value of the SOA (or $\log$ SOA) for each subject that is associated with the maximum PPI value. Then perform an analysis of variance on those values. An alternative method of finding the subject-specific value would be to fit separate smooth curves for each subject and interpolate the maximum PPI along with its accompanying SOA. You could use the results that you obtained from the augPred() function, for that matter. This might be somewhat unsatisfying, but it has the virtue of being feasible and interpretable. Think of it as a first-order approximation. I might start with that even if I were going to do something else, just to give me a back-up plan as well as a sanity check. Since the groups represent differing intensities, you could also consider a regression analysis as an alternative. It might be interesting to plot the data by decibels or log-decibels, anyway. 2. You mention that "upside-down u" shapes fit reasonable well for each subject. Since you fit cubics, perhaps the fit was not great. Anyway, if you have a parametric form for the curve, you could reparameterize the curve in terms of the quantity that you want to test --- in this case, the SOA producing the maximum PPI. Use nlme to fit the model again. Then, the interaction effect of group with your new parameter would be the interesting test. 3. Another option would be to fit a fully Bayesian model and determine posterior distributions for the contrasts of interest.
