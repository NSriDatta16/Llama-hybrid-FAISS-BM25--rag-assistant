Reinforcement learning does not depend on a grid world. It can be applied to any space of possibilities where there is a "fitness function" that maps between points in the space to a fitness metric. Topological spaces have a formally-defined "neighborhoods" but do not necessarily conform to a grid or any dimensional representation. In a topological space, the only way to get from "here" to "there" is via some "paths" which are sets of contiguous neighborhoods. Continuous fitness functions can be defined over topological spaces. For what it is worth, reinforcement learning is not the be-all-end-all (family of) learning algorithms in fitness landscapes. In a sufficiently rugged fitness landscape, other learning algorithms can perform better. Also, if there are regions of the space where there are no well-defined fitness function at a given point in time, it may be indeterminate as to what learning algorithms are optimal, if any.
