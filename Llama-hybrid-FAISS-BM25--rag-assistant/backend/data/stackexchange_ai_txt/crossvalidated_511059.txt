Imagine one of the models is a Random Forest. They usually have 100% accuracy if you use the predictions on the training set. Another model, on top of this, would use the predictions of the Random Forest believing that "Random Forest prediction is always right", since they are always equal to the label. So it would just have the same predictions that the Random Forest, and therefore, the same accuracy.
