How do I make all of the position attributes the same?

I made a drag-and-drop engine in JavaScript, and I'm currently adding a "bounding" feature. My issue is that the bounding element's position changes depending on its parent's position: attribute. In other words this html: Hello World! One Two and this html: Hello World! One Two affect the engine in different ways, and they shouldn't. Only the should affect the drag object. Here is the CSS: @charset "utf-8"; /* CSS Document */ * { padding: 0px; margin: 0px; } .drag { position: absolute; -webkit-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; user-select: none; } .bound { position: relative; } .square { width: 100px; height: 100px; background: red; cursor:move; } #center { width: 500px; height: 300px; margin: auto; margin-top: 50px; background-color:#ccc; text-align: center; border-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius: 25px; } #box { background-color: #FF3; height: 278px; border-radius: 0 0 25px 25px; -moz-border-radius: 0 0 25px 25px; opacity: 0.5; } If anyone asks for the JavaScript function which sets the bounding, I will be happy to post it in an edit! To make the position attribute not affect my JavaScript would I need to translate everything into absolute coordinates? How would I do this? Will translating everything into absolute coordinates allow the JavaScript to treat the two html samples the same way?
