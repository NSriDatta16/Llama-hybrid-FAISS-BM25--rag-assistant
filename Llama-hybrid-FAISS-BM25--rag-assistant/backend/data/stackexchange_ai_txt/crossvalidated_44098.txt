Long-term predictions

My question might sound a bit vague and probably too broad. It is because I do not expect straight answer. I'm starting a part of my PhD were I need to analyse a long-term prediction of reliability. However, after initial investigation (a.k.a. searching in various database, as well as googling) I have not found any statistical paper analyzing the question of predicting long-term behaviour of a random variable. Of course, long-term is problem-dependent, but I seek some references where questions like "how reasonable are the long-term predictions", "how to compare estimators in long-term predictions", "what methods fail at delivering reasonable long-term predictions", "Bayesian long-term prediction versus frequentist". Any comment or reference to a paper on this topic would be of high interest for me.
