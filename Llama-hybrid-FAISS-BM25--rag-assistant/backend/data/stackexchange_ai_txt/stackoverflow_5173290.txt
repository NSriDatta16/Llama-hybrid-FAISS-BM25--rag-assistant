Get collection of class "b" rows after row class "a" until next non-"b" row?

I'm not exactly a jQuery selector ninja yet, so I'm asking this in the hopes somebody can take a stab at it. I'm using jQuery Templates to create a table with rows based on nested dictionaries (they're nested 5 layers deep or so). It's based on data regarding organizational structure, and the people in each group. What I aim to do, based on the partial code below, is -- for each "team" row -- get the row of "persons" belonging to that team. Here's what I've got, indented for ease-of-reading. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... What I have now is a jQuery selector that gets all class="team" rows, and then for each row, I'm trying to find the selector to get each subsequent class="person" row, until the next non- person row. I can't get it right. Does something need to go in the place of the .nextAll() method ? $('table tr.team').each(function () { var personRows = $(this).nextUntil('tr.team'); console.log('row count: ' + personRows.length); }); I'm logging to the console for the time being so console output for the HTML above should match something like... > row count: 2 > row count: 3 Unfortunately, I'm getting something more along the lines of this, because of that "division" -class row. > row count: 2 > row count: 4 I've been racking my brain trying to look through the API to get what I want, but I can't get the desired effect. Any ideas? Any elegant solutions? Am I going to have to throw in an if clause somewhere to determine if the row is one I want to include in my selector?
