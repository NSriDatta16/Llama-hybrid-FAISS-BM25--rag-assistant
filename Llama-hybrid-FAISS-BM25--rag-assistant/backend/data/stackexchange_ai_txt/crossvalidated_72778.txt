Inverted SPSS results: Logistic regression command vs. Genlin?

I want to do a logistic regression in SPSS. However, since I analyse unemployment spells the subjects are sometimes repeated (violating the independence assumption of the regression). One way of removing the within subject variation is by applying a Genlin model with the repeated subject subcommand (in essence a GEE model). Thus, I tried out a Genlin model with binomal probability and the logit link, comparing it to a standard logistic regression. I used the exact same variables in the two procedures. However, the results that was delivered from the Genlin procedure was inverted relative to that of the logistic regression. For instance: Exp(B) for women (of the independent variable sex/gender) was just above 2.0 in logistic regression while being at 0.49 in Genlin. The same happened with every independent variable. Any suggestions to why the results of the Genlin procedure is inverted? Is there any way to get the Genlin results in accordance to the logistic regression?
