I've had this problem before and at that point gave up after reading all I could google about it (including this thread). The solution turned out to be simple in my case. All I had to do was not use ASP.NET test attributes and simply test the MVC project as a DLL. Step 1 Remove the extra attributes from the test. [TestMethod] public void TestMethod1() { Page page = TestContext.RequestedPage; Assert.IsTrue(false, "Test ran, at least."); } Step 2 In Code Coverage, uncheck the MVC Project and add the MVC Project's DLL manually. Voila, it get instrumented as a normal assembly, no errors, doesn't spin up the Development Server, also doesn't fail the Team Build.
