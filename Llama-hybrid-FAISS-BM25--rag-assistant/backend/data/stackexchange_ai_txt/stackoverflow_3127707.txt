Probably it is due to memory fragmentation: you have still free memory but not contiguous. Memory is divided in pages , usually 4KB in size, so if you allocate 4 MB, you will need 1024 contiguous memory pages in your process addressing space (they have not be physically contiguous as the memory is virtualized per-process). However memory for the hashtable hasn't do be contiguous (unless it is very badly implemented), so maybe it is some limit of the memory manager...
