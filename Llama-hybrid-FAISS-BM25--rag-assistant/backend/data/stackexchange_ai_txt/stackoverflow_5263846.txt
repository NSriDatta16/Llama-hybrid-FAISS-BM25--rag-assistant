Using LIBSVM to predict authenticity of the user

I am planning on using LibSVM to predict user authenticity in web applications. (1) Collect Data on particular user behavior(eg. LogIn time, IP Address, Country etc.) (2) Use Collected Data to train an SVM (3) Use real time data to compare and generate an output on level of authenticity Can some one tell me how can I do such a thing with LibSVM? Can Weka be helpful in these types of problems?
