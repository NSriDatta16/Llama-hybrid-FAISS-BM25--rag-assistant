GLM negative binomial - what to do when one category has only zeros?

I have camera trap data for four different management types (A,B,C,D). I want to know whether there is an effect of these management types on the abundance of different mammalian herbivore species. For some of the species, there are only zeros in one type of management, which complicates the analysis. What do I do? I know I could do a Bayesian approach but before I go into that, I would like to know if there's a work-around that allows me to do this analysis using a frequentist approach. The data for zebras: counts The model: library(MASS) model The output shows a huge standard error for group D, that only had 0s: Call: glm.nb(formula = counts ~ management, init.theta = 11.27380856, link = log) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.42149 -0.35526 -0.00006 0.45934 1.70106 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 5.0689 0.1258 40.286 It can also not show me any differences between 'D' and all the other groups. pairwise comparison: library(multcomp) contrasts |z|) A - B == 0 0.5063 0.1799 2.815 0.018355 * A - C == 0 0.7208 0.1810 3.982 0.000271 *** A - D == 0 25.3715 6344.9393 0.004 1.000000 B - C == 0 0.2145 0.1829 1.173 0.597425 B - D == 0 24.8652 6344.9393 0.004 1.000000 C - D == 0 24.6507 6344.9393 0.004 1.000000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method)
