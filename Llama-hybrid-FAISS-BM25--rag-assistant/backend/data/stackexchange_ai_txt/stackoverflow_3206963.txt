There is a Transformer class in my Quasimondolibs http://code.google.com/p/quasimondolibs/source/browse/#svn/trunk/quasimondolibs/com/quasimondo/tools Here is a little example: http://www.quasimondo.com/examples/transformer/ Example's source: http://code.google.com/p/quasimondolibs/source/browse/trunk/examples/Transformer/src/TransformerDemo.as Of course since there is no $300 price tag on it it comes without documentation or support. But as you can see in the example the usage is relatively simple. Also it does not have fancy features, like group transformations. If you want to do that you have to add those elements to a parent holder and add the transformer to that one.
