The cited paper by David Pollard indeed analyses an example due to Kagan and Shepp [The American Statistician 59 (2005) 54â€“56]. That example gives a statistic which is not sufficient, but still the Fisher information based on the insufficient statistic is equal to the Fisher information based on the complete data. I will not state that example here, but note that it is a mixture distribution where the support of the distribution varies with the unknown parameter $\theta$ . That is known to cause many hickups. So the conclusion, this is not an iff condition. But the cited paper continues to state and prove a theorem 7, which gives a necessary regularity condition for iff to hold.
