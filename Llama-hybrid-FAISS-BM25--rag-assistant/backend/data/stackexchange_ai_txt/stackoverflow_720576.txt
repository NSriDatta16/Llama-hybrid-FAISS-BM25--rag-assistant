Though not as immediate as you would like, you may be interested in the management of tracking rectangles and tracking areas performed by NSView class. This mechanism allows you to define specific areas of your custom view. Then, an event is generated whenever the cursor enters or leaves the area, or a mouse button is pressed in this area ( -mouseEntered: , -mouseExited: , -mouseDown: , -mouseUp: , -mouseDragged: , ... of NSResponder class). This up to you to define what you want your application do in response to these events (set the rectangle as selected and display it accordingly).
