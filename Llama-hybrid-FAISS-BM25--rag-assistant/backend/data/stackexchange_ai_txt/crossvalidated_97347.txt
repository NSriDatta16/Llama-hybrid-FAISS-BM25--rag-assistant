How can I improve the accuracy of my logistic regression code, which tests the accuracy using the 10-fold cross-validation technique?

How can I improve the accuracy of my logistic regression code, which tests the accuracy using the 10-fold cross-validation technique? I have implemented this code using glmfit and glmval . The desired accuracy is somewhat higher and it requires the parameters to be found using maximum likelihood estimator. Also, when I run this code in MATLAB, I get the following error Warning: X is ill conditioned, or the model is overparameterized, and some coefficients are not identifiable. You should use caution in making predictions. In glmfit at 245 In LR at 8 The code is: function LR( X,y) y(y==-1)=0; X=[ones(size(X,1),1) X]; disp(size(X,2)); indices = crossvalind('Kfold',y,10); for i = 1:10 test = (indices == i); train = ~test; b = glmfit(X(train,:),y(train),'binomial','logit'); y_hat= glmval(b,X(test,:),'logit'); y_true=y(test,:); error(i)=mean(abs(y_true-y_hat)); end accuracy=(1-error)*100; fprintf('accuracy= %f +- %f\n',mean(accuracy),std(accuracy)); end
