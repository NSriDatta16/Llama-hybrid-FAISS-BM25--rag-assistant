Comparing mean test scores (different tests, same group)

I have the following problem: There is 1 group of students (student 1, student 2, ..., student n) This group of students takes several tests (math, French, Biology) - all scored as percentages (e.g.: student 1 has 60% on math, 70% on French, etc.) Finding: the average score for math is 55% while for Biology it is 76 %. Question: I want to know whether these average scores are statistically different My answer would be: paired samples t-test However: in most explanations and examples I get in textbooks as well as online about the paired samples t-test a time element is involved (eg: comparing test scores for the same group before and after introducing a new education method). In case I am right and it is the paired samples t-test, what is my independent variable? (second part of my question)
