The real question here is whether you require tooling to support your database or not. By tooling I mean reporting, data migration, data mining, etc. Do you need to provide self service reports? Heck, even reports with a fast turnaround time that doesn't require deploying new code? (Providing report functionality in the application is a real drag.) There are countless tools available to perform these operations against traditional RDBMs. Against OODBs? I'm not familiar with any major products. Though, admittedly, I'm not an OODB kinda guy. If you don't need those tools, they go for it. Otherwise, stick to traditional RDBMs. With current ORM technology, the pain of mapping objects to records is much less than it used to be.
