General purpose algorithm for triangulating an undirected graph?

I am playing around with implementing a junction tree algorithm for belief propagation on a Bayesian Network. I'm struggling a bit with triangulating the graph so the junction trees can be formed. I understand that finding the optimal triangulation is NP-complete, but can you point me to a general purpose algorithm that results in a 'good enough' triangulation for relatively simple Bayesian Networks? This is a learning exercise (hobby, not homework), so I don't care much about space/time complexity as long as the algorithm results in a triangulated graph given any undirected graph. Ultimately, I'm trying to understand how exact inference algorithms work before I even try doing any sort of approximation. I'm tinkering in Python using NetworkX, but any pseudo-code description of such an algorithm using typical graph traversal terminology would be valuable. Thanks!
