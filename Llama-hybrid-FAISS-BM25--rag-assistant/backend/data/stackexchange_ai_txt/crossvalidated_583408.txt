The book does give the formula for the marginal covariance (matrix) of the response $Y_i$ of individual $i$ (several times, f.i. on page 201): $$ \Sigma_i=\mathrm{Cov}(Y_i)=Z_iG{Z}^{\top}_i+R_i\overset{\text{typically}}{=}Z_iG{Z}^{\top}_i + \sigma^2I_{n_i}, $$ where $R_i$ is the covariance matrix of the measurement errors, $Z_i$ the design matrix and $G$ the covariance matrix of the individual-specific/random effects $b_i$ . Entry $(k,l)$ of $\Sigma_i$ gives you the marginal covariance between observation $k$ and observation $l$ of individual $i$ . 'Marginal' means averaged over the (distribution of the) random effects. $^\star$ Clearly, the corresponding correlation matrix is given by $$ \mathrm{Corr}(Y_i)=S_i\mathrm{Cov}(Y_i)S_i, $$ where $S_i=\mathrm{diag}[(\Sigma_i)_{11},\ldots,(\Sigma_i)_{n_in_i}]^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ , i.e. $S_i$ is a diagonal matrix with the reciprocals of the marginal standard deviations extracted from $\Sigma_i$ on the diagonal. $^\star$ Here averaging can be understood as calculating the respective expectations in the law of total covariance applied to $\Sigma_i$ , where $b_i$ is the conditioning variable. Judging from the book's website , I think Table 8.4 shows the estimated marginal correlation matrix of $\log(\mathrm{FEV}_1)$ for individual 35 . The code below calculates the estimated marginal correlation matrix for all individuals and then extracts only the block corresponding to individual 35. Details can be found in one of the lme4 vignettes . I've added the age as column and row names for illustration purposes. corr_marginal $id == 35 corr_marginal(model_1)[rows_35, rows_35] %>% round(2) %>% as.matrix() %>% 'colnames age[rows_35]) %>% 'rownames
