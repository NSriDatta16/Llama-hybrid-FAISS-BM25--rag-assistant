I guess in practice, I would grudingly go with the #pragma disable... or 'UNUSED'. However, as a main rule, code should be kept clean of warnings even at the cost of some extra bulk. It should compile in multiple different compilers on different platforms and operating systems without warnings. If it does not, the code has be to fixed so that it does. Maintaining code that generates warnings at gcc -Wall level is not a good idea. Compiler warnings are your friend, and should be heeded as a matter or principle. Even when it means things have to be implemented in a bit bulkier and more verbose ways. Pays for itself in the long run as the code is ported, maintained, and lives on forever...
