What is the name for moments, a parameter that is calculated

I am looking to correctly name something. Often when I have my data, I calculate a "value". For instance a moment like the mean value, or a quantile. Or I aggregate a continuous variable into say 5 categories. For instance, for a time series I would calculate the mean value or some wavelet coefficients. Then I use all those "values" as input for, e.g., my regression analysis. In quantitative trading lay people call those calculated values "signal", but that sounds strange to me. In general, what is the name for those "values"? How would a statistician name those?
