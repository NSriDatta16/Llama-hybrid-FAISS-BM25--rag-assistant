Ok i get what you are trying to do but why don't you want use javaws? Launch4J looks like a good option as alternate to having java installed, as it will allow seamless usage of the jar file. javaws is more or less uses java.exe with security permissions and some launch options. But the security permissions can be disabled if you use a certificate that the user trusts. Also i am unsure when javaws was introduced but i am sure it was available in java 1.5 which i near EOL. So unless your user has not had a java installed for many years i doubt getting them to launch jnlp would be a problem. Even if they are running an older version you can add a required version of java to the jnlp and this will be automatically downloaded for that application only.
