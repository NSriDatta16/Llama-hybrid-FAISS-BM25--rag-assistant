A collection class like ArrayList encapsules some kind of internal storage (presumably an array which is resized as needed, but it could also be a linked list or some other implementation). Metods like IndexOf and Sort needs access to the underlying private storage to be efficient, so they have to be instace methods. An Array on the other hand is not encapsulated, there is public access directly to the storage. The Array.IndexOf and Array.Sort methods does not need any special access to the array data, so they might as well be static metods.
