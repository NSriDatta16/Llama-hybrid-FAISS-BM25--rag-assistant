Expected Identifiers in Xcode? I need need help!

im using 3.2.6 iOS 4.3 to begins with. now the question i have is its telling me I have an (located on the "(@Implementation window, hvController;"): Expected Identifier or '(' before '@' token in the Delegate.m class //HelloUniverseAppDelegate.M (@Implementation window, hvController; (... //HelloUniverseAppDelegate.m - (void)applicationDidFinishishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { HelloUniverseController *hvc = [[HelloUniverseController alloc] inWihhNibName:@"HelloUniverse" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; self.hvController = hvc; [hvc release]; [window addSubview:[self.hvController view]]; // Override point for customization after application launch [window makeKeyAndVisible ; } - (Void)dealloc { [hvController release]; [window release]; [super dealloc]; } HelloUniverseController *hvc = [HelloUniverseController alloc]; hvc = [hvc initWithNibName:@"HelloUniverse" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; #import "HelloUniverseAppDelegate.h" @implementation HelloUniverseAppDelegate @synthesize window; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Override point for customization after application launch. [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } - (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application { /* Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state. This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state. Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game. */ } - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application { /* Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later. If your application supports background execution, called instead of applicationWillTerminate: when the user quits. */ } - (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application { /* Called as part of transition from the background to the inactive state: here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background. */ } - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application { /* Restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) while the application was inactive. If the application was previously in the background, optionally refresh the user interface. */ } - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application { /* Called when the application is about to terminate. See also applicationDidEnterBackground:. */ } #pragma mark - #pragma mark Memory management - (void)applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:(UIApplication *)application { /* Free up as much memory as possible by purging cached data objects that can be recreated (or reloaded from disk) later. */ } - (void)dealloc { [window release]; [super dealloc]; } @end now also its telling me I have a similar error in the Controller.h with Expected Identifier before '{' token its located on the "- (void)dealloc :{" line. the code I have for it is #import @interface HelloUniverseController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UITextField *txtFirstName; IBOutlet UITextField *txtLastName; IBOutlet UILabel *lblMessage; } - (IBAction) btnClickMe_Clicked:(id)sender; //HelloUniverseController.m - (void)dealloc :{ [txtFirstName release]; [txtLastName release]; [lblMessage release]; [super dealloc]; } @end im also very new at this, my second day ever using a mactonish as well as first with Xcode.
