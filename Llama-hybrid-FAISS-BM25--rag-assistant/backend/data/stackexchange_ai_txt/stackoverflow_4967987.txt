I'm not sure quite what you're wanting to do with that subset of values from your range, but you can perform functions on a subset of values by using an array formula {=AVERAGE(IF((A1:A10>=2)*(A1:A10 This example identifies all values in the range 2-5 from the range A1:A10, and executes AVERAGE just using those values rather than the entire A1:A10 dataset.
