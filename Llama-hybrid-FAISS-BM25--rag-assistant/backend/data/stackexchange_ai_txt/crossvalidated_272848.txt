Residuals of symmetric Procrustes analyses are not symmetric

I am trying to replicate the analysis I saw in a paper. One of the step is to describe the relationships between two data tables. I use the procrustes() function from the vegan package with the argument ,symmetric= set to TRUE . I have two issues: 1) Although the statistic is the same, the residuals from: procrustes(A, B, symmetric=TRUE) procrustes(B, A, symmetric=TRUE) are different. This is a problem for me as I would like to have only one vector of residuals for a pair of data tables. Which leads to my second question. 2) What kind of symmetric analysis, or Procrustes variation, could enable me to get the same residuals independently of the order of my two data tables? I am afraid to continue exploring the residual relationship (not explained by each other) between A and B with two different vectors of residuals. Here is a an example dataset: jjj You can see here that the residuals are different: residuals(procrustes(jjj, lll, symmetric=TRUE)) site1 site2 site3 site4 site5 site6 site7 site8 site9 0.1963394 0.2408448 0.1568857 0.1574536 0.1080745 0.4005659 0.2499062 0.2456437 0.1414271 site10 site11 site12 site13 site14 site15 0.2270507 0.2859563 0.1329476 0.2468849 0.1645302 0.1516206 residuals(procrustes(lll, jjj, symmetric=TRUE)) site1 site2 site3 site4 site5 site6 site7 site8 0.11621180 0.10311944 0.26165198 0.03076077 0.27298092 0.23605756 0.21506970 0.22596903 site9 site10 site11 site12 site13 site14 site15 0.24395170 0.12297483 0.21167006 0.15647634 0.32112479 0.33889141 0.19974906
