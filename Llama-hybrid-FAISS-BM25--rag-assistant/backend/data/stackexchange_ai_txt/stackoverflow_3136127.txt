ASP.NET MVC Web App - Session Randomly Fails

I've a Web App that just recently has began randomly losing sessions. The exact cause is elusive at best, however it seems the session is killed/lost on the server side and results in the user needing to close their browser entirely and relaunch in order to log back in. I wish I could provide some code, but I can't figure out where the problem is at all. Here is a session action filter we use currently: public class SessionExpireAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute { public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) { HttpContext lvContext = HttpContext.Current; //if( // check if session is supported if (lvContext.Session != null) { // check if a new session id was generated if (lvContext.Session.IsNewSession) { // If it says it is a new session, but an existing cookie exists, then it must // have timed out string sessionCookie = lvContext.Request.Headers["Cookie"]; if ((null != sessionCookie) && (sessionCookie.IndexOf("ASP.NET_SessionId") >= 0)) { lvContext.Response.Redirect("~/Account/Timeout"); } } } base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext); } }
