If the scale of the survey is adequate and sampling is random from the population of interest, then the plain-English usage here should be OK. If all you care about is a difference in frequency of XYZ between 2 groups, you don't need to do logistic regression; a simple Fisher exact test or chi-squared test can determine if the 2 groups differ. In your particular example, a quick check indicates that your particular example would be statistically significant at the usual p = 0.05 level provided that there were more than 400 or so individuals sampled from each group. You generally don't just want to know, however, if behaviors are "more likely." To make informed decisions about resource allocations you typically want to know how much more likely and how certain you are about the magnitude of the difference. So providing confidence intervals for the estimated frequencies would be much more informative.
