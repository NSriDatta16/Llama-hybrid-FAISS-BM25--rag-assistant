Recommend you use the HTTPClient instead as shown in this example How do I make an http request using cookies on Android? From what I can see in your code: This section will given an extra & at the end while( keys.hasMoreElements() ) { String key = URLEncoder.encode(keys.nextElement().toString(),"UTF-8"); String value = URLEncoder.encode(post_values.get(key).toString(),"UTF-8"); post_string.append(key + "=" + value + "&"); } You read only a single line of what has been returned by the server. Even though the content might be placed in one line, the HTTP headers will span several lines String responseData = rawResponse.readLine(); You use the default user-agent request header which may not be accepted by the server If you want to try fixing your current code, I recommend you debug it or throw in some log statements (which you can view with for example the aLogCat application)
