Advice on where to continue in the field of data engineering and machine learning

I finished a 28 hours Machine learning with python (Basic course) on Udemy, and it was very beneficial. My aim, is to be able to understand what is ML and how to use its concepts while working with data. I am confused about where to continue. My goal is to be a data engineer/analyst or at least data engineer. I am searching for courses on coursera, because of its credibility. I found a course from University of Michigan: Applied data science with Python . But I am confused if I should take something else in order to start my data science job search. I know it is going to be a long process to finish. Any suggestions on how to proceed in this journey as I am really confused. Feel free to remove my question if it was not supposed to be asked here.
