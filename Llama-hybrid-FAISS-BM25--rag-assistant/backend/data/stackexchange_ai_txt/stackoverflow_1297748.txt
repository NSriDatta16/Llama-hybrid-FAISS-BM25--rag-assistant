Sorry, the new analytics system isn't available yet. If you're trying to estimate costs, note that CPU usage is easy to count (number of role instances * number of hours they've been running * $0.12), and storage usage is even easier (GB * months * $0.15). Bandwidth will be a hard one to estimate without analytics, sorry they're not available yet.
