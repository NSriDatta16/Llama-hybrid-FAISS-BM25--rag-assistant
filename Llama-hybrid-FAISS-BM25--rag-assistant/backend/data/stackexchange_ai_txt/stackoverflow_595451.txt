I think most people will say testing them is a waste of your time. In the 99% case that is true. If there's a bug in an accessor and the rest of your unit tests don't catch it indirectly then I'd start questioning why that property is there at all. On the other hand, testing an accessor takes less typing that asking this question :) Personally I test them. But this is a gray area for me and I don't press other people in my group to test them as long as they have sufficient coverage around the functionality of the class.
