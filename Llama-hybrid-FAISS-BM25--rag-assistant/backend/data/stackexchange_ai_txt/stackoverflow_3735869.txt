Well ... Code in a vertex shader is only evaluated per-vertex, with the input values of that vertex. But when moved to a fragment shader, it is evaluated per-fragment, i.e. per pixel, with input values appropriately interpolated between vertices. At least that is my understanding, I'm quite rusty with shader programming though.
