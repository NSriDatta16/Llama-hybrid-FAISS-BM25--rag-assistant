I thought I'd complement COOLSerdash's answer by showing what this actually entails in Python (spoiler alert: it's quite simple!). In a nutshell, you're basically going from this... import statsmodels.formula.api as smf model1 = smf.ols('inattention ~ group_a', data).fit() model1.summary() (where group_a is a dummy variable indicating whether the individual belongs to group A) ...to this: import statsmodels.formula.api as smf model2 = smf.ols('inattention ~ group_a + age', data).fit() model2.summary() That's really all it means to control for age. Also, note that the inferences from model1 and from your t-test are equivalent.
