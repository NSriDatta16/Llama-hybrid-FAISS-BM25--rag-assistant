As the error message points out, you could turn off custom errors altogether while sorting this out. In your web.config search for "customErrors" - if you have a fairly default version of the file, this will be commented out completely - remove the comments, and change the custom errors mode from "RemoteOnly" to "Off": If there isn't a customErrors block, just add one between the tags. When you've finished, set it back to either "RemoteOnly" or "On", and add at least a defaultRedirect pointing to a friendly error message for your users. This will then display the full error message, and if you've got a debug build deployed (or you're running a web site and you've set compilation mode to debug rather than a compiled web application) you'll also get line numbers, etc, rather than offsets. Once you've resolved the issue, I'd recommend following Roberto Sebestyen's advice , and add some proper error handling and reporting to your site ;)
