link : http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/creating/include.html there are two ways to create client side includes: JavaScript and iframe . Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of both before we tackle how to do it. The JavaScript method is the more seamless of the two. JavaScript code can fetch a fragment of a page from any URL and insert it into another page at any point. The end result looks as good as a server-side includeâ€” but only if JavaScript is turned on. And search engines don't see the included text at all, which is a serious problem. The iframe method is simpler. The iframe element can be used to force a second page to "embed" inside the first page, in much the same way that Flash movies, videos and MP3 players are embedded with the object element. And JavaScript doesn't have to be turned on. But there are disadvantages here too. The iframe element has a fixed width and height, no matter how big the content is. That can mean scrollbars inside your page. And, as of this writing, Google doesn't appear to index the separate page referenced by the iframe so that searchers can find your page.
