Relationships via Email Rather Than User List

I'm new at Drupal, so I may have missed a solution despite a lot of research: I want users to be able to invite non-users and other users into a named relationship they've set up (using e.g. the Friendlist or User Relationships module) using only email addresses and not the user list. I believe that invitations from both of those modules are done only after the inviter selects the invitee after selecting the invitee from a list of all users. Frankly, I would be surprised if no email solution exists since a large site's user list would be daunting. Does anyone know if this is possible using Organic Groups? Thanks very much.
