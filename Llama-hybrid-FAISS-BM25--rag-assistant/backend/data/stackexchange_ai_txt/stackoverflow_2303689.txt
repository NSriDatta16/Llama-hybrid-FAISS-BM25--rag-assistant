Using timers in Flex

I am programming an aplication with Adobe Flex, but because i just begining with this language a couple of days ago i have a lot of doubts. I have created two states and a transition between them, now my goal is to programatically switch over and over again between these two states every 5 seconds. I aproach this using timer object and it works fine, but my question is: Is there is any other elegant method to do that? and Could be intensive from the resources point of view the use of these timers in flex? thanks
