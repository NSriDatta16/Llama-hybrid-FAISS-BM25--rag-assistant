How can preprocessing with PCA but keeping the same dimensionality improve random forest results?

I found these sentences: PCA before random forest can be useful not for dimensionality reduction but to give you data a shape where random forest can perform better. I am quiet sure that in general if you transform your data with PCA keeping the same dimensionality of the original data you will have a better classification with random forest from this page: PCA on high-dimensional text data before random forest classification? In my case I found this is really true , for a regression problem with a database of ~1M records and 25 predictors. The error decreases by about 10% if I use the 25 PCA as predictors instead of the 25 original predictors. Can anyone help me in understanding and clearly interpreting this result?
