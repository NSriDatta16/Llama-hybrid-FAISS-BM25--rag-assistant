What does it mean to create predictions on predicted probabilities?

Background: I have a particular dataset of presence and absence of a specific bird. This data went through various means of simplification for machine learning techniques, for example random forests and a calibration model to finally predict the probability of encounter given a collection of X variables onto a raster, to map out these encounters. This was implemented over several years of MODIS landcover data, and finally I managed to gather the changes in landcover (Covariates - X variables), from year-to-year relative to independent habitat types. The dataset looks like this: #glimpse encounter year landcover pland_change ly_name 1 0.0303 2011 barren -0.143 Prairie_Potholes 2 0.0327 2011 barren -0.143 Prairie_Potholes 3 0.0280 2011 barren -0.143 Prairie_Potholes 4 0.0243 2011 barren -0.0556 Prairie_Potholes 5 0.0627 2011 barren -0.0833 Prairie_Potholes 6 0.0201 2011 barren -0.100 Prairie_Potholes Variables: Encounter - This was calculated using randomforest on presence/absence data, to estimate the probability of encounter. The finaly calculation has actually gone through a calibration and prediction model to get the final values of encounter . pland_change - These are the differences in pland relative to landcover , where ly_name represents the BCR region in which they're from. pland_change was calculated from MODIS MCD12Q1 yearly landcover data. The calculation of pland was performed with the following calculation: $$Pland = P_I =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}}{A}(100)$$ PLAND is equal to the sum of areas ( $m^2$ ) of all patches corresponding the patch type ( $a_{ij}$ ), divided by the total landscape area ( $m^2$ ), and multiplied by 100 (to convert into percentages). So pland_change is the difference of every year after 2010 (2010-2019), minus from 2010, to calculate the difference of pland from 2010. A simple introduction into my processing is taken from here (3 and 4) Research goal: My dataset above, after following the procedures from the link. I extracted those value from a raster with habitat and encounter values, then coerced them into a single dataframe. Given the following steps provided, I had the thought of proceeding with the information below if possible. Question: What does it mean to create predictions of estimated encounter-probabilities on relative habitat changes? Given that the estimated encounter-probabilities are predictions based on species presence – absence data, altogether, they’re likelihood estimations with a given error, of encountering a presence of species. Although, to predict the likelihood presence, as a further prediction of landcover changes, what does it mean to predict, a predicted probability of encounter given that these predictions were calculated on independent habitat types, and now they're predicted relative to habitat changes from year-to-year? Summary: Can you predict a predicted probability of encountering a bird?
