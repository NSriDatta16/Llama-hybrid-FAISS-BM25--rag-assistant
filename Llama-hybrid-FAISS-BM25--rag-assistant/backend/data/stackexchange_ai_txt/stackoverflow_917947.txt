This is how I do it: #pragma mark - #pragma mark NSURLConnection Delegate Methods - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection*)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse*)response { NSHTTPURLResponse* httpResponse = (NSHTTPURLResponse*)response; int responseStatusCode = [httpResponse statusCode]; } But I'm using an asynchronous NSURLConnection, so this may not help you. But I hope it does anyway!
