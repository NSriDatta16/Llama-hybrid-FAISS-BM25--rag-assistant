getting text that will be displayed to user from html

Bit of a random one, i am wanting to have a play with some NLP stuff and I would like to: Get all the text that will be displayed to the user in a browser from HTML . My ideal output would not have any tags in it and would only have fullstops (and any other punctuation used) and new line characters, though i can tolerate a fairly reasonable amount of failure in this (random other stuff ending up in output). If there was a way of inserting a newline or full stop in situations where the content was likely not to continue on then that would be considered an added bonus. e.g: items in an ul or option tag could be separated by full stops (or to be honest just ignored). I am working Java, but would be interested in seeing any code that does this. I can (and will if required) come up with something to do this, just wondered if there was anything out there like this already, as it would probably be better than what I come up with in an afternoon ;-). An example of the code I might write if I do end up doing this would be to use a SAX parser to find content in p tags, strip it of any span or strong etc tags, and add a full stop if I hit a div or another p without having had a fullstop. Any pointers or suggestions very welcome.
