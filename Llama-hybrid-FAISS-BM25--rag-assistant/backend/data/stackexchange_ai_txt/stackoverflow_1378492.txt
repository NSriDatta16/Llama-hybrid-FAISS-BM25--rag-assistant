Embedding JARs into the OSGi bundle with maven-bundle-plugin

Iâ€™m trying to embed some JARs into single OSGi bundle using the feature of maven-bundle-plugin The thing that worries me is that all packages of embedded JARs are put into the Import-Package header of the generated MANIFEST.MF. If I specify explicitly to use only the packages I need, like in the following snippet: Import-Package: org.osgi.framework The build fails with BND error (unresolved references). So, the question here is how can I build the bundle with embedded JARs with "Import-Package" header I need?
