magento 2column-right template where doe s $this refer too?

in the template.phtml file there is a line of code which refers to the content, using getChildHtml('content') ?> which echos out the content and the containing divs, i wish to access this raw code so i can insert some custom data but for the life of me cannot find where it is?! i have found the Mage_Page_Block_Html class in the core but cannot see any html that it is throwing out! Thanks in advance
