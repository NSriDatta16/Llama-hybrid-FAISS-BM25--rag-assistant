If you are doing it with a computer things are already in binary, so just repeatedly dividing by 3 and taking remainders is about as easy as things get. If you are doing it by hand, long division in binary works just like long division in decimal. just divide by three and take remainders. if we start with 16 ___101 11 |10000 11 100 11 1 100000 / 11 = 101 + 1/11 so the least significnnt digit is 1 101/ 11 = 1 + 10/11 the next digit is 2 1 and the msd is 1 so in ternary 121
