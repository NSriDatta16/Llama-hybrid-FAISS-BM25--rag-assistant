I'd like to add my "pragmatic" advice. Use PUT when you know the "id" by which the object you are saving can be retrieved. Using PUT won't work too well if you need, say, a database generated id to be returned for you to do future lookups or updates. So: To save an existing user, or one where the client generates the id and it's been verified that the id is unique: PUT /user/12345 HTTP/1.1 Otherwise, use POST to initially create the object, and PUT to update the object: POST /user HTTP/1.1
