Some options. 1./ Do you really have to populate with 12,000 items? can you use some filtering scheme and only return a subset of that data? 2./ Do you have to use a Combo box? do you have the screen real estate to use a virtual list view instead? (handle the storage and paging yourself) 3./ Create your own Virtual combo box...model the virtualization techniques on the virtual list view. 4./ Cheat...rather than a combo box, use a edit box with a "browse" button that opens a list that you can fill dynamically. As far as I know there is no mode that lets you do this already with the dev express (or native) combo boxes.
