Glad you found where it went wrong! However, it is really possible for something like that to happen. There is no such thing as "best algorithm", so the performance of a method partly depends on what your dataset looks like. Or sometimes your feature engineering method just allows the data to cheat on you, say, you mistakenly leaked some data, or neglected the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
