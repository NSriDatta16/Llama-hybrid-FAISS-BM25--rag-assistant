Excel formula to sum non-overlapping ranges of cells?

Say I have numbers in A1 to A20 and I wanted to sum non-overlapping ranges of 5 cells in column A and store the results in cells in column E, it would look something like this (if the formulas were typed into each E column cell manually): E1 = SUM(A1:A5) E2 = SUM(A6:A10) E3 = SUM(A11:A15) E4 = SUM(A16:A20) However, I don't want to type the formulas into E cells manually. I want to be able to select the formula in E1 and drag it down to E4, whilst maintain the non-overlapping ranges of 5 cells in A! Excel does not give me this behavior by default, it does this instead: E1 = SUM(A1:A5) E2 = SUM(A2:A6) E2 = SUM(A3:A7) E4 = SUM(A4:A8) See how the ranges of 5 cells in each SUM() function overlap? e.g. A1:A5 and A2:A6. That's not what I want. So, what is a formula that would enable me to do this? Basically, the following pseudocode would work, but I can't seem to implement anything like it in Excel: SUM(CELL(COLUMN, (CURRENT_ROW - 1) * 5 + 1):CELL(COLUMN, (CURRENT_ROW - 1) * 5 + 5)) For example, for E2, CURRENT_ROW = 2, meaning it would look like this: SUM(CELL(A, (2 - 1) * 5 + 1):CELL(A, (2 - 1) * 5 + 5)) = SUM(CELL(A, 6):CELL(A, 10)) This pseudocode assumes CELL has the method signature CELL(row, column).
