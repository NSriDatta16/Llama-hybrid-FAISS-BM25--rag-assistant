Autocovariance, Autocorrelation and Autocorrelation coefficient

I am taking a course about time series this year, and this is a brand new topic for me. I just got my first assignment and I am confused by a couple of terminologies. Q1. What is the difference between autocovariance, autocorrelation and autocorrelation coefficient? I tried to google it, but most of them don't really make sense to me. Q2. The question asks to estimate lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient, but what is lag? Is it a variable? Any help would be really appreciated! We don't lecture slides or any additional materials for this course, so if you have any textbooks, papers or slides that are helpful, feel free to comment below.
