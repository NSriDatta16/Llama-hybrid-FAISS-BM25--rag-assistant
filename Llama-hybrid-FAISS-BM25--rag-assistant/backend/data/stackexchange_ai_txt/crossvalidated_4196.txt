Confidence interval for ratio in timeseries

I have a time series $X(t)$ . Each $X(t)$ has three possible outcomes: A, B or C. I am interested in the ratio of A, B and C to the total. Assuming $N$ is the number of data points I have gathered for $X(t)$ , How can I compute the confidence levels for A/N, B/N and C/N when the $X(t)$ are "intuitively" not independent ? For example, $X(t)$ is an indication of whether a car is: moving (speed>0), stopped (speed=0) or its motor is off. The data I gathered is a time slice pertaining to a car. To me, those categories are not independent because when the car is moving at $X(t)$ is very likely to be still moving at $X(t)$ . [Am I correct?]
