Difference between "estimated" and "fitted"?

Currently I am using a r package to fit an ARMA-GARCH process. Afterwards, I want to use the fitted values to calculate the Value at Risk. So these values are not the forecasts, but the "in-sample-fit". Now, I am wondering about the word-choice, i.e. the difference between the word "fitted" and "estimated"? What word should I use? Is it the same? E.g. Tsay page 136 says in figure 3.8 "Time series plot of estimated volatilty ($\sigma_t$) for monthly excess returns ...." Whereas in the R manual it says: "fitted values"
