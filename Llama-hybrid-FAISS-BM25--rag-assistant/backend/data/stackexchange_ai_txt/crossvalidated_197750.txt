How to perform a meta-analysis on incidence rates?

I have a number of studies with incidence rates of a disease in the population and I want to obtain a weighted average, also taking into account moderator variables; specifically (i) study design (ii) population size from which the incidence was drawn, and (iii) the number of years of data collection. As a novice how do I go about doing that? Everything I read seems to be aimed at interventions and effect sizes.
