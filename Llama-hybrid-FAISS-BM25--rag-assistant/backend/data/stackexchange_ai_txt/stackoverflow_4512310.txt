This is an extremely difficult question. Using computer vision algorithms you can isolate the pupil and measure an average diameter in pixels, but you would ever be able to translate that into physical size without knowing how far the eye is from the camera and the camera's field of view. For example, you could have a person with the camera a few inches from their eye and their pupil could be the same size in pixels as a picture of an eye on a billboard 100 feet away. Even though, physically, they have very different sizes.
