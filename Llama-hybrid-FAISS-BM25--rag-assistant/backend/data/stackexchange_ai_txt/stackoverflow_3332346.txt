LaTeX: writing what looks like Math statement, but I want it as text. How to do it with no error of 'Missing $...'?

While writing in LaTeX, I happened to type something like "$ variable = test" as a text. However, LaTeX said something like: Missing $ .. I tried putting \ before the $ and other math symbols, but it still messed up the shape of the text. My question is: how can I instruct LaTeX that this whole paragraph or sentence, is pure text, and no math in it? Also, away from this, when I try adding the symbol " | " it shows it as double underscore " __ ". How to solve this? Thanks!
