It sounds like you want to take an existing memo field and chop-up before putting it into the database and then gluing it back together when you need to display it. I think you are going to be in for a world of pain if you try that. I'd try harder to change the backend if that was your only option :) I'll build on DWF's answer by suggesting doing something like you were suggesting. Make a 1:N table (I'll call it UserNotes) with a text field (vs the memos that you seem to be having troubles with). Then create a subform with UserNotes as its record source, and replace the memo field with the UserNotes subform. This lets the user decide where line/paragraph breaks are within the context of the 255 character text field. (for conversion you'll still have to chop the memos up, but that's just a one time operation)
