logic of stationary property?

I am extremely puzzled... In textbooks I read that the "stationary property" is having the same statistical properties, in two chunks of my time series. I do not understand... How can I possibly check that?, Clearly if I do any chunk against all others, that will be infinite possibilities since the chunk can also vary in size. I can't understand how the TS could for example keep the same mean? To me, for it to be the same mean always it has to be a straight line, otherwise I could just pick two specific chunks so that it will make my mean different and conclude is not stationary.
