IntelliFactory have some nice samples for how you might build a web UI using F#, the examples are based on their WebSharper product. It's not free but if your serious about building a LOB app in F# then it's definitely worth looking at, as in my humble opinion, it's really good: http://www.intellifactory.com/products/wsp/Tutorial.aspx# For the data side I'm told Entity Framework V2 works reasonable well for F#, and there's always my FunctionalNHibernate project which is in it's infancy but really quite cute: http://bitbucket.org/robertpi/functionalnhibernate/
