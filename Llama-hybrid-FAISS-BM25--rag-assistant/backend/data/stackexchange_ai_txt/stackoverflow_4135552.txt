NullPointerExceptions not being thrown in test

I have just installed EclEmma into my Eclipse setup and run it against a test suite to see what code coverage I had on its target methods. I have found that any lines where I throw a new NullPointerException are not covered, despite asserting in the test that one will be thrown when the method is invoked. I am finding that these tests pass! An example can be found below: public static boolean isXMLFile(File f) { if(f==null) { throw new NullPointerException("isXMLFile: Input File must not be null"); } } I am finding that I am getting the NPE I wanted when I call the above code with isXMLFile(null) in my jUnit test, but I don't think it is coming from where I think it is! I'm missing something very fundamental about runtime exceptions, aren't I?
