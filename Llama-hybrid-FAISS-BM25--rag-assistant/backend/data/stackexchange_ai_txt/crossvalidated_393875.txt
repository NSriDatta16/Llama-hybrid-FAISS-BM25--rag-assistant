What is matrix norm in (Collins, 2001)

I am studying " A generalization of PCA to the exponential family " (Collins et al., 2001) and I don't understand some notations. What is the meaning of the matrix squared norm on page 6 ? Is it a frobenius norm? If it's a matrix... what does matrix quotient (division) mean ? If it's a scalar, is it equivalent to the following notation ? $A^{(t)}=\frac{1}{\left \|\mathbf{V}^{(t-1)} \right \|^2}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{V}^{(t-1)})^T$
