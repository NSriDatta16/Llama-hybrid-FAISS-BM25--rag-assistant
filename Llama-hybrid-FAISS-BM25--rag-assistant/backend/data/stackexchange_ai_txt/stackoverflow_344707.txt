I think the best way to do this would be to have each word be a textblock and then just attach the words to the correct event handlers you want for particular sections. This would give you the wrapping you want and for the indentation on the first word, you can set it's left margin. See this article for an example in which something similar is done with text and the wrap panel. http://jesseliberty.com/2008/12/03/the-wrap-panel/
