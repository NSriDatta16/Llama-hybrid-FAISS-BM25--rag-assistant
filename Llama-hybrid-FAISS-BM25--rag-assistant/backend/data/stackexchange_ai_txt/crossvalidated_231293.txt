Conditional probability for Gaussian

First of all I'm studying machine learning with Bishop's pattern recognition I'm stuck with chapter two Gaussian parts. It requires a lot of linear Algebra and Statistics. which books you recommending to form the base for Gaussian part? and this is my second question about chapter 2(Gaussian) this equation is from gaussian conditional distribution for quadratic equation $$-\dfrac{1}{2}({\bf x}-{\pmb \mu})^T\Sigma^{-1}({\bf x}-{\pmb \mu})=-\dfrac{1}{2}{\bf x}^T\Sigma^{-1}{\bf x} + {\bf x}^T\Sigma^{-1}{\pmb \mu}+const \qquad{(2.71)}$$ This is called completing the square How left equation derived to the right equation? what does equation represent? (do not understand the format of the euations and why we use this?) what does it mean to find the mean and the variance from this equation? and this is conditional probability for gaussian and this equation $$-\dfrac{1}{2}{\bf x}_a^T\Lambda_{aa}{\bf x}_a \qquad{(2.72)}$$ it said take derivative two times and this equations derived. ..... why.... $$\Sigma\_{a|b} = \Lambda_{aa}^{-1} \qquad{(2.73)}$$ why some covariance represent the conditional probability? if its too hard to explain can you list the "things" I should know for this equations?
