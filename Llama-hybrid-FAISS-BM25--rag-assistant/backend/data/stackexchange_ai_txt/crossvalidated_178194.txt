Why is my support vector machine model not working in R?

I am using a Support Vector Machine model to predict the direction of a stock price given some independent variables. Here is part of my dataset: post_eco eco_ant sd_eco ant_cl1 sd_cl1 Up 0 0.000000 -0.03 0.00948683 Up 0 0.000000 0.04 0.01663330 Down 0 0.000000 -0.04 0.02110818 Down 0 0.000000 -0.11 0.03977715 Down 0 0.000000 -0.19 0.06783149 Down 5 2.041241 -0.19 0.08256983 I want to predict the direction using the variables listed. post_eco: shows the direction the stock price is going to take in the next ten minutes: 'Up' or 'Down'. eco_ant: tells me by how much has the stock price moved in the last 10 minutes. sd_eco: tells me the standard deviation of the stock price in the last 10 minutes. ant_cl1: tells me by how much has the oil price moved in the last 10 minutes. sd_cl1: tells me the standard deviation of the oil price in the last 10 minutes. I use the function: svmfit=svm(post_eco~., data=train ,kernel ="radial",cost=0.0625,gamma=0.0625) to apply the support vector machine and predict the relationship. The problem is that I get a 'Down' for every predicted observation (which does not make sense).
