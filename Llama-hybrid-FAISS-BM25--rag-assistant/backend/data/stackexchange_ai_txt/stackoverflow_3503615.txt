What are the minimum margins most printers can handle?

Im creating pdfs server side with lots of graphics so maximizing real estate is a must but at the same time ensuring users printers can handle the tight margins is a must. Does anyone have an idea what safe values I can use for the margins when authoring the pdfs. In the past Ive used work and home printers with margins of about one cm with no problems but of course I can't take this as the defacto minimum. Oh and I don't really want to allow the user to specify the margin (50% lazyness 50% will get complicated.) Ive googled but couldn't find anything concrete. (average minimum margin printing)
