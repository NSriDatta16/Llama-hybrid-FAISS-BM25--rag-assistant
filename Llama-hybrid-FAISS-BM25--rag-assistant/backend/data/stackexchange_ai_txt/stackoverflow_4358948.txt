Most editors use the contentEditable property. Simply setting it on any HTML element enables editing, copy&paste, spell checking, formatting etc. in modern user agents. However, google docs specifically does not use contentEditable. Instead, they implemented their own rendering engine in JavaScript. Unless you plan a project on the scale of google docs (i.e. you have at least, say, 3 people willing to work full-time on the rendering engine), contentEditable is the way to go.
