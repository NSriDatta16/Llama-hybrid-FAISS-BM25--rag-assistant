How to make an HTTP GET with modified headers?

What is the best way to make an HTTP GET request in Ruby with modified headers? I want to get a range of bytes from the end of a log file and have been toying with the following code, but the server is throwing back a response saying that "it is a request that the server could not understand" (the server is Apache). require 'net/http' require 'uri' #with @address, @port, @path all defined elsewhere httpcall = Net::HTTP.new(@address, @port) headers = { 'Range' => 'bytes=1000-' } resp, data = httpcall.get2(@path, headers) Is there a better way to define headers in Ruby? Does anyone know why this would be failing against Apache? If I do a get in a browser to http://[address]:[port]/[path] I get the data I am seeking without issue.
