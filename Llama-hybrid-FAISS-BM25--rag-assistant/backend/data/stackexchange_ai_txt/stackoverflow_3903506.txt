Packet, you mean? If you want see packets in userspace, not kernel-level then you can use several ways. libpcap: libpcap is packet capture library used in tcpdump/wireshark libipq: iptables packet queueing library. http://rubyipq.rubyforge.org/ for libipq, there is also ruby binding but it doesn't seems to be in activated. Actually libipq is deprecated by libnetfilter_queue You can make ruby binding of libnetfilter_queue.
