What sort of workloads would be appropriate for use on Amazon EC2 Spot Instances?

Amazon just announced " Spot Instances " for their EC2 based infrastructure. I was wondering what sort of workloads would be appropriate for such service? Spot Instances enable you to bid for unused Amazon EC2 capacity. Instances are charged the Spot Price set by Amazon EC2, which fluctuates periodically depending on the supply of and demand for Spot Instance capacity. Interesting quote : The philosophy of JIT is simple: inventory is waste. EDITED: I wonder if there are applications that could sustain themselves (read: be viable) just by leveraging a large volume of those Spot instances. Think about it: imagine you get 10 instances for the price of 1 on average... of course there wouldn't be guarantees but in the case that no Spot instances are available, a number of "normal" instances could be kicked-of.
