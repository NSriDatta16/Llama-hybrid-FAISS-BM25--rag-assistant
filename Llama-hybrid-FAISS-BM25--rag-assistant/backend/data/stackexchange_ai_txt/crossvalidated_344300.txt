Linearity predictor with log odds violated in binary logistic regression - How to solve?

When testing the assumption for linearity with the log odds in my binary logit model (using Box-Tidwell), I found that one of my predictors does not satisfy this assumption. What should I do next? Transform this predictor? In what way? And how to do that? PS: I am using RStudio.
