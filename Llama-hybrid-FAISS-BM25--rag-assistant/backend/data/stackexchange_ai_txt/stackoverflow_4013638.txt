Delegating to the base class implementation

How can I delegate the invocations within a baseclass to the base class implementation rather than the inherited class implementation? For example: class A def foo p "hello" end def bar foo end end class B In the example above, what is the most elegant way to print hello when the foo method is invoked within the base class by bar method?
