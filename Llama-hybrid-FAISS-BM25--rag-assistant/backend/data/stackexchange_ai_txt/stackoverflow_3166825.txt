Cygwin cron starts at wrong time

I have a cron job starting at 1 o'clock everyday 0 1 * * * somescript the script downloads updates my files, however when I check my modified date the earliest file says it was modified at 3:30 A.M. and this happened for 2 days now, so I tried */1 * * * * date >> c:/date.txt and saw that the date is fine. Is there something else throwing cron's timing off by 2 and a half hours? or does cron use some other timing that I need to correct? If all else fails I guess I could just move my script timing up to 30 10 * * * but I'd like to get the time corrected/find out what I'm doing wrong. My curl output: Fri Jul 02 3:31:43 AM Central Daylight Time 2010 myfile % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 0 100 273k 100 273k 0 0 427k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 460k So it didn't take that long.
