You can define an Eclipse fragment with the missing dependency on its classpath (normally in the lib directory of the fragment and specified on the classpath in the manifest). A fragment is a special type of plugin that is attached to a target plugin. The fragment is merged with the target plugin at runtime, so the classes in the plugin will have access to the jar. See this question for some pointers on creating a fragment.
