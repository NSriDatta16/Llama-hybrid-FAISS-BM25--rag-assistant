If I understand you correctly, you want to generate a static script from your data. If so, consider performing a query on the old data that concatenates strings to form the SQL statements you'll want in the script. First, figure out what you want the scripted result to look like. Note that you'll need to think of the values you're inserting as constants. For example: INSERT INTO NewTable VALUES 'value1', 'value2' Now, create a query for the old data that just gets the values you'll want to move, like this: SELECT value1, value2 FROM OldTable Finally, update your query's SELECT statement to produce a single concatenated string in the form of the output you previous defined: SELECT 'INSERT INTO NewTable VALUES ''' + value1 + ''', ''' + value2 + '''' FROM OldTable It's a convoluted way to do business, but it gets the job done. You'll need a close attention to detail. It will allow a small (but confusing) query to quickly output very large numbers of static DML statements.
