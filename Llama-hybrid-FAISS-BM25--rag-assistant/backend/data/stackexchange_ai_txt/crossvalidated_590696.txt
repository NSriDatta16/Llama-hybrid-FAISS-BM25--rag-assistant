Understanding Dickey-Fuller-Result

I am currently looking into the dickey-fuller test but seem to not understand something fundamental. To understand the test better, I created 4 time series: cons, lin, r1 and r2. How these are generated can be seen in the code below. While r1 pulls samples from N(0,1), r2 follows the definition of a random walk. These are displayed as Figure 1. I would expect to obtain Z(t) > 0.05 for r2 and fail to reject H0 that it is a random walk. On the other hand, I would expect Z(t) UPDATE The results however are not as clear as I would hope, for these very basic examples. While I fail to reject H0 for r2 (as anticipated), the same applies for lin and con with much higher certainty. Only drawing random samples (r1) is correctly identified not to be a random walk with certainty. . do "dickey-fuller-example.do" . set obs 80 Number of observations (_N) was 0, now 80. . gen points = _n . gen cons = 0 . gen lin = 0.02 * _n . gen r1 = 0 . replace r1 = rnormal() if _n>1 (79 real changes made) . gen r2 = 0 . replace r2 = r2[_n-1] + rnormal() if _n>1 (79 real changes made) . . two con cons lin r1 r2 points, msize(small...) . . tsset points Time variable: points, 1 to 80 Delta: 1 unit . . dfuller cons DickeyFuller test for unit root Number of obs = 79 Variable: cons Number of lags = 0 H0: Random walk without drift, d = 0 DickeyFuller Test -------- critical value --------- statistic 1% 5% 10% -------------------------------------------------------------- Z(t) . -3.539 -2.907 -2.588 -------------------------------------------------------------- MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 1.0000. . dfuller lin DickeyFuller test for unit root Number of obs = 79 Variable: lin Number of lags = 0 H0: Random walk without drift, d = 0 DickeyFuller Test -------- critical value --------- statistic 1% 5% 10% -------------------------------------------------------------- Z(t) 0.151 -3.539 -2.907 -2.588 -------------------------------------------------------------- MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 0.9694. . dfuller r1 DickeyFuller test for unit root Number of obs = 79 Variable: r1 Number of lags = 0 H0: Random walk without drift, d = 0 DickeyFuller Test -------- critical value --------- statistic 1% 5% 10% -------------------------------------------------------------- Z(t) -7.259 -3.539 -2.907 -2.588 -------------------------------------------------------------- MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 0.0000. . dfuller r2 DickeyFuller test for unit root Number of obs = 79 Variable: r2 Number of lags = 0 H0: Random walk without drift, d = 0 DickeyFuller Test -------- critical value --------- statistic 1% 5% 10% -------------------------------------------------------------- Z(t) -2.186 -3.539 -2.907 -2.588 -------------------------------------------------------------- MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 0.2112. . end of do-file Can somebody explain me what happens here? These are my main questions? Why do I fail to reject H0 for r2 with comparatively low confidence? Why do I fail to reject H0 for lin and cons? Is there an easy example like this to confirm that the test works correctly?
