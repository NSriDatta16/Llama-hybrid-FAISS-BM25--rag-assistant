So your problem is that you may have too many methods? I thinks it's right, because those methods do different things. If you want to reduce the number and you're using HQL you may add a parameter to the method that says if you want to join fetch the relations: getWhatever(WhateverFetchMode f) where f can be a boolean, or an object that returns the HQL fragment of string that gives you that relations to fetch. public List getList(boolean fetchProp1) { return em.createQuery("select r" + "from Object as r " + fetchProp1 ? "left join fetch r.prop1 " : "") .getResultList(); } or public List getList(WhateverFetchMode fetchProp1) { return em.createQuery("select r" + "from Object as r " + fetchProp1.toHql()) // This returns the right join fetch .getResultList(); }
