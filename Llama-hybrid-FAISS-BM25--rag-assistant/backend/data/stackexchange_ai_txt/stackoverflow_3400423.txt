What are the browser capabilities of the e-ink Amazon Kindle's WebKit offering?

It seems like the new "experimental" web browser in the Kindle is fairly limited in capabilities. Styling of even the included bookmarks looks a bit rough. In one video , the person mentions JavaScript being enabled in "advanced" mode but there was no demonstration of what that means. As of writing this, the product page only offers a quick paragraph about international support limitations. What sort of web standards does the Kindle WebKit browser officially support?
