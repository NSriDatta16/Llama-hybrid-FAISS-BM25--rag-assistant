I have used both Mercurial and git and I vastly prefer hg to git; it just feels nicer. Steve Losh in his blog post The Real Difference Between Mercurial and Git sums up most of my feelings about it. Here are some quotes which I agree wholeheartedly with: I think there’s still one very, very important difference left: the systems feel very different to use. I personally find Mercurial’s philosophy easier to work with. It’s easy for me to wrap my head around commands when they’re more modular and less monolithic. I personally don’t like the index. I feel that git encourages people to check in changesets that contain code which they’ve never tested (or even built) because the index is such a prominent part of git’s workflow. I've found the index a pain to work with - if I want something like that (and more powerful, too) I'll use mq. In the mean time - why should I be forced to have different types of add s, etc.? Why should I be forced to use git commit -a (and have git status - where is git st ? - show weird info)? Quite seriously, I personally can attribute the success and wide acceptance of git to nothing other than GitHub. Steve latches onto that, too. How may people have been through this, and "given in" to pressure from git users? I don’t like using git itself (though it’s far better than SVN or CVS), but GitHub is such an awesome site that I’ve considered switching just to use it. I'll continue to only use git/GitHib when required to - when I want to make a patch to something that's on there. My own projects will continue to use Mercurial. It feels nicer.
