Support Vectors are not "central" vectors of your data set. Instead, they are borderline cases . Similarly, the confidence score of SVM does not measure how typical an object is; but mostly how far away from the other class it is. Consider this example from Wikipedia ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linear-svm-scatterplot.svg ): An object at (100,100) - way out of the picture - would have a 1.0 score for being in the "white" class. But that does not at all mean the object is "central" to that class. Only that is substantially far away from the other class.
