how to use mysql defaults file (my.cnf) with sqlalchemy?

I'd like to have sqlalchemy get the hostname, username, and password for the mysql database it's connecting to. The documentation says mysql schemas are specified as such: mysql_db = create_engine('mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo') Is it possible to instead source a mysql defaults file such as /etc/my.cnf and get the login details from there? I'd like to avoid embedding the username/password in my code.
