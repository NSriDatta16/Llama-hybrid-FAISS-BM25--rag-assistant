What additional functionality are you looking for that isn't provided by the already-available NSSplitView? Reeder for Mac seems to use a simple NSSplitView with 3 subviews. (To create a split view with 3 views, drag the usual NSSplitView into a window or view in InterfaceBuilder, then drag an additional NSView into the NSSplitView in the "Outline Mode" of your IB document's window.)
