is "multivariable linear regression" the same as logistic regression?

I am new to machine learning and I am simultaneously studying linear and logistic regression. Logistic regression is when there is one dependent variable and there may be more than one independent variable Multivariable linear regression attempts to find a linear relationship between multiple variables where every independent variable x must have a dependent variable y. Can anyone tell me the difference between the two?
