The author (C. Bishop) intentionally doesn't use the classic relation (1) because it'd then be required to calculate the denominator by marginalising the joint PDF. This integral is quite cumbersome in may cases in bayesian literature and there are approximate ways of getting it. However, in the Gaussian case, we have a way of calculating it in an indirect way (i.e. not by marginalising the joint). The author simply exploits the form of the joint PDF to come up directly with the conditional PDF. The idea can be outlined as follows: The conditional PDF is a function of $x_a$ , and since $x_b$ is given, any expression containing $x_b$ can be regarded as a constant. Therefore, the denominator has no effect on the form of $x_a$ 's conditional PDF. Ex: If let's say $p(x_a,x_b)=g(x_b)e^{-x_a h(x_b)}$ (assume $x_a$ is not a vector for this particular case), then $p(x_a|x_b)$ is in the form of an exponential random variable's PDF because all other terms including $p(x_b)$ in the denominator don't change the form of the conditional ( $Ce^{-\lambda x})$ . That's why the author manipulates the joint PDF and says that it's actually in the following form: $$\begin{align}p(x_a,x_b)&=C\exp(-0.5(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu))\\&=C\exp(-0.5(x_a-b)^TS^{-1}(x_a-b)+g(x_b))\end{align}$$ where $g(.)$ is a function. And, this form is Gaussian for $x_a$ . So, the conditional PDF is Gaussian. We don't worry exactly what would the denominator be or what exactly $g(x_b)$ brings us since it'd all have to satisfy the normalization property of PDFs anyway. Noting that the form is Gaussian, it all boils down to finding what $S$ and $b$ is which are conditional covariance and the mean. Of course, there are a lot of steps between the first and the second line here, and if you have questions about specific steps, you can ask them as follow-ups.
