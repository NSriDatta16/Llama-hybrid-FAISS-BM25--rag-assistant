As far as i have been able to tell from the docs and using gearman with PHP, the only way to clear the job queue is to restart to the gearmand job server. If you are using persistent job queues, you will also need to empty whatever you are using as the persistent storage, if this is DB storage, you will need to empty the appropriate tables of all the rows. stop gearmand --> empty table rows --> start gearmand Hope this is clear enough.
