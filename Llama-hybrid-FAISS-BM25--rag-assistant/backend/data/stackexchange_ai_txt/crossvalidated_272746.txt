I'm not sure, but I would suggest trying to add values to c and gamma parameters when tuning them. The reason I say that is because gamma defines a sort of "smoothness" of classification. That's to say a very small value of gamma means any close point will be considered having the same target (thus putting everything in one class when they are a bit similar). While it is great that you used a logarithmic scale for your tuning, we actually go further than "0.05" for gamma. I usually range from ($2^{-15}$ to $2^5$). Try to add ( $0.5 , 5$ ) for exemple. (Ps : You could use 10^(-10:5) wich I find easier to write in R) Not so long ago, I had a classifier that had ($C= 100 , gamma= 10$) as it's best parameters, and it appeared that it gave very poor results for $gamma I hope this helps. If it doesn't, could you post your results for a linear kernel svm ?
