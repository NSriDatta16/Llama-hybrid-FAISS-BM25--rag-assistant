Typically not as R is an interpreted language, which on average is many times slower than equivalent compiled code. While converting your program to C, Fortran, or Java takes a significant investment, the code can literally run 10-100X faster than an equivalent R version. Additionally, R has very limited tools to manipulate large datasets, especially ones that require clusters to process or require special hardware. Moreover, most commercial implementations need to provide user interfaces and fit into existing frameworks, which are typically written in other languages. While you could interface with existing R code from most compiled languages (there are wrappers out there), you would find that your core numerical routines would still not be any faster than the original R code. At the end of the day, R (like Matlab) is used mostly for prototyping and/or trying out ideas using existing implementations.
