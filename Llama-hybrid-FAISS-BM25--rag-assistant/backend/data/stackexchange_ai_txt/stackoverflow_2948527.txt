content_tag_for a collection in Rails?

I have a Post model. Posts have many Comments. I want to generate a element for post.comments using content_tag_for . Ideally, it'd produce ... where 7 is the ID of the Post. The closest I can get uses which produces ... which is pretty close, except for the class="post" . Using :class => :comments in the content_tag_for yields class="post comments" , but I just want class="comments" . It seems logical that I'd be able to use something like but, sadly, that yields ... I've searched far and wide. I feel like I'm missing some elegant way to do this. Am I? Because, seriously, " class="comments"> is painful.
