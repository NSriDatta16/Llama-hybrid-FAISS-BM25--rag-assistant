normal qq plot and OLS

Just have a quick question. You have to know by looking at the residual plot and the normal qq plot that the residual should be distributed as normal, average of residuals should be 0 and residuals should not have a discernible trend and residuals should have constant variance.Then, from these points, you know that the OLS is a good or bad choice. But, let's say from the residual plot, you see that the residuals have inconsistent variance meaning that as the fitted value increases, you can see higher and higher residuals. Then, one option is by applying log transformation by reducing the phenomenon where the residuals grow in variability. My question is this: if you apply log transformation, you hope to see that the new residuals should be now following the normal distribution as well? thanks
