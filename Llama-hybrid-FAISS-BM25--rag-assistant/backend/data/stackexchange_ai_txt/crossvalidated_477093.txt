Can neural networks learn many to one function?

I am thinking of building a secondary Neural Net to train the relation between the hyper-parameters and test set accuracy of my primary Neural Net, so as to maximize it efficiently. And there are 2 ways to approach this: 1). Let the input features be the hyper-parameters(X) and output be the test acc(Y). Then after the network has learned, I can provide the value of test acc and obtain the optimum hyperparams by applying inverted weights and activation functions on Y. But i realized that the relation between X->Y is many to one. Different set of X could give the same value of Y. So is the above method even possible. If the above method isnt possible, then is it plausible to train my NN with X as test acc and Y as the hyperparams and hope it would work?
