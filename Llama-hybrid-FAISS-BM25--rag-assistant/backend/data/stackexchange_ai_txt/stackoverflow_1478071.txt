How do I play a sound in Octave?

Octave appears to assume that a specific sound playing utility will be available on a system but doesn't seem to provide the ability to specify an alternate. In the error below, Octave is looking for ofsndplay , which is not a utility available on all systems. octave:38> sound(beamformed_20) sh: ofsndplay: command not found Is there an Octave configuration setting or code fragment that I can use to specify an system-appropriate utility?
