Check out Django. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. There will be a learning curve, but you might as well learn how to do it right the first time. Go through the documentation, and start building small Django applications. There are tutorials on the Django website. And yes, you will have to learn HTML and CSS anyway. Tables are not evil, by the way. You don't have to learn your first website with CSS, but you will need to learn correct CSS layout sooner rather than later. There are free CSS templates out there you can use, which makes the correct use of CSS much easier.
