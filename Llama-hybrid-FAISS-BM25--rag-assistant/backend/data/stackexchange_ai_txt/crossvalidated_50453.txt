If you want to force a regression line to go through a single point, that can be done in a roundabout way. Let's say your point is $(x_i,y_i)$. You just re-center your data with that point as the origin. That is, you subtract $x_i$ from every $x$-value, and $y_i$ from every $y$-value. Now the point is at the origin of the coordinate plane. Then you simply fit a regression line while suppressing the intercept (forcing the intercept to be (0,0). Because this is a linear transformation, you can easily back-transform everything afterwards if you want to. If you want to force a line to go through two points in an X-Y plane, that's pretty easy to do also. Any two points can be fit with a line. You can use the point-slope formula to calculate your slope, and then use one of the points, the slope, and the equation of a line to find the intercept. Note that it may not be possible to fit a straight line through three points in a coordinate plane. However, we can guarantee that they can be fit perfectly with a parabola (that is, using both $X$ and $X^2$). There is algebra for this too, but as we move up, it might be easier to just fit a model with software by including only those three (more) points in the dataset. Similarly, you could get the straight line that best approximates those three points by fitting a model that has access only to those three points. I feel compelled to mention at this point, however, that this may not be a great thing to do (unless your theory provides very solid reasons for doing so). You may also want to look into Bayesian regression , where you can allow your model to find the best combination of the information in your data, and some prior information (which you could use to strongly bias your intercept towards zero, for example, without quite forcing it).
