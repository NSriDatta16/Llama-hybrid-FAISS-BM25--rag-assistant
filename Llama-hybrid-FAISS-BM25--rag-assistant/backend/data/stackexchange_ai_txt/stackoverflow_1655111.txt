The usual way is to add the following around your header files: #ifndef FOO_H_ #define FOO_H_ #include "baseclass.h" #include "bar.h" class Bar; class Foo : public baseclass { public: bar *varBar; }; #endif and #ifndef BAR_H_ #define BAR_H_ #include "foo.h" class Foo; class Bar { public: Foo *varFoo; }; #endif Most compilers (gcc, VC) also accept #pragma once at the beginning of the file, but I'm pretty sure it is not part of the current C++ standard. EDIT: Sure enough, as the ISO/IEC 14882 states, a #pragma " causes the implementation to behave in an implementation-defined manner. Any pragma that is not recognized by the implementation is ignored. " It is currently still the same with C++0x. So I would stick with the first old-fashioned way of doing that ;-)
