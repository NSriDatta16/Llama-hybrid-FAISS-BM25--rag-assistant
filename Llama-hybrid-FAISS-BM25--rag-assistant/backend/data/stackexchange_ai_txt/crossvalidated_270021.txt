It's important to keep in mind that you are going to have to write down some model for the variances, and as the variances cannot be estimated independently of the means, you will simultaneously need a model for the means. Are you willing to assume that the distribution of measurements within any particular class is normal? I assume so, since you analyzed the data with an anova, but this is an important assumption that affects how you can compare variance between classes. I assume that you want to estimate the class means independently, though there's not enough information in the question to be sure that you don't treat the effect of class as random (rather than fixed). Importantly, decisions like this could affect your inference about the variances! Now that you've narrowed down a model for the means, you need to focus down to a specific model for the data by figuring out how to model the variances. Do you want a model where class variances differ strictly according to some linear predictor (e.g. the variances are given exactly by a linear function of the class size?), or a model where each class has its own independent variance, or a model like the one you describe where the class variances are modeled as a linear regression (with homogeneous normal error) on the class size, or... ? In general, it is hard to get good estimates for variance parameters. MCMC fitting routines often (presumably correctly) yield higher uncertainties for variance parameters than homologous frequentist estimates. Therefore, I suggest that an MCMC fitting routine with vague priors might be the best way to get the inference you seek. The BUGS/JAGS likelihood associated with the linear regression you describe (where class means are estimated separately and class variances come from a linear regression on class size) would look like this: for(i in 1:n_samples){ sample[i] ~ dnorm(mu[class[i]], tau[class[i]]) } for(j in 1:n_classes){ tau[class[i]] Then you want inference on the parameter m . But this is just one highly specific model for a particular form of the means and variances!
