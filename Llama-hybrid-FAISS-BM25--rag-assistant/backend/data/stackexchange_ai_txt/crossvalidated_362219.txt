Other than out of sample error, are there any other ways of comparing goodness of fit of two models, when the models come from different families?

I'm asking this within the context of time series, but the question would apply to any regression type learning problem. It usually specified that using information criteria like the AIC or the BIC to compare different models works only if the models come from the same family of models (e.g all the models are ARIMA models of with different orders, or the models are all regressions with different numbers of regressors, etc...). But what if I want to compare the performance of an ARIMA model and an Exponential Smoothing model and I don't want to (or can't) use out of sample error ? What options do I have, since the AIC or the BIC are no longer valid comparison criteria?
