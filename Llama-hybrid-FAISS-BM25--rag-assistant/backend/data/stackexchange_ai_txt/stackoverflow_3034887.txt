Retro video games programming

I just watched the Super Mario Bros. -1 World glitch in youtube and I really began wondering about the code behind those games. Which language was used? What about the OS for the video games consoles? Are there any website with resources about this subject? (I am a 90s video gamer so I am particularly interested about the programming behind those games but feel free to make this a wiki and include links to resources about video games programming in general, if you want)
