There are two distinct questions in the Kaggle page: "How has crime changed over the years?" For this you can simply plot some time based densities and histograms. "Is it possible to predict where or when a crime will be committed? Which areas of the city have evolved over this time span?" No. You might be able to predict aggregates, like monthly crime rates per zip code or something similar, but you will never be able to forecast when the next individual crime is likely to occur: Such an individual event is just too stochastic to be modeled in any reliable way. At best you might be able to fit a poisson process or do some sort of survival analysis, which would give you an average time before a crime is likely to occur, but even that is a stretch. I would also point out that this is definitely one those situations where just because you can do predictive modeling on a data set doesn't mean you should do predictive modeling a data set. The ethical and social risks of false positives and a biased model in this case far outweigh any planning/resource allocation benefits that might be reaped from predicting the crime rates in advance. Some things are better left "un-modeled".
