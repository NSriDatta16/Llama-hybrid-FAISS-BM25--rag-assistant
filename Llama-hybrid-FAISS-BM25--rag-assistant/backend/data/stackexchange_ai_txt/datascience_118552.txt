Using NLP output for subsequent model?

I use SpaCy to output a vectorized array of my text field. I'm having issues plugging this output into my random forest and could use some guidance. I label encoded other fields so my pandas dataframe looks something like: import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split d = {'le1': [0,1,2,1], 'le2': [3,0,2,1], 'spacy_output':[[0.12,0.14,3.5],[1.21,0.84,1.92],[0.34,0.85,2.43],[0.09,0.18,2.21]], 'response':[0,1,1,0]} df = pd.DataFrame(d) Then I try to plug this into my model: X = np.array(df.drop(response, axis=1)) y = df[response].values.ravel() X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 23) clf = RandomForestClassifier(min_samples_split=4, n_estimators=100, criterion='entropy') clf.fit(X_train,y_train) Confused on how to pass this dataframe to my model. I get the following errors: TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.
