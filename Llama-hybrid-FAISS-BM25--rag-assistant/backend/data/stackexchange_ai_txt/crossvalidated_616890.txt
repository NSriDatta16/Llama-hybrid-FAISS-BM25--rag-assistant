No autocorrelation is not independent. To statistically check if the given time series is autocorrelated you can use Ljung-Box-Test, there is also many other test that have the same target. You can also plot the histogram, the Q-Q-Normal, and the Residuals vs Predicted graph, with those you can visually check if the residuals follow a normal distribution or not.
