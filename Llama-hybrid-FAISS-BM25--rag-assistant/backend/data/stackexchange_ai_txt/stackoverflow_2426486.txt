Many OpenMP implementations start up a gang of threads at program start up and only close it down at finalisation -- ie they don't do a lot of destruction/construction during execution. However, I think this is implementation dependent so you need to check your situation and documentation carefully. No arguing from first principles on this issue -- test ! EDIT: If you find that your implementation does start and stop threads during execution, you can probably wrap the whole program in an omp parallel construct and use master clauses to ensure that the single-threaded parts of the program are not parallelised. This is probably easier if you have an implementation of OpenMP 3.0 than an implementation of the earlier specifications.
