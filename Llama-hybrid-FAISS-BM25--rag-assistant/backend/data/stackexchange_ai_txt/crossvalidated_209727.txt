ARMA when ARIMA should be used

(Note: I am taking a first course in time series -- correct me where I am wrong.) What happens when we fit an ARMA model to a time series when a differenced model (ARIMA with nontrivial $d$), should be used instead? To be precise, consider the following simulation in R: example When I plot the acf of this function, I get the following slowly decaying ACF, which is exactly what we expect from an ARIMA process. I have been taught that this indicates the time series should be differenced. Suppose that I don't and fit an ARMA(1,1) to the data instead. fit Now, if I plot the residuals, they look stationary and well-behaved. Also, here is the ACF and PACF of the residuals for "fit": So the residuals look like white noise, which is what we expect from a ``good'' model. My question is: What was the foul that I made by doing this ARMA fit when I should have differenced the series immediately? I am too inexperienced to detect a flaw in this proposed ARMA(1,1) model. (Maybe there isn't one...)
