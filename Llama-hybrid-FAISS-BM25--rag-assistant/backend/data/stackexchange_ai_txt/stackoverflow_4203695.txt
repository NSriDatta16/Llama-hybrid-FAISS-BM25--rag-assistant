How do I properly use namespaces in vb.net with embedded resources?

I'm having trouble organizing some Crystal Reports into a more manageable structure in a VB.Net winforms project. The reports were all defaulting to the root namespace (in this case 'Reports') and then having names like 'analysisKS3SubjectSummary.rpt', 'analysisKS4SubjectSummary.rpt' etc. To tidy this up I set namespaces for the report classes, and on the 'Custom Tool Namespace' property of the report. These are structured like so: Reports.Analysis.KS3.SubjectSummary Reports.Analysis.KS4.SubjectSummary The namespaces worked fine, but if a report has the same name like above. The project will not build, stating that two embedded resources cannot have the same name. It then displays 'Reports.SubjectSummary' as the error description, but there is no such resource. It looks like its trying to put them back to the root namespace during build. Any idea how I can force the embedded resources to use the proper namespaces given to them? P.S. Apparently this works in C# with no modification required. But I need it to work with VB.
