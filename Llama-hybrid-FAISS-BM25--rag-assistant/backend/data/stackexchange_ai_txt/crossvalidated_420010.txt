There are different ways to forecast time series with machine learning models. No way is generally better than another, so it is necessary to carry out a trial and error process (a.k.a. time series cross-validation) to determine which is the best method for the specific dataset you are using. In the particular case of neural networks, appropriate feature (variable) selection is crucial for accurate forecasting. So try to use an approach that identifies a set of candidate features based on the data characteristics and then select a subset of them using correlation or instance-based feature selection methods. I recommend you read this excellent thesis so that you have a broader view of the methodologies you can use for this problem.
