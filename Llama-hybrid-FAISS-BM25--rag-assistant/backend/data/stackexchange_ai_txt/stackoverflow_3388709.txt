In a pure HTML scenario (as tagged), consider placing your message at the bottom of the page, and using CSS to position it visibly at the top. This should push your warning far enough down the page as to avoid it showing up in typical search results. If your HTML is generated by server script, then you may be able to conditionally present the element based on the client UserAgent. A good search engine user agent list would be convenient in this case.
