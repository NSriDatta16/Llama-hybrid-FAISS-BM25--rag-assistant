Interface Builder Plugin crash with assetLibrary:didFinishDraggingAssets:info:shouldSlideBack:

I created Plugin for providing access to my Frameworks objects. Objects are working good except one controller. When I drag him from library to file arise very interesting assert. Assertion Message: An exception was raised while -[IBLibraryController assetLibrary:didFinishDraggingAssets:info:shouldSlideBack:] was executing. One more interesting thing: if files in .xib window stay in list mode - drugging complete without problems. Even if files stay in icon mode and I do double click on my object in library it go to the .xib file without problems. Every body know why it is happens? I can't find any manuals about IBLibraryController class.
