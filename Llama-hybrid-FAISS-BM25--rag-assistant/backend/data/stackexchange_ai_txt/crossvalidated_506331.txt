Is it acceptable to use Boostrap/Jackknife to estimate the variance of an MAP estimators?

Suppose we obtain a point estimate using a maximum a posteriori estimator $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ . Note that I'm aware Bayesian approaches generally do seek point estimates, but suppose this is an example where a point estimator is specifically needed, and we want to incorporate some prior information using a prior distribution. Then we need some way to quantify the accuracy of our estimator $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ - and suppose that an analytical approach to deriving it is not available. My question is whether it is acceptable to use standard bootstrap or jackknife methods to estimate the variance of $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ ? For example, suppose we obtain thousands of bootstrap resamples, each with a boostrap estimate $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}^b$ , and estimate the standard error of our estimator based off of these boostrap sample estimates. The reason I am confused is that all mentions of stanndard bootstrap/jackknife that I have read consider it solely in the frequentist domain, and I can't really find any reference to normal bootstrap/jackknife when it comes to Bayesian point estimates. Again, I guess this is because Bayesian approaches generally do not seek point estimates over descriptive statistics of the posterior.
