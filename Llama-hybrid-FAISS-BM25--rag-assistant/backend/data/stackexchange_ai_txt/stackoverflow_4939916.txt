Magento payment : additional_information or payment attribute?

I'm wondering which is the better way to add some information to a payment in magento (1.4.1.1). Let's say I want to add an information called "payment_duedate" which would be the date the customer has to pay his invoice. Actually, there is a field in the sales_flat_order_payment called "additional_information" which contain serialized data set by the method setAdditionalInformation($arg1,$arg2); available in the 'sales/payment' model. So I could save my date by : $payment->setAdditionalInformation('payment_duedate',$myDate); $payment->save(); But one could also choose to add a payment attribute, which would have as effect to create a new column called 'payment_duedate' in the 'sales_flat_order_payment' and then save my date by doing : $payment->setPaymentDuedate($myDate); $payment->save(); The main differences are : with the "additional_information method", datas are serialized, and so, not queryable easily. with the "setPaymentDuedate() method", datas are queryable and a new field is created in the table So, in your opinion, which of the two ways is the best ? Thanks, Hugues.
