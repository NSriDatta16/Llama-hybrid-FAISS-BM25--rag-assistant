jQuery drag and drop - how to get at element being dragged

I am using the jQuery library to implement drag and drop. How do I get at the element that is being dragged when it is dropped? I want to get the id of the image inside the div. The following element is dragged: I have the standard dropped function from their example: $(".drop").droppable({ accept: ".block", activeClass: 'droppable-active', hoverClass: 'droppable-hover', drop: function(ev, ui) { } }); I have tried various ui.id etc. which doesn't seem to work.
