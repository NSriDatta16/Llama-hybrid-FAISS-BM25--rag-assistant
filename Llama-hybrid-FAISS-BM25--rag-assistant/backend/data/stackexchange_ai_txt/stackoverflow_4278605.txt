Modelling a NoSQL Forum Application with C# / ASP.net MVC

I'm currently developing a Forum (Question / Answer) based application. Using C# ASP.net MVC and MongoDB for data storage. I'm currently looking at the model. I was thinking of having separate classes like this: (simplified) public class Question { public string ID { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public string Body { get; set; } public List Tags { get; set; } public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; } public string ForumID { get; set; } } Answer public class Answer { public string ID { get; set; } public string QuestionID { get; set; } public string Body { get; set; } public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; } } My questions is: How to handle the "replies" Am I best of having (as in the model above) two separate "entities" Or should I have a List of Answer in my Question model? Some requirements are that i'll need to be able to display a count of answers etc... With this being stored in a NoSQL db, I'm aware I should denormalize things, but how can I insert an answer, without retrieving the entire post? Is that sort of operation possible using NoRM with MongoDB?
