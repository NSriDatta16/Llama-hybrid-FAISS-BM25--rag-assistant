Parse data from multiple XML files and output to csv file

I've got a dozen XML files which contain the results of some wcat web performance tests. Within each XML file there is a data node that contains the names of each page requested and the average time it took to load it. I want to extract that information from each XML file and output it to a csv file so I can create a nice pretty graph in excel. I could do the task in my main working language of C# but in an attempt to improve my scripting skills I'd like to try and do it using unix/cygwin commands or a scripting language such as Ruby. The format of the XML file is: ... lots of other XML junk... Request Name I ... 628 Request Name II ... 793 ... lots of other XML junk... And the csv output I need is: Request,File 1,File 2,...,File 12 Request Name I,628,123,...,789 Request Name II,793,456,...,987 Are there any good cygwin command line utilities that could parse the XML? Or failing that is there a nice way to do it in Ruby?
