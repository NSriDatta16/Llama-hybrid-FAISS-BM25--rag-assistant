You are correct, it is not possible to assign weights to features using an RBF kernel since you work on the dual. Thus, it is not possible to 'put the blame' on specific words. However, you can potentially blame specific documents that SVM with RBF kernel identified as support vectors and make some noise removal at that level, i.e. remove whole documents. An easier alternative might be train the linear classifier, use it to filter out some noise (if you have a way to spot it easily), and then retrain an RBF if that gives you better performance.
