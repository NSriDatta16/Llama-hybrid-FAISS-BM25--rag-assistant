Using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to compare models with different sample size due to NAs

I have database with missing values (NA) so that it is theoretically not possible to use AIC (or AICc) to weight models with different sample size. Would using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) account for this problem? Alternatively I am thinking of using the "full-information maximum likelihood", but I cannot find a library in R that runs linear mixed models with this method. Yet another alternative could be to use an imputation model such as MICE to "fill up" missing values (NAs).
