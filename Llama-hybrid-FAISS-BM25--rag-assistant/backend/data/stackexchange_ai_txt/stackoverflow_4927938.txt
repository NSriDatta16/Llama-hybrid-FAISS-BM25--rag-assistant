AS3: Approach to store MovieClips in a database

I have potentially an interesting situation. I'm developing a dynamic drawing tool using shapes and I need to be able to store the current "state" of the objects in a database. The "shapes" will be simple geometric along with custom-drawn shapes so i can't just store the geometric footprints of them. Here's an example screen shot (simple shapes): During use, these shapes can be dragged, resized, rotated, deleted and split into smaller shapes so their current properties need to be retained. Any ideas? I just need a starting point.
