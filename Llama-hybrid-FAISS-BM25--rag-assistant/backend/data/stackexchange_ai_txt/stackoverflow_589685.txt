For 32-bit systems, the 'de facto' standard is ILP32 — that is, int , long and pointer are all 32-bit quantities. For 64-bit systems, the primary Unix 'de facto' standard is LP64 — long and pointer are 64-bit (but int is 32-bit). The Windows 64-bit standard is LLP64 — long long and pointer are 64-bit (but long and int are both 32-bit). At one time, some Unix systems used an ILP64 organization. None of these de facto standards is legislated by the C standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999), but all are permitted by it. And, by definition, sizeof(char) is 1 , notwithstanding the test in the Perl configure script. Note that there were machines (Crays) where CHAR_BIT was much larger than 8. That meant, IIRC, that sizeof(int) was also 1, because both char and int were 32-bit.
