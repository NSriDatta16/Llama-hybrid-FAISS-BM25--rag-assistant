Predicting time series using `arima` or `fitlm` in Matlab?

I have 6 sequences (time series); they all belong to the same variable. I divide each sequence in two parts having 80% and leaving the last 20% for validation. I am doing the analysis and modelling in Matlab. In the training set (80%): I want to train on 5 sequences using an autoregressive method having a window size of 1 event in order to model the behaviour of the sequences (e.g. sequences 2:5 = $X$) and see whether I can predict the one that is left out (e.g. sequence 1 = $Y$). I want to have the model learning by steps. The dependency would be like $$ Y_n = \text{sd}(X_{n-1}) + \text{mean}(X_{n-1}) $$ For this I am thinking of using the Matlab function arima to estimate the model parameters. I donâ€™t know though how to integrate the modelling of $X$ in arima since the estimation seems to be for $Y$. Q1: Maybe I am not understanding well how to use this? I assume an alternative would be using fitlm to obtain the model between the mean and standard deviation (of all the sequences in the training set) per event in $X_{n-1}$ and the sequence in $Y_n$. Q2: Which of these both methods would be better to take into account the changes from event to event? In the testing set (20%): Once I have the model I would like to use it to test its accuracy on the 20% percent left. I understand that when using fitlm the best would be to use predict or feval and for arima I should use forecast . Q3: Is this correct? Q4: Can anyone point me some simple example or tutorial on how to do this correctly?
