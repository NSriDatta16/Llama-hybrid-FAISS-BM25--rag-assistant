The Web Services Connector for Java Management Extensions (JMX) Agents and the reference implementation ws-jmx-connector would be my choice. JSR 262 will provide a new opportunity for cross-platform/cross-language enterprise integration projects, but development unfortunately has slowed down. It would only require some SOAP calls to invoke all operations of the JMX management interface, IIRC even including callbacks/notifications.
