It's also possible to turn of the swap space of Windows. Only do that when you've got plenty of RAM. Swap space can be found in My Computer/properties/Advanced/Performance/Advanced/Virtual Memory. If you also wish to defrag at some point, do it when the disk is as empty as possible otherwise defrag (which can improve performance) will not work all that well, if at all. Don't forget to activate swap space again afterwards.
