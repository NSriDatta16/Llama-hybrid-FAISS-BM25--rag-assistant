Feature selection for data with both continuous and categorical features?

I am working on a classification problem with 4 ordinal classes to predict, labelling/predicting samples as either a number from 1-4. My training dataset has 284 features by ~40,000 samples and I am looking to explore feature correlation and variance and relate that to using a filtered feature selection method. I've been looking to learn from this guide: https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-real-and-categorical-data/ However, my dataset has predominantly continuous features, but it does have ~5 categorical features. How do I consider both types in my statistics and feature selection method? Is it common to partition the features and explore correlation separately (e.g. select out my categorical feature and use Chi-square, then select my continuous and use ANOVA?). Or should I be transforming either my continuous or categorical variables into the other and applying one statistical method to all features? I aim to be systematic and explore different statistics and selection methods, but I am not sure how I should be accounting for the continuous and categorical variables together or apart. I am new to machine learning (with a biology background) so any help or resources to learn more would be appreciated.
