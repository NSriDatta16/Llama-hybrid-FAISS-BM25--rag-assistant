I figured it out. If you notice in BCStructure, it has a value called name. Whenever I change the name of the node I did not update this value. Then if you notice in the copy() of the Page class, it uses this name variable. Copy gets used in the drag and drop process. If name was not updated, it would be using the old value which is why I saw the behavior I did. Kind of simple to see but hard to explain. Thanks all for your help.
