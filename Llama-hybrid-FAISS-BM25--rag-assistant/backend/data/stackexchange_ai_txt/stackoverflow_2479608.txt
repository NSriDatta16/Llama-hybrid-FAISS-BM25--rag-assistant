Can't type anything in inputs or textareas

I have a problem: I've add a Jquery UI drag-n-drop widget to my page, but after that I can't type anything into inputs or textareas. I use jQuery 1.4.2 and jQuery UI 1.8rc3, and tiny_mce for convert textareas into WYSIWUG editor (I've tried to disable tiny_mce). When I put $("input").click( function(){ alert('clicked!'); }); - it's working(I have an alert). When I get focused to any input I even can't refresh page by F5 and go to the next element by Tab key. There's a page: http://cms.reactive.by/test.htm (click to clip2net.com/clip/m7787/1269022358-clip-3kb.png to see that jQuery UI is workong) And yes.. there's no errors in FireBug. I hope You can help me to understand what's wrong with this code.
