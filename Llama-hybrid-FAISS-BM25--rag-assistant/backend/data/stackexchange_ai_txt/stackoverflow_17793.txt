This is a compiler bug . Here's another post confirming it's a known issue. I've got the same issue in one of my projects and there's no way to prevent it from being triggered unless you have some way of avoiding the use of OdbcParameter. The most conservative way to suppress only the buggy warnings is to use #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable: 4341 ) // code affected by bug #pragma warning( pop )
