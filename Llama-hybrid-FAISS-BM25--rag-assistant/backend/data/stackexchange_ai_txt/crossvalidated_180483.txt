spBayes for non fixed semivariogram parameters

I am considering a Bayesian Gaussian spatial regression model y(s) = x(s) b + w(s) + e where w|theta ~ N(0,k2 H(phi)) e ~ N(0,tau2) Assuming the range phi and the tau2/sigma2 ratio fixed, a normal prior on the regression coefficients b and an inverse gamma on sigma2 reduces the problem to a conjugate Bayesian linear regression problem. Hence no need for MCMC and I can use the bayesGeostatExact function. My question is: if we assume instead that phi and the tau2/sigma2 ratio are NOT fixed we need to specify priors for the spatial parameters as well. Assuming a uniform prior for phi and inverse gamma priors for tau2 and sigma2 ratio makes the conjugacy still hold? I don't understand why in this case we need to use a MCMC simulation (through the spLM function) and there is no equivalent bayesGeostatExact function if the spatial parameters are not fixed. Thanks
