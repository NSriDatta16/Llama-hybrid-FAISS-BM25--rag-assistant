The obvious one is Ragel . whois records are pretty straightforward, have a limited set of key terms and such -- it should be straightforward. And Ragel parsers have proven very efficient. Update As promised. Okay, so why use Ragel ? Basically, anything that can be described as a finite state machine can be described in Ragel, which then generates code for a highly efficient parser. This parser is much faster than a generalized regular expression engine, simply because it has a simpler program than the general parser. Now, you could take this further, for example by using the ABNF Generator here . Then, your description to start with could be as simple as something like WHOIS ::= RECORD* RECORD ::= FIELDNAME ':' FIELDVALUE FIELDVALUE ::= NAMESTRING | IPADDRESS | DOMAINNAME (I make no claim that's particularly ABNF syntax, just a rough BNF.) The point is that you describe the parser in a more or less intuitive form, and let the generator make the exciting code part.
