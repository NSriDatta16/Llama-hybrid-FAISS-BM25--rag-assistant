Using python vs R is more of a personal choice, but most people I know in data science, including myself, use python. If you decide to take up python, almost all of the python ML libraries are written using the OOP approach, hence, some of the API design and interactions (such as error/warning messages) will make more sense if you are familiar with basic OOP concepts. However, you can keep the advanced OOP and OOD for the future.
