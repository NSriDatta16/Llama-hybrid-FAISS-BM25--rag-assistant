problem downloading movie to iphone for storage and playback

I am basically making a video library where you download videos and I then write them to the applications documents folder. This all works fine and if i stream the video from online it plays fine. Or indeed I can stream it from the resource folder fine. However, after downloading it and saving to the documents folder then attempting to stream I get the error 'movie format not supported' any ideas? thanks very much
