Did you try django-compress ? See http://djangopackages.com/grids/g/asset-managers/ for a fairly complete list of available asset managers for Django... If you already are using django-compress, you should have a look at upgrading to django-pipeline, which is a well maintained fork, with a lot of new features. I encourage everyone to who is using django-compress to switch to django-pipeline instead: * django-pipeline documentation
