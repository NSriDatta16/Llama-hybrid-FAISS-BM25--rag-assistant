Is there a way to get YQL to return HTML?

I am trying to use YQL to extract a portion of HTML from a series of web pages. The pages themselves have slightly different structure (so a Yahoo Pipes "Fetch Page" with its "Cut content" feature does not work well) but the fragment I am interested in always has the same class attribute. If I have an HTML page like this: Wolf Dog Cat and use a YQL expression like this: SELECT * FROM html WHERE url="http://example.com/containing-the-fragment-above" AND xpath="//div[@class='foo']" what I get back are the (apparently unordered?) DOM elements, where what I want is the HTML content itself. I've tried SELECT content as well, but that only selects textual content. I want HTML. Is this possible?
