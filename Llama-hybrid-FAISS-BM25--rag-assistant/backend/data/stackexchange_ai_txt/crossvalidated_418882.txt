Monty Hall Problem with a Fallible Monty

Monty had perfect knowledge of whether the Door had a goat behind it (or was empty). This fact allows Player to Double his success rate over time by switching “guesses” to the other Door. What if Monty’s knowledge was less than perfect? What if sometimes the Prize truly WAS in the same Doorway as the Goat? But you could not see it until after you chose and opened YOUR door? Can you please help me to understand how to calculate IF— and by how much — Player can improve his success when Monty’s accuracy rate is less than 100%? For example: what if Monty is wrong — on Average-50% of the time? Can the Player STILL benefit from switching his Guess/Door? I imagine that if Monty has less than 33.3% chance of being correct that Prize is NOT behind the Door, then Player's best option is to NOT Switch his Door choice. Can you please provide me with a way to calculate the potential benefit of switching by inserting different Probabilities of Monty being Correct about the Prize NOT being behind the Door? I have nothing beyond High School math, and am 69 years old, so please be gentle. Thanks for the insights and formulae provided. It appears to be that if "Fallible Monty" is only 66% accurate in predicting the absence of a Prize/Car that there is ZERO benefit to switching from your original choice of doors....because his 33% error rate is the default base rate for the Prize being behind ANY door. One assumes, though, that IF Monty gets better than 66% at predicting where there is NO PRIZE THEN switching derives greater Utility. I will be trying to apply this reasoning to a game where an "Expert" makes an "expert prediction" that one of three roughly equally probable options will be the correct one. I have little faith in the Expert being correct, and I am quite certain that his "hit rate" will be less than 33% - more like 15%. My conclusion from this will be that when the "Expert" chooses a different option from my choice, that it will be beneficial for me to switch my choice to the other option. And, when the Expert chooses the same option as me, I am probably wrong for sure, and should change to one of the other two! ;-)
