Infinite dimensional Gaussian processes have sample functions which span an infinite dimensional space (subspace of Hilbert space of mean square integrable functions). Equivalently, the kernel expansion requires an infinite number of terms (Mercer's theorem). It is possible to have Gaussian random processes with countable or even uncountable index sets whose sample functions span a finite dimensional space, equivalently a kernel expansion with a finite number of terms, and hence are not infinite dimensional. So the previous answers are not correct
