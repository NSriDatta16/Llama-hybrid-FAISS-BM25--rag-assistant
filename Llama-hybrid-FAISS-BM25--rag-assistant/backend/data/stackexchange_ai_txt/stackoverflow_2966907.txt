I would think that sorting on insertion would be better. We are talking O(log N) comparisons here, so say ceil( O(log N) ) + 1 retrieval of the data to sort with. For 2000, it amounts to: 8 What's great about this is that you can buffer the data of the element to be inserted, that's how you only have 8 function calls to actually insert. You may wish to look at some inlining, but do profile before you're sure THIS is the tight spot.
