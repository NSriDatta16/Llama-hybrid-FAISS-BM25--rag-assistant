How replace 2 files?

i have this code snippet private List FolderOne(string Folder) { string filena; DirectoryInfo dir = new DirectoryInfo(Folder); FileInfo[] files = dir.GetFiles("*.mp3", SearchOption.AllDirectories); List str = new List (); foreach (FileInfo file in files) { str.Add(file.FullName); filena = file.FullName; filena.Replace("*.mp3", "*.jpg"); if (filena.Length > 0) { pictureBox1.Image = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(filena.ToString()); //I receive a error "Parameter is not valid." } } return str; } My purpose was to make read the picture box the file.fullname ".mp3" in the same folder but end with ".jpg",infact i have 2 file in a folder the first one is a song "firstsong.mp3" and the second one a picture "firstsong.jpg" the difference between them is the final extension so i try to make read to picturebox the same filename but with extension ".*jpg" and i receive an error "Parameter is not valid." in the line code "pictureBox1.Image = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(filena.ToString());". How i can work out that? Thanks for your attention Nice Regards
