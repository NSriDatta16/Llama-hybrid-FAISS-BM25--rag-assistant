It depends on the model you use. If you are using some generative model, then there is a principled way to deal with missing values (). For example in models like Naive Bayes or Gaussian Processes you would integrate out missing variables, and choose the best option with the remaining variables. For discriminative models it is more elaborate, since that is not possible. There are a number of approaches. Gharamani and Jordan describe a principled approach, where missing values are treated like hidden variables, and a variant of the EM algorithm is used to estimate them. In a similar fashion, Smola et al. describe a variant of the SVM algorithm which explicitly tackles the problem. Note that it is often recommended to substitute the missing values by the mean value of the variable. This is problematic, as described in the first paper. Sometimes, I have come across papers that do regression on the variables to estimate missing values, but I cannot say whether that applies to your case.
