Parsing bounce messages in general is a huge task, because their formats vary greatly between different mail transport agents. So unless you are on a closed network, or you only care for bounces reported directly from your own transport agent, then you are in for a big job, and you certainly cannot count on the original messages being attached in full to the bounce answers. If it is possible for you to regenerate the outgoing mails from a few key parameters, then you might want to consider using a VERP addressing scheme instead. Your parsing job would then be reduced to recognizing and deciphering the recipient addresses of the bounce messages, instead of their full content.
