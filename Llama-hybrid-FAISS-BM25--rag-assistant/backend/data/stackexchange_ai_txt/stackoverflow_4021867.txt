In order to assist you with your question, we first need more information about your configuration and performance metrics. Environment: What Edition of SQL Server are you running? What is the CPU and RAM spec? What is the configuration of your Storage Sub-system? Provide the table schema's and associated index definitions. Provide test code demonstrating how the inserts are performed. Performance: What wait_types are you seeing on the server during your Inserts i.e. what resource is SQL Server waiting on? Are you CPU bound/Disk Bound or perhaps you have page contention. Do the wait_types differ depending on when you run the test with Identity Vs GUID? Initial Hypothesis/Speculation: You may be seeing page contention when performing identity inserts, as the leading column in the index is continually increasing, the contending resource will be the last page in the B-Tree. This is of course only a theory until we have more details from you to work with.
