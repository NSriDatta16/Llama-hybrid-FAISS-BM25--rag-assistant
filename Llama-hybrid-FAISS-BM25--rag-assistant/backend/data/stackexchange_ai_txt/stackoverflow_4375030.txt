Android-Threading: refer to Views from Threads

I've tried to use threads for better performance in my Android App. In the onCreate Method i started two threads: @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.play); ... new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { makeList(); } }).start(); new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { setChronometer(); } }).start(); } In these Methods I change the some settings of my Views. (no heavy events) First a Chronometer: private void setChronometer(){ time.post(new Runnable() { public void run() { time.setFormat("Time: %s"); time.setBase(SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()); time.start(); } }); } Second a ListView : private void makeList(){ ... final ArrayAdapter listAdapter = new ArrayAdapter (...); list.post(new Runnable() { public void run() { list.setAdapter(listAdapter); list.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() { public void onItemClick(AdapterView parent, View view, int position, long id) { .... } }); } The Chronometer works fine, but the operations in makeList() weren't done.. so my ListView isn't working! I had the idea,that when the activity starts, defining the listView and Chronometer is less important, so i defer them in threads, with the aim, that the activity starts faster (is more performat) First of all, was this a good Idea? Secondly, why is my ListView not working? When i remove the list.post(new Runnable() { it works, but i thought that wasn't a good way in android. Cause now the Views are directy changed from a thread. Thirdly, when should i use Threads vs.View.post ? Any help would be great, Thanks! Greetings FireDragon
