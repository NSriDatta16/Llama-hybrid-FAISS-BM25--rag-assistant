The problem seems to be suited for some kind of PCA analysis. You'll represent your series $x_{it}$ where $i$ is the place and $t$ - time as follows: $$x_{it}=\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} f_{jt}C_{j}$$ where $f_{jt}$ are not correlated, i.e. $Corr[f_{jt},f_{kt}]=\delta_{jk}$ However, $f_{jt}$ are autocorrelated, i.e. $Cov[f_{jt},f_{j,t+1}]\ne 0$ Since, the factors are not correlated you can add up their variances, i.e. uncertainties in your language. So, this trick may allow you to keep treating the components separately without worrying about correlations. PCA is often used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Your temperatures are very correlated, so you may not need all $n_i$ factors, but use first couple of them. However, that would be an additional benefit in your case, it seems. You will use PCA to deal with correlations.
