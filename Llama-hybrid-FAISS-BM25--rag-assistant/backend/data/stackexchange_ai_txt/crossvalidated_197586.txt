When is Bayesian Inference, more helpful than naive frequentist updating over a stream?

When is Bayesian Inference more helpful than naive updating by prior evidence, for a prediction task over a stream? Imagine a stream of data accumulating over time. And there are no a-priori assumed parameters which experts attribute very high certainty to (maybe only some assumptions here and there, which are more intuitive than believed by experts). A humble amount of evidence has accumulated already, not large enough for other kinds of machine learning. Why is it then not efficient/helpful/sensible to directly assume the so-far observed probability, in its frequentist sense, and thereafter repeat this naive update ongoing or on interval, rather than using Bayesian inference?
