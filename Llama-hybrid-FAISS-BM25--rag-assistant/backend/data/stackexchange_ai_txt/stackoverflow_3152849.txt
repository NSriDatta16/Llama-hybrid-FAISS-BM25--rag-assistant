The best resource for finding out what's different between PHP 4 and PHP 5 is the official migration guide . Most well-written PHP 4 code will run unmodified under PHP 5. Most average PHP 4 code will run under PHP 5 with either some settings changes or small code changes. The biggest and most important difference is that PHP 4 was end-of-lifed at the end of 2007 . You should not be running PHP 4 today, it has not been maintained since 2007. Please upgrade, PHP 5 was released in 2004. If you're on a commercial hosting provider, please ask them about upgrading PHP. If they are unable or unwilling to upgrade you to PHP 5, drop them like a rock.
