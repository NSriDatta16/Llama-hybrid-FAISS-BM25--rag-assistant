Dot net is basically a write/copy of Java. In the late 90's Microsoft attempted to add some Windows extras to Java. The com and winforms support baked in dot net are quite clearly necessary for Microsoft to leverage their investment in those respective technologies. A better way to answer the question is perhaps to ask Why Microsoft felt the need to reinvent Java. The brief simple answer is because Microsoft wanted to drive the direction and capabilities of the platform so that it worked well with Windows. Features like Pinvoke thing and its liberal use will always mean that when Office or Visual Studio when they are written in c# will only work on Windows - vendor lockin. The close pedigree between Java and Dot net is clearly evident with so many things being copied across - NHibernate, NSpring. Is ASP MVC a copy of Struts + JSP albeit with some little extras ?
