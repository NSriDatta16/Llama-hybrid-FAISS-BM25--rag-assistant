Cosmetic web bugs involving styling in various browser O/S configurations, e.g. a page looks fine in Windows and Mac in Firefox and IE but on the Mac in Safari something gets messed up. These are annoying sometimes because they require so much attention to detail and making the change to fix Safari may break something in Firefox or IE so one has to tread carefully and realize that the styling may be a series of hacks to fix page after page. I'd say those are my nastiest ones that sometimes just don't get fixed as they aren't viewed as important.
