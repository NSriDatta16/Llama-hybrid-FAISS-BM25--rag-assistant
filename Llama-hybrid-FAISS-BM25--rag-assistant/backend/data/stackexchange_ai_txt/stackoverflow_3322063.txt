Take a look at Solr. It's the fastest way to get up and running with a Lucene-powered search server. It'll provide additional features like faceting and plumbing for document pre-processing when indexing. Solr also provides a lot of room for scaling as your site grows via both sharding & replication. There seems to be plenty of bindings for Ruby (I'm more of a PHP guy so I can comment on their usefulness). Solr exposes a rich REST API you could leverage easily too. One thing to consider carefully with Solr is how to deal with search index updates. Batch vs near real-time index updates may affect your strategy. You'll want to define your app's requirements in this regard ahead of time.
