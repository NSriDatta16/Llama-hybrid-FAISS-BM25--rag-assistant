This is a really good question. Unfortunately, there's no sure-fire way of doing this, but you have two basic options: Calculate ahead of time the average space used per given time unit at a given bitrate, based on experimentation or data from the codec provider. Start by using technique #1, but then also create a mechanism for determining the average space being used during a given recording, by dividing the space currently in use by the file from the total recording time. Then, use this metric to determine the amount of time remaining. Option 1 is a quick and easy way to get started. Option 2 requires a bit more programming, but your estimate will be substantially more accurate. After all, compression in these instances is based on what you are recording. Recording a solid green screen for 1 hour takes substantially less disk than recording a moving background with continuously changing foreground, or maybe a fractal sequence. There's no way to do a good estimate ahead of time.
