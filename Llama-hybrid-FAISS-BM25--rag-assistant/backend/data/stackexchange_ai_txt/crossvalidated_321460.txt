Dice-coefficient loss function vs cross-entropy

When training a pixel segmentation neural network, such as a fully convolutional network, how do you make the decision to use the cross-entropy loss function versus Dice-coefficient loss function? I realize this is a short question, but not quite sure what other information to provide. I looked at a bunch of documentation about the two loss functions but am not able to get a intuitive sense of when to use one over the other.
