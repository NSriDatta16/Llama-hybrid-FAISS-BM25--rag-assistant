static methods and unit tests

I've been reading that static methods tend to be avoided when using TDD because they tend to be hard to mock. I find though, that the easiest thing to unit test is a static method that has simple functionality. Don't have to instantiate any classes, encourages methods that a simple, do one thing, are "standalone" etc. Can someone explain this discrepancy between TDD best practices and pragmatic ease? thanks, A
