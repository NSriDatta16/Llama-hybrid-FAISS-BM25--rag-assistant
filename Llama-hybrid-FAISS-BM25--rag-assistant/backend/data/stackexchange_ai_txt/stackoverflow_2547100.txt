Can you add subfolder to layout in Eclipse Android project?

When I create a subfolder in the layout folder, and drag an xml file to it, the generated R file doesn't seem to show the subfolder. a) is there a way to change that b) is the file and file structure still picked up by SVN and c) so, if I do it that way, can I still just refer to the object using layout?
