There's nothing I can see from the code that would indicate to me a problem. At this point, I would drag and drop a new DBUser object onto your DBML file (rename it DBUser2), execute this code, and watch it work. Having working code, I would then check for the differences between the two entities. This is going to be something non-obvious. Also, click "Run Custom Tool" on your DBML file and watch your Errors/Warnings window for any warnings -- SqlMetal might just tell you what's wrong in the form of a warning.
