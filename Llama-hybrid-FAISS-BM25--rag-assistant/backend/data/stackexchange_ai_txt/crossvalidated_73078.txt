Modeling what should be a logistic regression but has no negative responses

I have a data set of reported food-borne illnesses and we're trying to determine what environmental conditions during food cultivation led to high bacterial counts in the food, and thus caused the illnesses. Unfortunately, I only have data of foods that caused confirmed illnesses. I requested that we go back and "randomly" sample from food tags that did not cause a reported illness but am not allowed to do so for various reasons. Even that would have had problems (because just because an illness is not reported doesn't mean it didn't occur), but at least this would have given me some negative observations. I was originally planning to model these data using a logistic regression but I am stuck at what to do now. Without negative observations, I can only really provide univariate descriptive statistics, right? I'm hoping that someone else has had this problem and perhaps there's some model I haven't heard of before that can handle this. Thank you.
