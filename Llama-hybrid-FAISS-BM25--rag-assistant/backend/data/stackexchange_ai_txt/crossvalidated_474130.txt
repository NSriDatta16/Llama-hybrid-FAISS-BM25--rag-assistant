Can you cross validate a regression model using supervised learning?

Our team created a regression model based on a select data size/parameter and achieved a good C-statistic (area under ROC curve). We faced a few difficulties with submission for publication, so I added a machine learning component to support our model. The model was trained using the same data size/parameters split randomly, kind of like K-fold cross validation and the idea is to show that a supervised learning model using the same parameters achieves a worse/equal C-statistic as our original model. My question is, is this a legitimate way to support our regression model? I had never seen someone use machine learning to support a regression model. Furthermore, can I say the supervised learning cross validate/validate the regression, or should I use more general wording (support/ strengthen) to avoid confusion?
