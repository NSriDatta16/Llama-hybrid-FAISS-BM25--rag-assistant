Your time series is probably stationary. The output charts are on different scales which makes the trends angle look sharper than it is (the bar on the right reflects how much the scale is increased in each chart) if you look at the top chart, it ranges between 0 to 0.15 whereas the trend chart has a scale ranging from 0.04 to 0.055. If you plot the trend on the same scale as the raw series it will probably look completely flat...
