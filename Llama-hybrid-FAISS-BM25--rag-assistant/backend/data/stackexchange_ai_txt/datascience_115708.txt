How to smooth noisy data set?

I have a univariate dataset that is locally jagged (lots of ups and downs) that I need to smooth. I've also tried polynomial features with linear regression, but because the curve is extremely non-linear, I couldn't get the curve to fit properly no matter how I raise the degree. I'm basically looking to overfit the model, something like an exponential moving averages but without the lag. Random forest regressors is a little too jagged; I've looked at splines from scipy but they just give back my original points since I'm not looking to interpolate. Is there anything else I could try?
