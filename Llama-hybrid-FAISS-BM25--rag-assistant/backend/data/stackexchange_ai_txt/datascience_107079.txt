Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is not very useful for that type of interpretation. Just imagine you are in a shoe store and sell addidas, nike, puma etc, and you want to figure out which of those is your times worth and you get the best out of and how to push them to become your ideal supplier. It would be more useful to frame it as a supervised learning problem and find the feature and instances that are most associated with the target values.
