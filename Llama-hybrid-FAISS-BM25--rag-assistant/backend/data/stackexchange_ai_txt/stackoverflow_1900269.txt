What's the best way to deploy an executable process on a web server?

The original question: The title of this question might be a bit clumsily phrased, but here's the situation: I have a .NET web project deployed on my server. It's still in beta, so there's a lot of releasing and re-releasing happening. I have also written a C# executable in the same VS solution (call it "admin.exe") that runs in the background on the server, periodically performing certain business rule integrity checks and making appropriate insertions to a warning table in the DB. Question is: what's the best way to deploy this app so that it gets updated whenever I make a new release? It should be running all the time in between releases, so ideally I'd like some sort of setup whereby the shutdown-deploy-startup process involves the minimum possible number of steps. Thanks! Edit - Bounty started The answers given thus far have been helpful and interesting, but haven't provided me with a clear, concise and elegant solution. Please do not assume I have extensive knowledge of deployment projects, because I don't. Bounty goes to the person who can provide a solution that does the following: Publish the latest version of the web site; Shut down any instances of admin.exe that are running on the server; Update admin.exe; Launch admin.exe; All of the above should be done preferably in one step, or as few steps as possible, seeing as it will be done repeatedly throughout the life of the product; and All of the above should be done preferably without requiring installation of any 3rd party software. Thank you for your help! Minor edit - clarification I think a lot of the solutions offered thus far have overestimated the complexity of the problem, so let me clarify: everything that is to be deployed, only has to be deployed on one computer, which also happily has Visual Studio available with all source code. I only need to (1) publish the web site to the web folder, and (2) shut down, reinstall and restart admin.exe on the same server. Isn't there a simple way of doing this in one step? Can it be done with a VS Deployment project?
