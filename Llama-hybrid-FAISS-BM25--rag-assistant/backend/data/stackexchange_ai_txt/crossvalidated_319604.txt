Linear regression, independent variable stationarity

If we have classical linear regression model, and one of the regressors is time series (e.g. GDP), is it necessary for that variable to be stationary? Well i do not think so, because diversity in values yields to better results when we talk about linear regression, but I encounter different opinions.
