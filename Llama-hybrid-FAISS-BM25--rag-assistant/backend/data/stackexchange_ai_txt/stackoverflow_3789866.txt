Using natural keys as part of equals and hashCode

I know that this topic has been discussed umpteen number of times, but still need some clarifications on the issue we are facing. Hibernate best practices talk about using natural keys for the equals / hashCode methods. We do have a composite key which consists of 2 parameters (say String name, Organization org) to which a particular object belongs. Unfortunately I can't use org since it is lazily loaded and leads to other issues and I don't want to create a surrogate key either (maybe auto generated from the database or a UUID created via an API call prior to object creation). What kind of options do I really have since in the above Object (name, org) fields are unique and I can't just write my logic just based on the name field itself. Is surrogate key the only option, does this mean I have to store this value as part of each row in the table?
