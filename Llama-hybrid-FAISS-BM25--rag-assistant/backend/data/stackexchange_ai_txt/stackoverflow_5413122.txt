Showing many markers in Google Maps

I have this map and want to display a whole bunch of markers. But I need to find a way of showing this in an orderly fashion, and well... something cool would be nice. Good thing is that Google Maps has many cool features. But I am new to its use and most likely not aware of cool options to organize markers and content. I just stumbled upon one neat way, which I will post below. But in order to learn about solutions that others have found / created, my question is: what are cool ways of showing a large group of markers?
