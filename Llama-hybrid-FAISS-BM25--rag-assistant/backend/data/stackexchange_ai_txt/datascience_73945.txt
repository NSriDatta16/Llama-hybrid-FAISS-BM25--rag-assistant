Output vector size of a LSTM

Is the size of the output vector of all machine learning algorithms the same? Can't an ML algorithm predict only one value as output? I have trained an LSTM network with X, Y, heading, speed(from taxi sensor) against feature_x, feature_y. So given a point, I can predict the next one. Given the LSTM is many-to-one type how does it produce two values as output(x,y)? Could an MLP also do that?
