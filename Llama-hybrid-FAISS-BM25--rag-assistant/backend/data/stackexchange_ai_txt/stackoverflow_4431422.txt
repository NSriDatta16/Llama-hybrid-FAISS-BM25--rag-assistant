Re-organizing in org-mode

In org-mode, I have a simple list of items, with multiple tags (C-c C-c). I like convert this in such a way that I can display each tag as different header and see the items under that tag. For example, if I have tags 'company' and 'fruit' applied to the item 'apple' , then I like to see 'company' and 'fruit' as header and see the 'apple' as item under both of them. I have many other items and I like to combine them. So I can have all fruits under 'fruit' header etc..
