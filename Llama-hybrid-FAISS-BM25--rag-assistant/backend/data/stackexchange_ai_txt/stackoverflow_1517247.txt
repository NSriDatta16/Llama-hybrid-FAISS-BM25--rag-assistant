You should not write something that's already in Rails itself! You can easily leverage Rails' caching methods to put your query results in Memcached (or what ever caching framework you configured): class ArticleController 30.minutes) do Article.find(:all, :include => :comments) end end end BTW. the :expires_in is optional. You can leave the cache 'forever' or expire it manually. Second example, as by my comment: class ArticleController 30.minutes) do Article.find(:all, :include => :comments, :conditions => { :page_id => @page.id}) end end end This will cache the articles and comments for a given @page object.
