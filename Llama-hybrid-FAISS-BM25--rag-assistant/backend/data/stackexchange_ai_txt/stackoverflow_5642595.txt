Ants Profiler is very good: http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-performance-profiler/ Also I like dotTrace: http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/ Ants is more robust but dotTrace's company support is awesome :) Also, with dotTrace, if you are doing opensource projects, then you can qualify for an OpenSource license. They also have frequent updates and they still support .netCF (For VS 2008. Not important to you, but shows they care and support all the Windows Platforms) EDIT: Here are 2 screenshots of a project I'm working on, profiled in dotTrace. As you can from the first image, you get the call tree, organized by threads. It shows the inclusive time and the inclusive run percentage of each method and sub methods. In this picture you see the exclusive run time, number of calls and in the lower panel, the functions that called the selected method (in the top panel) and the number of calls and recursive calls. I am not affiliated with jetbrains, but I have several opensource projects and they have given me free licenses because of them. For that reason I really like the company. Hope this helps! (Oh, and I have the Professional version. I'm not sure what the other version have or don't have)
