The classical statistical answer is that if the selection process is in the data and described by the model or selection is at random then the parametrical model contemplates it correctly. See Donald Rubin paper Inference and Missing data (1976). You do need to include the mechanism of data selection in your model. This is a field where parametric inference should do better than pure machine learning.
