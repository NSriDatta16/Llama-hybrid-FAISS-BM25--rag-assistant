If you assume a uniform prior on $\beta$, then the posterior for $\beta$ is $$ \beta|y \sim N(\hat{\beta},V_\beta). $$ with $$\hat{\beta} = [X'\Sigma^{-1}X]X'y \quad \mbox{and} \quad V_\beta =[X'\Sigma^{-1}X]^{-1}.$$ To find the predictive distribution, we need more information. If $\tilde{y} \sim N(\tilde{X}\beta,\tilde{\Sigma})$ and is conditionally independent of $y$ given $\beta$, then $$ \tilde{y}|y \sim N(\tilde{X}\hat{\beta}, \tilde{\Sigma} + V_\beta).$$ But typically for these types of models, $y$ and $\tilde{y}$ are not conditionally independent, instead, we typically have $$ \left( \begin{array}{c} y \\ \tilde{y} \end{array} \right) \sim N\left( \left[\begin{array}{c} X\beta \\ \tilde{X}\beta \end{array}\right], \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \Sigma & \Sigma_{12} \\ \Sigma_{21} & \tilde{\Sigma} \end{array} \right]\right). $$ If this is the case, then $$ \tilde{y}|y \sim N(\tilde{X}\hat{\beta} + \Sigma_{21}\Sigma^{-1}(y-X\hat{\beta}), \tilde{\Sigma} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma^{-1}\Sigma_{12}). $$ This assumes $\Sigma, \Sigma_{12},$ and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ are all known. As you point out, typically they are unknown and need to be estimated. For the common models that have this structure, e.g. time series and spatial models, there generally won't be a closed form for the predictive distribution.
