If it is for an organisation, having internal wiki page (or something similar) could help. If it is only for you (and anyone that's interested), write a blog, favourite snippets on internet etc. For code, a good approach (in both cases: organisation and yourself) is to keep something I call "Utilities Library". Each piece of code I like usually fits into one of the problem scopes / namespaces of the library. This way, over time, you have a neat code base that allows you to not to invent the weel again. Of course, after couple of months or years the library needs documentation to find anything in there :)
