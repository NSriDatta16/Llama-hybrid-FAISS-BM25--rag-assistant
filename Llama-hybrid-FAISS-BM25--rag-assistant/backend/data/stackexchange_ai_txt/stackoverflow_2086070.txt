I would start by seeing what response I got from something simple like wget or using a tool like http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler to test the response and check any headers you are getting back. Sometimes sites will return different responses from different agent strings and so on, so you may need to adjust your request headers and masquerade as a different browser to get the data you are looking for. If you are using Fiddler on the same machine that is running the script you should be able to see exactly what is different between a request for the page from your browser and a request for the page from your script. There may even be a simple 302 redirect or something like that going on that your code isn't following. If you can access the page with a browser then you will definitely be able to access it by sending exactly the same request as your browser would send. Edit- Fiddler is slightly trickier to use from your own code because it behaves as a proxy- it sets itself up with regular browsers, but you would manually have to tell your code to run through a proxy on 127.0.0.1 port 8888 in order for Fiddler to see your results.
