Android open file I wrote to cache

I am trying to read a file I already created in the application's cache directory yes I used File (java.io.File) to create the file in the cache directory, I use file to check to see if the created file exists but in another class I need to open that file (a class that isn't called unless the file exists), I want to use openFileInput(String filename) but openFileInput doesn't allow file paths! it also doesn't default to the cache directory, what a conundrum! (using debugger to watch all the various exceptions that openFileInput will throw, it either gives file not found or illegal arguments when a path name is input) I need another way to get at this file. Everything worked when I was reading and writing to storage, but I need to use cache.
