There are a number of steps you need to go through to achieve your goal, Breaking them up and learning each will help with your attention span (no disrespect I have the same problem) Steps required to achieve your goal Connect to MySql database - see documentation on mysql_connect and mysql_select_db Validate your input (ensure you have a valid Hardware ID) Prepare a query - I would suggest something like $Sql=sprintf("Select [columnName] from [tableName] where [columnName]=%s", mysql_escape_string($hardwareID)); get the recordset back by using mysql_query($sql) -see documentation on php.net 5.Check see if it is empty mysql_num_rows() if so exit script Hope that helps a resource I would point you at would be http://tuxradar.com/practicalphp particularly Chapter 9 All as others have put above really I was a little slow typing :)
