Collapse z-scores from non-normal data?

I have a data set in which I want to combine 4 variables into one scale. The variables are open ended questions (e.g., How much would you be willing to pay for ...) and thus non-normally distributed. Usually, I would calculate z-scores and average across the variables to receive a single scale score. But does that also work with non-normal data? Any help is highly appreciated! Thanks!
