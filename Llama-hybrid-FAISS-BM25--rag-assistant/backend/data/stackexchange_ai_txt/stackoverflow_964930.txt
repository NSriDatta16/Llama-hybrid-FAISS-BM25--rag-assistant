It appears to be simplest to sync all tournament results to all iPhones in the tournament. You can do it during every game: before a game, if the databases of two phones contradict each other, the warning is shown. If the User A falsifies the result if his game with User B, this result will propagate until B eventually sees it with the warning that A's data don't match with his phone. He then can go and beat up explain to A that his behavior isn't right, just the way it is in real life if somebody cheats. When you compute the final tournament results, show the warning, name names, and throw out all games with contradictory results. This takes away the incentive to cheat. As said before, encryption won't solve the problem since you can't trust the client. Even if your average person can't use disassembler, all it takes is one motivated person and whatever encryption you have will be broken.
