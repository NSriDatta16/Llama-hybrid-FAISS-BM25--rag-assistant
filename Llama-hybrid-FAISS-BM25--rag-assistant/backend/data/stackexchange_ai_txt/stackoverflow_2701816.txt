You should change the signature of startButtonClicked to - (void)startButtonClicked:(UIGestureRegognizer *)gestureRecognizer and then query the gesture recognizer's state property in the method. The gesture recognizer will call its action method multiple times with different states (e.g. UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan and UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded ).
