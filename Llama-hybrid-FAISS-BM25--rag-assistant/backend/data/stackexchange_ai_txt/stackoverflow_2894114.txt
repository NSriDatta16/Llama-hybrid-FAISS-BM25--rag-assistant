The thing that you must learn is that you don't need to be on the bleeding edge of every technology. In fact I would recommend not learning any new technology until it's been out(and mainstream-ish) for at least a year. Things do move quickly but the amazing thing is that just because a new version is released of Rails or PHP doesn't mean the old version is removed from all eternity. Learn at your own pace. It's ok that you're not compiling Rails3 from source with Ruby 1.9.3-head even though some people are off bragging about all the awesome features.
