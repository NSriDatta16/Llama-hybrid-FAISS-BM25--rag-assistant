One perhaps more pragmatic approach is to have zero defects on the trunk, and branch for all development, then having daily builds is possible on both the trunk and branches, but zero defects does not apply to dev branches. While there may still be a certain level of stigma from having your branch breaking its builds, it is less of a problem than breaking the trunk.
