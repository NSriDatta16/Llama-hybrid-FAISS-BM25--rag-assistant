In servlet 3.0, certain static resources are available through the web context, such as .css, java script, and .png files, so you no longer need to use ServletContext getResource() and getResourceAsStream(). For more information, check out web-fragment.xml ( https://blogs.oracle.com/swchan/entry/servlet_3_0_web_fragment ) which is one resource that covers this subject. Personally, I prefer to structure my projects the way Maven likes them, with a src/main/resources directory which is part of the application's classpath.
