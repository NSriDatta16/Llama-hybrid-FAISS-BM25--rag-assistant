So you weighted the weights by themselves? Then the same concept applies; imagine the numbers from the "Weighted" column as the ones in the "To_Weight" column. You said yourself that you expected the weighted average of To_Weight to be different from the unweighted average of To_Weight. The same can apply for any set of numbers you put into the "To_Weight" column, even the ones from the "Weighted" column. Generally the weighted average (ie. weights are not 1) of any set of numbers can very different from the unweighted average, even if the set of numbers is the weights themselves.
