The log of the likelihood for a random sample from that distribution is $$\text{logL}=\sum _{i=1}^n \log \left(\sin \left(\frac{\pi (x_i-a)}{b}\right)\right)-n \log (b)-n \log (2)+n \log (\pi )$$ So we choose values of $a$ and $b$ to maximize the likelihood. We'll need to do this in an iterative manner and need good starting values. The mean and variance of Gilbert's Sine distribution are $a+b/2$ and $\frac{\left(\pi ^2-8\right) b^2}{4 \pi ^2}$ , respectively. The method of moments estimators are then found by equating the theoretical moments and the sample moments so that $$a_0=\bar{x}-\frac{\pi s}{\sqrt{\pi ^2-8}}$$ $$b_0=\frac{2 \pi s}{\sqrt{\pi ^2-8}}$$ where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the sample standard deviation. These two values can be used for starting values in the iterative procedure that finds the maximum likelihood estimates. (Probably a safer set of starting values would be $\min\left(\min(x),a_0\right)$ and $\max\left(\max(x)-\min(x),b_0\right)$ , respectively, but I'll ignore that for now.) Some R code to generate a random sample and then find the maximum likelihood estimates of $a$ and $b$ . # Set values for a and b a max(x)) { -n*log(2) - n*log(b) + n*log(pi) + sum(log(sin(pi*(-a + x)/b))) } else { -10^200 } } # Find maximum of log likelihood # Starting values a0 $par[1], " \t", covmat[1,1]^0.5, "\n", "b\t\t", results$ par[2], " \t", covmat[2,2]^0.5, "\n", sep="") #Parameter Estimate Std. Err. #a 2.950283 0.0577424 #b 2.120144 0.1106378 Whatever optimization routine you use, good starting values are your friends. The method-of-moments estimator should work most of the time. If you use optim in R and the "L-BFGS-B" method, this restricts the possible parameter values to a rectangular region but the values that are legitimate are in a "triangular" region so one could possibly end up with estimates that aren't supported by the data and probability model. Here's how that triangular region is constructed:
