Brian is right. The formulas are quite simple. If you want your solution to be a good one, you'll pay attention to roundoff error. If you just let roundoff error accumulate and propagate you can off by several cents at the end of the schedule. With careful programming, you'll minimize the error. Also, if you have MS Excel on your computer, you can download an amortization template from MS office online.
