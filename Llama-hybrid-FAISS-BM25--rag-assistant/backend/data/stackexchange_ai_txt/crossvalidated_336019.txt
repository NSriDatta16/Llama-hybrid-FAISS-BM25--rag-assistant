I don't think there is a good way to deseasonalize based on a linear model. You may want to look at Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman & Atahanasopoulos , specifically the chapter on decomposition , and think about applying a moving average to extract the trend-cycle components, but you would need a rather wide kernel to account for your triple seasonality. Or apply single exponential smoothing with a small smoothing parameter to the same effect. However, you still only have two outer (yearly) cycles - that's not a lot to estimate and remove the seasonality. An alternative would be to apply an algorithm to your data that is specifically built to deal with the multiple-seasonalities involved, e.g., bats or tbats , both available in the forecast package. Unfortunately, tbats() does not converge for me, and bats() runs for a long time, but you may want to look for some inspiration into the original paper by De Livera, Hyndman & Snyder ( JASA , 2011) .
