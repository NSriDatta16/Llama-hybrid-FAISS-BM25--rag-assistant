There's no better way than reading good papers. Go to Google Scholar or arXiv where you can find any kind of scientific paper. The problem is that you may not know which ones are good ones. So, look up the most cited papers, they're usually good. For instance, if you search for "linear regression" in Google Scholar one of the top hits is "Leggetter, Christopher J., and Philip C. Woodland. "Maximum likelihood linear regression for speaker adaptation of continuous density hidden Markov models." Computer Speech & Language 9.2 (1995): 171-185." with currently 2690 citations. I haven't read the paper but it must be good if 2690 papers cited it. Once you get a feel of how good papers look like, you may look for resources which suggest you how to write and format papers. There's a ton of them out there. I'd recommend reading this paper: Mathematical Writin g by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts. It's short and covers a lot of ground. Knuth is the author of TeX system, which is the most popular scientific typesetting software. He wrote a lot of great papers and books.
