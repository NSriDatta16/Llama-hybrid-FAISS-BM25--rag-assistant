Should I mix PCA and non PCA variables in a logistic regression model?

I have a dataset that is used to predict birth weights of babies. I have completed PCA on the parents attributes and have used that as one new combined PCA variable ParentsAttributes. I am using this column plus other original attributes related to the baby to predict it's birthweight. My question is, is the above a correct approach or if I am using PCA should I use it on all variables?
