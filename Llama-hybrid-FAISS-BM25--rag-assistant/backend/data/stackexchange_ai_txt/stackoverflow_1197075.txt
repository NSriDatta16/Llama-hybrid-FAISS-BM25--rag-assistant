Selenium RC Tests + Unit Tests using PHPUnit throws a Seg Fault

So I have a set of unit/integration tests and a set of selenium rc tests as part of my suite. When I run them together using PHPUnit I get a Segmentation fault error message at the very end of the run when, during normal operation, it starts to generate log files. The interesting part is, if I run just the unit tests, or just the selenium rc tests everything works fine. I'm reasonably certain it's not a problem with my code-base because I can visually see all my tests passing. As I said, the error occurs during the results generation phase. I'm using code-coverage for the unit tests but NOT for the selenium tests (by leaving the $coverageScriptUrl property empty in my selenium objects). I'm really grasping at straws here because I've never had to diagnose an error with no file or line number. Is there some place I check for some more information? Can someone point me in the right direction? The php error log is empty. Any ideas?
