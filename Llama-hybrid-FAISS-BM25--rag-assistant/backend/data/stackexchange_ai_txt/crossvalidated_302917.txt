$\chi^2$ of $\chi^2$ as a function of a variable

I am currently measuring some unknown quantities from a discrete distribution of known quantities. This is achieved by taking a measured distribution, generating a Monte Carlo simulation of this distribution, and minimising the $\chi^2$ (Chi-Square) between data and simulation until the unknown values are measured. Explanation: My question relates to the nuisance parameters of the fit, which must also be calculated. These are particularly important, as the distribution is measured as a histogram and changes in the nuisance parameters result in movement of points between the bins, which consequently contribute to imperfections in the measurement of the Chi Square. There are too many free parameters to feasibly fit in a reasonable period of time. The currently accepted solution to this in my group is the following: Minimise the $\chi^2$ for whichever parameters do not require a new simulation; Fix all parameters except one and calculate the $\chi^2$ between data and a new MC with a changed nuisance parameter. This is carried out as a scan $Â±2 \sigma$ through the parameter space. Fit a 2D Polynomial to the plot of the points ($\chi^2$ vs sigmas from the last minimum) and find the minimum; Set this minimum to be the new nuisance parameter; Repeat 1-4 for all parameters until the minima have moved less than 0.1 $\sigma$. Some of the parameters are very sensitive to the error on the MC, which scales as $\sqrt{N}$, and jitter at the minimum if an insufficient amount of MC data is used due to the aforementioned bin migration. However, the amount of jitter is different for each parameter: one size does not fit all. On the other hand, this process is time consuming and it is senseless to use a lot of processing time to generate an entirely new MC for a nuisance parameter that does not need it. Question: I must come up with a method of measuring whether this jitter is at an 'acceptable' level for a given parameter, in order to balance time and quality of fits. My current best solution is to measure the goodness-of-fit of the 2D Polynomial on the distribution of Chi-squares vs the parameter (Measuring the Chi-square of a fit to a distribution of Chi-squares), but this is fruitless as I do not know the error on the Chi-square itself. Is there a smarter, more elegant statistical solution that can be offered to this conundrum? EDIT: When I say I 'generate a new MC', what I mean is that I apply different criteria to a pre-generated set of numbers and obtain a different resulting distribution.
