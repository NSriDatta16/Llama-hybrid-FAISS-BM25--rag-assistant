The problem here is what is called separation. For one level of your predictor (age) you have zero occurrences of one level of your outcome (collagen). The program is driving its estimate of the coefficient upwards to infinity and in this case stopping at an arbitrary value which as you point out when exponentiated gives you a very large odds ratio. What you do about it is really a substantive question to do with the underlying science rather than a statistical one. Added as edit You ask what separation means. In logistic regression it means that for some value of the predictor (or some linear combination of the predictors) only one value of the outcome occurs. You have a variant of this because you are using an ordinal model rather than logistic regression. What you do is a matter of your underlying science. Finding a perfect predictor may be really desirable for you or you may feel that this is just a chance finding caused by your sample size. There are models for logistic regression (exact logistic regression, Firth's bias corrected method) but I do not know whether they are available for ordinal models. Further addition Investigating this further with two R packages (I do not use SPSS) reveals that they agree on there being a problem but give slightly different output. The function polr from MASS basically agrees with the output in the original question and inspecting the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients shows that the estimated correlation between age and one of the intercepts is close to 1 in absolute value. > fit.polr summary(fit.polr) Call: polr(formula = coll ~ age + treat + gene, data = res, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std.

Using @FrankHarrell suggestion to investigate LRT we find that age is indeed significant. > fit.clm summary(fit.clm) formula: coll ~ age + treat + gene data: res link threshold nobs logLik AIC niter max.grad cond.H logit flexible 54 -34.39 78.77 21(0) 5.63e-09 4.5e+09 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

My feeling is that there is insufficient information here in the data-set to fit the model with any confidence. If we had a single observation for age == old & coll == 0 then both functions would fit the model (and give identical results) so the problem here is the zeroes for both (age == old & coll == 0) & (age == young & coll == 2).
