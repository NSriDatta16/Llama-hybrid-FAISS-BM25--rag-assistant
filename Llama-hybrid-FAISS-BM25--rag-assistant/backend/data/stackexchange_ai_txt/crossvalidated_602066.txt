Yes, it is possible. The short version is: Improve model architecture. Larger strides for the large kernal sizes for this particular case. Include global pooling at final layer More conv layers (use 3-4) with RELU and max pooling if model does not perform well before offsets are introduced For best performance, train with data that includes off centered offsets, but not necessarily required if model is properly designed See answer posted here and the comments for additional details: https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/38649/should-a-cnn-generalize-to-arbitrary-positions-in-the-data
