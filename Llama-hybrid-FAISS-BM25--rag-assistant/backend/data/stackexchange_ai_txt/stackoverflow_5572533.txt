I have to agree with LucasTizma on the debugging issue. When I began using XCode4, I started not explicitly declaring ivars and let them be created for me using @synthesize aVar = _aVar syntax. While trying to debug code, I noticed that I couldn't hover the cursor over the variable and see its value. For me, this is just unacceptable. I guess it's back to declaring them explicitly.
