The question "How to detrend ...." begs the question "is there a trend that should be isolated and adjusted for " . Your unit of measurement required some non-intrusive magnification (10**3) in order to assess model structure. A reasonable model did not contain a trend to be excerpted and here is the actual,fit and forec ast . The actual equation based upon a deterministic error variance reduction http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html at period 45 is here . The plot of the model errors provides reasonable (but not perfect) suggestion of model adequacy Time series data ( and we have seen a few !) are like people .. some are easy to understand and require "simple tools" others can be a bit develish like this "nice series" warrant more nuanced approaches to sort out the underlying structure (the model !) . Recall all models are wrong but some are useful ! In summary there is no region in the 106 values that support a trended equation even the relatively stable period of 37-97 . Ask not "what you can do to your data" but rather "ask the data what needs to be done to characterize it" You say " First difference (values are negative so I can't use this), moving average (requires a lot of observations)," . I don't believe either of your assertions are corrrect. In this case first differences are quite appropriate and an Ma(1) model would be just as useful as the identified AR(1) model since ph1=.4 [1-.4B] -1 = [1+.4B + .16B 2 + .064B**3 ... ] EDITED TO PROVIDE A STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO DEAL WITH MODEL IDENTIFICATION: A MASTER-CLASS IN TIME SERIES MODELLING STEP 1: YOU SPECIFIED AN AR(1) . I estimated that model here with residuals here with the following ACF There are three Gaussian violations that possibly need to be addressed : there are one-time pulses in the residuals suggesting the need to incorporate pulse indicators (0/1) predictors there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals suggesting needed ARIMA augmentation there is significant non-constant error variance in the residuals suggesting the need to do WEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES (Generalized Least Squares) by adjusting (reducing the volatility) of the first 44 observations You didn't address any of these violations. STEP 2: Specifying a first difference model with an AR(1) (0,1,0)(1,0,0) and 6 pulse indicators and a test for a breakpoint in error variance Note that AUTOBOX found a breakpoint in the error variance suggesting that the first 44 values by down-weighted by .64 (square root of .406) culminating here Not that the ACF of the residuals from this model indicate insufficiency as there appears to be some sort of a four period effect in the residuals suggesting further iterations. Peeling an onion comes to mind ! Is there any reason that you know of that would suggest this phenomenon ? It could represent an exogenous/unspecified predictor variable like an election cycle effect. A plot of the residuals suggests that the error variance is much more homogeneous but with the 43-64 region still suggesting some non-constnt error variance.
