You need to create a region with CRgn , then select that as the clipping region in your CDC with SelectClipRgn . Then you can use CDC::SetPixel to set random pixels anywhere within the bounding rectangle of your shape, and only the ones within the clipping region will be painted. Be aware that this will be slow, and will need to be redone every time the window paints (such as when another window is dragged over it).
