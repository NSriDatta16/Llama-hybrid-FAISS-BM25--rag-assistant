With respect to different numbers in each group: although standard textbook presentations of ANOVA use equal numbers in each cell, that's not generally a substantial problem and modern linear-modeling software handles it well. With respect to normality: there is a school of thought that normality testing is essentially useless at this stage of a study. With a large enough group you will almost always find violations of normality in real-world data. You'll note that the apparent non-normality problem is seen in girls, who outnumber boys by about 2 to 1. With such a restricted range of dependent-variable (DV) values, my initial reaction in a comment that normality shouldn't even be suspected is substantially alleviated. With respect to data transformation: with all values fractional and not including 0 or 1 exactly, consider a logit transformation. Think of your score as being equivalent to the probability p of a perfect match to the reference individual. Then transform with $\log(p/(1-p))$ . That would put your DV values on a scale from about 1 to 3 while stretching out the top of the scale. With respect to the risks of proceeding in the face of apparent non-normality: the discussion on this page shows that there is no simple rule to follow with respect to violation of normality assumptions. As what you are modeling is something essentially the same as a failure rate, however, you probably should consider the caution in this answer on that page. With respect to non-parametric tests: if you move to a non-parametric test you can still look for differences between boys and girls and between those who answer Yes versus No, but there will be no good way to look at interactions between gender and answer . As the answer linked in the previous sentence suggests, however, you might be able to analyze your data with an ordinal logistic regression regardless of normality in a way that allows you to evaluate that interaction.
