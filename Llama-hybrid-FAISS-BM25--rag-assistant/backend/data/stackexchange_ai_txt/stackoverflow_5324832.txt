What is the use of GAC? i) You can store multiple versions of the same assembly on a machine and execute them side by side. ii) Store the same assemblies in multiple locations on a machine uses additionally unneeded storage. Keeping them in one location reduces this cost. iii) Serving assemblies on a machine becomes simpler because you only have to update one location (the GAC) rather than searching for multiple instances of an assembly stored on a machine.
