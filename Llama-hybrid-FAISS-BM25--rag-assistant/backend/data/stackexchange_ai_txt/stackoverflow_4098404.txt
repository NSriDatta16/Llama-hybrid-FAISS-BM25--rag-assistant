Automatically Restarting Website after IIS AppPool recyle

I'm using a website which interacts with SQL Server Agent in order to schedule the automatic processing and emailing of reports. I recently noticed that when the AppPool recyles, that i'm not getting reports afterwards - until someone logs into the website again. It's possible for the website not to get hit for hours/days, during which all the scheduled tasks are lost. I'd like to set up a windows task to either run periodically or trigger off the AppPool recycle event. But I'm not sure what the task should be. I had one suggestion to set up a Windows task to exercise a .js script that would hit the website, but this only works with Windows Authentication (which isn't being used): var xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP"); xmlhttp.open("POST", "http://localhost/website/default.aspx", false); xmlhttp.send(); Looking for some suggestions on how to "wake up" a website after an IIS AppPool recycle. Thanks. ab.
