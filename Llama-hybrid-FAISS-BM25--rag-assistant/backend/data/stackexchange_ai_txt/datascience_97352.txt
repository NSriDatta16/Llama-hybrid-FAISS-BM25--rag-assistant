Choosing a Change Point Detection Algorithm

I am currently working on a dataset that belongs to the restaurant and food delivery domain. After completing sentiment analysis and quantification, I now need to select a Change Point Detection Algorithm and detect a shift in the sentiment signal in the reviews on each category of restaurant. The signal will be a score that is the difference between the positivity and negativity of the reviews in a certain time frame. I have considered 3 sentiments that are positive, neutral and negative and am thus contemplating the use of a multivariate time series. Since, I have the complete dataset at hand, I will be conducting an offline change point detection algorithm to detect a shift in the sentiment of the reviews in the pre-covid and post-covid time. Please provide me some help as to how do I select an algorithm. I am very confused and a few factors to consider with links to resources are welcome.
