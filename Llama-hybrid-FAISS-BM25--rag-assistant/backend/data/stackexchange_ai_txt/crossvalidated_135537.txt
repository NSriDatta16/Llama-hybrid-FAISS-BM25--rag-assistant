Combining Poisson estimates

On average, 10 buses and 60 cars pass your house per hour. During one period of time, you count 11 buses and 40 cars passing your house. How long were you counting for? My first thought is to make one estimate based on the bus count and one based on the car count. However, the estimate based on the car count is more reliable, due to the greater number of observations. So how to combine the two - if that is even the right way to go about it?
