In Machine Learning, what is the point of using stratified sampling in selecting test set data?

I am currently learning machine learning via this book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Sci-kit learn and Tensorflow" by Aurelien Geron. In page 76 and 77, the author talks about using stratified sampling so that your test set would be more representative of the whole data. I didn't really understand the point of this since it would not affect the accuracy of your training model ? or how would selecting better test sets affect the accuracy of your training model ?
