In ECMAScript5, what's the scope of "use strict"?

What scope does the strict mode pragma have in ECMAScript5? "use strict"; I'd like to do this (mainly because JSLint doesn't complain about it): "use strict"; (function () { // my stuff here... }()); But I'm not sure if that would break other code or not. I know that I can do this, which will scope the pragma to the function... (function () { "use strict"; // my stuff here... }()); but JSLint complains about it (when the "strict" JSLint option is enabled) because it thinks you're executing code before you enable "use strict". Here's my question. If I have fileA.js: "use strict"; // do some stuff and fileB.js: eval( somecodesnippet ); // disallowed by "use strict" and then include them in my html page in that same order, will the pragma be scoped to the file, or will the pragma bleed over into fileB, thus blocking the eval execution?
