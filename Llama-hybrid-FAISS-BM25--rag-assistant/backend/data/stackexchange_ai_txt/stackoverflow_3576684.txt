Causes of Unable To Validate Data

I'm getting "Unable to validate data" in a webfarm scenario but not all the time. I'm getting it about on AVERAGE 1x or 2x per hour but fairly random. All of the causes of this error that I know of are list below: Machinekey in the machine.config (or web.config) not set the same in a web farm scenario. Mine are set the same in the machine.config. A page is submitted after a server recycle and the machinekey is set to auto. I'm using a static key which should eliminate this source. A postback is triggered before a page is loaded. I'm using 3.5 SP1 with the render viewstate at top set to true. A page that post back to another page or uses server transfer. I'm not. Serializing an anonymous type into the viewstate Anti-virus programs or web accelerators on client machine. A malicious attempt to modify viewstate These are all of the sources that I know. Any other sources appreciated. Is this fairly typical to see this error 10x-20x times per day?
