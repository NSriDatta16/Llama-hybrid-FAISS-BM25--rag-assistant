(source: mit.edu ) from University of Mexico The information theoretic notion of Entropy is a generalization of the physical notion. There are many ways to describe Entropy. It is a measure of the randomness of a random variable. It is also a measure of the amount of information a random variable or stochastic process contains. It is also a lower bound on the amount a message can be compressed. And finally it is the average number of yes/no questions that need to be asked about an random entity to determine its value. Equation for Entropy in a sample application for probability calculation: it is the sum over all values of a rv of the probability of that value times the log of that prob(i.e. p(x)logp(x)). This equation can be derived from first principles of the properties of information.
