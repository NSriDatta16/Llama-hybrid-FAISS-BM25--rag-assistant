How can I hash a password and store it for later verification with another digest?

I am using gsoap's wsseapi plugin and would like to store hashed sha1 passwords rather than plain text. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time experimenting with various methods of hashing the plain text password for storage. Can anyone suggest a way to hash a password so it can be later verified against a username token digest sent by the client? I can't seem to get the client password to authenticate against my stored hash.
