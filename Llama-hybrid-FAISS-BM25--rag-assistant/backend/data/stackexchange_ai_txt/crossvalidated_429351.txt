Transform a U-shape variable in Logistic Regression

I am using logistic regression to predict the probability of being a bad customer. I need to transform each independent variable to make sure it has a strong linear relationship with the log-odds of my target. One variable has a upper U-shape when I plot the variable value against the log-odds. How should I transform it so I won't over-predict the lower group and under-predict the upper group? EDIT: I tried using square, but it did not give me a better/linear-er line.
