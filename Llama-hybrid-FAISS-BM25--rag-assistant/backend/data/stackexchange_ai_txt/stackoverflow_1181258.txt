Check the following settings in php.ini : upload_max_filesize needs to be greater than 10 MiB ( 10M ). post_max_size needs to be at least 40% greater than upload_max_filesize . The reason why this is required is that some old user-agents will upload using base64 encoding, which adds a 37% overhead to the data. Add mime headers, other post parameters, there are plenty of reasons to have it higher than upload_max_filesize . max_input_time needs to be at least 900 (15 minutes). You want to give enough time for the user to upload its file.
