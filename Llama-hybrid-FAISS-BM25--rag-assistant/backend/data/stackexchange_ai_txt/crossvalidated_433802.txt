Benefits to fitting a separate logistic regression model for each independent variable?

Is there any benefit to doing a for loop so that a logistic regression model is fit separately for each independent variable (i.e. 100 models all using the same dependent variable)? As opposed to fitting one model with all 100 independent variables and the dependent variable.
