Tuning SVM parameters in R

I am training an SVM model for the classification of the variable V19 within my dataset. I have done a pre-processing of the data, in particular I have used MICE to impute some missing data. Anyway a part of the training dataset I use is this one: Through the "tune" function I tried to train looking for the best parameters through cross-validation; tune.out I tried many combinations of parameters and different kernels, but what I get is always a model that can not predict correctly even the same training data, always returns all outputs to FALSE. I really don't know if it's just a problem of tuning parameters or if I managed wrong the dataset. Thanks for any advice. EDIT : @Alex H I tried your code and what I obtain is : Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel 1094 samples 18 predictor 2 classes: 'X1', 'X2' Pre-processing: centered (18), scaled (18) Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 5 times) Summary of sample sizes: 985, 985, 985, 985, 984, 984, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: C ROC Sens Spec 0.25 0.5241539 0.9996 0 0.50 0.5320540 1.0000 0 1.00 0.5066151 0.9994 0 2.00 0.5225485 1.0000 0 4.00 0.5130391 1.0000 0 Tuning parameter 'sigma' was held constant at a value of 0.04595822 ROC was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. The final values used for the model were sigma = 0.04595822 and C = 0.5.
