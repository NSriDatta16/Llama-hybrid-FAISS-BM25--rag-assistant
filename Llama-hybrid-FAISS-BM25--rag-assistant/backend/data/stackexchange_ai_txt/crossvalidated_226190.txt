Modified German Tank problem involving string distance metrics

Pretend we have a list of items, e.g. names, and we know it is sorted ALPHANUMERICALLY let's say in ascending order. Given a small set of the first K items, how can we estimate the length of the full list? E.g.: for K=5: The subset: Adrian Anna Carl Derrick Eric ... would probably be from a shorter list than the subset: Aaron Adaline Adam Aden Alma since the average alphanumeric distance between names is a lot less in the 2nd subset than the first subset, and since we know there is the same potential finite length for each full list (there is a last possible name, since the last name on the list will start with Z and be something like Zebulon, etc.). I can think of 2 approaches. Use average alphanumeric distance between the items of the subset to estimate the full length, e.g. using some metric like Hamming distance or better, Levenshtein distance. Also include priors by using known name frequencies (a lot more complicated, but probably provides a better estimate). So, can someone please help me to decide on a way to estimate N, the cardinality of the full list, given a subset of the first K names in the alphanumerically sorted list?
