Get shopping cart details in Magento

I want to get the shopping cart details, by using Magento's getQuote function. How can I do this? $cart = Mage::getModel('checkout/cart')->getQuote(); When I print the $cart Page stops execution and blank page is shown. But when I write $cart = Mage::getModel('checkout/cart')->getQuote()->getData(); and print the $cart an array will show. But I want to track the complete cart data (product Id,Product price like all information). Is there any other method by which I can find the shopping card data?
