Anyone know average HL7 clinical message response times?

I'm designing a .net interface for sending and receiving a HL7 message and noticed on this forum theres a few people with this experience. My question is.... Would anyone be able to share their experience on how long it could take to get a message response back from a hospital HL7 server. (Particularly when requesting patient demographics) - seconds / minutes / Hours? My dilemma is do I design my application to make the user wait for the message to come back. (Sorry if this is a little off topic, it’s still kinda programming related? – I searched the web for HL7 forums but got stuck so again if anyone knows of any please let me know ) cheers, Jason
