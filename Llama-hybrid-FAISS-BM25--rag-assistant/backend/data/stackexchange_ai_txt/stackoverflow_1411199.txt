What is a better way to sort by a 5 star rating?

I'm trying to sort a bunch of products by customer ratings using a 5 star system. The site I'm setting this up for does not have a lot of ratings and continue to add new products so it will usually have a few products with a low number of ratings. I tried using average star rating but that algorithm fails when there is a small number of ratings. Example a product that has 3x 5 star ratings would show up better than a product that has 100x 5 star ratings and 2x 2 star ratings. Shouldn't the second product show up higher because it is statistically more trustworthy because of the larger number of ratings?
