I think people describe code as "OOP in procedural style" when the methods inside a class tend to be very long and complex. Martin Fowler's book 'Refactoring', describes a long method as a 'code smell' that hints that parts of its code could be broken down into smaller methods or separated out into other classes. see: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1MsETFPD3I0C&lpg=PP1&dq=refactoring&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false I think your code is perfectly fine. Just bare in mind how disposable the objects of the class are. Generally a 'parsing service' like this should be created, used and thrown away. Then you won't have to worry about old properties causing confusion if it is re-used. As eteubert suggests, passing the tooling in the constructor helps to let the clients know that the object is being created for a very particular purpose.
