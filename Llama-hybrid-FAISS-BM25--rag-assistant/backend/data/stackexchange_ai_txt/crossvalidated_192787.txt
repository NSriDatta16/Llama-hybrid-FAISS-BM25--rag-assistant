Interpretation of the variance of a slope

If I have a simple regression model: $$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2(\text{income}) + \varepsilon$$ I can calculate the $\text{Var}(\hat{\beta_2})$ quite easily with a formula. However, what is the practical meaning of $\text{Var}(\hat{\beta_2})$ ? What does it actually tell us? I know that it tells us the variance of the slope $\hat{\beta_2}$, but what does this mean? Does it mean that from the various samples, when you collate all of the predictions for $\beta_2$, we get an average level of $\beta_2$ and then the variance of this level of $\beta_2$?
