Since it's a class member, you need to comment the class as well so that doxygen knows to look within the class for member functions. Do something like this before class Foo /** * @class Foo * * The foo class is awesome */ Here is the code I am using (exactly yours plus that comment) which generates the output on the link below. http://raged.microsonic.org/test/html/classFoo.html Hope that helps, good luck! On a side note, it is always a good idea (especially for documentation) to list your var types as the poster above suggested. I generally declare every @param and @return as some sort of variable type (since I come from a C++ background) although it is not totally necessary in PHP. In PHP you tend to have many "mixed" var types as where this could not happen in C++. Anyway good luck with your project!
