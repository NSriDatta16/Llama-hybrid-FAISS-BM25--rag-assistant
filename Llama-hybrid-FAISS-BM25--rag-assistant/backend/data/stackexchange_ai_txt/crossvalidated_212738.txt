One simple example of model averaging is when you are deciding the order of a polynomial model $$y_i=\sum_{j=0}^kx_i^j\beta_j+e_i $$ So you don't know the betas and you also don't know the value of $k $. And $e_i\sim N (0,\sigma^2) $. For fixed $k $ you have a least squares problem - with a proper prior it is "regularized" least squares. When you do model averaging, you can think of a weighted average of the predictions for each $k $. The weights will be proportional to something like $\exp (-\frac {1}{2}BIC_k) $ in cases where the prior on the betas and the polynomial order are fairly uniform ($BIC_k $ is the bayesian information criterion for the least squares model of order $k $).
