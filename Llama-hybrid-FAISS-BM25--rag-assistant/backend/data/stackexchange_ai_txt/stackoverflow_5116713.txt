Something like this maybe: var csv = @"A, 22, 23, 12 B, 32, 4, 33 C, 34, 3 ,33"; var lines = csv.Split('\n').Select(x => x.Split(',').Skip(1).Select(n => int.Parse(n))).Select(x => new {Sum = x.Sum(), Average = x.Average()}); foreach (var line in lines) { Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + line.Sum); Console.WriteLine("Average: " + line.Average); } In general, I don't suggest to do something like this. You should use a full blown CSV reader to parse the CSV file and you should include error handling.
