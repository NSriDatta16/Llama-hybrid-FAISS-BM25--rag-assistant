I would work with the two samples separately at first, since they are independent. The MLE of $\lambda$ from just the $X$ s is $\tilde\lambda_n=1/\bar X_n$ and the MLE of $\lambda$ from just the $Y$ s is $\check\lambda_m=-\log \bar Y_m$ . By the CLT and the delta method, $\tilde\lambda_n$ is asymptotically Normal, and you can write down its asymptotic mean and variance. Similarly, by the CLT and the delta method, $\check\lambda_n$ is asymptotically Normal, and you can write down its asymptotic mean and variance. These two are independent, so their joint asymptotic distribution is bivariate Normal and you know the means and variances. Now, if you have two independent Normally-distributed estimates $(\tilde\lambda, \check\lambda)$ of the same thing, the optimal combination of them is a weighted average, weighted by the inverses of the variances. So that gets you an overall estimator with known asymptotic distribution. If this were a real problem we'd be done, but it's an exam problem so we do need to worry whether this estimator is the MLE. It's asymptotically efficient (because the two components are MLEs and thus asymptotically efficient), and the MLE will be asymptotically efficient, so it must have the same asymptotic distribution as the MLE, and we are really done. Now, I don't know that this is what the examiner had in mind. You can think of $X$ as first-event-times in independent Poisson processes and $Y$ as whether the first event happened before time 1, so there may be a clever argument that makes use of this connection and gives an explicit MLE or a more elegant link between the two sets of variables. But this is a derivation of the asymptotic distribution.
