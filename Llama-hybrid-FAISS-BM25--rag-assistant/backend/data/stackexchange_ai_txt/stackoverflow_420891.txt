How do I tell Windsor to add an Interceptor to all components registered that implement IMustBeIntercepted

If I registered several components with Windsor. IAnimal provides BigAnimal IPerson provides SmellyPerson IWhale provides BlueWhale etc.. pretty standard component registeration all the above types implement IMustBeIntercepted, how do I tell the container add an interceptor to all types that implement IMustBeImplemented so that when Resolve is called it is returned a BigAnimal with an interceptor as defined since it matches. I know I can do this for each one but its extra XML config or programatic config which I want to avoid
