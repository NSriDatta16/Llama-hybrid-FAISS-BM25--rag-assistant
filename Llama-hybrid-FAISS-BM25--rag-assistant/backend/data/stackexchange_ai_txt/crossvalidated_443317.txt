With ordered coordinates, the first thing that I think of is bounding-box regression. Two main algorithms in this area come to mind that might be useful: 1) Faster R-CNN : The main idea is to superimpose "anchors" (basically a grid of pre-defined rectangles) over the image, figure out which anchors are "interesting" (contain an object), and then perform bounding box regression on those rectangles. This is a very high-level overview â€” technical overview linked. 2) YOLO : The main idea here is to divide the image into a big grid. Each square in the grid is responsible for detecting one object only, and will output B bounding boxes and class-conditional probabilities (Pr of class C given object exists). Apply non-maximal suppression at test-time, and you have your predictions. Note: the limitations to YOLO that you'll often see (bad at fine-grained features, less accurate) will likely be less impactful on the newspaper article-detection case, since 1) usually articles fill rectangular areas, 2) such areas take up a large proportion of the page, and 3) it is unlikely that a single grid box will contain more than 1 article. Some quick words of caution though: As with any neural net, your model is only as good as your data.
