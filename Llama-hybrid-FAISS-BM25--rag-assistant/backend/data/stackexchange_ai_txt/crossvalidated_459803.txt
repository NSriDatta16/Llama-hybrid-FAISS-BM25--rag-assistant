How do we calculate total probability of data by taking account all of our hypothesis in Bayesian Inference?

Given a Bayesian Inference Formula $P(H\mid E)={\frac {P(E\mid H)\cdot P(H)}{P(E)}}$ . How can we ever calculate the total probability of all of our models? This seems impossible given a large number of models. So along with the requirement of prior probability, shouldn't this also be considered as a critical factor of success in Bayesian inference as well when we are setting up our experiment?
