Being a pragmatist, I would just put: // Hopefully not a name collision :-) void *xyzzy_plugh_zorkmid_3141592653589_2718281828459[] = { &functionToForceIn, &anotherFunction }; at the file level of one of your source files (or even a brand new source file, something along the lines of forcedCompiledFunctions.c , so that it's obvious what it's for). Because this is non-static, the compiler won't be able to take a chance that you won't need it elsewhere, so should compile it in.
