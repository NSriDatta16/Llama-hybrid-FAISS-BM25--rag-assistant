Hidden Markov Model One of the best approaches to modeling time series data is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). You can either make a single model of your know non-problem state, separate models of each of your known problem states or, if you have sufficient data, a single composite model of all of your known problem states. A good open source library is the Hidden Markov Model Toolbox for Matlab. http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html Kalman Filter Another approach that is a little more involved is a Kalman Filter. This approach is especially useful if your data has a lot of noise. A good open source library is the Kalman Filter Toolbox for Matlab. http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/Kalman/kalman.html Bayesian Models Both of these approaches are considered Bayesian Models. A good open source library is the Bayes Net Toolbox for Matlab. http://code.google.com/p/bnt I hope this works for you.
