The most obvious thing to do is to plot residuals vs predicted (i.e. simulated) - you can plot this directly, without reference to a program to fit regression. However, if you want to use a regression to fit it, you need an intercept of 0 and an offset of simulated , if your program allows for an offset. (In R that's lm(observed~0,offset=simulated) ) That fit can be used produce most of the usual diagnostic plots, but not all (leverage, for example, is 0, so the leverage based plots won't work).
