Likelihood ratio test in R

Suppose I am going to do a univariate logistic regression on several independent variables, like this: mod.a I did a model comparison (likelihood ratio test) to see if the model is better than the null model by this command 1-pchisq(mod.a$null.deviance-mod.a$deviance, mod.a$df.null-mod.a$df.residual) Then I built another model with all variables in it mod.c In order to see if the variable is statistically significant in the multivariate model, I used the lrtest command from epicalc lrtest(mod.c,mod.a) ### see if variable b is statistically significant after adjustment of a lrtest(mod.c,mod.b) ### see if variable a is statistically significant after adjustment of b I wonder if the pchisq method and the lrtest method are equivalent for doing loglikelihood test? As I dunno how to use lrtest for univate logistic model.
