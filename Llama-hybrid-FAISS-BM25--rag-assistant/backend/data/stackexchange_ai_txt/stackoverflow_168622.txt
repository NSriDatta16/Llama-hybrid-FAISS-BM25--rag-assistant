Using the form designer: Drag the ToolTip control from the Toolbox, onto the form. Select the properties of the control you want the tool tip to appear on. Find the property 'ToolTip on toolTip1' (the name may not be toolTip1 if you changed it's default name). Set the text of the property to the tool tip text you would like to display. You can set also the tool tip programatically using the following call: this.toolTip1.SetToolTip(this.targetControl, "My Tool Tip");
