Sample vs Apparent vs True error rates of a confusion matrix

Consider a machine learning program which produces a classifier that works perfectly correctly on 1,000 training examples. When subsequently applied to 100 different, randomly selected examples the results are: Actual Class P N Classifier P: 10 5 Results N: 15 70 What would be the sample error rate, apparent error rate, and estimated true error rate? And what are their differences?
