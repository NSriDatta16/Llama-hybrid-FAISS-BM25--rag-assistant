Why is there insertOrThrow but no updateOrThrow or deleteOrThrow?

I am creating android app that uses SQLite database. Looking at the SQLiteDatabase class I found that there is a method called insertOrThrow() which is similar to insert() but with one important difference - if insert fails it will throw exception and app will die (if not catched). I am using insertOrThrow() in the initial stage of the development because it draws my attention to SQL errors in a very noticeable way, i.e. app dies. I am just curious: Why is there no updateOrThrow() , deleteOrThrow() , etc... I've tried to google for info but did not found anything...
