from the BUILD menu, select configuration manager option on the active solution configuration dropdown select "new" create two new 'configurations' one for PRO and one for ENTERPRISE close the configuration manager. open the project properties (from the project context menu) select the build tab select the PRO configuration (from the CONFIGURATION dropdown) enter your compilation constant "PROVERSION" into the conditional compilation symbols textbox. now all you have to do is select the config you want to build from the config dropdown on the main toolbar and then do your build. when you build the PRO using the PRO configuration the compiler pragmas (#IF PROVERSION) scattered throughout your code will include the code limiting your feature set. you may also consider setting a ENTERPRISE constant for the ENTERPRISE configuration if you want to specifically include ENTERPRISE features in an ENTERPRISE build (versus disabling enterprise features in a PRO build)
