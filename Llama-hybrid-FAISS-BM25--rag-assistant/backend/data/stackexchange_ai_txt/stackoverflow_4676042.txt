Visual Studio licensing per user or per machine

I have been using VS2010 Pro from DreamSpark. I will shortly be joining a commercial organisation who will not be providing me with a VS license and as such I will need to purchase my own. Is Visual Studio licensed per user, per machine, or per-user per-machine? I.e. if I buy one license am I able to exclusively use it on both my laptop and desktop? Thanks
