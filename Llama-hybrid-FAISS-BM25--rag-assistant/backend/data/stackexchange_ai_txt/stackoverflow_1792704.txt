My best guess is you'll have to capture the MouseLeftButtonDown event and detect dragging. If not dragging, then cancel the event. If dragging is detected, capture the start position in a class variable. In MouseMove, compare the mouse position to the start position and determine whether to increment or decrement the Grid Splitter position. To get this to work, I think you will need to adjust the width of the left grid column programmatically based on the increment/decrement decision above. I'll be curious to see how this goes.
