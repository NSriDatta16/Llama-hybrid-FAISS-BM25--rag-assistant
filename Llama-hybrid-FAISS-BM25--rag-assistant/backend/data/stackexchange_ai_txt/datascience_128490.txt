Searching ChatGPT transcripts?

Maybe I just don't understand the functionality of the web version. Using GPT4 here. When I do technical queries (usually TensorFlow applications) I use similar prompts until I get the understanding I need. I want to be able to retrieve chats using folders or keywords that I assign, or some other such method. When I ask GPT I'm told web browser history or Evernote / other note-taking software is what I should use. Surely there is some sort more powerful search available? At the moment I cut-and-paste important chats into word processor documents. This is just ridiculous when I'm paying for a service that's supposed to make information retrieval / analysis quicker and easier. All I can find are Chrome extensions like "Superpower ChatGPT", which requires a paid subscription. I'm dubious how long these sorts of extensions will be around, and don't want to lose the effort I'll need to put into adding keywords etc if the extension stops being developed.
