Feature selection for sports prediction

I worked through couple of projects on Kaggle to pick up machine learning. Now I am looking to implement a basic tennis prediction algorithm. I have a very beginner question. Let's say, for each match, I collect 5 features for player A, 5 features for player B. My very basic understanding of machine learning tells me that from the perspective of a machine, these features are not players specific. In other words, there are simply 10 features. Is this correct? In this case, is it generally better to substitute these 10 features with differences between corresponding pairs of features, resulting in 5 features.
