The reason the other bars are missing is because of your method of summing the values and the missing values in your dataset. The way you are adding the values together means that if even one value is missing (NA) the total for that column will be missing as well, and as a result, will not be in your final plot. It is better to use pandas built-in methods (for conciseness, speed, but also to avoid errors such as the one you encountered) to add up the values as follows (using random values): import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt datainput = pd.read_csv("MD_COVID-19.csv") fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1]) regions = ['Allegany', 'Anne_Arundel', 'Baltimore', 'Baltimore_City', 'Calvert', 'Caroline', 'Washington'] # select all region columns and calculate the sum column-wise total_cases = datainput[regions].sum() ax.bar(regions, total_cases) plt.ylabel("Number of Cases") plt.show() Which gives the following result:
