Write XML Fragment with LINQ and Prefixes

I have a document created in a constructor, and during execution I'm filling it in with fragments generated from Custom Business Objects. When I'm outputting the fragments, I need to include namespace fragments, but I'd like to avoid adding the namespace url to each fragment, since it's defined in the root. Any thoughts? _doc = new XDocument( new XDeclaration("1.0", "UTF-8", "yes"), new XElement(aw + "kml", new XAttribute(XNamespace.Xmlns + "gx", "http://www.google.com/kml/ext/2.2"), new XAttribute("xmlns", "http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"), new XElement(aw+"Document", That's how the doc starts, so the namespaces are there. How do I go about building an XElement to add using the gx prefix?
