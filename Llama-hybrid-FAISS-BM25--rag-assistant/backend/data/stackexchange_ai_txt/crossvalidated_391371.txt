Define a fragment embedding network $E(x, l; \theta)$ which takes as input a small fragment of the state $x$ (such as the position), the type of information given $l$ (position, or velocity, etc) and outputs some $d$ dimensional vector. Choose some aggregation function $g$ which combines an arbitrary number of embeddings into a fixed size representation. This can be simple as $g(x_1, \ldots x_n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum x_i$ , or perhaps an LSTM $g(x_i; \phi)$ . Take the output of $g$ as your state embedding.
