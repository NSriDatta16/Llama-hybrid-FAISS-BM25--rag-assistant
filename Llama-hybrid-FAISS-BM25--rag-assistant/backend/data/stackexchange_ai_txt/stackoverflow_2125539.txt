You can store up to 10Mb with a list of Blobs. Search for google file service . It's much more versatile than BlobStore in my opinion, since I just started using BlobStore Api yesterday and I'm still figuring out if it is possible to access the data bytewise.. as in changing doc to pdf, jpeg to gif.. You can storage Blobs of 1Mb * 10 = 10 Mb (max entity size I think), or you can use BlobStore API and get the same 10Mb or get 50Mb if you enable billing (you can enable it but if you don't pass the free quota you don't pay).
