You should be putting all your require s and include s at the head of the file - that certainly a style thing, but for one thing it allows you to see by glancing at the source, what other files are need by your PHP file. There are two cases: You will only ever use user.php and storage.php from other files ( app.php say) There are cases where you will use user.php and don't want to worry about remembering to require storage.php . For #1 - you don't need to worry about requires, however there's no significant disadvantage to using require_once at the head of your PHP even if most of the time it'll have already been required. For #2 - you need to use require_once at the header since you cannot use user.php without storage.php and the final page only knows it needs user.php . short answer: Use require_once to include all dependencies for the code (to allow it to easily be used by other code) note: You should only include direct-dependencies for the code. That is: if you have group.php that uses user.php , it should require_once 'user.php' , but need not worry about storage.php since it isn't directly used, and user.php implicitly includes it (that being said - no significant performance disadvantage of being thorough if you wish)
