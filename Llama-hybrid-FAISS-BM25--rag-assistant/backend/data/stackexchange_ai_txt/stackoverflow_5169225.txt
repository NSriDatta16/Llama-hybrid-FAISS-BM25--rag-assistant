Cache as much as possible, i.e. when you have expensive queries (with or without joins) try to cache the query result rather than executing the query again etc. To make the whole site fast, cache objects on the highest possible layer, i.e. try to cache whole pages, if that does not works, try caching page fragments, then the data objects that provide the data to populate the pages etc. etc. Caveat: There's some truth to the old saying "There are only 2 hard things in Computer Science - cache invalidation and naming things", so be careful what you put in your cache and for how long.
