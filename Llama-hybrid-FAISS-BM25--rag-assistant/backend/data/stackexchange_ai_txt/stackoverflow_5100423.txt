I group JS code in files, separate from partials Partials can be cached and JS updates would not require html cache deletion Better code organization, as the functionality gets complicated, it would be easier to manage and optimize Over time JS will grow in size and you can use CDN to deliver your JS, this is a great performance booster for page load times
