How do I use PCA to know if two categories are sources of variability?

I have a matrix of values 10000x2 that fall in two categories A and B. I would like to use PCA to know if the categories are large sources of variability. I ran a PCA analysis in R, but I have no idea how to make sense of the numbers I got nor how to work out what it means for my two categories. Could somebody help me?
