For an HTML5 demo of drag-n-drop, check out: http://html5demos.com/drag-anything Seems like dragover , dragenter , dragexit , drop events + event.dataTransfer are how it all works. Putting it together with a multi-part/form ajax POST like the link that dhorn gave is more impressive in my opinion. I would hope that it could be done a little easier than that.
