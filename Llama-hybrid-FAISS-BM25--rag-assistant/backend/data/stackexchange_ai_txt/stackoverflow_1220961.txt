What is a correct way to move directories with TortoiseSVN?

If I move a directory to another place inside the same repository by dragging it to the new place in Tortoise, I cannot checkout revisions prior to the move , because the URL to these old revisions is not valid anymore. How do you move a directory and still be able to access revisions before the move? Example : If I move trunk/folder1/source to trunk/folder2/source then I can see the "source" folder now under folder2, and I can checkout the head revision, meaning the revision that produced the move. However, if I try to checkout an older revision that was committed before the move, I get an error that the url doesn't exist. I guess it's because the url of the older revision still points to the old path. But there must be a way to fix this, otherwise a move would not make sense if you loose access to older revisions.
