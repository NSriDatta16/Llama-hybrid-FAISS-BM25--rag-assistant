Regression of a time series difference

Suppose $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are two time series. I regress $y(t)$ against $x(t)$ , and obtain $$y(t)=ax(t)+b+z(t) $$ for some regression constants $a, b$ and residue $z(t)$ . Define $\Delta u(t):=u(t+1)-u(t)$ for a given time series $u(t)$ . Now regress $\Delta y(t)$ against $\Delta x(t)$ . It seems the following should hold $$\Delta y(t) \sim a\Delta x(t)$$ However, it seems the actual regression coefficient turns out to be $0$ . Can someone give a model to account for this phenomenon? Is there where cointegration should be used?
