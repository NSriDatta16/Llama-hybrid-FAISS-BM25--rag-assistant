Can I perform elementwise division in XSLT?

I have a data structure which looks something like: 1 4 2 4 3 5 5 6 I'd like to compute avg((result/numCorrect) div (result/truthCorrect)) , but XSLT doesn't seem to allow element-wise division, how do I compute this average? If it helps, I'm using Saxon as an XSLT 2.0 processor.
