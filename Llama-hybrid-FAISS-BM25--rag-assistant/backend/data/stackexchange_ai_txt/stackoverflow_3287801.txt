Pointers to elements of std::vector and std::list

I'm having a std::vector with elements of some class ClassA . Additionally I want to create an index using a std::map which maps some key value to pointers to elements contained in the vector. Is there any guarantee that these pointers remain valid (and point to the same object) when elements are added at the end of the vector (not inserted ). I.e, would the following code be correct: std::vector storage; std::map map; for (int i=0; i How is the situation, if I use std::list instead of std::vector ?
