You can reset the auto-increment like this: ALTER TABLE tablename AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 But if you are relying on the autoincrement values, your program is very fragile. If you need to assign consecutive numbers to your records for your program to work you should create a separate column for that, and not use a database auto-increment ID for this purpose.
