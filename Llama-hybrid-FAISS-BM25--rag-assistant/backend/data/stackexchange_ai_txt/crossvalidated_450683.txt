Is it appropriate to examine the density plot for time series data?

Usually we use time plot to examine the behaviour of time series data cause it reveals the chronological characteristic. Does it make sense that one looks at the data distribution using some non-parametric statistics (e.g. kernel density)? While looking at the kde of some iid data makes sense, I'm not sure does it apply to time series data which is not noise (iid), or even with structural breaks or conditional heteroscedasticity. Possibly duplicate of Can I plot time series data in a histogram? , which doesn't have any answers.
