Magento - How to replace 'Home' in the breadcrumb?

I'm just wondering if anyone has had any experience in formatting the breadcrumb in Magento? I would like to replace the link that currently displays the text 'HOME' with an image. I thought it would be a simple case of replacing some text with a picture but it seems the 'HOME' text/link is dynamically created as this is all that is in the breadcrumbs.phtml: $_crumbInfo): ?> "> " title=" htmlEscape($_crumbInfo['title']) ?>"> htmlEscape($_crumbInfo['label']) ?> htmlEscape($_crumbInfo['label']) ?> htmlEscape($_crumbInfo['label']) ?> &gt;
