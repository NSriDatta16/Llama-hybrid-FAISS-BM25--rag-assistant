As mentioned in the comment by @Dilip Sarwate, the key is conditioning which is often implicit in Bayesian notation. So what you really wanted was $$ y|\mu,\sigma^2 \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) $$ and $$\mu|\mu_0,\sigma_1^2 \sim N(\mu_0,\sigma_1^2) $$ and thus $$ E[y|\mu,\sigma^2] = \mu,$$ i.e. if we knew the true value for $\mu$, then $y$ would be centered at it. And $$E[y|\mu_0,\sigma_1^2] = E[E[y|\mu,\sigma^2]| \mu_0,\sigma_1^2] = E[\mu|\mu_0,\sigma_1^2] = \mu_0$$ i.e. our prior guess about where the data y will be is centered around $\mu_0$.
