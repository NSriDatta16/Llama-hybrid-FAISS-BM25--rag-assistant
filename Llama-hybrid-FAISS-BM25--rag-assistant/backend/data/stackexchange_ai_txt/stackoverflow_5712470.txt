Draggable AND clickable pushpin in silverlight bing map

I'm trying to create a pushpin in a Silverlight Bing Map that is both draggable as well as clickable. I found some code here http://pietschsoft.com/post/2010/05/30/Draggable-Pushpins-using-Bing-Maps-Silverlight-Control.aspx to achieve the draggable part. I've mapped mouseclick on the map to drop a pin. However, the problem (and this exists with the default pushpin as well) is that clicking on the pushpin seems to be handled by the map control first so I end up dropping another pin, instead of registering an event on the pushpin. If I replace the pin with a ControlTemplate that is a button, I can trap the click, but now I don't have a draggable pushpin. Can anyone recommend a solution ?
