even easier, look at /proc/loadavg , it shows something like: $ cat /proc/loadavg 0.37 0.67 0.68 1/312 8594 First three numbers are, "the number of cpu's you would need to handle the current load". Meaning that on multi core you can have a load of 5 without a problem. The three numbers are averaged over different intervals (1, 5 and 15 minutes, according to man uptime )
