The idea that you can completely learn a new API died a long time ago, probably with Windows 3.0. The Windows API became so complex that it really was beyond the ability of most of us to learn it all, in the way you could for example learn all UNIX system calls. and there was no need - online documentation, easily searchable, made the learning unnecessary. Of course, what you do need to know is how an API (or a class library) is organised, and what its capabilities are, but there is no sense in learning what the third parameter of function call X is.
