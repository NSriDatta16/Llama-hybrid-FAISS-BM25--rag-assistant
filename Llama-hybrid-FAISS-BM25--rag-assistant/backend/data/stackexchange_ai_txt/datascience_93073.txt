I'm trying to do a time series model without a datetime field in python. Is this possible?

I have a dataset with data like this: Day Revenue 1 1.2 2 1.5 3 1.1 4 1.34 I want to do a time series model on it, but am getting this error: ValueError: view limit minimum -35.45 is less than 1 and is an invalid Matplotlib date value. This often happens if you pass a non-datetime value to an axis that has datetime units When I plt, it assigns all of the date to 1/1/1970. I understand why, because it's not a date time field. Out of curiosity, I tried converting the Day column to a datetime, but it assigned every day to 1/1/70. Is there a way to either convert the column to a datetime field and have it assign a new date starting with a specific date (say 1/1/2017, 1/2/2017, etc) or is there a work around when you just have the day counts (1,2,3,4)?
