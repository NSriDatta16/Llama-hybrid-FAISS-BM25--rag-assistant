Single scalar from vector

I am aware that this question is very general, but I found this question and it made me curious. What are the sensible ways that you can think of to derive a single scalar value from a vector? Of course this procedure will vary a lot according to your data and your purpose and will result in an information loss, but what are the alternatives? For now, this is what I have (from linked question and mine): Length . Compute the Euclidean norm for each vector. Max . Take the maximum value of the vector. Central tendency . Mean, median, mode etc. Measures of distribution shape . Skewness and Kurtosis. Dispersion . Variance, standard deviation, IQR, range, entropy, etc. Dimensionality reduction . Perform some kind of dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA, t-SNE, Isomap, etc.) to the vector set and keep the value of the first component. Distance from centroid . For every vector, compute the distance from the centroid and use this scalar as an index of the "eccentricity" of the vector.
