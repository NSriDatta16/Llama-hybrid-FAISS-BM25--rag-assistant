In clear violation of my Unix past I use c:\dev (for development) or whatever other drive I use for development. Note: It is advisable NOT to use the system partition for development as software development really fragments the disk. I never had any reason to use another directory - except for some projects where "company standards" forced everybody to have the development directory on the root of the C: drive. (really! They had hardcoded paths to c:\whatever) During development I sometimes check out multiple versions of the source to different directoies - if only to find out that the version committed into the version control system of the day really has every file checked in. (Sometimes I add a file to the development directory but forget to check it in.) So I think it is rather irrelevant where your development directory is, as long as the path is typable for you (I prefer short paths) and does not contain white space for the usual reasons on windows (if you want to do some scripting).
