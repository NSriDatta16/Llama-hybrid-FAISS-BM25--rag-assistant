A feasible approach would be to take a pre-trained model, like BERT, and fine-tune it on a small labeled dataset. For that, you may use Huggingface's Transformers, which makes all the steps in the process relatively easy (see their tutorial on doing exactly that: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training )
