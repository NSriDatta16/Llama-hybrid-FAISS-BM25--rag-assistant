The problem here is the broadness of the IMapper contract. It is too general - the NewsController wants to map something like News to NewsViewModel but IMapper just says "maps something to something." Instead, have a look at creating a generic variant such as IMapper . Then, you can set up container so that the NewsController receives an IMapper which is unambiguous and should uniquely match the NewsMapper component (however you decide to set that up.) Edit For examples/variants on the generic mapper theme see: http://consultingblogs.emc.com/owainwragg/archive/2010/12/15/automapper-profiles.aspx http://lucisferre.net/2009/12/31/graphite-update-the-automapfilter-for-model-e280933e-viewmodel-mapping/ Specifying a default Unity type mapping for a generic interface and class pair
