Many statistical tests are used to try to reject some null hypothesis. In this particular case the Ljung-Box test tries to reject the independence of some values. What does it mean? If p-value 1 : You can reject the null hypothesis assuming a 5% chance of making a mistake. So you can assume that your values are showing dependence on each other. If p-value > 0.05 1 : You don't have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So you can not assume that your values are dependent. This could mean that your values are dependent anyway or it can mean that your values are independent. But you are not proving any specific possibility, what your test actually said is that you can not assert the dependence of the values, neither can you assert the independence of the values. In general, what is important here is to keep in mind that p-value 0.05 does not let you confirm the null-hypothesis. In particular, you can not proof the independence of the values of Time Series using the Ljung-Box test. You can only prove the dependence. 1: I assumed $\alpha = 0.05$, which is a standard value of risk.
