What is the relation between belief networks and Bayesian networks?

How are Bayesian networks related to deep belief networks? Are they the same? From the post What is the difference between a neural network and a deep belief network? , I gathered that deep belief networks are like deep neural networks where the weights and biases are set by iterations of an unsupervised algorithm. (I hope I'm understanding that right anyway.)
