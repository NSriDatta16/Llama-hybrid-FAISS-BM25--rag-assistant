How can you tell if any Activity in your application is foregrounded?

I've got an Android app which has a periodic background Service. I want this Service to react differently depending on whether any Activities in my application are open. The issue is that the Service just keeps itself running via the AlarmManager making it on kind of on a separate "track" from the Activities, so I don't know whether the application is open when it runs. The best solution I can think of is to flip a boolean on/off whenever onResume() or onPause() is called in all my Activities, but this seems like a lot of footwork. Is there a simpler, more elegant solution?
