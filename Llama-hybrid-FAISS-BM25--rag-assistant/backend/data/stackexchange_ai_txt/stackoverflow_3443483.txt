A simple "median" function could produce smoother curves over a mostly un-smooth curve. Otherwise, a brute-force or genetic algorithm could be used; attempting to find the way to split the data into sections, so that more sections = worse solution, and less accuracy of the lines = worse solution. Another way would be like this: Start at the beginning. As soon as the line moves outside of some radius (3 above or 3 below the first, for instance) set the new height to an average of the current line's height and the previous marker. If you keep doing that, it would ignore small fluctuations. However, if the fluctuation was large enough, it would still effect it.
