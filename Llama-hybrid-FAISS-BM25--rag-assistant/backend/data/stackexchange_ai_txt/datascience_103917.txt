Your best bet is to use the ktrain python module. There are example notebooks for every NLP task (also very simple and easy to follow along) I'm not sure if your data is labeled or not. I'm assuming its not labeled therefore, I'd go with text regression example. Alternatively, you can choose text classification example and try to rephrase your problem to somehow incrementally reach the final probability you're going after. I would also encourage looking through all the examples and finding inspiration on how to specifically tackle your use-case. This module supports autoNLP with a range of data preprocessing tools. Also, you can specifically choose any model from the huggingface library.
