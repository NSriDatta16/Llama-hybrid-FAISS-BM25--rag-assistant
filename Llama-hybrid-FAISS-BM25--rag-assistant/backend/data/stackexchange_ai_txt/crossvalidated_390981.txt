It is possible to estimate the parameters based on this information, but to construct some (approximate) likelihood function based on the given information $n,Q_1, Q_3, \bar{X}_n$ do not see easy. In a way this is a followup on the answer by @BruceET, trying to formalize ideas in that answer. Using the theory of order statistics we can construct a likelihood function based on $n,Q_1, Q_3$ . How to also incorporate the observed mean do seem more difficult. To simplify I will assume $n=4k$ and that $X_{(k)}\le Q_1\le X_{(k+1)}$ and $X_{(3k)}\le Q_3\le X_{(3k+1)}$ . An exact analysis (if at all possible) for small $n$ would need to know exactly how the quartiles was computed (different methods can give quite different answers for small $n$ ). Then we can find the likelihood $$ L(\mu,\sigma) \propto \Phi(\frac{Q_1-\mu}{\sigma})^k \left[\Phi(\frac{Q_3-\mu}{\sigma})-\Phi(\frac{Q_1-\mu}{\sigma}) \right]^{2k}\left[1-\Phi(\frac{Q_3-\mu}{\sigma})\right]^k \cdot \phi(\frac{Q_1-\mu}{\sigma})\phi(\frac{Q_3-\mu}{\sigma})/\sigma^2 $$ where $\phi, \Phi$ are the standard normal pdf, cdf respectively. This can now be used as any other likelihood function. But to extend this to a likelihood also using the mean, we need the joint distribution of $Q_1, Q_3, \bar{X}_n$ and that would probably have to be approximated in some way. That seems like a nice little project! Other ideas to look into here is ABC (approximate bayesian computation) which seems a good fit to estimation based on (insufficient) summary statistics. Or maybe simulated maximum likelihood. I will come back here to look at that.
