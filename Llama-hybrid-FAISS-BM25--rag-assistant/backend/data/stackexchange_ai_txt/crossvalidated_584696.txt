Why is the expectation of a random vector still a vector?

In my previous post on derivation of covariance between y and random effect , for the following linear model: Frank's anwer proved cov(y, u) = ZD as below: Frank's proof involved E[u]. As far as I could understand, the random effect variable u in linear mixed model is a vector of 1*q, where q is the number of covariates in the model. My question is why the E[u] is not a single number? What I do not understand: If I have 3 random covariates in the model, then u MUST BE a vector of random variable of size 3*1. An example of u is as follows: then what is E[u]? I think u is only a column of numbers, so E[u] should be the average of c(1,2,3), which is 2. However, frank says the expectation of a random vector is still a vector. I know he is right but I do not see why. I want to see the answer E[u] for my example so that I could really see what is E[u], including its dimension and how each number in E[u] is derived.
