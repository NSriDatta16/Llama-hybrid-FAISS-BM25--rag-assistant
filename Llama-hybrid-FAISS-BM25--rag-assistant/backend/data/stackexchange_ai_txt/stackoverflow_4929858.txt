The difference between a Backbone.View and a Backbone.Controller is that the Controller has the routes architecture, and the corresponding Backbone.History() listener, which pays attention to the part of the URL after the hash tag (#). Fundamentally, this means that a Backbone.Controller provides bookmarkable URLs. Because you can hand-write the hash portion, and bookmark them, the Bookmark.Controller should only refer to objects for which it makes sense to display a GETtable item. I've written a little tutorial, http://www.elfsternberg.com/2010/12/08/backbonejs-introducing-backbone-store/ , a port of the Sammy tutorial of The Backbone Store. If you follow the link to the GitHub repository, you can also get the latest version.
