why tuckey UrlRewriteFilter outbound-rule mapping did not work?

I'm using urlrewritefilter to pretty up my product links for a better google indexing (removing product parameter). example: .../product/snowboarda is transferred via url rewriting rule to .../product.seam?product=snowboarda rewriting rule ^/product/([a-zA-Z]+)$ /product.seam?product=$1 But my problem is that I've no idea at the moment how to rewrite outbound links in my facelets. I read the paragraph about outbound-rule in the in the manual . Now I'm wondering how I can use this together with s:link ? what about form submits or redirects (action outcome null)? please help to sort things out :) possible rewriting outbound rule (?) ^/product.seam?product=([a-zA-Z]+)$ /product/$1 any hints/ideas?
