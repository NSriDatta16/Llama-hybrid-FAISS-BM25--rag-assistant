Manual simulation of Markov Chain in R

Consider the Markov chain with state space S = {1, 2} , transition matrix and initial distribution Î± = (1/2, 1/2) . Simulate 5 steps of the Markov chain (that is, simulate X 0 , X 1 , . . . , X 5 ). Repeat the simulation 100 times. Use the results of your simulations to solve the following problems. Estimate P(X 1 = 1|X 0 = 1) . Compare your result with the exact probability. My solution: # returns Xn func2 What is the difference if I run this code once versus 100 times (as is said in the problem-statement)? How can I find the conditional probability from here on?
