running the consumer example at my machine, i get the following error: Got no response code when fetching https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id CURL error (60): SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed this means curl fails verifying google's https server certificate. you can workaround this by either providing curl with CA certificates to verify google's certificate via CURLOPT_CAINFO / CURLOPT_CAPATH , or - easier - stop validating the cert via CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER . the following change in Auth/Yadis/ParanoidHTTPFetcher.php accomplishes latter for me: --- ParanoidHTTPFetcher.php.orig 2009-04-22 02:31:20.000000000 +0800 +++ ParanoidHTTPFetcher.php 2009-09-30 22:35:24.093750000 +0800 @@ -127,6 +127,9 @@ Auth_OpenID_USER_AGENT.'
