Give me real time access to a video's frames, and allow me to modify them Are you looking to get the uncompressed video frames and modify them before they are rendered? Or do you want to modify the video frames, saving them back to a media file? The first one would be slightly easier. Even though DirectShow may seem complicated at first, it really is an elegant framework. I would strong suggest looking at the DirectShow.NET samples. To get access to the frames of the video, you'd simply configure and add a SampleGrabber filter to the DirectShow graph, do a graph.RenderFile(mymediafile, null), and you will receive a callback for each frame. You can modify the pixel data and it will appear on the rendered video. This should not take more than 1 page of code. I have an example source code on using SampleGrabber , but it's made for web cameras. Playing media is much easier (graph.RenderFile!). If you need to write this stuff to a file, you'd do something similar to what is described above, but instead of using a video renderer, you'd have to configure the graph to use video encoders and muxers. Probably not fun for someone new to DirectShow ;). If you just wish to get frames there is a VERY simple interface in directshow called IMediaDet. I have written a simple class to easily extract out any frames from a media file. It's geared towards WPF, but you can gut it to work with straight GDI.
