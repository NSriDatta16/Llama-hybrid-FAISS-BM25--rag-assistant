What could cause the error message 'Target "1" does not exist in the project "xxx".' running Ant on Windows?

I'm using ant.bat (in Ant 1.7.1) to build the all target in a build.xml file, on Windows 2003 Server. (I've substituted "xxx" in the error message for the project name in that file.) It builds successfully, but then ends with: 2009-06-10 17:26:03 | all: 2009-06-10 17:26:03 | 2009-06-10 17:26:03 | BUILD FAILED 2009-06-10 17:26:03 | Target "1" does not exist in the project "xxx". ...and returns with a non-zero error code. I've searched build.xml unsuccessfully for anything that might lead to this error. (There is no target "1", of course, nor any dependencies that might resolve "1".) I'm hoping someone out there might recall seeing this. I don't expect anyone to debug the XML for me, but a Google search turned up http://simile.mit.edu/mail/ReadMsg?listId=9&msgId=2735 , which contains "I found an email thread on this problem and will retry.". I wish I could find that thread. Update - here's the command-line: D:/build/toolchain/noarch/ant-1.7.1/bin/ant.bat all -DBRANCH_NAME="main" -DBUILD_NUMBER="66675" -DCHANGE_NUMBER="1061789" -DGOBUILD_AUTO_COMPONENTS= -DGOBUILD_OFFICIAL_BUILD=1 -DGOBUILD_VICLIB_ROOT=d:/build/ob/bora-66675/compcache//viclib/ob-65655/windows -DGOBUILD_VIMBASE_ROOT=d:/build/ob/bora-66675/compcache//vimbase/ob-64494/windows -DOBJDIR="beta" -DPRODUCT_BUILD_NUMBER="82" -DPUBLISH_DIR="d:/build/ob/bora-66675/publish" -DRELTYPE="beta" -DREMOTE_COPY_SCRIPT="D:/build/toolchain/win32/python-2.5/python.exe D:/build/gobuild/script/gobuildc.py bora-66675"' Hopefully it's of some help.
