magento - error on checkout page

I am in the middle of translating a english shop to French for a client. However, something appears to have broken. On the checkout page, when I click the continue button to allow for first time registration, nothing happens. Even stranger, on the actual page I can see the following code appearing underneath the button: yCode == Event.KEY_RETURN) { loginForm.submit(); } } Any idea what might be wrong here? Regards, Fiona
