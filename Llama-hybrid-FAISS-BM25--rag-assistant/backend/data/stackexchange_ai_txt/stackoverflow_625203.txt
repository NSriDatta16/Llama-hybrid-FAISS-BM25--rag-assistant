For me, CHM is still the answer. I build CHM files with the Sandcastle Help File Builder tool that is available on Codeplex. The concerns about the accessibility of CHM are valid. To address that, I produced a CHM-to-Web converter pretty easily, with some IStorage hacking, a text search-and-replace, and an XSL transform. This page is a web site that was produced automatically in about 8 seconds. It has an expand/collapse treeview on the left-hand-side nav. Frames based (not very URL friendly) but it works well enough.
