HtmlUnit and Fragment Identities

I'm currently wondering how to deal with fragment identities, a link that I am wanting to grab information from, contains a fragment identity. It seems as if HtmlUnit is discarding the "#/db4mj" of my url and therefore loading the original url. Does anyone know of a way to deal with fragment identities? (I can post example code to further explain if need be) EDIT Since I wasn't getting many views (and no answers), I'm going to add a bounty. Sorry it's only 50, but I only had 79 to start with EDIT Here is an example code as requested. Our URL will be: http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psbrushes/?order=9&offset=0 So if you take a look at the content in the link, you'll see multiple brushes that contain URLs as well. So my script grabs the URL: http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psbrushes/?order=9&offset=0#/dbwam4 As you can see there is the fragment identifier #/dbwam4 Now I try and grab the content that is on this page, but HtmlUnit still thinks it is on the original URL. Here is an the example code in my script where it fails on the fragment identifier URL but has no problem with the original URL. client = new WebClient(BrowserVersion.FIREFOX_3) client.javaScriptEnabled = false page = client.getPage(url) //url with fragment identifier //this is on the url with the fragment identifier only, not the original url img = page.getByXPath("*[@id="gmi-ResViewSizer_img"]") I'm expecting to be able to grab certain information from the URL with the fragment identifier but am unable to access it whatsoever.
