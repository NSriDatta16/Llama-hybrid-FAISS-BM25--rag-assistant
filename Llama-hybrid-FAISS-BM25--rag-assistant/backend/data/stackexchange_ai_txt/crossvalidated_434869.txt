This is not an example of Simpson's Paradox. It is directly related to the weighting of the Electoral College and its winner-take-all nature. Simpson's Paradox generally requires an inbalance in the participation in two categories. To generate that, you would need something where candidates can participate unequally across states. For example, we could get a Simpson's Paradox by looking at rally attendance if the candidates travel to different types of locations/venues. For example: ======== ============================= =========================== ================ Candiate Avg. in Small States (number) Avg. in Big States (number) Total Attendance ======== ============================= =========================== ================ A 10,000 (5) 40,000 (10) **450,000** B **15,000 (10)** **50,000 (5)** 400,000 ======== ============================= =========================== ================ Candidate B has larger average attendance in both types of states, but visits small states more often than big states. If you look at total rally attendace (or average, since they have the same number of rallies), Candidate A appears to draw larger crowds. Because the candidates participate in the same states for the election (assuming you don't have a case where candidates skip states altogether), you can't get this kind of unbalanced design.
