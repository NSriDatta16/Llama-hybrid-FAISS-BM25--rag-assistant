Which format to create logs in profilers?

In the profiler I am writing, which is in fact a JVMTI agent for Java programs, I need a format to log the events collected. Further these logs have to be send to a socket and read by a GUI somewhere else. So I need a working serialization between two languages. I already implemented my own protocol in XML and it worked very well. However I was told to consider another format. As XML building might be very slow and every additional code executed in the profiler influences heavily the profiled program. This is true, but does XML DOM Building take that long? I used TinyXML so far. I hope no one points to RapidXML, as I hope there are not that different on a not-embedded machine. What do you think? Currently I am trying to reimplement it with protobuf, which claims to be n times faster then XML.
