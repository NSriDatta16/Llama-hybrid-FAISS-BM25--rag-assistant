Flash security: problem loading Flash 8 AS2 modules into Flash 6 AS1 module

I have an old program written in Actionscript 1, compiled in Flash 6. It loads 10 other modules, of which 3 are written in Actionscript 2, compiled in Flash 8. The original program is embedded into an html and works perfectly when the html file is run on a webserver. But if I just drag the html file to my browser, the 3 AS2 modules will not load. Or, more accurately, they do load but I can't access their functions. All the modules are compiled with "local playback security=access local files only". I am using Flash CS3 to compile all the modules. Without rewriting the main loading module to AS2, is there anything I can do to solve this? Thanks
