Confidence Versus Prediction Intervals using Quantile Regression / Quantile Loss Function

If you fit a quantile regression for the 5th and 95th percentile this is often described as an estimate of a 90% prediction interval. This is the most prevalent it seems in the machine learning domain where random forests has been adapted to predict the quantiles of each leaf node or GBM with a quantile loss function. Is this best characterized as a confidence or prediction interval and why?
