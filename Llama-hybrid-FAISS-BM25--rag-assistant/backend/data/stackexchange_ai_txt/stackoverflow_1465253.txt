CreateObject("WXZ.Agent.1", "RemoteServerName") Permission denied. How can a username and password be supplied?

Hi I'm trying to use CreateObject to DCOM to a service running on a remote machine. I get the error "Permission denied: 'CreateObject'", which is kind of what I expected. I'm wondering though, how can I supply credentials to this call of a user who I know has permissions on the target machine to create the object? Is this possible? Or do I have to be logged on as a user who has the right permissions? Thanks in advance.
