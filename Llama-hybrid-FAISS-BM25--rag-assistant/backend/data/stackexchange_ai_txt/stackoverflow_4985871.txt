I just had this issue and found the solution was the true attribute in my maven-war-plugin org.apache.maven.plugins maven-war-plugin ${plugin-war-version} false true false So setting this to false (false) solved my issue. I blogged about it as well: http://www.baselogic.com/blog/development/java-javaee-j2ee/propertynotfoundexception-target-unreachable-identifier-patientbean-resolved-to-null
