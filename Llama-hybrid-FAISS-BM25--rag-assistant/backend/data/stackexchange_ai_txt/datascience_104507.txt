Following is a direction you might want to explore - You can build a closed domain question answering model using massive amounts of text. And then give a single word as an input to the model. More details about this can be found here . In short, in closed-book question answering, large language models like T5 or GPT-3 memorize some facts during pre-training and can generate an answer without explicit context (unlike normal question answering models). You will need to build and annotate the datasets accordingly for your task.
