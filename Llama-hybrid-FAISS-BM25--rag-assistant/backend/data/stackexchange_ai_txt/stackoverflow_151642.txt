Best thing I can think of is to encode it yourself. How about this subroutine? from urllib2 import Request, urlopen from binascii import b2a_base64 def b64open(url, postdata): req = Request(url, b2a_base64(postdata), headers={'Content-Transfer-Encoding': 'base64'}) return urlopen(req) conn = b64open("http://www.whatever.com/script.cgi", u"Liberté Égalité Fraternité") # returns a file-like object (Okay, so this code just sends POST-data. But you apparently want multipart-encoded data, as if you clicked an "Upload File" button, right? Well, it's a pretty straightforward combination of what I have here and the answers from the question you linked.)
