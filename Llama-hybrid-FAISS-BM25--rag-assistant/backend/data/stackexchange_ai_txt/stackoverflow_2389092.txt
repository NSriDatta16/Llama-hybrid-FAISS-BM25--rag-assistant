I, too, needed to override default options and took me a while to figure out for jQuery UI 1.8: $.extend($.ui.dialog.prototype.options, { modal: true, resizable: false, draggable: false }); The above code will allow you to drop anything on top of the dialog options. The above method should work for most UI components (it will also let you prototype over the functions that exist, or add to).
