I am using Iron Python, not professionally, unfortunately, but as a Rapid Development language for my personal projects. Python is such a great language for ease of use, brevity but readability of code and simplicity. Some of this is due to it being a dynamic language, but also its basic syntax. I am, however no cpython guru, and can get so much more out of Iron Python than cpython as I can easily leverage the .NET platform, on which I am far more at home. I am disappointed there is currently no port to the Twisted libraries in cpython, the only extended Python libraries I am comfortable with, as they would be so useful in .NET. I also use the interactive window just to test .NET structures when I am coding in C#.
