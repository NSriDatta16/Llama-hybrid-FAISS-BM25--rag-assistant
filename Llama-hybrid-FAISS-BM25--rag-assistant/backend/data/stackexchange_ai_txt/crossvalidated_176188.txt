Possible to train classifiers in parallel on clusters?

Is it possible to train classifiers on data in parallel on supercomputer cluster? I think it makes sense when bagging. But what about in the case of something like SVM? Can this be only done by creating subsets of data? Does this tend to be easier with neural nets? If so, why? Thanks!
