Storage engine for specific case

What database can you recomend for such case: Very lot of inserts and updates Sophisticated queries (SQL or something like it) Lot of data, but small amount of frequently accessed (can be in memory) It's OK to loose part of data (recent hour for example) in case of crash (but not everything) Possible solutions and problems with it: Redis - looks good, but it doesn't support complex queries. RDBMS (current solution) - guarantee ACID and use hard disc a lot so updates is too slow RDBMS + RAM disc - will use OS swap, recovery problems, and in general look not very reliable MongoDB - has server level lock on writes, is it really fast?
