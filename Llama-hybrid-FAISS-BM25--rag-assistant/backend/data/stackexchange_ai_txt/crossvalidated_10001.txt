Optimized implementations of the Random Forest algorithm

I have noticed that there are a few implementations of random forest such as ALGLIB, Waffles and some R packages like randomForest . Can anybody tell me whether these libraries are highly optimized? Are they basically equivalent to the random forests as detailed in The Elements of Statistical Learning or have a lot of extra tricks been added? I hope this question is specific enough. As an illustration of the type of answer I am looking for, if somebody asked me whether the linear algebra package BLAS was highly optimized, I would say it was extremely highly optimized and mostly not worth trying to improve upon except in very specialized applications.
