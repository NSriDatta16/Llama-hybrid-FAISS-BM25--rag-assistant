You're right. In this 2011 slideshow , equation (4), slide 6, shows the missing term. As you mention it, the interpretation to keep in mind is that a triple difference is a difference between two differences in differences. You're right to mention that the estimation requires you to omit a reference category for your time, state and age group fixed effects (to avoid collinearity). However, the choice of the reference category should not matter for the estimator of the triple-difference term. Note that you can write directly your dummies as interactions between time periods, states, and age groups, see the equation in Pischke's lecture notes (bottom of p.16). One way to frame the identification assumption is the following. In standard DiD, you would like your two groups to have evolved in a similar way if treatment had not existed. In triple difference, you would like the gap between your treated stated and your states to evolve similarly over time for older and younger individuals, in the absence of the treatment. You could also frame it switching states and age groups. The way you would empirically test this would first be to eyeball the trends before treatment happened (if you have data before it happens). In a DiD case, you would just plot the treated and control average for each year before treatment. In the triple difference case, you could do the same with four lines or, more conveniently, you could plot gaps between treated and control states, for each age group and year, and check whether they are parallel.
