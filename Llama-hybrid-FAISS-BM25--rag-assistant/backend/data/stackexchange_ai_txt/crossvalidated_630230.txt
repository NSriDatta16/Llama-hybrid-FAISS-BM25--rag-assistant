Should you average loss and accuracy across epochs or steps?

In a typical training loop what is the correct way to report and average metrics like accuracy and loss. Should you maintain a running average through the whole process or reset it each epoch. What is the impact of doing either on and is one more correct? train_loss = 0 num_samples = 0 for i in range(EPOCHS): for batch in dataset: loss = model(batch) train_loss += loss num_samples += len(batch) print("training loss: ", train_loss / num_samples) versus for i in range(EPOCHS): train_loss = 0 num_samples = 0 for batch in dataset: loss = model(batch) train_loss += loss num_samples += len(batch) print("training loss: ", train_loss / num_samples)
