Why do we want an objective function to be a convex function?

I understand that a convex function is a great object function since a local minimum is the global minimum. However, there are non-convex functions that also carry this property. For example, this figure shows a non-convex function that carries the above property. It seems to me that, as long as the local minimum is the global minimum, we should be able to use gradient-decent (or similar methods) to find the global minimum. So, my question is, why do convex functions get more attention, compared to other functions that also carry the above property? Thanks! [UPDATE] Thanks for many of the great comments and answers. I self-learned concepts of optimization and I admit many of my wording are imprecise. Do you have any suggested references for more practical aspects of convex optimization? Boyd's book is probably too intense for me.
