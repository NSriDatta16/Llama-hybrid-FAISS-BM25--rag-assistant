The Bias-Variance Decomposition is done to the prediction error on a fixed observation in the test set. We assume we resample our training set again and again and re-train the model with each of the resampled train sets. For example, the estimation of the error goes in this way: After we get $N$ train sets by resampling, we fit $N$ models with each of $N$ train sets. With the each of fitted models, we make a prediction on the same observation(OOS) in the test set. With the predictions, we will have $N$ predicted values, and the expected value of errors is calculated by taking the average of all the prediction errors. The bias-variance decomposition states that the estimated error consists of error from bias, error from variance, and reducible error.
