How can I calculate the effect of my equipment on my sport's performance?

I'm doing a stationary sport like golf, so the details matter. I'm recording each of my scores with detailed information about the equipment I'm using, and the weather conditions. So 1 score has 2-3 pieces of equipment attached to it. I can plot averages for may main piece of equipment, but then how do I isolate the effect of the others(performance accessories/safety equipment)?
