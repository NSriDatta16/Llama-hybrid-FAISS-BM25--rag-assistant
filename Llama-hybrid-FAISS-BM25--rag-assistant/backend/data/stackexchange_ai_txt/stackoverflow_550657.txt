We refresh stats every night. No sense waiting for the Weekend if the stats could be refreshed nightly - by Friday they will be worse than they were on Monday ... Problem is what if it takes too long? For databases which have that problem we refresh stats on certain tables each night - so some tables are done every night, some less often. (We have a database table of which tables to do when, and a history of how long the Stats took to regenerate, and tune the schedule accordingly) if the stats are 6-8 months old how detrimental to the performance of the database is this going to be I would be very surprised if it didn't make a huge difference on a table growing by 1 million rows-per-month If that is your actual state I would expect that the tables need defragging too
