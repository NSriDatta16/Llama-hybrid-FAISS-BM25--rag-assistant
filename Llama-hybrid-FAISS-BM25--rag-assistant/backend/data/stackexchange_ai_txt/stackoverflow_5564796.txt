A virtual function call is actually a callback. The caller looks up the corresponding entry in the object's virtual function table and calls it. That's exactly like a callback behaves, except that member function pointers have awkward syntax. Virtual functions offload the work to the compiler, which makes them a very elegant solution. Virtual functions are the way to communicate within the inheritance hierarchy.
