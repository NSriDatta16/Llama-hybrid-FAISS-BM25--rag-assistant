Comparing 2 time series in R

I was wondering what kind of tests one would use to compare these two time series. The first data set(in percentages) are results from a weekly survey that asks a YES/NO question on whether someone has a full time job. The second data set are weekly sales totals. I have the same number of data points (300). Any suggestions on what types of analysis I could do with this set? or how to analyze the trends? So far I attempted a Cross correlation Function in R and found a 0.39 correlation when the survey data leads by 3 weeks. I also compared the HoltWinters exponentially smoothed daily values with the daily sales values and found a maximum correlation of 0.45 at lead = 12. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks
