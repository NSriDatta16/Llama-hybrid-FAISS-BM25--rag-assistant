On a site I worked on I started off doign odd/even table row styling with jQuery because the syntax is trivial as well as some other table styling. But then for larger tables I began perforamnce testing it and on Firefox 3 (which is reasonably performance for the modern browsers) I was spending as much as 200-500ms (according to YSlow) rendering the page, which is unacceptably high. You want to do as much as you possibly can on the server--basically anything you can do on the server while rendering the page you should. It'll be much quicker that way. Save jQuery for the things you can't do on the server.
