Even though optimization algorithms are fast on modern computers, the likelihood function of an ARMA model can be sufficiently complicated to make the computing time noticeable. Try fitting an ARMA(5,0) model on a 1000-long time series a thousand times, and you will find yourself bored waiting (takes 60 seconds on an i7-6600U Skylake processor or 97 seconds on a i5-2410M Sandy Bridge processor). Try it yourself: set.seed(1); x=rnorm(1000) Sys.time(); for(i in 1:1000) m=arima(x,order=c(5,0,0),method="ML"); Sys.time() When you need to run this for tens of thousands or millions of time series (instead of just a thousand), even supercomputers might sweat. The same estimations with CSS are some 8-9 times faster (7 seconds on i7 Skylake and 11 seconds on i5 Sandy Bridge). (Replace "ML" with "CSS" in the code above.) If computational time is not a problem, you could prefer exact MLE to CSS for small or medium samples as the effect of the initial conditions are often noticeable (that can be simulated, too). In really large samples this might not matter much.
