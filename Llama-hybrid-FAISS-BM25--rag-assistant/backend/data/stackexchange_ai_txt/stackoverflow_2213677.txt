Remove(), Clear() or Dispose()

Simple question... I have controls that the user can drag around on my form at runtime. And they can also delete them... Should I just Call .Dispose(); when they click the delete button, or should I do something like panel1.Controls.Clear(Control); ? ...Or something else? Thanks :) Bael
