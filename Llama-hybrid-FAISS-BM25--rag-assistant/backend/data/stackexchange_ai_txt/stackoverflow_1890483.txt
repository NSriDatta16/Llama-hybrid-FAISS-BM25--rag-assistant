I also agree that chaining is the best method to use, but something else no one has address here is using .andSelf() ( 1 ) and .end() ( 2 ) while chaining. The following adds the "border" class to both the div and the p contained within. $("div").find("p").andSelf().addClass("border"); Using .end() "resets" the selector $("div") .find("p").addClass("myParagraph").end() .find("span").addClass("mySpan"); Update: .andSelf() has been deprecated and essentially renamed to .addBack() , use it in the same manner.
