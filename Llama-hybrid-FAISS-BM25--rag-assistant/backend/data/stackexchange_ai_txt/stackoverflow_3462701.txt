Creating a WordPress plug-in that needs Authentication

I want to create a WordPress plug-in but also want to ensure that the plugin can only be used after it has been activated with a serial key that should be unique for each domain. What is the best way to go about it assuming: I have to give the actual source code to the users and cannot have a VideoPress type of security - which is just a JavaScript wrapper for the actual content that comes from the plugin's server. I want to ensure that a novice to average PHP developer will not be able to cirumvent the security easily. The simplest solution is to have a server that will be able to serve as an endpoint for verifying if the domain that the request is coming from is the correct one or not (an Ajax call on plugin-install, init etc). But, there is nothing stopping the end user to just simply remove those bits of code and make it work without the authentication. I just want to make this a little tougher.
