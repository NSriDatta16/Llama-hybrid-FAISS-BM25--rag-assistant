Dealing with outlier data causing a non-linearity for logistic regression model

I'm building a logistic regression model where yes is the target, one of the attributes spnr_avg_spend_mod is shown below. It is a continuous variable but has been binned up into 10 bins using pd.qcut . As shown in the image below, apart from the first data point there is a linear decrease in the proportion of yes with increasing spend (increasing spnr_avg_spend_mod ). I am looking for ideas/methods on how to deal to this when modelling as it is a nice feature apart from that point. In [14]: df Out[25]: spnr_avg_spend_mod yes 0 0 0.474293 1 1 0.531138 2 2 0.533260 3 3 0.503260 4 4 0.503418 5 5 0.482936 6 6 0.479729 7 7 0.460062 8 8 0.450755 9 9 0.421202 In [15]: plt.scatter(df.spnr_avg_spend_mod, df.yes) Out[15]:
