No, C only automatically initializes all the members to 0 when your variable has static storage, otherwise you have to write: struct TableEntry tableEntry [MAXSCOPE][MAXSIZE] = {0}; If your tableEntry is a global variable or declared static inside a function, then you don't need the = {0} part. Then you can use memset to reinitialize some of the entries afterwards: memset(tableEntry[1], 0, sizeof(struct TableEntry) * MAXSIZE); will reinitialize tableEntry[1][0] ... tableEntry[1][MAXSIZE - 1] to 0 .
