No, not really. If you have to check, you have to check. You could replace the if with a ternary operator but that will almost certainly compile down to the same code. Unless the size() method is particularly convoluted, I can't see it dragging down the performance that much. You may get some speed improvement by caching the value in the Stack class (I'm assuming v is a vector of some sort). However, if it is a vector, it's perfectly capable of acting as a stack on its own so you can let it raise its own exceptions rather than imposing your exceptions on it. The only thing you're missing is the exch method which you could do as: a = v.back(); v.pop_back(); b = v.back(); v.pop_back(); v.push_back(a); v.push_back(b);
