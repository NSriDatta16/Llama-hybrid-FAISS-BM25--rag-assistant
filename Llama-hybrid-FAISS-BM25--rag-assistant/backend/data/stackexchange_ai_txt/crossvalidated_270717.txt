This type of naive procedure will not ever keep the type 1 error rate or FDR (or would require extreme contortions to do so). In fact, it is also a pretty poor approach to what is effectively model building with some steps using unadjusted analyses (why??) or several steps being conditional on not rejecting a null. That kind of thing is simply guaranteed to be problematic. Combining a more reasonable exploratory model building approach that has some chance of producing reasonably calibrated SEs/CIs with e.g. Hochberg (or using a Bayesian hierarchical shrnkage model from the start) might be a better way of approximately controlling the FDR.
