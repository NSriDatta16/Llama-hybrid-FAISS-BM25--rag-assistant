There's no need to shuffle data for SVM , as it's nonparametric learning algorithm, moreover most built-in implementation uses the Sequential minimal optimization ( SMO ) algorithm, the algorithm uses a heuristic for choosing which example eligible for optimization. It's not a part of your question, but I would like to mention that normalization going to hurt your objective ( outliers detection ), as there's some trade off between normalization and outliers , roughly speaking by normalizing input-space you are going to reduce the outliers (influence), and for SVM it's meant that, the distance (i.e. support vectors linear response ) going to be reduced too.
