How to prevent/tell if Decision Tree is overfitting?

In SKLearn's documentation on Decision Trees, they say we should pay special attention not to overfit the tree. How can we do this? I am aware that using random forests may prevent it, but how do I generally tell if it's overfitting? Can you tell by an accuracy score? Is, for example, a 0.99 accuracy score an indicator of overfitting? Would in this case 0.95 mean not overfitting? What are some best practices in addition to a balanced input to avoid overfitting (especially with using SKLearn)?
