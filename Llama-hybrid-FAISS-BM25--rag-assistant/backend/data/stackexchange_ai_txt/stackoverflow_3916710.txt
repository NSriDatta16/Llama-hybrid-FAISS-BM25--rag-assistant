UNIX Timestamp 32-bit problem seems to be pretty annoying for users who enter future dates in 2038+. Either use the DATETIME sequence for MySQL, or store your dates as BIGINT(8) unsigned (max: 18 quintillion) or FLOAT so that you can enter large numbers. Then you cannot use for example PHP's date() function because it only allows integers as parameter (limited by 32-bit systems). The solution I found is to use PHP 5.2.0 functions. Here's the DateTime PHP solution . No need to change UNIX_TIMESTAMP format. As long as you have BIGINT(8) unsigned as your MySQL storage for timestamps. You won't be limited by 32-bit systems anymore.
