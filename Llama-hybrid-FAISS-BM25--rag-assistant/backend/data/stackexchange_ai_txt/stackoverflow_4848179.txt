Error in maven while downloading dependencies

My project1 and project2 were working fine with maven builds. Recently I upgraded from maven2 to maven3 using this tutorial (I checked it on maven2,but it didn't work either). Everything worked and is working fine for project2 which has a private (self hosted) Nexus repo. But, now I am getting error while downloading dependencies for my project1 (using public maven repo). My pom.xml: 4.0.0 com.dds.server.DDSStartup storage 1.0-SNAPSHOT jar storage http://maven.apache.org UTF-8 junit junit 3.8.1 test com.google.guava guava r07 log4j log4j 1.2.16 com.sleepycat je 3.3.75 com.google.protobuf protobuf-java 2.3.0 jgroups jgroups-all 2.4.1 oracleReleases Oracle Released Java Packages http://download.oracle.com/maven default Where am I going wrong, this is the error I get when I do a : mvn clean package [ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project storage: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.dds.server.DDSStartup:DynamicDistributedStorage:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies for [junit:junit:jar:3.8.1 (test), com.google.guava:guava:jar:r07 (compile), log4j:log4j:jar:1.2.16 (compile), com.sleepycat:je:jar:3.3.75 (compile), com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:jar:2.3.0 (compile), jgroups:jgroups-all:jar:2.4.1 (compile)]: Failed to read artifact descriptor for log4j:log4j:jar:1.2.6: Could not transfer artifact log4j:log4j:pom:1.2.6 from/to oracleReleases (http://download.oracle.com/maven): /Users/username/.m2/repository/log4j/log4j/1.2.6/log4j-1.2.6.pom.ahc65d8d087349b4a46 (No such file or directory) -> [Help 1] UPDATE: I deleted everything (workspace), imported the project again and it worked like a charm. Nothing can beat that solution! ;)
