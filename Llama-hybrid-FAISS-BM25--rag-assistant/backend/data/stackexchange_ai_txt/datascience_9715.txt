is neural networks an online algorithm by nature?

I have been doing machine learning for a while, but bits and pieces come together even after some time of practicing. In neural networks, you adjust the weights by doing one pass (forward pass), and then computing the partial derivatives for the weights (backward pass) after each training example - and subtracting those partial derivatives from the initial weights. in turn, the calculation of the new weights is mathematically complex (you need to compute the partial derivative of the weights, for which you compute the error at every layer of the neural net - but the input layer). Is that not by definition an online algorithm, where cost and new weights are calculated after each training example? Thanks!
