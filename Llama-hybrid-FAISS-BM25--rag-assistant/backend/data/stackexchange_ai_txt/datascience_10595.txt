difference between logistic regression and binary logistic regression

In xgboost R package, there are two objectives given with booster gbtree . reg:logistic binary:logistic See,page 22 (first 2 lines) https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf I was wondering, what is the difference between these two methods?
