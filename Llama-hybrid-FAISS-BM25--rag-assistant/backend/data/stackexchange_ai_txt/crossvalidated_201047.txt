convert beta estimates from linear regression to estimates you would get from logistic regression

I employed a software package on binary data thats takes a long time to run (e.g. a week) that used a multilevel mixed model (linear) instead of a logistic model; the significance is very similar between the models, and the software says its appropriate for binary data as outcome, but it doesn't give the right estimates you would get from a logistic regression. Is it possible to correctly convert linear regression coefficients to coefficients you get from logistic regression?
