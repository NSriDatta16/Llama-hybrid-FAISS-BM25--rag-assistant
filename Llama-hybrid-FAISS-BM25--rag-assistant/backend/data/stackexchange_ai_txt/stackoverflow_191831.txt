What do I need to re-build my web server?

I am getting ready to completely overhaul my web server. I use it for both development and to present product to clients. It also hosts my company website. I will be loading MS Server 2008 and MS SQL 2008. I want it to have the latest .NET Framework as well as the latest MVC templates. I want it to use SubSonic. I also want to start using some sort of SourceSafe (or whatever a good one is).I plan to use VS 2008 as my development tool. I figure there are a lot of people out there who have recently gone through this and will have good suggestions. It is a good stout machine with lots of memory and storage, so, please let me know anything that will help me become a better developer. Scott and the Dev Team
