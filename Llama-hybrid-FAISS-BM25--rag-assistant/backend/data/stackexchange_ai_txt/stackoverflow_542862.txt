No indent for paragraphs after figures?

The default style for my document is that paragraphs are indented. That's fine. But I need no indentation for paragraphs that follow a figure or other objects. Using \noindent manually does not work well, because you don't know which paragraph will follow the figure in the final output (LaTeX places figures automatically). So I need paragraphs that follow figures in the output to not be indented (in the tex source you can't see which ones that would be). How can that be achieved?
