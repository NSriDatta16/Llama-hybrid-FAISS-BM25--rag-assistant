The "MachineStore" options are not available in Silverlight, there are just "Application" and "Site". Both are scoped by the user..since the files are stored under the user's AppData on Windows. Apps in-browser and out-of-browser share the same Isolated Storage stores. [edit..I missed part of your question the first time]: The Isolated Storage stores are not part of the browser cache, so they are not cleared when the browser cache is cleared. As a developer, you can delete things programmatically. As a user, you can use the Silverlight configuration UI (i.e. the right-click menu) to manage the stores - it's called "Application Storage" to the user. Finally, an intrepid user can locate the files on disk and delete them manually...they are hidden so they won't show up in a normal search, but a determined user can still find them.
