Can someone explain how dual averaging helps the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) choose step-size adaptively?

I have read both the original NUTS paper and also the dual averaging paper by Nesterov but due to my lack of background knowledge in optimisation, I don't really understand how dual averaging works. In particular, I don't understand why the update scheme below will cause the step size to converge to a value such that we get the acceptance probability we want. Any help/intuition will be appreciated. Thank you.
