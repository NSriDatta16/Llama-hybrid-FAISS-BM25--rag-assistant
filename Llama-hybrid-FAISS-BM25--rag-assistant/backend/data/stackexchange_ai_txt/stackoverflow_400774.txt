I began professional programming with Visual Basic 3.0 around a decade ago, and I was probably the last guy to migrate to .NET (I did it in 2004). So you COULDN'T find a bigger admirer of the platform than me. I don't think Visual Basic 6.0 is going to go away soon. There're are a lot of legacy applications written in it. Company accounting software, customised tools, you name them. So the applications will be around. The number of fresh Visual Basic 6.0 applications is going down in a spiral, so if you're looking to make a career as a Visual Basic 6.0 programmer, you're obsolete. That said, there will be a pretty strong demand for people who can maintain/fix/upgrade old code. I've got software written in Visual Basic 6.0 that's got about a 100 thousand users, and is still going strong. All of my fresh development is in C#, but for this particular software, I think I will re-write it in C# by 2009 end, or 2010 beginning. So at least till then I don't see Visual Basic 6.0 being not supported by Windows.
