If you were able to easily run SVM and other ML models then your dataset is not "non-vector like". You had to somehow represent your data in a way that is understandable by SVM and other methods - if you did encode them to vector format then your data is vector like . If you, however used some tricky kernel, which fitted model to raw, non vector data (such as text, or graph) you could advocate the term "non-vector like", however this is purely linguistic as "under the hood", SVM always works on vectors, sometimes in a very weird spaces, yet still vector, Hilbert spaces.
