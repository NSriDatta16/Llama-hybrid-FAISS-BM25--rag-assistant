Looks like you might want to do a time series similarity analysis. There is a SAS procedure called PROC SIMILARITY which would identify how similar a target variable(y) is with input(x) variable. I'm sure there is an R equivalent, however I'm not sure if there is an SPSS equivalent. See the example in this website , looks similar to what you are trying to achieve. There is a path and cost statistic and would tell you how similar two time series are. Hope this is helpful
