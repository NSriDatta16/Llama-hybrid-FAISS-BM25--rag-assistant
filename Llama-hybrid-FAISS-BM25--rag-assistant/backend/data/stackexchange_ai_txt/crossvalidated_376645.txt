What does "structural" mean in marginal structural models and structural nested models?

Robins developed the marginal structural models and the structural nested models. An example of the structural nested models is $$E[Y^a-Y^{a=0}\mid A=a, L]=\beta_1a + \beta_2aL,$$ where $Y^a$ is the counterfactual outcome, $A$ is the treatment, $L$ is the covariate vector. I have a background in machine learning but I'm new to causal inference. To me, the structural nested model is simply a regression model. What does the word "structural" mean here? How it's different from a regression model? Thanks! Edit: In section 2.1 of this paper "Simulating from marginal structural models with time-dependent confounding", the authors say that "the term "structural" distinguished it as an interventional model, versus some observational marginal model $P(Y|A=a)$ ."
