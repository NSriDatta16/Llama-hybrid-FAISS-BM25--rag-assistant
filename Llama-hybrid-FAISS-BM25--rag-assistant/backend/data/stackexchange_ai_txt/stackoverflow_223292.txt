Don't forget that VC++ may impose a padding on the sizeof() value on the class. Since the provided example is expected to be 8 bytes, it is automatically DWORD aligned, so should be ok. Check #pragma pack . Though, I agree, the provided examples are some degree of Coding Horror. Many Win32 data structures include a pointer placeholder in the header structure when variable length data follows. This is probably the easiest way to reference this data once it's loaded into memory. The MAPI SRowSet structure is one example of this approach.
