I had more or less the same problem a few months ago when I had to choose a framework for my simulation. I look at Repast, NetLogo, Swarm and Jade. NetLogo was nice and I tried to write some simple test applications but since I wanted to use Java as my programming language, NetLogo wasn't the best candidate. Repast has pretty much everything you need to write larger simulations and there are many projects (especially in social sciences) where Repast is used. My problems with Repasts were: bad API documentation, parameters that are passed to methods or constructers that are never used and don't make any sense at all (have a look at the source code) and a lot of boilerplate code. I'm using Jade ( http://jade.tilab.com/ ) now and I'm really happy with it. The community is good and their mailing list is VERY active. Okay, Jade is just a library and a framework for agent-based modelling. You don't get anything like those visual editor in Repast and you'll have to write your own tool for visualising the results. Cheers
