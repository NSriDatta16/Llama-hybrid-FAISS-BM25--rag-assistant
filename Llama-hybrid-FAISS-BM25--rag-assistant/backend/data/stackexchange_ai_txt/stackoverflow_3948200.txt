Within an iOS app how do I detect that the user has pressed one of the arrow keys on their external keyboard?

I have a couple of iOS applications which present inherently linearly organised information, allowing the user to move forward and backward through the data with on-screen controls. I would like to allow users with the keyboard dock or a paired bluetooth keyboard to use the arrow keys to move back and forth as well. Since the apps are full-screen it is very important to the user experience that there is no risk of displaying an on-screen keyboard as a side-effect. I cannot find an API that will let me do this in Apple's documentation; but I cannot be sure that I have used the right search terms. What APIs are there which will allow me to achieve this? Update: I have raised this as an enhancement on Apple's bug reporting site .
