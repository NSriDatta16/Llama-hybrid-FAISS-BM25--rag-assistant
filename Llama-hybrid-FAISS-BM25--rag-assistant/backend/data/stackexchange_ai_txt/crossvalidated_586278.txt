Continuous x Continuous Interactions in Logistic GLM and GLMMs

Lets say I want to run a logistic GLMM like so: Binary Outcome ~ Subject Composite Score 1 * Subject Composite Score 2 * Item-Level Variable + Random Effect Item + Random Effect Subject I was reading in Logistic Regression Models by Joseph Hilbe that interactions between multiple continuous variables is erroneous for standard logistic regressions (from Page 190): Given this is the case, my question is: if the presence of an interaction is supposed to occur between two continuous variables in a logistic regression, is there no way of capturing this? Can one artificially create a binary/categorical variable instead (such as "high x" vs "low x") without issues? Is it better to just make an additive model with easily interpretable coefficients? There is one additional thing I should mention. The binary outcome can also be transformed into a subject-level sum score. However, given it is a composite, I'm not sure what would be the best way to model this in GLMM, as I don't believe it would have a normal distribution. Edit For context, this is the page directly proceeding it. I believe this is the first part of the book that addresses this issue:
