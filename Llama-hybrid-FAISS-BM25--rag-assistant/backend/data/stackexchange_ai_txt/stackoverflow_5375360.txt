dragging "Div" issue

How can we make a div movable from here to there. I tried using JQuery Drag, Drop & sortable kind of things but my requirements is not fulfilling. I have a plenty of DIVs on the page and i need to drag & drop a DIV_1 onto DIV_2,then DIV_2 should be adjust/set in place of DIV_1. Such drag n drop kind of things works when i have very few DIV but it doesn't work when i have many DIVs inside differnt ROW(div) & COLOUMN(div). Does anybody tell me?
