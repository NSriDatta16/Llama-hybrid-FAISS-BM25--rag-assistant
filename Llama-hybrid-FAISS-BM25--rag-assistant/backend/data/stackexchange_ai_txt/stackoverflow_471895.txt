Dynamically choose which properties to write to Appengine Datastore

Has anyone tried to dynamically select which properties they want to write to an entity on appengine? For example: I have a web form with 5 fields, and any given user will fill out some subset of those fields. I POST only the fields with data to the server (e.g. Fields 1,2,4). On the server side, how do I elegantly write only properties 1,2, and 4? The Model class has a function that returns a dictionary of property names (Model.properties()), but how would I use it to select property names? In SQL, I would build an INSERT or UPDATE statement by matching the fields POSTed against the Model.properties() dictionary. I would look at the db module code in the Appengine SDK, to see if the Model class had some collection of Property objects, but I can't find the module on my disk (I'm a little new to python and appengine). Update: I read trunk/google/appengine/ext/db/ init .py which confirmed that there is no way to refer to the properties as a group. Anyone know of a workaround? Any thoughts? Update2: This question was answered on the Google Group for AppEngine: http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/b50be862f6d94b6e#
