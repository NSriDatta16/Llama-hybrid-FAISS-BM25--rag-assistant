I just tested it on my relatively new MacBook pro(i7 32g RAM) and it takes about 30s for 100,000 rows and 8 variable data, I tried even larger dataset for test and it took much longer time. Your computer's memory is indeed an issue, but I'm sure it's not the main problem. Try using some feature extraction method such as PCA might helpful. (I am using smotefamily package for test)
