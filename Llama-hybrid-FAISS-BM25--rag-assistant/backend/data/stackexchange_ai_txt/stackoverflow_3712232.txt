How to make tds stack after sort using jQuery

You can see the full problem here: http://users.cjb.net/syn4k/test.htm I have described the problem in full at this location. Edit: since you have asked to see the problem here as well, Drag and drop the outlined items from one column to another and then try sorting the items in that column Issue: The items do not stack after sort but rather, they align horizontally (float left or right). If you do not experience this problem try changing the td you are sorting. Expected outcome: The items should always stack after sort and should never, in any case do otherwise. Note that items should stack one item on top of another and not next to another.
