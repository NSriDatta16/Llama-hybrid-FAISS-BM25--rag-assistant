What you describe seems to refer to a particular case of multilevel modeling, where data are organized into a hierarchical structure; in your case, forests (1st level unit) nested in counties nested in states, but see Under what conditions should one use multilevel/hierarchical analysis? . Now, the "particular" case comes from the fact that you want to account for the spatial proximity which might be a vector for the propagation of Lyme disease (correct me if I am wrong), as is done in epidemiology where one is interested in studying the geography of infectious disease. In the usual case, we can use so-called spatial models like the multiple membership model or the conditional autoregressive model , among others. I enclose a couple of references about these approaches at the end, but I think you will find more references by looking at related studies in ecology or epidemiology. Now, I think that you may pay a particular attention at the following paper of Langford et al. which features multilevel modeling with spatially correlated data: Langford, IH, Leyland, AHL, Rasbash, and Goldstein, H (1999). Multilevel modelling of the geographical distributions of diseases . Journal of Royal Statistical Society C , 48 , 253-268. Harvey Goldstein is the author of an excellent book on multilevel modeling, Multilevel Statistical Models (the 2nd edition is available for free). Finally, the book of Andrew Gelman, Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models , may provide additional clues about hierarchical/multilevel modeling. About software, I know there is the R spdep package for modeling spatially correlated outcomes, but there are some examples of analysis of spatial hierachical data with WinBUGS on the BUGS Project .
