Embeding youtube videos with playlist parameter

I am using the javascript youtube api to embed youtube videos, i am having difficulty in embedding playlists using the swfobject.embed functionality. The code im using which i found in the javascript api docs is: var splitSrc = src.split(","); var params = { allowScriptAccess: "always", wmode: "transparent", allowFullScreen: "true" }; var atts = { id: "myytplayer" }; if (splitSrc.length > 1) { swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.youtube.com/v/" + splitSrc[0] + "?showsearch=0&enablejsapi=1&playerapiid=ytplayer&rel=0&fs=1&playlist=" + src, "PlayerYoutube", "0", "0", "8", null, null, params, atts); } where src is a comma seperated list of video ids, but the player loads just the first video specified in splitSrc[0]. Is there another way of doing this? Am i doing this wrong? Please could someone help me with this issue. I have another work arround but its going to be a lot of implementation involved, i would rather have a simple solution to this.
