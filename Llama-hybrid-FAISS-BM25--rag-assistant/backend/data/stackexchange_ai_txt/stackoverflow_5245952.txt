Team Foundation 2010, Build Server Cannot start

When I try to start Build Service from Administration Console I receive TFSBuildServiceHost failed to start correctly and the event log reports Service cannot be started. Microsoft.TeamFoundation.TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException: TF30063: You are not authorized to access http://localhost:8080/tfs/defaultcollection. My build configuration settings are as follows Connect to Team Project Collection (outgoing) : http://localhost:8080/tfs/defaultcollection Local Build Service Endpoint (incoming) : http://localhost:9191/Build/v3.0/Services Run Build Service As : Windows Service Credentials : NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService I have a default Build Controller and 1 Build Agent, with working Directory $(SystemDrive)\Builds$(BuildAgentId)$(BuildDefinitionPath). Both are enabled My Security Setting are as follows Application Tier > Service Account : NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE Team Project Collections > DefaultCollection > Group Memeberships > [DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Build Service Accounts : Contains NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE, NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM IIS > Sites > Team Foundation Server > tfs : Contains NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE (full control) C\Builds\ : Contains NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE (full control) C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010\Application Tier : Contains NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE (full control) So I am not sure what else I am missing?
