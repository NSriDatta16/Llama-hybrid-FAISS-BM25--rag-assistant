iv been developing an ecommerce package using mvc and linq. Its roughly based on magento's implementation and is about 50% complete. All the basic stuff works like adding categories and products, pricing rules, user sign ups, product imports and exports. There are currently two stores using it. Im thinking about open sourcing it and would like to hear from other developers who would be interested in giving me a hand to finish it off.
