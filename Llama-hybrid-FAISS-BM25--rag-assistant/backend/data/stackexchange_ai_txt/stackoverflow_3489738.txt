I'd write my own UISlider subclass and implement all the touch handling myself (i.e. in hitTest:withEvent:, return [self pointInside:point withEvent:event] ? self : nil; , using UISlider just to do the rendering (you can get the relevant min/max rects by calling thumbRectForValue: or whatever it's called). I'm not sure what you mean by "I can't seem to capture the y coordinates of my touch", but it's not (easily) possible to access a touch event once a subview has "captured" it. One hack is to handle all touches yourself but then forward touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/Cancelled.
