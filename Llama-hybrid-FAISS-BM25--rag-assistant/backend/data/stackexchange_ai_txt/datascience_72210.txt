Scikit-learn has a great implementation of latent dirichlet allocation, which I would argue is as straightforward to use as the implementation in tidytext. There’s a tutorial here . Also, Python has SpaCy , which is slicker than anything R has so far in terms of tooling for NLP pipelines, I do love R, and I feel it’s still a better language for tidying and processing data than Python. Tidytext is currently nicer than anything in Python in terms of getting data in and out of topic models. However, Python is a lot better resources than R for text mining overall.
