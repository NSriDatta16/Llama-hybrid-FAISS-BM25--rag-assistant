Why symmetric trees are not used in xgboost

I was reading about catboost and found out that catboost uses symmetric trees. The reasons for using symmetric trees is: The choice of oblivious trees has several advantages compared to the classic ones: • Simple fitting scheme • Efficient to implement on CPU • Ability to make very fast model appliers • This tree structure works as a regularization, so it can provide quality benefits for many tasks If symmetric trees has so many advantages, why xgboost does not use symmetric trees as well? Is it because of the fact that when xgboost was released symmetric trees were not as prevalent?
