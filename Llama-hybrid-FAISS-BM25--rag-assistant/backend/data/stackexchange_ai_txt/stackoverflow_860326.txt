What would you consider to be called a "helper method"?

I am wondering what kind of methods are "helper methods". Where do we have to draw te border to say that an specific method is a "helper method"? Actually, I consider any method to be a "helper method" if it's not an initialization method, a method implemented for conforming to an protocol or delegation response methods. Any other method I implement to perform anything is a "helper method" in my perspective, but I feel that there are more categories to think of. Why I want this to know? Because I want to make mor use of the #pragma mark HEADLINE stuff in Xcode. I beliefe it's good to organize the code in some way. Please help me to get my picture of an "helper method" clear. Examples appreciated!
