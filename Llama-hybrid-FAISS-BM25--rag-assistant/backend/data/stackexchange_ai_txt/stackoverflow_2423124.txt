how to modularize/organize java web application

I am creating a j2ee web appp and I have created the following packages com.cms.controller (to hold servlets) com.cms.business (to hold busines logic) com.cms.dao (to hold data access objects) com.cms.beans (to hold beans) Now i want to write a functionality. So i have written a index.jsp page which has action = /loginConroller . Now should I do the folling in loginController ? Authentication authentication = new Authentication(); boolean flag = authentication.chekLoginCredentials(username, passwd) Will Authentication class consist of only one function? Is this approcach correct?
