Estimating regression coefficients in the presence of stochastic trend

I have a very basic problem. My time series is modeled as: $$ \begin{align} Y_t &= a_t + \beta x_t + v_t \\ a_t &= a_{t-1} + w_t \end{align} $$ where $ w_t$ ~ $N(0,W) $ with known $W$, and $v$ is white noise. I don't know if I can use the usual linear regression here, since the values for $a$ are not deterministic and are not stationary. What method should I use to estimate $\beta$, and specifically, get $t$-statistics or $p$-values for it? Implementation wise, I use lm() for estimating my regression in R. I would appreciate it if you could mention how to do it in R.
