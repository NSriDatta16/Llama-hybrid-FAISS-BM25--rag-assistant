Semipartial correlation and logistic regression

I am running a series of multiple linear regression models as well as logistic regression models. I have calculated the semipartial correlations (sr) as a measure of effect size for the linear regression models and the odds ratio (OR) as a measure of effect size for the logistic regression models. My first question is can I compare the sr to the OR? And if so, how do I do so? Based on Cohen's criteria my sr is small ( My second question is, is it possible to calculate a sr for my logistic regression model when my predictor is continuous? Thanks in advance!
