That's a very interesting question. Similarity here should be computed component-wise, but the thing is from a "business logic" perspective, the similarity of the last 3 numbers doesn't matter if the other 3 sets of numbers are not the same. Keeping that in mind, I would probably do something like the following (there is probably a more elegant way of doing it, and I don't have much time to think about it so forgive me if it doesn't answer your question and for the poor formatting). Assuming IPv4 of the form aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, I would so something like: If aaa_1 == aaa_2: If bbb_1 == bbb_2: If ccc_1 == ccc_2: If ddd_1 == ddd_2: Dist = 1; Else: Dist = (3 + distance(ddd_1,ddd_2))/4; End if; Else: Dist = (2 + distance(ccc_1,ccc_2))/4; End if; Else: Dist = (1 + distance(bbb_1,bbb_2))/4; End if; Else: Dist = distance(aaa_1,aaa_2); Return 1/Dist;
