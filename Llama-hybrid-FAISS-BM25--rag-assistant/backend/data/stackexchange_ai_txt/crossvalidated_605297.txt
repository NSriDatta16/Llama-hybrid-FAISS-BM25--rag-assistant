What do the weights in the specaccum function actually do?

I am trying to create a species accumulation curve that accounts for different areas of each sample. For example, samples were obtained from different sized quadrats. I think the weights argument in the specaccum vegan function can be used. However, I am not sure what this argument actually does. The non-weighted results seem almost identical to the weighted, except for the confidence intervals. For simplicity, is it acceptable to just run a non-weighted model and then rescale the x-axis to represent the cumulative area sampled? Or is there a better way to account for different areas? Here is sample code to show the similarities: # Load in libraries library("Hmisc") # for making a plot with error bars library("vegan") # for specaccum function and dune dataset # Use the dune data as an example data(dune) # Make example reproducible set.seed(13) # Make species accumulation curve with random method mod.orig = specaccum(dune, "random") # Make second species accumulation curve but with weights # Assign the 20 sites random areas ranging from 1-100 square # meters dune$area = sample(1:100, 20) # Run model with weights as the areas mod.w = specaccum(dune, "random", w = area) # Model gives NA value for first entry. Remove this value mod.w.richness = mod.w $richness[-1] # richness mod.w.sites = mod.w$ sites[-1] # sites mod.w.sd = mod.w$sd[-1] # standard deviation # Make plot of weighted model in red. Bars represent 95% # confidence intervals errbar(mod.w.sites, mod.w.richness, mod.w.richness - 2*mod.w.sd, mod.w.richness + 2* mod.w.sd, type = "b", col = "red", errbar.col = "red", ylab = "Richness", xlab = "Sites") # Add the original (non-weighted) results over top in black plot(mod.orig, add = TRUE) legend("bottomright", legend = c("Weighted", "Normal"), col = c("red", "black"), lty = 1) Here is what the output looks like. The plots are nearly identical except for the confidence intervals
