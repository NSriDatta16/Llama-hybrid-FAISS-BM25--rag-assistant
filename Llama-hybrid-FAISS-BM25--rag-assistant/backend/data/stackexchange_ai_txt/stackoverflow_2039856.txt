Explain step by step of Airsource Ltd's answer for adding image to simulator: Drag it to simulator, then Safari opens (or browse to the Image in the internet using Safari) Hold your click on the image When the pop-up appears, choose Save Image and enjoy ;) Update: for iOS Simulator 4.2, do these steps twice to get it work. Thanks kevboh ! Update: This also works for iOS Simulator 6.1
