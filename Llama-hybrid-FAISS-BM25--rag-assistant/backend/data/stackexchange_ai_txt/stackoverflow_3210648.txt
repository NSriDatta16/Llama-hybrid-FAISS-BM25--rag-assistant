I managed to CentOS working with a lot of the defaults. I now have a running django app, with mod_wsgi, git, django-south, django-imagekit, rackspace CDN, apache, mysql etc. I've found that there were so many people having issues with this, however all the answers only took me half-way, I have tracked what I have done and published all this info into a handy tutorial. http://appelfreelance.com/2010/07/a-working-copy-django-pil-imaging-libjpeg-mysql-git-apache-mod_wsgi-easy_install-pip-django-imagekit-cdn-storage-on-centos-5-4/
