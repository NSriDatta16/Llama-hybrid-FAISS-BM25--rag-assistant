Use Javascript to call method within a flash (.swf) file?

I have a flash file that contains a package "game" which has a class "Scores" and a method setValue(). I want to write some lines of Javascript that allow me to call that method. Someone directed me to this tutorial, but I am still a bit confused. Javascript: alert("start"); var so; so = document.embeds[0]; so.addParam("allowScriptAccess","always"); import flash.external.ExternalInterface; ExternalInterface.call("setValue[2600]"); displays an alert to tell me that it has indeed began to execute saves the embedded flash file into a variable and sets access imports that class calls the method I am not sure about how this class thing works? This is just the bits and pieces I was able to come up with from that site, but I don't really understand how it all works (but certainly hope to eventually). This is the site: http://bytes.com/topic/flash/answers/694359-how-do-i-access-flash-function-using-javascript . When I execute the code with the importation nothing happens, but the alert does come up when I don't have that statement? If someone could elaborate on how I might call that method, I would be very thankful! :)
