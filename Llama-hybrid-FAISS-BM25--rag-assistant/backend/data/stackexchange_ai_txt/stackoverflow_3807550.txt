The Google Earth COM API is being depreciated and developers are being encouraged to use the Google Earth Plugin Api instead. Using the plug-in in an embedded application would easily allow you to achieve this as you could just capture the frames from the plug-in and then render them to a video file using your desired codec. I have put together a library of controls that work with the Google Earth Api in managed code. They may not be exactly what you need but they should give some idea of the main principals (e.g. loading, geocoding, screen-grab, etc)
