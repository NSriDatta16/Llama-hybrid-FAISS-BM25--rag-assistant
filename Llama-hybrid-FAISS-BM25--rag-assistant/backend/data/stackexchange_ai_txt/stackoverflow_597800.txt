If you use beyond compare and start a new text compare you can just paste into the windows and it will diff what you've pasted. Not quite drag and drop, but the same really. No need to have the contents you want to diff in a file. I'd really recommend beyond compare, it's a great tool. You can get a trial version at: http://www.scootersoftware.com/ Just to mention, it is linux compatible, but I've only ever used it on windows.
