.NET ServerVariables("AUTH_USER") and a non ASP page

I'm going to be running a node.js server in a Windows environment (via Cygwin) on an internal network that needs access to the Windows login information of the client. The best method I've come up with is to have an iFrame with an ASP page that just does Response.Write(Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_USER")) Then, get the contents of the iFrame on load and store it in Javascript. It should contain something like "MANAGER/HisLogin", and I can store that variable. I could possibly sha1/salt it for security purposes. Couple questions: Are there any inherent security risks in doing something like this? IIS and Node.js will be running on the same server, but different ports. If required I could make IIS listen to localhost only. Is there a better route rather than having the iFrame contents picked up by Javascript and relied upon? I realize the client can change the contents of the iFrame and the Javascript variable, but the contents are only read once and I could create a self-destructing function in a Javascript closure that is called upon iFrame load, something like: Example: var login = function() { var loginInfo = null; return { init: function(theLogin) { loginInfo = theLogin; this.init() = function() {}; }, getLogin: function() { return loginInfo; } }; }(); This is the header node.js is reporting headers: { host: '/*Removed*/', connection: 'keep-alive', accept: 'application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5', 'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.44 Safari/534.7', 'accept-encoding': 'gzip,deflate,sdch', 'accept-language': 'en-US,en;q=0.8', 'accept-charset': 'ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3', cookie: 'socketio=websocket' }, Edit 2 Another alternative that I thought of was to post the results from the iFrame loading the page instead of Response.Write. I'd have to find a way to correlate the message to eachother.
