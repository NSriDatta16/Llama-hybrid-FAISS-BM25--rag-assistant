So, after some research on the topic... I came to realise that if you execute the following code: pacf(ts(cbind(dx,dy)),lag.max=10) You get the partial cross correlations between x & y. So I researched a little, and found this link where Simone Giannerini creates a corrected version of the multivariate pacf. Here is the code: pacf.mts =2) { for(s in 2:lag.max) { dum.u Which follows the recursive algorithm described in pp. 402-414 in Wei (2005) Time Series Analysis, and actually yields the same output as the first line of code I wrote above (probably the pacf function was corrected on CRAN after he posted this new function) I think this is what I am looking for, but why isn't it called partial cross correlation, if that's what it (seems) to be? WARNING: I realised that doing: pacf(cbind(dx,dy)) Yields highly undesirable results (do not understand what actually happens here, but it is certainly wrong... probably has something to do with the input class not being a ts?), after getting this output:
