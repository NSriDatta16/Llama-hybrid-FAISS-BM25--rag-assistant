I have Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective by Stephen Marsland and find it very useful for self-learning. Python code is given throughout the book. I agree with what is said in this favourable review: http://blog.rtwilson.com/review-machine-learning-an-algorithmic-perspective-by-stephen-marsland/
