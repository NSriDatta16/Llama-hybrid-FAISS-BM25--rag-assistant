Reference category and prediction

I am struggling a little bit at the moment with a question related to logistic regression. I have a model that predicts the occurrence of animal based on land cover with reference to forest. I am not grasping the concept of a reference class and struggle to extrapolate the model onto a new area. Any explanations or guidance towards papers, lecture notes etc would be highly appreciated.
