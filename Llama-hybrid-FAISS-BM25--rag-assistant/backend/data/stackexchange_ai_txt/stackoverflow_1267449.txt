There is no java VM on the iphone - xmlvm must cross-compile the java code into an executable for the phone. edit 1: that said coming from Java, you may not find objective-C that much of a shock to migrate to. It took me a few months to learn it coming from Java and C/C++ - most of the books about iphone programming (e.g. the pragmatic programmer's one) also give a little background on the language to get you started. It is a learning curve but ultimately I suspect a lot less frustrating as it the first-class language on the phone and well supported by tools and documentation etc. edit 2: From a glance at the webpage, it looks like what xmlvm produces is actually objective-C, linked against a native xvmlm support framework. I assume the next step is to compile the objective-C output using whatever toolchain you have - probably xcode but if not then some gcc toolchain. Anyway the end result is going to be a native executable not java bytecode. You'll install that just like any executable you build from objective-C.
