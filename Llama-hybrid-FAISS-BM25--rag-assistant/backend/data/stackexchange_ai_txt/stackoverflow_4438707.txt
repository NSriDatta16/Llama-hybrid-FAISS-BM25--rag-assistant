What is a viable local database for Windows Phone 7 right now?

I was wondering what is a viable database solution for local storage on Windows Phone 7 right now. Using search I stumbled upon these 2 threads but they are over a few months old. I was wondering if there are some new development in databases for WP7. And I didn't found any reviews about the databases mentioned in the links below. windows phone 7 database Local Sql database support for Windows phone 7 My requirements are: It should be free for commercial use Saving/updating a record should only save the actual record and not the entire database (unlike WinPhone7 DB) Able to fast query on a table with ~1000 records using LINQ. Should also work in simulator EDIT: Just tried Sterling using a simple test app: It looks good, but I have 2 issues. Creating 1000 records takes 30 seconds using db.Save(myPerson) . Person is a simple class with 5 properties. Then I discovered there is a db.SaveAsync (IList) method. This is fine because it doesn't block the current thread anymore. BUT my question is: Is it save to call db.Flush() immediately and do a query on the currently saving IList? (because it takes up to 30 seconds to save the records in synchronous mode). Or do I have to wait until the BackgroundWorker has finished saving? Query these 1000 records with LINQ and a where clause the first time takes up to 14 sec to load into memory. Is there a way to speed this up? Here are some benchmark results: (Unit tests was executed on a HTC Trophy) ----------------------------- purging: 7,59 sec creating 1000 records: 0,006 sec saving 1000 records: 32,374 sec flushing 1000 records: 0,07 sec ----------------------------- //async creating 1000 records: 0,04 sec saving 1000 records: 0,004 sec flushing 1000 records: 0 sec ----------------------------- //get all keys persons list count = 1000 (0,007) ----------------------------- //get all persons with a where clause persons list with query count = 26 (14,241) ----------------------------- //update 1 property of 1 record + save persons list with query count = 26 (0,003s) db saved (0,072s)
