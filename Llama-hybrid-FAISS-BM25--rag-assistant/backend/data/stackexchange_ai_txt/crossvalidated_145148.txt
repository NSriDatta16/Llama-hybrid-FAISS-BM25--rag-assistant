A chi-square test is a good approach as a preliminary view to your question. The stl decomposition can be misleading as a tool to test for the presence of seasonality. This procedure manages to return a stable seasonal pattern even if a white noise (random signal with no structure) is passed as input. Try for example: plot(stl(ts(rnorm(144), frequency=12), s.window="periodic")) Looking at the orders chosen by an automatic ARIMA model selection procedure is also a bit risky since a seasonal ARIMA model does not always involve seasonality (for details see this discussion ). In this case, the chosen model generates seasonal cycles and the comment by @RichardHardy is reasonable, however, a further insight is required in order to conclude that suicides are driven by a seasonal pattern. Below, I summarize some results based on the analysis of the monthly series that you posted. This is the seasonal component estimated upon the basic structural time series model: require(stsm) m A similar component was extracted using the software TRAMO-SEATS with default options. We can see that the estimated seasonal pattern is not stable across time and, hence, does not support the hypothesis of a recurrent pattern in the number of suicides across months during the sample period. Running the software X-13ARIMA-SEATS with default options, the combined test for seasonality concluded that identifiable seasonality is not present. Edit (see this answer and my comment below for a definition of identifiable seasonality ). Given the nature of your data, it would be worth complementing this analysis based on time series methods with a model for count data (e.g. Poisson model) and test for the significance of seasonality in that model. Adding the tag count-data to your question may result in more views and potential answers in this direction.
