Its not clear if you are doing this to be secure, or only in order for a trojan to claim payment for restoring the files ;) Encrypting files after they have been written in plaintext will leave the plaintext spread around your Flash (or disk) until that space is later reclaimed for new files. Its basically not secure. You have to encrypt before bytes get written to disk. Android runs on Linux, and device drivers for storage, whilst modular, are compiled into the kernel. So unless you are distributing a custom Android image, you cannot post-install install a driver on someone's device. There has been discussion like this on the mailing list here .
