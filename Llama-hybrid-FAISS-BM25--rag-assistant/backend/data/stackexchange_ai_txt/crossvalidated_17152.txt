From a purely practical point of view, I am not a fan of methods which require lots of computation (I am thinking of Gibbs sampler and MCMC, often used in the Bayesian framework, but this also applies to e.g. bootstrap techniques in frequentist analysis). The reason being that any kind of debugging (testing the implementation, looking at robustness with respect to assumptions, etc ) itself requires a bunch of Monte Carlo simulations, and you are quickly in a computational morass. I prefer the underlying analysis techniques to be fast and deterministic, even if they are only approximate. This is a purely practical objection, of course: given infinite computing resources, this objection would disappear. And it only applies to a subset of Bayesian methods. Also this is more of a preference given my workflow.
