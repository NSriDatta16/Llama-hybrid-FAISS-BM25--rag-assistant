HtmlParser or any other HTML or XML parser hasn't got a hope in hell of parsing PDFs. HTML is a completely different format to PDF format. What you need to do is get your web crawling software to pay attention to the content type headers returned that the remote web server returns when you GET a document. This tells you the nominal format of the resource that you have just fetched. If the content type is PDF, or some other format that your link extractor cannot cope with, you should not attempt to parse it. At the moment your code does this: parser.setResource ("http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr" + "/docs/00/16/76/78/PDF /27_Bendaoud.pdf"); This need to be replaced with something that sets the resource using an already opened InputStream, etc.
