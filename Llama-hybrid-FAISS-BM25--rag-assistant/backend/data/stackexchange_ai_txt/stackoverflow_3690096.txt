In addition to RBerteig's and Matt's answer: If you enable the 64 bit IO support correctly and carefully for all your files in your project (for which the methods are systemn dependent) you don't have to be worried about integer overflow if you use the correct types, I think. off_t should then be the correct choice to position your file pointer. If all else fails go with the correct C99 types if you make assumptions about the width of the type. Using int or long is almost always the wrong thing to do, they are too much compiler/platform dependent. Use int64_t (or int_fast64_t if you don't have that).
