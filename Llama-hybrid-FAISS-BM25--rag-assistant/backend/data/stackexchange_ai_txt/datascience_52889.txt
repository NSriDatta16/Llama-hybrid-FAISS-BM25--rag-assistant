Does increasing kernel size in a CNN result in higher accuracy on the training set?

In a convolutional neural network, does increasing the size of kernel always result in better training set accuracy? For example, if I use 5x5 kernels in a CNN instead of 3x3 ones, will it always generate better training accuracy? Increasing kernel size means effectively increasing the total number of parameters. So, it is expected that the model has a higher complexity to address a given problem. So it should perform better at least for a particular training set. Or will it be harder to learn a bigger kernel? I am not concerned about the validation set accuracy here.
