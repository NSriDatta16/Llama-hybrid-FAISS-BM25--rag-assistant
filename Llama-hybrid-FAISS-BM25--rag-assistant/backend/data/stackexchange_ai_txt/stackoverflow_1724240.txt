Given your definitions the structure of the picture (i.e. how the pixels are organized) does not matter at all, the only thing that matters is the subset of RGB triplets that appear at least once in the picture as a pixel value. Let that subset be S. You want to find then another subset of RGB triplets E (the encoding) such that for every s in S there exists a counterpart e in E such that diff(s,e) This particular problem cannot be given an asymptotic complexity assessment because it has only a finite set of instances. It can be solved in constant time (theoretically) by precalculating the minimum set E for every subset S. There is a huge amount of subsets S but yet only a finite number, so the problem cannot be e.g. classified as NP-complete optimization problem or anything. The actual run-time of your algorithm for this parcticular problem hence depends completely on the amount of preprocessing you are willing to tolerate. In order to get an asymptotic complexity assessment you need to generalize the problem first so that the set of problem instances is strictly infinite .
