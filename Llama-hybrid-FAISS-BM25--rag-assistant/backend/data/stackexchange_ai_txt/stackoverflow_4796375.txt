Theere is no "install" of the file - it's just a single file. Copy it to the device via ActiveSync/WMDC or some storage mechanism. Ssing the file requires the consuming application have the SQL Compact binaries installed. Microsoft also supplies a simplistic on-device query analyzer, which IIRC comes with the redistributables. If you need something else, you need to be a bit more clear in your question. EDIT Once you install the redistributables on your PC, the various CAB files and binaries for SQL Compact will be stored here: %PROGRAM_FILES%\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\v3.5
