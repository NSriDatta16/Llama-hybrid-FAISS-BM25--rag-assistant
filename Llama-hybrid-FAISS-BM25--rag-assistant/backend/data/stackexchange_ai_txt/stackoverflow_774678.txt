The book is complete. C is capable of running threads, but only with support from the run-time it sits on. C doesn't support many things natively. For example, if you want to open a file or get input from the mouse, you'll need a library that gives you that support. This is good in a way because it means C can run on a small embedded computer and doesn't need lots of memory for features you may or may not want. Multithreading was around way before C. ( That's according to this: http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/multithreading.html ) You need a threading library. Eg, on windows you can: #include "Windows.h" int main() { CreateThread(/*Google the function for details of the parameters.*/); return 0; } You'll need to download the windows platform sdk to do that. Most platforms have some kind of sdk that'll have a library with some functions for creating threads. Most have a CreateThread style function, where you pass in the address of a function you want the newly started thread to begin running in parallel to your current thread that began on the main function. A standardized threading library you might want to look up is posix.
