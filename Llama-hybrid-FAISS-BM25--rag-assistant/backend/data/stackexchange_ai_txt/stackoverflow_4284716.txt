Actually there are two parts for chatting: A long running request that streams massges from the server to the client Ajax messages from the client to the server that sends one message to the server For the second, any ajax framework will do it. For the first you might have a look at Comet to get the idea for this. But you should be aware that html isn't ment to be a chatting protocol. If you don't pay attention such stuff can easily kill your server.
