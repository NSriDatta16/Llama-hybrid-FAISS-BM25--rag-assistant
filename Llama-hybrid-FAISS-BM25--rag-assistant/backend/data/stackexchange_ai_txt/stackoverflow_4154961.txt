Find substring in string but only if whole words?

What is an elegant way to look for a string within another string in Python, but only if the substring is within whole words, not part of a word? Perhaps an example will demonstrate what I mean: string1 = "ADDLESHAW GODDARD" string2 = "ADDLESHAW GODDARD LLP" assert string_found(string1, string2) # this is True string1 = "ADVANCE" string2 = "ADVANCED BUSINESS EQUIPMENT LTD" assert not string_found(string1, string2) # this should be False How can I best write a function called string_found that will do what I need? I thought perhaps I could fudge it with something like this: def string_found(string1, string2): if string2.find(string1 + " "): return True return False But that doesn't feel very elegant, and also wouldn't match string1 if it was at the end of string2. Maybe I need a regex? (argh regex fear)
