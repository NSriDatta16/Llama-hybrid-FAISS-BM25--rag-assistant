For general use, and when not in need to show step-by-step calculations, note that your integral is a Mellin transform of $e^{-x^2/{\beta}^2}$. The following general relation holds: $$\int_0^{\infty} x^{s-1}\exp\left\{-ax^h\right\}dx = h^{-1}a^{- s/h} \Gamma\left( s/h\right)\;, \qquad h>0, \;\text {Re}\,a>0,\;\text {Re}\,s>0 $$ ...where $\Gamma()$ is the Gamma function. This leads of course to the answer given by @Robert Smith, using the specific numerical values. Finally , you cannot "verify" that it is a pdf - what you can do it to determine for what value of $\beta$ it becomes a proper pdf over the specific domain, i.e. that it integrates to unity.
