To get started with your project I suggest to do some research in order to identify relevant papers. Reading through the abstracts, intros and conclusion sections will quickly give you an understanding which models are state-of-the-art. There has been some research on match prediction using neural networks. However, most papers apply gradient boosted decision trees and these, usually, outperform other approaches (however, there are no standardized benchmarks for this task which makes it harder to compare methods). Besides the type of model, feature engineering is very important for this task. Only using basic features does usually not provide good results. Instead, you need to derive more complex features which have predictive values (e.g. running scores, ELO, PI score). To gain an initial understanding which features might work best you can refer to the relevant literature. Depending on the type of sports you will need to think for yourself which features may have predictive value (e.g. for football there are many papers. But for less prominent types of sports you may rely more on your intuition, i.e. it helps to know the form of sport). You can find some additional information in this answer incl. links to a couple of papers to read.
