Each browser may implement the W3c standards slightly differently, much to the chagrin of all developers (#rant)... Relying on meta information generated by a user/browser is highly unreliable and not recommended. If this is your only security/sanity mechanism then someone wishing to cause harm to your system could manually enter the meta type field with a custom request to == "audio/mpeg" then upload any kind of executable file. If you really want to be sure you must fully examine the data on the server side once it has been uploaded before accepting it into your permanent storage / production system. Or on a less sinister note.. a user with a different browser you have not tested before could want to upload a legit mp3 file but it may not announce its mime type as audio/mpeg or audio/mp3 and then you would deny them access to the system...
