CausalImpact with Panel Data

The way I understand it, the CausalImpact package estimates a Bayesian model meant to analyse time-series data. What if, instead, I want to use panel data (i.e. repeated observations of the same individuals over time)? Is the estimator still valid, or should I look for something else?
