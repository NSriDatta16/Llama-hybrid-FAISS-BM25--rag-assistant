Features more on top of the tree contribute to the final prediction of a larger fraction of the input samples than features deeper down inside the tree. The feature_importances_ is an estimate to what fraction of the input samples' classification a feature contributes to. 1.0 would mean you have a feature that alone classifies all samples, 0.0 would indicate a feature that can add no (additional) value for classification. The RandomForest calculates an average of these estimates to reduce variance of the importance estimates. You can use these values e.g. for feature selection.
