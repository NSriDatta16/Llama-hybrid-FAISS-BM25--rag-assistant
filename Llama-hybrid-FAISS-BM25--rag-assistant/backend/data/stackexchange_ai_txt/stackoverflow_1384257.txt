Multilingual support with unicode characters. A little confusion

I am creating a web application framework, in which I am providing support for multilingual content. I mean a content, say a paragraph can have 2 sentences in English and other 2 sentences in Hindi (an indian language). Now I have several doubts about that. 1) User or admin will add that content to the website. They will be presented a textarea (where they can paste their content). Then they submit the post and I will save the content in a database. I also want to provide them a web based typewriter interface where they can type content in a given language, copy it from there, and then put it back in my main textarea. Doubt: 1a) Will I need to do something to the textarea, so that it will accept characters in unicode. 1b) Where can I find a typewriter interface for some language I desire. Does tinymce supports that. 1c) I should put the encoding of database as 'UTF 8', right? 2) Then I nead to get content from database and put it in a webpage and show it. Now this content has utf8 encoding. As it can have many languages. What should I need to do? I am guessing that just setting encoding of the webpage as utf-8 will do. What will happen if the font that is required by a language is not installed on clients pc? I am using PhpEd editor. Should my php files encoding must be utf-8, or just specifying the html encoding tag as utf8 will be enough? I am a bit stumped. Please help.
