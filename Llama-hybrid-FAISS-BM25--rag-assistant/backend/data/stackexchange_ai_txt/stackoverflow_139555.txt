Whats the best way to create interactive application prototypes?

The question should be interpreted from a general point of view and not targeted solely at web apps or desktop apps. I have been looking around to find a simple and easy way of creating interactive prototypes for web applications. I'd like to use a technique that allows simple UI creation and especially UI recreation and modification in further iterations. Filling the UI with mockup data should be very simple. The technique may require a simple form of programming, e.g. to specify a drag and drop behaviour from UI element A to UI element B. One tool i currently use is the Adobe Flex Builder. The included GUI-designer is very good and i have accomplished some skills with AS3 so far. The problem is adding data to the UI. It always results in me programming code for checking and parsing of XML-trees structures, and mainly debugging this section of the prototype. Too cumbersome! Another tool many people use is PowerPoint which involves a really cumbersome way of creating a GUI by drawing every part of an interaction in a separate slide. No way! I would be much faster with paper prototypes. Other (better!) free form drawing tools are also part of this category (i'm a happy heavy weight inkscape user) but Prototyping and Mockup are obviously not their main purpose. The UI-stencil palette for Viso makes it a bit better than the drawing competition. The main competitors in rapid prototyping as far i know are: iRise Axure Serena and other ? Viso Powerpoint, Illustrator, Inkscape or any other free form drawing tool paper prototyping IDE with good GUI builders (such as Flex Builder Designer and Netbeans Matisse) My opinion is that real GUI-builders are a good staring point. What are your current approaches? Please outline your process and the pros and cons as an answer here.
