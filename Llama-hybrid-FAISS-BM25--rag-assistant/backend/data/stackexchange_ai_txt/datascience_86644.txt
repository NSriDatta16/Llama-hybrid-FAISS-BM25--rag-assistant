Ordering a material science dataset (properties names, properties scalars, formulas)

I'm dealing with a materials science dataset and I'm in the following situation, I have data organized like this: Chemical_ Formula Property_name Property_Scalar He Electrical conduc. 1 NO_2 Resistance 50 CuO3 Hardness ... ... ... CuO3 Fluorescence 300 He Toxicity 39 NO2 Hardness 80 ... ... ... As you can understand it is really messy because the same chemical formula appears more than once through the entire dataset, but referred to a different property that is considered. My question is, how can I easily maybe split the dataset in smaller ones, fitting every formula with its descriptors in ORDER? I really need help on this... thank you. ( I used fiction names and values, just to explain my problem.) I'm on Jupyter Notebook and I'm using Pandas. I'm editing my question trying to be more clear: My goal would be to plot some histograms of (for example) nÂ°materials vs conductivity at different temperatures (100K, 200K, 300K). So I need to have both conductivity and temperature for each material to be clearly comparable. For example, I guess that a more convenient thing to obtain would be: Chemical formula Conductivity Temperature He 5 10K NO_2 7 59K CuO_3 10 300K ... ... ... He 14 100K NO_2 5 70K ... ... ...
