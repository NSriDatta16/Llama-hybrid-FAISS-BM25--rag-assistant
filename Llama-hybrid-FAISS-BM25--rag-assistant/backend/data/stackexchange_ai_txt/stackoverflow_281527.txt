Defrag a virtual hard disk (.vhd)?

Like any other hard disk, virtual hard discs (*.vhd) will suffer from fragmentation. So to keep good performance i guess i have to defrag first the virtual hard disc from within the virtual machine and also the (physical) hard disc the .vhd is stored on. First, are these assumption correct? And second, is there a way to defrag both (virtual and physical hard disc) at once? Thanks in advance!
