Monte Carlo method was the first approach to use computer simulation for statistical problems. It was developed by the John von Neumann, Stanis≈Çaw Ulam, & Nicholas Metropolis team from Los Alamos laboratories that was working on the Manhattan project during the World War II. It was first described in 1949 by Metropolis & Ulam , and it was the first time the name appeared in print. It was possible because the scientists that discovered it were also able to use one of the first computers , that they were working on. In their work they used Monte Carlo methods for simulation physical problems, and the idea was that you could simulate a complicated problem with sampling some number of examples of this process. There are multiple interesting articles on history of Monte Carlo e.g. by Metropolis himself or some more recent, e.g. by Robert & Casella . So "Monte Carlo" was a name of the first method described for a purpose of computer simulation to solve statistical problems. Then the name became a general name for a whole family of simulation methods and is commonly used in this fashion. There are simulation methods considered non-Monte Carlo , however while Monte Carlo was the first use of computer simulation it is common that "computer simulation" and "Monte Carlo" are used interchangeably. There are different definition of what "simulation" is, i.e. Merriam-Webster dictionary: 3 a : the imitative representation of the functioning of one system or process by means of the functioning of another b : examination of a problem often not subject to direct experimentation by means of a simulating device Cambridge dictionary: to do or make something which behaves or looks like something real but which is not real Wikipedia : imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time What simulation needs to work is an ability to imitate some system or process. This does not need any randomness involved (as with Monte Carlo), however if all the possibilities are tried, then the procedure is rather an exhaustive search or generally and optimization problem . If the random element is involved and a computer is used to run a simulation of some model, then this simulation resembles the spirit of the initial Monte Carlo method (e.g. Metropolis & Ulam, 1949). The random element as a crucial part of simulation is mentioned, for example, by Ross (2006, Simulation . Elsevier). However, the answer to the question depends heavily on the definition of simulation you assume. For example, if you assume that deterministic algorithms that use optimization or exhaustive search, are in fact simulations, then we need to consider a wide variety of algorithms to be simulations and this makes the definition of simulation per se very blurry. Literally every statistical procedure employs some model or approximation of the reality, that is "tried" and assessed. This is consistent with dictionary definitions of simulation. We do not however consider all the statistics to be simulation based. The question and the discussion seems to emerge from the lack of the precise definition of "simulation". Monte Carlo seems to be archetypical (and first) example of simulation, however if we consider very general definition of simulation then many non-Monte Carlo methods fall into the definition. So there are non-Monte Carlo simulations, but all the clearly simulation-based methods resemble the spirit of Monte Carlo, relate to it in some way, or were inspired by it. That is the reason why "Monte Carlo" is often used as a synonym for "simulation".
