A couple reasons... Assemblies without a strong name cannot be added to the GAC Related to #1, assemblies not in the GAC do not benefit much from NGEN Strong named assemblies exhibit different behavior when it comes to assembly probing and loading with partial names. Assemblies without a strong name cannot be referenced by a strong named assembly So in organizations where the signing process is tightly controlled, it helps to be able to fake it out for development.
