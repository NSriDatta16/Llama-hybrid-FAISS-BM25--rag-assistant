Hillegass: Cocoa Prog 3rd Ed: Ch. 33 on OpenGL: Where's the Matrix?

I'm using XCode 3.1.4, on OSX 10.5, targeting same. In Ch. 33 we're asked to drag an NSOpenGLView and an NSSlider onto the IB library, and then do Layout -> Embed Objects in -> Matrix. Except the Matrix option is always disabled. What do I have to do to enable the matrix?
