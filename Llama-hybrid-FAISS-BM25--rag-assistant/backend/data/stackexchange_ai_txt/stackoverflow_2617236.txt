I haven't done this in a while so take this with a grain of salt but it goes something like: You need to define a protocol for you app to handle URLs. It will look something like "myApplicationName://aPath" In the apps Info.plist file add the protocol under CFBundleURLTypes key. Write code for the app to respond to openURL from NSWorkspace. This means the app will have to understand how to convert a URL style path to a specific location in one of its documents. I think the best method for handling the URL path is to assign a UUID to each document and then a numeric scheme to the paragraph and sentences. The URL ends up looking like: myApplicationName://UUID/paragraphNumber/sentenceNumber/wordNumber . Alternatively you can insert hidden text to define an anchor and just search for that anchor.
