Machine learning algorithm for ranking

I am working on a ranking question, recommending k out of m items to the users. The evaluation metric is average precision at K . Both R and Python have xgboost can be used for pairwise comparison and can be adapted for ranking problems. Are there other algorithms or approaches that can be applied to ranking problems?
