The big reason that comes to mind if the possibility of overfitting. With $36$ observations and $8$ variables, youâ€™re likely fitting to the noise at least close to as much as the signal. In other words, you are modeling coincidences in the data, rather than real trends. I once put a simulation on Data Science that takes this to the extreme. However, removing variables based on p-value is a form of stepwise regression, which has known issues . Andrew Gelman is not a fan, either , and Cross Validated has an answer with a $-58$ score that argues in favor of stepwise variable selection.
