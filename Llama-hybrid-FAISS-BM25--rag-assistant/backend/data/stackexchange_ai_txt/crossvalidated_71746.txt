Conditions for conclusion

A study had shown that annual income on average was significantly higher among men than women for people over 30 years old in Portugal. The results were from 312 Portuguese men and 62 Portuguese women. The samples were chosen (not randomly) by the researchers. Can we conclude that, in general, the annual income for Portuguese men is higher than the average income for Portuguese women? I think that we can not conclude this because of the following two reasons: The samples for both men and women were too low. The samples were not chosen randomly. Am I correct? Why or why not?
