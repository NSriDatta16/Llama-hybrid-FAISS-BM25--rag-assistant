The answer is simple: It cannot be done. As soon as you ship any solution to the end user, he or she can allways attack the server it is communicating with. The most common version of this problem is cheating with hi-score lists in Flash games. You can make it harder by embedding some sort of encryption in the client and obfuscating the code... But all compiled and obfuscated code can allways be decompiled and unobfuscated. It is just a matter of how much time and money you are willing to spend and likewise for the potential attacker. So your concern is not how to try to prevent the user from sending faulty data to your system. It is how to prevent the user from damaging your system. You have to design your interfaces so that all damage done by faulty data only affects the user sending it.
