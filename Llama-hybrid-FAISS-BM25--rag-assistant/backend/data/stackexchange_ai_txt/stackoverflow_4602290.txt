Create Framework for raw data or Binary read and write

I am working on one project in which data has to read in binary format but one can put into a structure format. In java Structure is not available. I have send the data in byte array. It also has some structure. For Example Packet int length int sequence no MessageData MessageData MessageHeader MessageBody MessageHeader int data1 long data2 char[] data3//2bytes char[] data4//3 bytes Same for MessageBody But data should be packed in byte array. One can do in CPP as #pragma(2) //for word alignment struct Packet{ int length int sequence no MessageData msgdata } I have to implement in java. for reading data I am using Preon library But for writing data I am still using normal method for packaging data in byte array with help of some function Anybody have work on same kind project or have better idea
