characters changed in a Curl request

When I look at the XML data feed i get with the below code, special characters are correct in the XML code. However when Curl returns the data, characters like "ó" and "ä" are converted into resp. "Ã³" and "Ã¤". This conversion happens to all special characters, these 2 are just an example. $myvar = curl_init(); $myURL = "http://someurl.com/"; curl_setopt($myvar, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, '[Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2")]'); curl_setopt($myvar, CURLOPT_URL, $myURL); curl_setopt($myvar, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE); curl_setopt($myvar, CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT, TRUE); curl_setopt($myvar, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,3); $xmlstr = curl_exec ($myvar); The header of the XML file says to encode as follows "?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?" All I want is to get the same characters to show up in the Curl result without any transformation. Hoping i just missed some plain easy step, looking forward to any answers. Best regards Fons
