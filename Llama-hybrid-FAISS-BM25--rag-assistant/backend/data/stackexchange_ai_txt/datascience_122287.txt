Regarding the Machine Learning approach. I would suggest to look at the kaggle G-research competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting It will help about data engineering, target engineering and modelling. Some take away: Binance offer a good API that is helpfull to get price. The ML approach will try to estimate the return over a given period of time. It doesn't give you other significant stuff (how to select time horizon ? how to deal with fees, how to measure performance ?) it will give you some feature engineering approach (work with returns, GK volatility estimation) the general approach weren't time series model (LSTM) but feature engineering (using lagged features) and tabular model (vanilla MLP / gbdt). regarding the discussion about using one model versus many, it wasnt entirely clear. Some used a general model, some used a generel model + a dummy variable for each coin, some used different models for each coin. In the end I remember people ensembling all those approaches. The data format might depend on what model you plan to use. If you go the tabular way i would suggest one big file (or one big file per fold). The problem with ML is that it won't answer very practical questions; how long do you hold ? how do you balance portfolio given predictions ? how do you account for fees ?
