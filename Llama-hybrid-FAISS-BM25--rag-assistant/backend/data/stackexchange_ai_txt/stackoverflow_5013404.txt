box2d + cocos2d: Why is there a delay when manipulating objects in box 2d using mouseJoint

When I drag an object in my game, the object is never directly under the finger. There us this lag / delay that I cannot get rid of. It follows my finger instead of being directly underneath it. You can try in the Testbed as well. Trying moving an object really fast and the object is never underneath the mouse/finger Is this a weakness in box2d? Or am I missing something obvious ? Thanks in advance
