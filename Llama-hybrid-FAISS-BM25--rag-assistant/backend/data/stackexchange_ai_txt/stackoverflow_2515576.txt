And the database technology you are looking for is SQL Server Compact Edition (a.k.a. SQLCE). An SQL CE database instance is a single file (.sdf) on the local file storage (much like the old Access Database stuff) and does NOT run as a separate service. So be sure you close your database connections neatly (use a finally clause!). From a brief reading of your app context I don't think you are going to have a massive multi-acess/connection pooling problem, though. Annoyances about the Windows Forms stuff on WinCE: sllllooooowwww (the graphics accelerator is not available or something) labels do not auto size, readonly multilne textboxes are something one sometimes falls back on text on buttons does not word wrap animated GIFs are not supported on PictureBoxes By the time you have revised code running on your device you will find it very hard to port back, so look to keep a new tree on your source control entirely ... :(
