How to install a MIDlet on a SonyEricsson phone directly in the Organizer folder

This question refers strictly to Sony Ericsson phones running Java Platform 8 or higher. It is possible to instruct the AMS to install the application in one of the folders Applications or Games. But I want to install the MIDlet in a different folder. The target folders are Organizer, Entertainment or Location services. Is it possible to instruct the AMS to install my MIDlet in one of these folders?
