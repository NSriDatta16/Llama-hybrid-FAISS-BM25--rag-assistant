If your SWF embedding object has an ID (or any other means of unique identification, for that matter), then it is rather simple to change its size. Using jQuery, for example: $("#swf").height(500); This sets the height of the SWF to 500 pixels. It is fairly simple even without jQuery: document.getElementById("swf").style.height = "500px"; To call javascript from inside Flash, use the ExternalInterface class, it has a static method for this purpose. (Alternatively, you may use the navigateToURL() static function with "javascript:" protocol.)
