Casting List - covariance/contravariance problem

Given the following types: public interface IMyClass { } public class MyClass : IMyClass { } I wonder how can I convert a List to a List ? I am not completely clear on the covariance/contravariance topics, but I understand that I cannot just plainly cast the List because of that. I could come up with this trivial solution only; lacking any elegance, wasting resources: ... public List ConvertItems(List input) { var result = new List (input.Count); foreach (var item in input) { result.Add(item); } return result; } .... How can you solve it in a more elegant/performant way? ( Please, mind that I need .NET 2.0 solution, but for completeness, I would be happy to see the more elegant solutions using newer framework versions, too. )
