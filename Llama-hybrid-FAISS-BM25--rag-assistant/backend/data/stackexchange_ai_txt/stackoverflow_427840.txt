Strictly speaking, since StringChild is derived from StringBase it's not safe. The C++ standard does not specify the layout for base class subobjects. Clause 10 Paragraph 3: The order in which the base class subobjects are allocated in the most derived object (1.8) is unspecified. If StringChild were a POD struct, then such a technique would be safe.
