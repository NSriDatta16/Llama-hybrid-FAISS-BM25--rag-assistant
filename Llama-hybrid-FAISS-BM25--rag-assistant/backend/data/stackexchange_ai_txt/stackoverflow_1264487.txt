How to get a related object sorted with Entity Framework for ASP.NET MVC

Having two classes like Blog and Post, in Entity Framework (and LINQ-to-Entities), how can you get the blogs with the posts sorted by date. I was getting the blogs with the posts this way: from blog in db.BlogSet.Include("Posts") select blog and now I'm forced to do this: public class BlogAndPosts { public Blog Blog { get; set; } public IEnumerable Posts { get; set; } } from blog in db.BlogSet select new BlogAndPosts () { Blog = blog, Posts = blog.Posts.OrderByDescending(p => p.PublicationTime) } which is very convoluted and ugly. The reason why I'm creating a BlogPosts class is that now, since I have to pass two variables, Blog and Posts, to MVC, I need a view model. I'm even tempted to try this hack: from blog in db.BlogSet select new Blog(blog) { Posts = blog.Posts.OrderByDescending(p => p.PublicationTime) } but what's the correct way to do it? Is Entity Framework not the way to go with MVC?
