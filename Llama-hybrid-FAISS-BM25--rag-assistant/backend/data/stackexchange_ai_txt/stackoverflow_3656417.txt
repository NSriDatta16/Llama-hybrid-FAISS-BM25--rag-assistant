How to determine android database max size and prevent SQLiteFullException?

I have few queries on Android SQLiteDatabase 1.) As normally the database stored in internal memory, can we specify the path of external storage and use it in similar way ? 2.) How to determine the size of available space of database ? I used getMaximumSize() from SQLIteDatabase class but that gives me 1099511626752 Is this in bytes ? If assumed then this seems to be too large and not practical. I am using HTC G1 to test this. 3.) How can I determine the size of an entry in table ? Or do I have to pull the whole table and manually see its size. Is it same that would be in phone storage ? 4.) Can I check if any free space available before making entry in database ? I want to prevent SQLiteFullException. Thanks.
