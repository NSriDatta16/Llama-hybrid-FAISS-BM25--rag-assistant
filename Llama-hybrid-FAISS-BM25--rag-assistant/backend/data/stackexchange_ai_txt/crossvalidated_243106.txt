How to manually calculate the intercept and coefficient in logistic regression

I'm currently studying about Logistic Regression. But I'm getting stuck at calculating intercept ($\beta_0$) and coefficient ($\beta_1$). I've been looking for it through the internet, but only get tutorials using Microsoft Excel or built-in functions in R. I heard it can be solved by Maximum Likelihood, but I don't understand how to use it, because I don't have a statistical background. Can anyone can give me a brief explanation and simulation for calculating the coefficients manually?
