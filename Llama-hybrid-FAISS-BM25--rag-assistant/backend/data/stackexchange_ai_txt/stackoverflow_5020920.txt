The simple reason being that the control always first go to main.Thus it is automatically located by the compiler thus giving its prototype is redundant and is of no use. Also we use prototype when call to a function is made prior to its definition.Thus looking at the function prototype compiler can decide whether call is legitimate or not.But in case of main we are accustomed to provide its definition along with its declaration (which is logically correct also)thus no need of prototype. Even when we make our c programs organized into multiple files there is no need for prototype of main .
