As has been stated, the HTML name and id attributes are generated by the naming containers and based on the application namespace. This prevents collisions when controls are children of repeating controls (like a UIData ) or a JSP is rendered twice in one page (like in a portlet environment). The id rendered to the HTML is the clientId . It is possible to hardcode or build the clientId manually, but this is a very fragile approach. It is better to use the component's getClientId(FacesContext) method; this is what the renderers use. A bean that can get the clientId for a bound component: /** Request scope */ public class IdBean implements Serializable { private UIComponent mytext; public String getClientId() { return mytext.getClientId(FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()); } public UIComponent getMytext() { return mytext; } public void setMytext(UIComponent mytext) { this.mytext = mytext; } public List getRows() { List rows = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i The view: function foo(name) { alert('You clicked '+name); } The mytext control is rendered 10 times, so any code that emits its name must also be a child of the dataTable.
