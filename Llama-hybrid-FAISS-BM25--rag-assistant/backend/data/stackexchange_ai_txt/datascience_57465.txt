To One-Hot-Encode or not to One-Hot-Encode?

I have been struggling to find proof for that but I couldnt Every time I prepare dataset I face the same issue when a column is a classification such as CountryCode or TaskType in this dataset TaskType CountryCode Target 1 61 Red 1 962 Yellow 2 1 Yellow 6 61 Yellow 4 81 Red 2 1 Blue 1 61 Red 2 962 Green 4 61 Blue if I applied the dataset as to different models such as linear regression, SVM, KNN, etc. will these model consider CountryCode and TaskType as numeric fields and treat them as continuous data? Shall I One Hot Encode these features before using them? what is the best way to handle this scenario?
