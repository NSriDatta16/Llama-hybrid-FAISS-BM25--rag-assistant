The standard method uses Ripley's K function or something derived from it such as an L function. This is a plot that summarizes the average number of neighbors of the points as a function of maximum distance apart ($\rho$). For a uniform distribution in $n$ dimensions, that average ought to behave like $\rho^n$: and it always will for small $\rho$. It departs from such behavior due to clustering, other forms of spatial non-independence, and edge effects (whence it is crucial to specify the region sampled by the points). Because of this complication--which gets worse as $n$ increases--in most applications a confidence band is erected for the null K function via simulation and the observed K function is overplotted to detect excursions. With some thought and experience, the excursions can be interpreted in terms of tendencies to cluster or not at certain distances. Examples of a K function and its associated L-function from Dixon (2001), ibid. The L function is constructed so that $L(\rho)-\rho$ for a uniform distribution is the horizontal line at zero: a good visual reference. The dashed lines are confidence bands for this particular study area, computed via simulation. The solid gray trace is the L function for the data. The positive excursion at distances 0-20 m indicates some clustering at these distances. I posted a worked example in response to a related question at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/7984 , where a plot derived from the K-function for a uniform distribution on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is estimated by simulation. In R , the spatstat functions kest and k3est compute the K-function for $n=2$ and $n=3$, respectively. In more than 3 dimensions you are probably on your own, but the algorithms would be exactly the same. You could do the computations from a distance matrix as computed (with moderate efficiency) by stats::dist .
