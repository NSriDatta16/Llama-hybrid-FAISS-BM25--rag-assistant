Question about wording(sql)

I just need help understanding what the following questions are asking for. List all details about packages. Sort the output by descending package cost within package type. What I don't get is "within package type" I know this much: SELECT * FROM PACKAGE, ORDER PACKCOST DESC; But I don't get the within?? List the average package cost for packages of each type. Then list only averages for types containing more than one package. So for this one I guess I should do the average for each type, then the average for each type that has > 1 packages??? Sorry I don't have the tables. Thanks. Table fields: PACKID PACKNAME PACKVER PACKTYPE PACKCOST
