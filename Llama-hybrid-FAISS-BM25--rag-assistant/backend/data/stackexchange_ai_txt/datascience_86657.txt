How to update Tensorflow with Anaconda

I installed the packages for Tensorflow and Keras by using the Anaconda Packege installer (I have a separate environment for that). Unfortunately I can't use Tensorflow or Keras. When I use the following code, I get an error message: import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras zip_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file( origin='https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip', fname='jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip', extract=True) csv_path, _ = os.path.splitext(zip_path) --> Error message: AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'keras' I tried to check the version of tensorflow by using the following code: import tensorflow as tf print(tf.__version__) --> Error message: AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute ' version ' I checked in the package manager of Anaconda and there the version of Tensorflow is 2.1.0 (see Screenshot) From this website I can see that there is in fact a version 2.2 ( https://docs.floydhub.com/guides/environments/ ) However, I tried to update tensorflow (such that I can use it with keras) by using Conda update tensorflow But this did not change anything. I get the message: "# All requested packages already installed." and problem still persists and the version number remained unchanged. Also trying Conda update keras yields the same message "# All requested packages already installed." What am I doing wrong? I'd appreciate every comment and would be quite thankful for your help.
