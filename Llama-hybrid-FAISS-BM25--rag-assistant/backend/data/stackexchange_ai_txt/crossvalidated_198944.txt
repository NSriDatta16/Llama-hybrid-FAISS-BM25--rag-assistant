data wrangling for predictive modeling

This question is about data wrangling. Say I had the following data set: df = data.frame(id=c(5012, 5012, 1256, 1256, 1256, 102), feature=c(1, 2, 5, 7, 6, 0), result=c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2)) How would I manipulate feature in a way that allows predictive modeling with things like random forest, neural nets, multinomial regression etc.? Should I convert feature into K , K=length(unique(df$feature)) number of dummy binary variables? Is this feasible if K is really large, like K>=2000 , for n=5*K number of observations? Say I am trying to predict Y ( result ) for observation ID , given X ( feature ).
