Like other responders I prefer to use frameworks, but my favorite is dojo -- clean and well-designed architecture, good books (my favorite being Matthew Russel's ), and a particularly impressive approach to using browser extensions (such as Google Gears or Microsoft Silverlight) if the user has them installed, while falling back gracefully (e.g. to Ajax-interfaced server-side storage) if no suitable browser extensions (or sufficiently advanced browsers, with HTML5 support) are present. Dojo is , currently, slightly less popular than jquery (e.g., [jquery ajax] has 8.4 million hits on Google Search, vs 4.3 million for [dojo ajax] ), but that's still way popular enough to ensure it won't go away any time soon;-).
