I'm serving a "few hundred users" from a single EC2 High-CPU Medium instance. No load balancing, no dedicated DB servers, nothing fancy at all. Simply a single box. Additionally I'm using some services: Elastic Block Store for MySQL data, MySQL binlogs and Lucene indexes S3 for resource and backup storage, obviously different baskets for each SimpleDB Metadata for resources CloudFront for resources - mainly because we can :) Simple Queue Service for messaging (used to queue some background tasks) As I said, nothing fancy - at least in Amazon's cloud environment. And everything for less than 200$/month. Regarding pricing, you should take care though. Amazon did a good job at obfuscating main costs. For example, looking at CloudFront Pricing, you might look at 0,15$ per GB but ignore 0,01$ per 10,000 - it's a ridiculously small price for a lot of requests, isn't it? Big surprise: 2/3 of our CloudFront cost is for requests (about 3 KB per request). I/O requests for EBS is a similar story. As it would be extremely easy to scale (use a bigger instance, move DB on Relational Database Service ) I'd suggest you start with the same setup. As you said, throwing more boxes in is pretty simple (assuming your setup supports adding/removing nodes on the fly). This makes choosing the appropriate setup by trial and error easily feasible - some thorough load testing should do the job. Choose something that works for your expected load (plus some extra power) and grow/shrink as soon as you have production data. As a conclusion: yes, it's certainly possible to host Java EE apps on EC2 :) Edit: as a side note: comparing pricing of EC2 with traditional hosting is comparing apples and oranges - at least as long as you don't get an SLA for your network, nearly unlimited scalability, no hardware issues, nearly unlimited and redundant storage, different availability zones and a bunch of extra services with it. If somebody tells you that traditional hosting is cheaper, he might be a sysadmin anxious about his job ;) Don't get me wrong, it is cheaper - but you get much less for a little less money. And by the way, I'm in no way affiliated with Amazon ... but I feel that I should be rewarded for being a good spokesman, shouldn't I? :D
