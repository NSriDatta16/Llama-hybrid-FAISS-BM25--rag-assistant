Martin's answer is correct on Windows Server 2003: You will have to assign the "Lock pages in memory" privilege to any user that runs your > application. This includes administrators Select Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy Select Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment Double click "Lock pages in memory", add users and/or groups Reboot the machine On Windows Vista you need also make sure that the application is run as Administrator (by right-clicking on the application or the shell and choosing "Run as adminstrator". In addition, it helps to have a freshly booted machine since the large pages can "run out" due to fragmentation of the heap.
