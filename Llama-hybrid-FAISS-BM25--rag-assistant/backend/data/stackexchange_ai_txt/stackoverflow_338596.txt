There is a special field called "Page N of M". Drag that onto your page and that should give you the numbering scheme that you're after. Edited to add: Sorry, I read your post and didn't "read" your post. The problem is that these aren't really pages but a continuation of a page or virtual pages. What if you were to use Page N of M and right-click that on your pageview and go to the format editor. Try selecting, "Repeat on Horizontal Pages" from the Common tab and see what type of behavior you get from that. Otherwise, I don't know if it's possible without a complicated formula.
