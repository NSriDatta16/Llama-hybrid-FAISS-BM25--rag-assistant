This answer doesn't comment on mixed models, but I can explain what the random-effects estimator does and why it screws up on that graph. Summary: the random-effects estimator assumes $E[u_i \mid x ] = 0$ , which is not true in this example. What is the random effects estimator doing? Assume we have the model: $$ y_{it} = \beta x_{it} + u_i + \epsilon_{it}$$ We have two dimensions of variation: groups $i$ and time $t$ . To estimate $\beta$ we could: Only use time-series variation within a group. This is what the fixed-effect estimator does (and this is why it's also often called the within estimator.) If $u_i$ is random, we could use only cross-sectional variation between the time-series means of groups. This is known as the between estimator. Specifically, for each group $i$ , take the average over time of the above panel data model to get: $$ \bar{y}_{i} = \beta \bar{x}_{i} + v_i \quad \quad \text{ where } v_i = u_i + \bar{\epsilon}_i$$ If we run this regression, we get the between estimator. Observe that it is a consistent estimator if the effects $u_i$ are random white noise, uncorrelated with $x$ ! If this is the case, then completely tossing the between group variation (as we do with the fixed effects estimator) is inefficient. The random-effects estimator of econometrics combines the (1) within estimator (i.e. fixed effects estimator) and (2) the between estimator in a way to maximize efficiency. It is an application of generalized least squares and the basic idea is inverse variance weighting . To maximize efficiency, the random-effects estimator calculates $\hat \beta$ as a weighted average of the within estimator and the between estimator. What's going on in that graph... Just eyeballing that graph, you can clearly see what's going on: Within each group $i$ (i.e. dots of the same color), a higher $x_{it}$ is associated with a lower $y_{it}$ A group $i$ with a higher $\bar{x}_i$ has a higher $u_i$ . The random effects assumption that $E[u_i \mid x ] = 0$ is clearly not satisfied. The group effects $u_i$ are not orthogonal to $x$ (in a statistical sense), rather, the group effects have a clear positive relationship with $x$ . The between estimator assumes $E[u_i \mid x ] = 0$ . The between estimator says, "sure I can impose $E[u_i \mid x ] = 0$ , by making $\hat \beta$ positive!" Then in turn, the random-effects estimator is off because it's a weighted average of the within estimator and the between estimator.
