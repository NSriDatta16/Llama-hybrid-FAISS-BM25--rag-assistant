In general, I think it looks good, and it's usually a good idea to create viewmodels for your domain objects. I haven't looked at every single line of code, but one thing that caught my attention was the constructors of OrganisationViewModel. I'd rewrite it using: public OrganisationViewModel() : this(new Organisation()) { } public OrganisationViewModel(Organisation o) { Organisation = o; InitCollections(); } This removes some duplicate code, as you don't have to call InitCollections() in both constructors. Of course, this is just a minor detail, and has nothing to do with the general idea.
