I think the easiest way to do this would be to create a category on the UIColor class and create a class method on it. For example: Place this in a header file (e.g. UIColor+CustomColors.h): @interface UIColor ( CustomColors ) + (UIColor *)myCustomColor; @end Place this in an implementation file (e.g. UIColor+CustomColors.m) @implementation UIColor ( CustomColors ) + (UIColor *)myCustomColor { return [UIColor colorWithRed:0.2 green:0.5 blue:0.2 alpha:1.0]; } @end Then you have access to the class method anywhere in your code like so: ... self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor myCustomColor]; ... See Apple's documentation on Categories for more info. Alternatively, you can save swatches of color through the system color palette. To do this you simply call up the system color palette, select a color and drag it into the grid of colors. These colors are now available in not only every Interface Builder document you create, but any application that makes use of the system color palette. color palette http://img.skitch.com/20091030-dhh3tnfw5d8hkynyr7e5q3amwg.png
