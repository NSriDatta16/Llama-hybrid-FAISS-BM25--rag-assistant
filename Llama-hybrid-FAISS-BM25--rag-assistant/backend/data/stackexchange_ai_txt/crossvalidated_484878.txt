Have you thought about using Bayesian Optimisation (BO)? BO employs a Gaussian process to minimise/maximise a function, it is quite useful when your function is noisy. BO will optimise the expected value of your function. We can think of the variance as a function of a parameter $\theta$ . If the RV is $X$ and $X \sim MyDistribution(\theta)$ then we will just aim to minimise $f(\theta) = \log (\text{Var}(X | \theta))$ . In your example, we would use the noisy estimates of the variance you have plotted in the figure on the right.
