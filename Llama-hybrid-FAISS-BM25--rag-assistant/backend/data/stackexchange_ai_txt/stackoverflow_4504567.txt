Windows phone 7 Media Element wav pause

I'm recording sound from microphone. Then I save PCM with wav header to isolated storage. Afterwards I play it using MediaElement. I want to have ability to pause the song but it's seems to be impossible. I've tried to use SmoothStreamingMediaElement but the problem was the same - maybe I did something wrong. If anybody has any idea how to pause the song from microhone then please help. Here is my code but pause doesn't work. Maybe I can read the file different way? using (var store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { using (var audio = store.OpenFile(_song_path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) { _media_element.MediaOpened += new RoutedEventHandler(_media_element_MediaOpened); _media_element.SetSource(audio); audio.Close(); } } Pausing code is quite simple :) private void button2_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { _media_element.Pause(); } For testing I have made simple project with ability to downloading files from web and playing it from isolated storage. It works with wmv and mp3 but not with wav. Here is VS project DowloadingAndPlayingWav If anybody has any idea pleas help. I've hacked probably entire internet - there is no solution for this problem.
