How to Program for Multiple Text Column Layout? So that Text Flows into Multiple Columns!

was happy when found css3/Mozillas multiple text column option, BUT source1 & source2 prove that IE9, the most popular browser as of jan 2011, will NOT support multi-column css3! BUMMER! Currently I use a stupid workflow, namely divide text manually into three divs that float to left. As you can imagine, this is a pain in the ass, since I have to reflow everything over and over until I get it right. Positive note: manual control of paragraph beginnings and endings! Text1 Text2 Text3 Question what are the solutions to smartly flow text into multiple columns, while having only one undivided text1 Text2 Text3 as input? Perhaps you already know a solution, or can suggest/sketch how you would share here with me? Any kind of inspiration is welcome, even seemingly off-topic images of newspaper layouts, since the entire purpose of this topic, obviously, is to be able to read pages more easily/beautifully . Thanks!
