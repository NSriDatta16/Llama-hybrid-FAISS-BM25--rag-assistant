For things like this .Net has an isolated storage. It is possible to select what will be the scope of the isolated storage machine/application/user etc. Depneding on scope the .Net creates a special directory under user or machine profile, where the application can store special application/user related data. To get the storage the following commad is used: IsolatedStorageFile isoStore = IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore( IsolatedStorageScope.Assembly | IsolatedStorageScope.User, null, null); To get files in the specific Isolated storage the GetFileNames is used: string[] fileNames = isoStore.GetFileNames(); To create or open a stream in the isolated storage: // use the correct FileMode flag Open/Create/Trancate/etc. IsolatedStorageFileStream isoStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream( , FileMode.Create, isoStore);
