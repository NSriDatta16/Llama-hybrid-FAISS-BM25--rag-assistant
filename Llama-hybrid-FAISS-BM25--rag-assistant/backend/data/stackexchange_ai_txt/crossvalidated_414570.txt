How to handle missing data in timeseries classification?

I'm using 16-channel, 400-Hz, standardized EEG data to train CNN-LSTM for seizure classification. The data contains periods of no recordings (flatlines) - spanning anywhere from seconds to minutes - example images below. How should these periods be handled? Help is appreciated. Methods considered so far: (1) Cutting out entirely (and then joining segments) $-$ seems unsound, as it conveys a meaningful continuity where none exists (2) Interpolation/Imputation $-$ methods vary, but using generative models to fill the gaps per local distributions doesn't seem unreasonable - any thoughts? (3) Noise imputation $-$ a 'cheap' alternative to generative models: replacing flatlines with Gaussian noise w/ $\sigma,\mu=$ local distribution's (nearest $\Delta t$ timesteps on both sides) (4) Predictive interpolation $-$ predict the missing segments w/ predictive models
