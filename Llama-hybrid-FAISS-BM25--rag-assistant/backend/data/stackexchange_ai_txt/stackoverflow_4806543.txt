Non GPS GeoLocation API - Google Vs. others (Skyhook / Navizon / Xtify / etc)

I am working on creating an LBS location aware app for iPhone, Android, Java, and Blackberry, which does NOT rely on GPS. I therefore need a GSM cell tower GeoLocation API to identify the phone's location. I can use 3rd party solutions such as Google's Geolocation API / Skyhook / Navizon / Xtify / etc. From what I understand, Google's Geolocation API is free, while all the others are not free and do not have as much coverage as Google's. Therefore the obvious solutions would be to write my mobile application using and accessing Google's Geolocation API. The dilemma seems too simple and if it is too good to be true, it usually is. What am I missing...?? Many thanx
