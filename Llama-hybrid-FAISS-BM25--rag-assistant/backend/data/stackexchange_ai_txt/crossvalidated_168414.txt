Excluding certain types of values from a Bayesian Network

I've been playing around in GeNie and I've been trying to construct a network of a certain structure, and I am not sure how to deal with impossible combinations of values for certain variables. Let's assume, we have three variables: A("the cat is under a table, the Sun is shining"), B("the cat is on a couch, it's cloudy"), C("it's raining, it's sunny) [see the picture]. And C is a common child for A and B. And when filling up a probability table, I was wondering how to exclude the possibility of "it's raining" (or it's sunny) given "the cat is under a table" and "the cat is on a table", as it can never be that if the cat is in one place, it can also be in another. Just physical impossibility. Any idea how to deal with it? Am I missing something fundamental here?
