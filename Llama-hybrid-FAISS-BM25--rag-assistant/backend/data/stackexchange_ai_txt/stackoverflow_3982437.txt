Xpath best practices

I have a readonly xml file and I have a set of xpath values. I need to create a function which would take in the xpath and return the value(s) corresponding to the xpath. I am a little confused regarding what would be the best way to proceed. The options I am thinking are using the regular XPathDocument/Navigator/Iterator classes or using LINQ to xml. The function I am trying to implement is: T GetString(string inputXpath) where T could be bool/string/array etc. Can someone help?Also, this function is going to be called all across the application, so performance might be a consideration. Thank you! -Agent
