jQuery-JSONP plugin fails when placed in a directory

I have an HTML page that uses the JSONP Plugin to gracefully handle errors in my JSONP call. My problem is quite perplexing (and I hope it has a simple, easy "D'Oh!" solution :)). When the .js file is in the same directory as the HTML page and is loaded like this: All works well. But if I move it to the internal JS directory, where all my other JS files are: It always calls the error function. I traced it with FireBug and it calls the $.jsonp function, but immediately jumps to the error function. The code itself looks like this: $.jsonp( { url: ipUrl, timeout: 30000, success: displayData, error: displayError } ); Any ideas? I really want to ship this in an organized manner. Thanks for your time. Couple of facts: the page is tested locally (no web server). There are no permissions/security issues . There are other .js files in that same directory that load well. The error occurs in all browsers. UPDATE : based on Alex's suggestion, I downloaded the unminified version and put it in the js directory. I changed the reference in HTML page and traced with FireBug. The function DOES receive the right URL and actually works! I went back and forth from unminified to minified and the result is clear: something is screwed up in the minified version! Still, I wonder what could screw up a function in a way that its location matters??? Should I just ship the unminifed version and forget about it? Update 2 - the solution : I minified the open file myself (I used Alex's link to get the C# code for JSMin ), I compiled, and minimized the file - and it worked. I then compared it to the file I downloaded - the carriage returns were screwed. Downloaded the file again - and everything works.
