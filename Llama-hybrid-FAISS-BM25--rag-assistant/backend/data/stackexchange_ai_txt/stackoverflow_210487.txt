I participated in the hobbyist development of the BitTorrent client in Haskell (named conjure). It uses STM quite heavily to coordinate different threads (1 per peer + 1 for storage management + 1 for overall management). Benefits: less locks, readable code. Speed was not an issue, at least not due to STM usage. Hope this helps
