How Would I know my Azure Table Storage AccountName?

I'm trying to move some table storage in Azure from local storage to the cloud. I had been using the "devstoreaccount1" for local access, but I'm not sure what I need to put there for moving to the cloud. It's not the user account I used to sign up for my Azure accounts, is it? That's just my email address, and that didn't seem to work. I've tried the project name without luck either. Is there anywhere in the portal that lists this account name?
