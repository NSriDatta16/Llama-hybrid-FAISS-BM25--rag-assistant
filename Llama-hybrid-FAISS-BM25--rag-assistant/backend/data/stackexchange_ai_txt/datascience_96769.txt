Do you have a data sample to answer better to your question? For instance, are those variables related to time? If yes, time series based models could be interesting like multi LSTM: LSTM Multi-class classification for large number of classes If not, you could use a random forest regressor. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html My best advice is to start with a simple single model that makes predictions on A, B and C, and then try more complex ones.
