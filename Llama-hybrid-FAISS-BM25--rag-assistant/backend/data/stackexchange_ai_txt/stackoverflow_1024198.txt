Let's say we would like to make an exponential decaying average on a continuous function. However we don't have all the values of that function, only a few samples. This formula would make a weighted average of the samples that we do have with the weights they would have in the continuous average. Multiplier n = Alpha Time n -Time n-1 Sum n = Val n + Sum n-1 *Multiplier n Count n = 1 + Count n-1 *Multiplier n Avg n = Sum n /Count n
