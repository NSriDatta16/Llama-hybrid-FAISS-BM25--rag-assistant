EF4 basically adds a whole bunch of OO-ness to the mapping that isn't present in LINQ-to-SQL, such as rich object inheritance models. My own take on it is that none of that is necessary for good design, and I have yet to come across a single scenario in my own work that warrants the added complexity EF4 brings to the table. Having said that, Microsoft has deprecated LINQ-to-SQL and will not continue developing it, so it will eventually fall behind EF4 in capability and efficiency (if it hasn't already). So the pragmatic choice is simple: go EF4.
