You are making the false assumption that just because you are capable of creating a web application in JavaScript and that such an application may be of superior usability that consumers want it. Research, that I do not have to give you, suggests that users do not want usability additions when such additions are contrary to efficiency in execution or download. Additionally, JavaScript can be used maliciously and in ways that are absolutely annoying. I remember when YouTube first attempted to introduce ads on the site. You could watch three videos and then you would be redirected to a page of ads instead of a choice of another video. In that case I turned out JavaScript to bypass the ad stupidity and then turned it back on to process the flash object request. If I were are a security manager at a large business that did not produce web services I would recommend that JavaScript be disabled by default in the browser settings and require administrative level privileges to change it. Any browser that does not allow such administrative management from an enterprise level would be blocked from installation. In that same spirit I would also block use of Flash, completely disable the same features in Acrobat, and completely disable ActiveX. Honestly, if web businesses are not willing to provide a security solution to the horrific security condition then those businesses reliant upon such technologies would fail to receive the business of my organizations employees from company systems.
