Which MySQL data types should I not be quoting during an INSERT?

As a beginner with MySQL, I want to get this right. My main hangup right now is the DECIMAL type. From the docs : As of MySQL 5.0.3, values for DECIMAL columns are represented using a binary format that packs nine decimal (base 10) digits into four bytes. Before MySQL 5.0.3, DECIMAL columns are represented as strings and storage requirements are... So the question is, which data types should I NOT be quoting during an INSERT? I assume I should not use quotes around any of the INTs, FLOAT, DOUBLE and REAL. What about DECIMAL? Any I'm forgetting? EDIT: I understand MySQL will "convert to the proper type," but I want to get the right answer regardless. =)
