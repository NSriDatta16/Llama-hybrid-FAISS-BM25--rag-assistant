You are highjacking the response and returning your generated image instead of the pages html with this line of code. objBMP.Save(Response.OutputStream, ImageFormat.Gif); A possible way around this is to instead save the image to the filesystem on the server and set the image src to point at this. However this will obviously result in a lot of image files which will have to be cleaned up with either a background process or when the captcha is submitted. A more elegant solution would be to use a HTTPHandler although you must ensure you reference IRequiresSessionState in order to save your value to session. You can now refer to this handler in the images source property: [WebService(Namespace = " http://tempuri.org/ ")] [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)] public class CaptchaHandler : IHttpHandler, IRequiresSessionState { public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context) { Bitmap objBMP = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(150, 60); Graphics objGraphics = System.Drawing.Graphics.FromImage(objBMP); objGraphics.Clear(Color.IndianRed); objGraphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias; Font objFont = new Font("Arial", 25, FontStyle.Italic); string randomStr = ""; int[] myIntArray = new int[5]; int x; Random autoRand = new Random(); for (x = 0; x Edit: I meant IRequiresSessionState not IReadOnlySessionState
