Powerbar, this answer is to address your last comment. Perhaps you can think of your simulation as representing a model for fuel consumption as a function of % minivans on the road plus a random noise component. So every time you run the simulation you get a slightly distorted picture of the curve because of the additive noise component. Each simulation is giving you at various % minivans simulated the value of the function + a random component. If the simulations are independent and the random components are independent (a very reasonable assumption) then averaging the values at each % minivan will improve the estimate of the "actual" fuel consumption value because the average reduces the variance of the noise by a factor of 1/n at each point. In your case choosing 5 reduces it by a factor of 1/5. The standard deviation is reduced by a factor of 1/sqrt(5) or 1/2.236. So the variation from the curve is 2.236 times smaller for the averaged data. Had you used 3 or 4 it would have helped also but not as much. For n larger than 5 would help even more but may not be necessary since your eye saw satisfactory smoothness.
