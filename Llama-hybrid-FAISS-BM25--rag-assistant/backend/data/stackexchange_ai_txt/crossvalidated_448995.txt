How to know which one is random variable?

Given a time series equation: $$x_t=\beta_1+\beta_2t+w_t$$ where $w_t$ is white noise. When I am calulateing the mean: $$E[x_t]=E[\beta_1+\beta_2t+w_t]$$ $$=\beta_1+\beta_2t+E[w_t]$$ $$=\beta_1+\beta_2t$$ However, isn't the varibale $t$ , also a random variable s.t. the answer should be $$E[x_t]=\beta_1+\beta_2E[t]$$ ? Edit: the whole question is: Consider the time series $x_t=\beta_1+\beta_2t+w_t$ , where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are known constants and $w_t$ is a white noise process with variance $\sigma^2$ .
