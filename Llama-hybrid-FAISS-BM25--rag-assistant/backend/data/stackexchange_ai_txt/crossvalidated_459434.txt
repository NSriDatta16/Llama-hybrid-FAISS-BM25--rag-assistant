I am afraid I cannot reproduce your similar results.. see below for a reproducible example, maybe you can provide the example dataset so that we can explore it further: library(vegan) data(dune) data(dune.env) table(dune.env$Management) BF HF NM SF 3 5 6 6 set.seed(111) adonis(dune ~ A1, data = dune.env,strata=dune.env$Management) Blocks: strata Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(>F) A1 1 0.7230 0.72295 3.6389 0.16817 0.031 * Residuals 18 3.5761 0.19867 0.83183 Total 19 4.2990 1.00000 adonis(dune ~ A1, data = dune.env) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(>F) A1 1 0.7230 0.72295 3.6389 0.16817 0.007 ** Residuals 18 3.5761 0.19867 0.83183 Total 19 4.2990 1.00000 R2, SumsOfSqs and MeanSqs are calculated based on your observed data, and it depends on your model, so for both codes (with or without strata) this is unchanged. To understand why the p-values might be different, adonis "uses a permutation test with pseudo-F ratios." (see vignette ). This would entail permutating the rows of the dissimilarity matrix (or whatever is on the LHS), and re performing the test under the condition where association between the response variable (distance in this case) and your variable of interest is lost. It collects this permutated F values and calculates how many of these are larger than your actual F value (in my dune example it is 3.6389), giving you a p-value. Maybe check out this for more explanation If there is a structure to your data, you might want to restrict the way this permutation goes, for example in your case, you want to preserve the effect of island, and randomize the disease effect, then you specify the strata to be island. In my example, I specify it to be Management. In your situation, you might want to check whether there is any difference in the dissimilarity matrix between island. If not, then most likely the strata is unlikely to have an effect.
