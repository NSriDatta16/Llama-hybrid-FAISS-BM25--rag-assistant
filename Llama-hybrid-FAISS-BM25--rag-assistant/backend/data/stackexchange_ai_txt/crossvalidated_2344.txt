Best way to present a random forest in a publication?

I am using the random forest algorithm as a robust classifier of two groups in a microarray study with 1000s of features. What is the best way to present the random forest so that there is enough information to make it reproducible in a paper? Is there a plot method in R to actually plot the tree, if there are a small number of features? Is the OOB estimate of error rate the best statistic to quote?
