I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do, but maybe you could try this: Dim count As Integer = 0 Const MAX_CUSTOMERS As Integer = 500 Dim customers As List(Of Customers) = dataAcess.GetCustomers() For Each c As Customer In customers 'do stuff here' c.Name = "Billy" count+=1 If count = MAX_CUSTOMERS Then Exit For Next It's not elegant by any means, but it makes sense and it will work.
