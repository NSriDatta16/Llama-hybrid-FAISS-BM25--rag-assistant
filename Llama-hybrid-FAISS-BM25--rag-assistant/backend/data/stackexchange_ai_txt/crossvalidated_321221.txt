Very very broad topic. Pearson Correlation only gives you linear association. Spearman and Kendall correlations would give rank associations (monotonic relationships). However, you do not want to limit yourself to correlation alone. Read "An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection" before you read anything else. I would not distinguish techniques as machine learning / non-machine learning. They are all statistical inference techniques. If the end goal is to classify it certainly makes sense to check the discriminatory information captured by each feature individually (one way is decision trees that use the Gini index or entropy, another is regularisation penalties like L1 or L2 regression). But then again, some features may be uninformative on their own, whereas quite informative when combined with others. Hence, I will finish how I started: Read "An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection" . It is a very good paper, and will definitely give you more context than any answer can in this limited space. Once you have finished the paper, I would start investigating multicollinearity , variance inflation factor, etc.
