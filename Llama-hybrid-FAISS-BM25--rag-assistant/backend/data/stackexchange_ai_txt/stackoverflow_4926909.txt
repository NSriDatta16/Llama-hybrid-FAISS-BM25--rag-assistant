There are a few standard OTS products (some may be free) that do what you are saying. Here are a few that I have used: NCover - Provides test coverage. The metrics this provides are good for illuminating areas where testing should be beefed up. I by no means recommend 100% test coverage...but the percentage should be high. NDepend - Provide code analysis / metrics that illuminate classes that may need to be refactored. ReSharper - Code analysis as you type to provide a 'coding standard' that all developers follow. This is an extremely helpful tool to ensure everyone's code meets a common standard. Very nice. Bob
