Once you have the image (I didn't think you were asking about the drag-and-drop feature, if that was the part you were asking about, sorry.), you can either push the image into an ImageIcon and display it in a JLabel as described here Or you can mess around with using Graphics#drawImage methods in paintComponent to draw Images . Something along the lines of (as a very basic example): public void paintComponent(Graphics page) { super.paintComponent(page); page.drawImage(img, 0, 0, null); } I give a more detailed example here .
