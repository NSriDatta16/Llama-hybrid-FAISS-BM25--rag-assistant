Was every (Bayesian) "Prior" once a "Non-Prior"?

I have always had the following question: Was every (Bayesian) "Prior" once a "Non-Prior"? This seems more like a philosophical question to me, but logically speaking : before something can be considered as prior knowledge, at an earlier point in time - this "prior knowledge" must not have been known, and must have been "directly observed"? If you takes Bayes' Law for instance: In a philosophical sense, could we say the following about Baye's Law? In this regard, Was every (Bayesian) "Prior" once a "Non-Prior"? Thanks!
