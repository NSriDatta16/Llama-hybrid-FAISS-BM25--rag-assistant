Have a good hash function for a C++ hash table?

I am in need of a performance-oriented hash function implementation in C++ for a hash table that I will be coding. I looked around already and only found questions asking what's a good hash function "in general". I've considered CRC32 (but where to find good implementation?) and a few cryptography algorithms. My table, though, has very specific requirements. Here's what the table will be like: 100,000 items max 200,000 capacity (so the load is 0.5) hashing a 6-character string which is a part of English sentence examples: "become" "and he" ", not " The number one priority of my hash table is quick search (retrieval). Quick insertion is not important, but it will come along with quick search. Deletion is not important, and re-hashing is not something I'll be looking into. To handle collisions, I'll be probably using separate chaining as described here . I have already looked at this article , but would like an opinion of those who have handled such task before.
