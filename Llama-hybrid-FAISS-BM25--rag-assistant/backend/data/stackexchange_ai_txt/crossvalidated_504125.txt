T-test and tree don't match logically

I would like some help in a machine learning homework. First I want to make clear that I don't think this is considered cheating as I am just asking for help in understanding a result, rather than asking for the code/answer. After all the professor told us himself that he encourages to seek outside help when needed. Regarding my question, I am using the DoctorVisits dataset from the AER package. Before making a tree I did some descriptive statistics on the data, including t-tests. After that I chose the column lchronic to make a tree . Thing is that the tree uses the variables illness and age , while the t-tests : t.test(illness~lchronic, data = DoctorVisits) t.test(age~lchronic, data = DoctorVisits) both resulted in the acceptance of the null hypotheses. Therefore, seeing as the means aren't different for these variables regardless of lchronic , shouldn't that mean that the tree can't have them as branches? Also, another minor thing, the branch freerepat seems to be doing nothing as it results to two 'No' nodes regardless of the value of freerepat .
