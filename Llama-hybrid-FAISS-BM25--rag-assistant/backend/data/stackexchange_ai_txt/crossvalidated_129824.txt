I'm using VAR to model retail employment in census blocks near transit stations. My vector is the time series of the 300+ census blocks within 1/2 mile of a transit station. I am attempting to find out if the total retail employment is significantly different after the advent of transit than before, and if the total employment is significantly different than it would have been without the addition of transit. So I'm using VAR to model my time series, using my VAR model to predict new data, and then comparing that new data to actual data during the years after the transit station opened.
