As Brent said, Azure Storage blobs are going to help, especially if you enable the Content Delivery Network, which has about 2 dozen nodes worldwide. Local directory caching won't work with just a local directory, as you'll have a separate cache directory for each instance. This is why many people have been using memcached for their multi-instance caching needs (David Aiken recently posted an article about setting this up in Azure). Brent hinted at Azure AppFabric Cache, which is currently in a 'preview' mode (you can try it out free, but it's not quite ready for production yet). This will easily allow you to cache data between your instances (even asp.net session state). How do you choose between Blobs and local cache??? Going with a caching solution such as memcached or AppFabric cache, you'll have more control over who accesses your content, as well as the ability to capture performance counters representing total bytes downloaded. Going with Blobs relieves your role instances of lots of work (networking, IIS processing and byte-converting, coding for cache, etc.) and even speeds up a user's browser experience (browsers typically default to only two concurrent connections to a particular address; blobs would technically be at a different URL). Further, you can use the content delivery network to boost performance on frequently-accessed images.
