In theory, a single integer "surrogate key" would be fastest. However I suspect that since the size of the concatenated field is a relatively small string, there won't be much difference between using the compound key and a concatenated field. It would probably begin to make a difference if the concatenated string was significantly larger. Another problem you might run into with large dimensions that have large string keys is the analysis services key store has a limit of 4gb. Check this whitepaper out, it has a lot of good information about optimizing the dimensional design and general perf tuning: http://sqlcat.com/whitepapers/archive/2009/02/15/the-analysis-services-2008-performance-guide.aspx This book has some of the best coverage on the analysis services storage engine and physical data structures: http://www.pearson.ch/1471/9780672330018/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Analysis.aspx Hope this helps
