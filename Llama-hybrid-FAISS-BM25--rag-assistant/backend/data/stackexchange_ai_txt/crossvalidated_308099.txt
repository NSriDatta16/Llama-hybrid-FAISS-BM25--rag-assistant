bayesian update of continuous beliefs

I know that the very similar question has been asked many times, but I hope that somebody can explain the mechanics in simple terms. Let's say there is a population of N=1000 people. A certain share p of them are honest, and 1-p are liars. This share is unknown to the individuals, but each individual has a prior belief about p . Let's say a specific individual i has p = 0.56 . At time t=1 he met a person, and with the probability equals p = 0.56 he decided to trust him. It turned to be that the person whom he met, was a liar. What will be his p_(t-1) if he updates his beliefs based on this one encounter? Again sorry for a naive question.
