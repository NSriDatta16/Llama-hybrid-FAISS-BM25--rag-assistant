F# Seq module implemented in C# for IEnumerable?

F# has a bunch of standard sequence operators I have come to know and love from my experience with Mathematica. F# is getting lots of my attention now, and when it is in general release, I intend to use it frequently. Right now, since F# isn't yet in general release, I can't really use it in production code. LINQ implements some of these operators using SQL-like names (e.g. 'select' is 'map', and 'where' is 'filter'), but I can find no implementation of 'fold', 'iter' or 'partition'. Has anyone seen any C# implementation of standard sequence operators? Is this something someone should write?
