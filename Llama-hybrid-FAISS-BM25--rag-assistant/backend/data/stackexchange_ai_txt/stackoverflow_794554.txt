This is a big question, and one could write an entire book in answer to it. Fortunately, someone already has. Grab yourself a copy of Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers. It's pretty much an entire book devoted to answering your question. It's a really good book, too. I'd definitely put it up there with Code Complete , Design Patterns , and Pragmatic Programmer on a list of books that should be in every developer's library.
