It's not an ideal solution but I'm currently just using a custom field called "thumbnail" and putting the location of an uploaded image in there. Then, when I display the post details somewhere I use the value from the custom field as the value. To upload the image in the first place I just use the normal image upload tool in the editor and copy the uploaded name into the custom field as I'm writing the post. Not very elegant but it works.
