Optimizing Magento-using Websites

Please be patient with my question, as this may be a bit longer. If you look at Magento and try to compare with any other non-PHP eCommerce Shopping Cart websites, you will find that the latter are comparatively faster. I know that the following factors work as well:- Hosting Server Bandwidth Magento offers lots & lots of features, which others does not (& will not be able to) provide with as much flexible as it offers now. Clients / Administrators can override the core behavior of the Magento functionality, using the custom module functionality, which will be a bit tough for other non-PHP websites. Still for non=PHP websites, programmers can use the concept of stored procedures very easily, with the help of which they can load the whole database in a view & then get disconnected from the database. So whenever any server request for next / previous page occurs, the server just accesses the view to fetch the proper results, instead of going for fetching from the database directly. Also from MySQL 5.0, it has introduced the Stored Procedure concept, but I don't know whether this is at all used in Magento. Even if it is used in Magento, whether will it be of any help for Magento, is another BIG question, because of the whole lot of features Magento provide. There are many clients, who like their websites to load very fast as compared to Magento sites. Can Magento offer any help in this regard? Please anybody having any idea about what & how to do will immensely help every Magento user, not just conceptually but also programmatically if possible? If anybody else have any other solutions or any other ideas, then please share those, like William .
