HTML jquery vs. doing it manually

i need to load images as the user selects. i am hoping to load them using DIV, but how to do it? jquery can do it and it is in javascript, i believe. so how can i write a function that manages div completion or is it too complicated? just looking for clarity at this stage. thanks. edit: well i have drop down listing and as user selects one option i need to load a bunch of images. i would like to cache the images and then show them. i can show you my site but that would be advertising.
