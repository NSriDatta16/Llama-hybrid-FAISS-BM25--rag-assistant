With VoidPointer's suggestion, it may be better to use NSValue for those times when enums turn out not to be integers (such as when -fshort-enums is in play, which should be never as you'd probably break compatibility with Foundation). NSValue *value = [NSValue value: &myEnum withObjCType: @encode(enum ETest)]; That's not going to add much here but gives you the general "I want to use in a collection class" technique. Notice that with modern compilers you can tell enums to use a fixed underlying type . This means you can control what storage is used for the enum, but as the above solution is general it still applies even when you know this.
