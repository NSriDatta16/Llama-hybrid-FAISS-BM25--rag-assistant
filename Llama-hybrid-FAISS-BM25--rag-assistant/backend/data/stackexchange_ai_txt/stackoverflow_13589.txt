ASP.net AJAX Drag/Drop?

I wonder if someone knows if there is a pre-made solution for this: I have a List on an ASP.net Website, and I want that the User is able to re-sort the list through Drag and Drop. Additionally, I would love to have a second list to which the user can drag items from the first list onto. So far, I found two solutions: The ReorderList from the Ajax Control Toolkit , which requires a bit of manual work to make sure changes are persisted into the database, and that does not support drag/drop between lists. The RadGrid from Telerik which does all I want, but is priced far far beyond my Budget. Does anyone else have some ideas or at least some keywords/pointers to do further investigation on? Espectially the Drag/Drop between two lists is something I am rather clueless about how to do that in ASP.net. Target Framework is 3.0 by the way.
