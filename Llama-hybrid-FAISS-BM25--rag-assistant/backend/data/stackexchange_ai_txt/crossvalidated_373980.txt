logistic regression what does this mean? Then a link function must be used to reverse the logarithm transformation, exponentiating the modeled value

Can you offer any assistance on clarifying the meaning of the following content - specifically the section on "Then a link function must be used to reverse the logarithm transformation, exponentiating the modeled value." This analysis is logistic regression and analyzed in SPSS. Also, how are beta coefficients best defined? The probability is modeled by taking the log of the odds ratio, Ln (p/1-p) = B0 + B1X1 The model results in estimated Beta coefficients B0 + B1X1. Then a link function must be used to reverse the logarithm transformation, exponentiating the modeled value. The result provides the model predicted probability of dropout (or transfer) and the change in model predicted probability if the person received counseling or PTSD diagnosis.
