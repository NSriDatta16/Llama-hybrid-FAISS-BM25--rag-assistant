You could use a relative small map and consider each node a cluster, but this is far from optimal. If you want to apply an automated cluster detection method you should definitely read Clustering of the Selfâˆ’Organizing Map and search similar bibliography. You could also use more sophisticated versions of SOM algorithm (multi leveled, self growing, etc). In any case, keep in mind that the problem of finding the "correct" number of clusters doesn't have a finite solution. Meta info: Basically I am copying my answer for a similar question in stack overflow. Probably not the proper way to do it, but how else?
