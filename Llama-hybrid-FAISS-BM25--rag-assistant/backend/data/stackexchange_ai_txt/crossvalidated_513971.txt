Say you have true labels TL : 1 0 0 1 0 Say you have 3 trees predicting T1 : 1 1 0 1 0 T2 : 1 0 1 1 1 T3 : 1 0 0 1 0 Bagging is computing the average from the upper tree threes. AV : 1 0 0 1 0 This reduces the overall variance, thus single trees may have bigger variance comparing to the true labels.
