In ordinary least squares linear regression, there is a closed-form solution for the parameter estimate: $\hat\beta_{ols}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ . Logistic regression lacks such a closed-form solution, so numerical methods are required to find the parameter vector that minimizes the loss function. The Current function value is the value of the loss function when you use the parameters found by your fit. The Iterations is the number of times a process in the numerical optimization had to be repeated in order to reach the solution. Terminating successfully means that the numerical optimization converged on a solution and is not still bouncing around, trying to find a solution.
