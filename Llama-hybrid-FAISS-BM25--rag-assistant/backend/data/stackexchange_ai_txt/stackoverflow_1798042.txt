You need to upcast to the return values to Object , then downcast to t . For example: Return CType(CType(CreateDistribution(ID), Object), t) The two casts are necessary because the compiler doesn't know that t is Distribution . Therefore, it cannot allow you to cast from Distribution to t (which, as far as the compiler is concerned, might be Integer ). However, once you upcast to Object , the second cast is fine, because Object can by definition be converted to t , no matter what type t is. Pre-emptive snarky comment: Yes, I'm aware that that isn't true for pointers.
