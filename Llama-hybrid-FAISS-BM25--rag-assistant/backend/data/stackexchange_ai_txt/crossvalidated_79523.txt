categorizing monthly gross income

what is the best way to categorize or even bin monthly gross income? As of now, the variable for income is numeric and continuous. I have seen many examples for annual income. Should I categorize variables into quartiles? The purpose would be to fit the transformed variable into a logistic regression. As of now, I do not feel comfortable with interpreting the continuous variable, as it seems strange to say for every dollar increase? Thanks!
