Adopting kon's approach to the filename munging, the speed improves from 320ms to 45ms on average. Thanks kon! for n in `cd src; find . -name "*.java"; cd -`; do if [[ src/$n -nt build/${n/.java/.class} ]]; then echo src/$n; fi; done The original is a bit slower now (was 275ms; now 320ms); I don't know why. I'm using the same line. Maybe different system sources after playing a video. EDIT re rst's comment: mangling the "src/" away instead of cd src; ... cd -; . Note that both $n and $n2 are used [you can't nest the ${var/A/B} construct, can you?] for n in `find src -name "*.java"`; do n2=${n/src/} if [[ $n -nt build/${n2/.java/.class} ]]; then echo $n; fi; done
