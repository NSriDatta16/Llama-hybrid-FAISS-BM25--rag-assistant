Perpelxity is a good measure of how predictable your text corpora are. For example, if the perplexity of you text is 80 then that means that predicting the next word in a sentence after reading the previous words is as hard as a multiple choice exam with 80 choices per question. Comparing perplexities across corpora works best when you use the same vocabulary everywhere. You can specify a vocabulary when you build the language models in SRILM. You might want to use the same vocabulary for all of the files.
