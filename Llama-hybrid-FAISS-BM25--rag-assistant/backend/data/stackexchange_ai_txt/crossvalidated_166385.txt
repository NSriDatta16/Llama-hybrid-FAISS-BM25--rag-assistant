I'll give you some examples, but try to find some more info about regression output interpretation. The reference category of the dummy variable IS NOT the intercept, but the information of the reference category is included in the intercept (maybe that's what you had in mind). So, given all the other variables in the model (that's always the case when interpreting) the difference between factor 2 and factor 1 (reference category) of the dummy variable is -0.30625 and that's statistically significant. So, when you compare cases that their only difference is factor 2 vs. factor 1, you expect on average that the one with factor 1 is 0.30625 higher. When you do anova and you include ONLY that variable and then you create a regression model with that variable + some other variables, it is not the same. Anova takes into account only this variable, but regression takes into account all variables together. If you include other variables or if you exclude some others maybe you won't get same results. Gender should probably be coded as a dummy variable as well, with factor 1 = Male and factor 2 = Female. Because the interpretation here is that when gender increases by 1 unit then the dependent variable decreases by 0.018 (which sounds wrong). The best way to find if you need to include interaction is to include them and check what happens to your predictive accuracy and what are the p values you obtain. Keep in mind that there are so many interactions you can include here. Try to simulate some simple data, run a regression model and check results. Try to use 2 dummy variables, try to include interactions, remove some variables and check how p values change.
