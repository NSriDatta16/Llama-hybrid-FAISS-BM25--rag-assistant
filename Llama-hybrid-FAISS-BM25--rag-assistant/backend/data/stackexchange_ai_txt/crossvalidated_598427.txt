What is the meaning of confidence intervals in the context of autocorrelation?

My understanding about confidence intervals is like this below. There are 50 students and check their height. The average height is 174cm, and the 95% confidence interval is [166cm, 182cm] However, the confidence intervals of autocorrelation plots look different. In the figure below, the blue background means confidence intervals. Questions For example, at lag=10, the autocorrelation is 0.65 and the confidence interval is -0.20 to 0.20. Can I say the 95% confidence interval at lag=10 is [0.45, 0.85]? If the absolute value of autocorrelation is larger than the absolute value of the corresponding confidence interval, then can I say the autocorrelation is not 0 at the 95% confidence? (This is exactly where the circles on the tips are outside the blue background, such as lag=1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12...) If we talk about correlation (of two variables), we may say "the correlation coefficient is 0.8, so these two variables are strongly correlated". Are there any standards to say the autocorrelation is large or small? Reference https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots.plot_acf.html
