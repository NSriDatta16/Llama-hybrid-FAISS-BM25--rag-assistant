vsTestHost.exe uses only one processor

I have a simple load test that is using one TestMethod on a quad core 64 bit windows 2008 box. When i run the load test, i only see one processor being used to 100%, other processors are just idle, and i know that the server is not being hit to the max, so my test agent is not able to produce enough load for it. is there any way to tell it to use multiple processors ?
