What is the best approach to take when you can't figure something out, and you have no one to ask?

The second part of that question is key. If you are one of a few programmers, and after banging your head on your keyboard for endless nights you can't figure something out, with no one else in your organization to ask, what do you do? Not having someone to ask has more to do with the fact that it would take too long to bring them up to speed to even have them assess the problem. Are these the instances where you have uncomfortable conversations with management and tell them a third-party contractor with more experience will be required?
