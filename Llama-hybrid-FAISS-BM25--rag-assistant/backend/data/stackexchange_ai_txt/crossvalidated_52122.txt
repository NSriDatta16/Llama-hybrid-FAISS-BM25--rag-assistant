Neural network for rainfall forecasting

I'm new to machine learning, and I have been trying to figure out how to apply neural network to rainfall forecasting. I have found resource related to my query, but I seem to still be a bit lost. I think a basic explanation without too much detail would help. Let's say I have 10 climate features values for each month over a few years, and I want to predict rainfall for new month. How I can apply neural network to this problem is what I am trying to find out. How can I give input in this because we have 10(features) * 12 months * 10 years.
