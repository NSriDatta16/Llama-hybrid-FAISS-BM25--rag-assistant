Python equivalent to C#'s using statement

Possible Duplicate: What is the equivalent of the C# “using” block in IronPython? I'm writing some IronPython using some disposable .NET objects, and wondering whether there is a nice "pythonic" way of doing this. Currently I have a bunch of finally statements (and I suppose there should be checks for None in each of them too - or will the variable not even exist if the constructor fails?) def Save(self): filename = "record.txt" data = "{0}:{1}".format(self.Level,self.Name) isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication() try: isfs = IsolatedStorageFileStream(filename, FileMode.Create, isf) try: sw = StreamWriter(isfs) try: sw.Write(data) finally: sw.Dispose() finally: isfs.Dispose() finally: isf.Dispose()
