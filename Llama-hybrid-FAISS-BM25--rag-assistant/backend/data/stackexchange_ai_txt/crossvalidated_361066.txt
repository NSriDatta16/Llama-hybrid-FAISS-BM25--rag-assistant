What is the point of having a dense layer in a neural network with no activation function?

I am surprised by the default setting in keras : keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=None, ...) Why do we have the option of only using a dense layer (which is matrix multiplication) but without an activation function (non-linear transformation)? I think these two should always go together in a neural network. Is there another case where we can use a dense layer without an activation function?
