Full HTTP Request from cURL in PHP

I'm trying to upload an image to a site via their API by trying to mimic a web form and posting the data using cURL. I'm looking to check what cURL is actually sending to the destination site, to ensure I've built the request correctly. I see you can use CURLOPT_VERBOSE to see what it's sending in the request header, but I'm looking to see the posted data, after Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------91f22eea64e8 The data I'm posting is in $post and the request is $ch = curl_init(); $opts = array( CURLOPT_POST => 1, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT => 10, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 60, CURLOPT_USERAGENT => 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)', CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $post, CURLOPT_URL => 'https://example.com/api', CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array('Expect:'), CURLOPT_VERBOSE => 1 ); curl_setopt_array($ch, $opts); $response = curl_exec($ch); Thanks
