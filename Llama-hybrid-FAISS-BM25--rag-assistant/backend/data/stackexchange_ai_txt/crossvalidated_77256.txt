Inference on bootstrapped-confidence interval resulting in multimodal distribution

I have a set of paired data that I am using to calculate a ratio. The ratio is calculated as the sum of column 2 over the sum of column 1 (please see below) Col1 Col2 3744519.37 0 2739505.37 0 46378122.62 0 2887639.57 78652.84 6000000 0 971112.48 0 7815969.01 0 11920577.36 0 2060120.66 0 4951863.34 0 8559269.86 0 4246529.62 0 54250000 0 17893683.49 0 1777305.52 0 1800832.37 0 2838034.29 0 15291266.83 0 3096538.88 0 2088767.28 0 5981199.57 0 2141878.34 0 1684058.06 0 2694327.27 0 7736276.87 0 3356067.88 0 1819461.59 0 972348.2 0 6922365 0 3357005.59 0 14870965.09 0 21500000 0 22419135 0 10000000 0 9250007.22 0 8900000 0 10404742.45 0 20452123.18 0 6340460.82 0 30494423.14 0 1157659.68 0 2868406.71 0 94257879.71 0 10369155.12 0 4315000 0 6158880 0 20057539.59 0 1335834.38 0 2406177.51 0 905846.54 405847 What I want to do is obtain a confidence interval from this point estimate to determine what the range of the population's ratio is. I took the approach of doing a bootstrap in R (see below) iterations = 10000 PCarray = c() for (i in 1:iterations){ rows=sample(1:length(data$Col1), length(data$Col1), replace = TRUE) numerator = 0 denominator = 0 ratio = 0 for (j in 1:length(rows)){ numerator = numerator + data$Col2[rows[j]] denominator = denominator + data$Col1[rows[j]] } ratio = numerator / denominator PCarray = c(PCarray,ratio) } hist(PCarray,breaks=200) Which ultimately gives me this graph: As before, I want calculate a confidence interval. Is it alright just to do the percentile method to get a confidence interval (i.e. the upperbound is the 95th quantile and the lowerbound is the 5th quantile for a 90% CI)? I realise the driver in the results is that only 2 values are non-zero, but is this an acceptable approach? Is there any literature on this that states a confidence interval can be drawn from a non-symmetric, multimodal distribution?
