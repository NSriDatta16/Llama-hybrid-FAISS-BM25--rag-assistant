An alternative approach which is probably not as advanced yet for this is some combination of a deep learning system with and modification of output to provide a 'similarity likelyhood.' This paper Code2vec , and this one have a neural network training on code to encode it as a vector in a scalable way in order to predict its properties, and then perform some task depending on the paper. It could be conceivable that if you have 'labeled' code that fits the criteria that you want to train on, that a NN could be something to look into (atleast from a distance). The Code2vec intro seems to fit the problem for more complex examples, in terms of being able to predict outputs and compare code in a way that is similar to language (as there are plenty of NN architectures which do that in terms of summarization and sentiment analysis).
