Edit Oh, I misunderstood your question apparently. Here is how to loop throught the text nodes of some element: function npup(parent) { var children = parent.childNodes, child; for (var idx=0, len=children.length; idx I wrote this in plain javascript since your code example was plain js. The selector engines of Libraries like Prototype and jQuery for convenience usually ignores the text nodes on retrieval so one doesn't have to bother with them. OR get to them, depending on how you lok at it.
