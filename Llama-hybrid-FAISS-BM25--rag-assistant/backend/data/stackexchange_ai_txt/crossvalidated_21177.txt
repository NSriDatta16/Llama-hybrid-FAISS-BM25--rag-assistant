Testing a model

So I hear the term 'testing a model' used a lot. There seems to be a variety of ways to find whether a model has explanatory power (R^2) or if there is an overall significant relationship between the variables (g-test). However, let's say I have data which I acquire each day. Let's say I ran a logistic regression on the past three days of day. Now, I want to know if that model has any explanatory power in explaining data from the newest day. So does this model still hold up if I look at just the newest day of data? I'm just wondering if there's a better way to test a model this way than by simply running that same model on the new dataset?
