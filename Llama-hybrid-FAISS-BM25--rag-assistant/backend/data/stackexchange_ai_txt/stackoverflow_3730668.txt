There are many ways to make that shorter but it all depends on what you're doing in your script. I'm not shocked by that operation taking 3 lines of code but anyway, here are a few ideas that can make your code shorter, sometimes at the price of decreased readability: Use empty() $content = (!empty($content)) ? (string) $content[0] : false; Echo the node directly: (it automatically gets cast as a string) echo (!empty($content)) ? $content[0] : ''; Use array_shift() to get the first element of an array. (attention, it does modify the array. If it was the last element, you could use end() instead) echo array_shift($propXml->xpath('//content/section[@name="accommodations"]/content'));
