Which test to use for non-normal paired data, with different sample sizes?

I posted a similar question yesterday, but was brought to my attention that I may need to consider the variance of my samples. I swabbed 9 rooms (3 cold/6 hot) for bacteria. The bacteria was counted on each swab, and then a week later after a chemical cleaning, I did the same thing. However, the # of times I swabbed (sample size) changes each time. I understand this is not a perfect experiment set-up, but re-doing the experiment is not an option currently. I have outlined the average bacteria count, along with SD of each test. I have noticed that cold rooms seem to see less difference than warm rooms. This was what I expected to see, I just need a statistical method to back up my findings. Any help is appreciated, and sorry if this question is trivial - I don't have a statistics background.
