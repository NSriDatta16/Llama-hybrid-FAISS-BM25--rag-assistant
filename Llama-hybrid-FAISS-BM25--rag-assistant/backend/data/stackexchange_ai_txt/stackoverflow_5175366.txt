Zoom Control which is part of WPF Extensions available on Codeplex

The zoom control found at http://wpfextensions.codeplex.com/ is something that I would like to use in my project. However, there is one feature I wish it had. I would like for it to work with a ScrollViewer so that if the contents are zoomed in, the scrollbars would activate (if necessary). The control's template is defined in Generic.xaml: CTRL + Wheel: Zoom In / Out ALT + Drag: ZoomBox (SHIFT +) Drag: Pan I tried adding ScrollViewer tags around the PART_Presenter but that caused the control to break (nothing was rendered). Hopefully someone smarter than I am can help me out with this. The control is not that complex but I am still learning WPF and especially templating. Thanks a lot.
