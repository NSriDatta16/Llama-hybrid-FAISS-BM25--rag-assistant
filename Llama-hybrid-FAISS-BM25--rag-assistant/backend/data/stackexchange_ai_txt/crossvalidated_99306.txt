The notion of Euclidean distance, which works well in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional worlds studied by Euclid, has some properties in higher dimensions that are contrary to our (maybe just my ) geometric intuition which is also an extrapolation from two and three dimensions. Consider a $4\times 4$ square with vertices at $(\pm 2, \pm 2)$ . Draw four unit-radius circles centered at $(\pm 1, \pm 1)$ . These "fill" the square, with each circle touching the sides of the square at two points, and each circle touching its two neighbors. For example, the circle centered at $(1,1)$ touches the sides of the square at $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ , and its neighboring circles at $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ . Next, draw a small circle centered at the origin that touches all four circles. Since the line segment whose endpoints are the centers of two osculating circles passes through the point of osculation, it is easily verified that the small circle has radius $r_{2} = \sqrt{2}-1$ and that it touches touches the four larger circles at $(\pm r_2/\sqrt{2}, \pm r_2/\sqrt{2})$ . Note that the small circle is "completely surrounded" by the four larger circles and thus is also completely inside the square. Note also that the point $(r_2,0)$ lies on the small circle. Notice also that from the origin, one cannot "see" the point $(2,0)$ on the edge of the square because the line of sight passes through the point of osculation $(1,0)$ of the two circles centered at $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$ . Ditto for the lines of sight to the other points where the axes pass through the edges of the square. Next, consider a $4\times 4 \times 4$ cube with vertices at $(\pm 2, \pm 2, \pm 2)$ . We fill it with $8$ osculating unit-radius spheres centered at $(\pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1)$ , and then put a smaller osculating sphere centered at the origin. Note that the small sphere has radius $r_3 = \sqrt{3}-1 and the point $(r_3,0,0)$ lies on the surface of the small sphere. But notice also that in three dimensions, one can "see" the point $(2,0,0)$ from the origin; there are no bigger bigger spheres blocking the view as happens in two dimensions. These clear lines of sight from the origin to the points where the axes pass through the surface of the cube occur in all larger dimensions as well. Generalizing, we can consider a $n$ -dimensional hypercube of side $4$ and fill it with $2^n$ osculating unit-radius hyperspheres centered at $(\pm 1, \pm 1, \ldots, \pm 1)$ and then put a "smaller" osculating sphere of radius $$r_n = \sqrt{n}-1\tag{1}$$ at the origin. The point $(r_n,0,0, \ldots, 0)$ lies on this "smaller" sphere. But, notice from $(1)$ that when $n = 4$ , $r_n = 1$ and so the "smaller" sphere has unit radius and thus really does not deserve the soubriquet of "smaller" for $n\geq 4$ . Indeed, it would be better if we called it the "larger sphere" or just "central sphere". As noted in the last paragraph, there is a clear line of sight from the origin to the points where the axes pass through the surface of the hypercube. Worse yet, when $n > 9$ , we have from $(1)$ that $r_n >2$ , and thus the point $(r_n, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$ on the central sphere lies outside the hypercube of side $4$ even though it is "completely surrounded" by the unit-radius hyperspheres that "fill" the hypercube (in the sense of packing it). The central sphere "bulges" outside the hypercube in high-dimensional space. I find this very counter-intuitive because my mental translations of the notion of Euclidean distance to higher dimensions, using the geometric intuition that I have developed from the 2-space and 3-space that I am familiar with, do not describe the reality of high-dimensional space. My answer to the OP's question "Besides, what is 'high dimensions'?" is $n \geq 9$ .
