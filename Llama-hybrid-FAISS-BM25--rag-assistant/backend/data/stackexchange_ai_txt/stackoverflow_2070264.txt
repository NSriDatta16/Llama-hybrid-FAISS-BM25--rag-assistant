You must draw the 'reversable' frame in the same position as previously to reverse it, before drawing the next frame in the new position. The pseudo-code is: bool prev_rev_frame = false; Rect prev_rev_rect; ... void on_mouse_move() { if(prev_rev_frame) Control.drawReversableFrame(prev_rev_rect); Rect new_rev_rect = .... Control.drawReversableFrame(new_rev_rect); prev_rev_frame = true; prev_rev_rect = new_rev_rect; } But in general, I recommend changing the mouse cursor to a drag-drop icon or a thumbnail of the image would be far more appropriate.
