Variance along the regression line

I have two random variables $X$ and $Y$ of unknown distribution which I sample $n$ times to get a set of $n$ random points. I do simple linear regression on this set and arrive at an equation for a fitted line defined in terms of the covariance of $X$ and $Y$, variance of $X$ and the sample-average of $X$ and $Y$. See first image. I am now interested in the distribution of $X$ and $Y$ relative to the fitted line. In particular I am interested in something like the variance along the fitted line. With this I mean something like taking the data set and rotating it (around an arbitrary point) so that the regression line now is parallel to the x axis. See second image. I then imagine projecting the data points down to the x axis and doing a simple variance measure on this data. I have derived formulas for this process but they do not look very convincing. Therefore I am wondering if there is some standard way of achieving this or something like what I have described. I have used the covariance measure, but it does not seem to have the isotropic property I require.
