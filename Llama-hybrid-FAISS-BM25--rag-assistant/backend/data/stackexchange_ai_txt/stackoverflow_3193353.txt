I guess that you already use this approach to show the HTML content in your TWebBrowser. Now, instead of JavaScript ( as suggested by Robert ), you use CSS in the generated HTML document. I haven't tested this, but you should be able to rotate the image (and other HTML-elements) by using this CSS code (for IE-based browsers): filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3); See details at MSDN
