What to use Multi-level Classification for Machine Learning predicting target Y1 and Y2

I have the data set where different signals are there. where it may be single or double or in groups so there are two outcomes where one outcome is dependent on the other. df = pd.DataFrame() df['signal']= ['P03' , 'U01 U30', 'P03 P02 P04', 'P04 P03', 'P03', 'U007', 'T0U', 'K050 A078', 'T0V','T0X T0U T0V'] df['MR'] = ['Bat','ECG','Bat','Bat','O2','Circuit','Cylin','Cylin2','EGR','Pad'] df['DC'] = ['Op or Kp','Mett','Op or Kp','Val','Crack','Op or Kp', 'Wire','Val','Op or Kp','Op or Kp'] Let's consider for machine learning model I have x input is signal and there are two outputs MR and DC .. I want to predict the DC but it is directly dependent on MR . Op or Kp is related to any signals but want to predict for where signals is matching with MR ... Let see If i take a Input as P03 then It should predict Op or Kp , Val , Crack , - First come 'Op or Kp' coz it comes two times where P03 is present. and then rest two. but with respect MR where it is showing bat and O2 . So I want to predict the DC (y1) and MR (y2) .. where y1 is dependent on y2 . Which algorithms should we consider or what should I search? In Traditional machine learning there should be only one Y output but there are two and one is dependent on second one. Not getting idea How can I do it? If someone can imporve this question will really helps and thank you in advance.. addition of this question link may help you to clear more. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73265598/how-to-train-machine-learning-algorithm-with-two-target-y1-and-y2 Expected output
