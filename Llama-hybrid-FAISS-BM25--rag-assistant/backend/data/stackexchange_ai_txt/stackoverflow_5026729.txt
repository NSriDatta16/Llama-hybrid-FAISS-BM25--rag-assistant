How to manually install files in c:\windows\assembly?

I had been facing the problem which i could say faced by quite a number of people out there. I'm interested with one of the answers given for this problem; quoting from https://stackoverflow.com/a/561530/3195477 : So it turns out that the .NET files were copied to c:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies, however, they were never registered in the GAC. I ended up manually dragging the files in c:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies to c:\windows\assembly and the application worked on that problem machine. you could also do this programmatically with gacutil. So it seems that something happened to .NET during the install, but this seems to correct the problem. i tried to drag and even copy & paste the files in c:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies\ to c:\windows\assembly but I couldn't maybe the system din allow that. How would I possibly transfer the files then?
