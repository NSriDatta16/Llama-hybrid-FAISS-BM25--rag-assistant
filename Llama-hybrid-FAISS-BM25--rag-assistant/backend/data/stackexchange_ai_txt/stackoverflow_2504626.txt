Silverlight tests not working unless RDP connection open

I have a few Silverlight UI tests that I'm automating with White. These tests are subsequently run by a TFS build agent, which is running interactively so it can access the desktop. The build passes if I have a Remote Desktop connection open to the build agent as the tests are run; I can see the mouse pointer moving around. When the test clicks on a HyperlinkButton navigation takes place, and is subsequently verified by assertions within the test. The build fails if I do not have a Remote Desktop connection open to the build agent as the tests are run. The Internet Explorer window is created and the Silverlight app loads, but no clicks happen; the application remains on the initial page and test assertions subsequently fail. Has anyone out there found a solution to this problem?
