Percentiling is meaningless in this context. That involves incomplete conditioning, e.g., computing things like P(Y=1 | X > c) instead of P(Y=1 | X = c), the latter being proper complete conditioning, i.e., full use of information. The task instead is to estimate P(Y=1 | X=c) as a function of height c. This is readily accomplished by fitting a binary logistic regression model with height X represented by a regression spline so as to relax the linearity assumption. See for example the RMS course notes .
