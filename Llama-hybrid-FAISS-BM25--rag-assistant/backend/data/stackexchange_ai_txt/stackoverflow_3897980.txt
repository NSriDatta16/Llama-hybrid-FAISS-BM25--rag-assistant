Several things you should check in your project: Check the Problems tab in your Eclipse IDE. Are you sure that you did not introduced building problems while making changes with drawables? To check that you need to check xml source of affected layout and see if something is marked red. In File explorer go to the directory where your Android project is. Check that you have file default.properties (.classpath, .project and AndroidManifest.xml should be there). If default.properties is missing it may be easily replaced by correct version. Which is the Android version you are working with? If that is 1.5 or lower be sure that in the res directory you have directory named drawable , not drawable-hdpi , drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi . Last three are valid for version 1.6 and higher. Right click on your project in Package explorer in Eclipse. You will get a number of options. Go to Android Tools-> Fix Project Properties so see if that helps.
