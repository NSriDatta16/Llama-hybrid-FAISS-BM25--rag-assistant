The target account's mail server can reject your mail with different reasons. You have to check your mail transfer agent logs. Or just check the mail queue (ex.: exim -bp). If the undelivered message is in queue, the target server is not accessible or rejected the message. Check Return-Path e-mail (someone@mydomain.com) for error reports about undelivered messages. If you will send messages from not MX-server of domain, you should read about SPF. At the end try to send messages using SSH from your server: $ mail -a "From:someone@mydomain.com" -s Test linto@test.com -- -fsomeone@mydomain.com Test Cc: If the message still not delivered, the problem is not in mail() or PHP.
