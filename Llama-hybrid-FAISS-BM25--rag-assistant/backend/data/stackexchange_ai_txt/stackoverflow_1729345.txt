Logging all Soap request and responses in PHP

Does anyone know how to log all request and responses with the builtin SoapClient in PHP? I could in fact manually log everything with SoapClient::__getLastRequest() and SoapClient::__getLastResponse() But we have that much soap requests in our system that i'm looking other possibilities. Note: i'm using wsdl mode so using a method that tunnels all through to SoapClient::__soapCall() isn't an option
