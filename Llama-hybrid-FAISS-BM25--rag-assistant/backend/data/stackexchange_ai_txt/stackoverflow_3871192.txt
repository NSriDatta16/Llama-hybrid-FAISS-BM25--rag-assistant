As Sabeen said, if you are using cookie based session tracking (which is what PHP uses by default, if the user agent supports cookie) the session will be picked up automatically. You might run into trouble if the pages loaded in the Iframe are from different subdomains. In that case, you have to use the session.cookie_domain configuration variable. ini_set("session.cookie_domain", ".domain.com");
