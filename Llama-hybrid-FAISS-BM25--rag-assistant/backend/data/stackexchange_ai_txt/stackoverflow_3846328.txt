White labeling CakePHP: What's the best way to provide customization hooks/callbacks to implementers?

I'm developing a CakePHP application that we will provide as a white label for people to implement for their own companies, and they'll need to have certain customization capabilities for themselves. For starters, they'll be able to do anything they want with the views, and they can add their own Controllers/Models if they need to add completely new stuff. However, I'd rather advise against touching my controllers and models, to make version upgrading easier. Esentially, the customization capabilities I'm planning to give them are going to be quite basic, I just need to call "something" when certain things happen, so they can do things like update external systems, e-mail themselves/the clients, things like that. I'm wondering what's the best way to do this? My plan is to have a "file" (with one class) for each controller of mine, to keep things reasonably organized. This file will have a bunch of empty methods that my code will call, and they'll be able to add code inside those methods to do whatever they need to do. The specific question is, should this class full of empty methods be a Component? A Controller? Just a regular plain PHP class? I'll need to call methods in this class from my Controllers, so I'm guessing making it a Controller is out of the question (unless maybe it's a controller that inherits from mine? or mine inherits from theirs, probably). Also, I'd need the implementer of these methods to have access to my Models and Components, although I'm ok with making them use App::Import, I don't need to have the magic $this->ModelName members set. Also, does this file I create (etiher Component or Controller) have to live in the app folder next to the other ( my ) controllers/components? Or can I throw it somewhere separate like the vendors folder? Have you done something like this before? Any tips/advice/pitfalls to avoid will be more than welcome. I know this is kind of subjective, I'm looking to hear from your experience mostly, if you've done this before. Thanks!
