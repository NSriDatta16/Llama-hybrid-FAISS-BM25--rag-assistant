In case somebody still needs an answer, newer versions of Matlab has an internal function findchangepts for changepoint detection. But if anybody needs a Bayesian alternative, one possible tool in Matlab is the BEAST method my team developed, which is available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72515-bayesian-changepoint-detection-time-series-decomposition . Unlike classical algorithms such as findchangepts , BEAST tells not just when the changepoints occur but also quantifies the probability of changepoint occurrence. See below for a quick illustration. It can be installed by running eval( webread( 'http://b.link/rbeast', weboptions('cert','') ) ); Then, here is a quick test: load('Nile.mat') % annual streamflow of the Nile River startin from year 1871 out = beast(Nile, 'season', 'none','start', 1871) % trend-only data without seasonality printbeast(out) plotbeast(out) Given below is the plotting of the example. There is one significant changepoint (vertical line) attributed to the dam construction in the Nile River. The second subplot Pr(tcp) gives the changepoint occurrence probability over time where the peak corresponds to the changepoint. More details about the toolbox are also available at https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast .
