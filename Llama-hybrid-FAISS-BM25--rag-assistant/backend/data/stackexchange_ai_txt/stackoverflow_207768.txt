How to fill a vector with non-trivial initial values?

I know how to fill an std::vector with non-trivial initial values, e.g. sequence numbers: void IndexArray( unsigned int length, std::vector & v ) { v.resize(length); for ( unsigned int i = 0; i But this is a for-loop. Is there an elegant way to do this with less lines of code using stl functionality (and not using Boost)?
