I think this problem is more related to game theory(math/econ). Anyway, you have to figure out the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium to see how this game plays out. Assume that both players are risk-neutral, i.e. they only care about the expected win. Let $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$ be the strategies of $A$ and $B$. From the structure of the game, the strategies are functions of each card values. The Bayesian Nash Equilibrium $(\sigma_A^*,\sigma_B^*)$ is defined as $$\sigma_A^* = \arg\max_{\sigma_A} E_{X_B}[\pi_A(\sigma_A,\sigma_B^*)]$$ $$\sigma_B^* = \arg\max_{\sigma_B} E_{X_A}[\pi_B(\sigma_A^*,\sigma_B)]$$ where $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ are payoff function given opponents' type and strategy. In equilibrium, nobody has incentive to deviate from their strategies given that their opponents play the equilibrium strategy. First, note that strategies can be characterized by a simple function that maps $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ where the range is the probability of choosing Raise($R$) for $A$ and the probability of choosing Call($C$) for $B$ given that $A$ raised. Note that $B$ has nothing to decide given $A$ called. So let's simply notate them by $P_A(x_A)$ and $P_B(x_B)$. (That's right. We are considering not just pure strategies, but also mixed strategies.) Second, let's work out through $B$'s problem given $P_A(x_A)$. Given $x_B$ and that $A$ raised, $B$ maximizes $$E_{X_A}[\pi_B(P_A(x_A),P_B(x_B))]=P_B(x_B)(2P[x_A x_B|A\ raised])-(1-P_B(x_B))$$with respect to $P_B(x_B)$. By definition of $P_A$, $$P[A\ raise|x_A 0$ and $0$ otherwise. Since the expression is monotone increasing in $x_B$, we know that the strategy must be characterized by a threshold $t_B$, where $B$ calls if $x_B>t_B$ and folds otherwise. Given this, let's work on $A$'s problem which becomes a lot simpler with the threshold characterization of $B$'s strategy. Given $x_A$, $A$'s problem is to maximize $$E_{X_B}[\pi_A(P_A(x_A),t_B)] = P_A(x_A)(2P[x_B t_B]-2P[x_B>x_A,x_B>t_B]+P[x_B t_B]=\max(x_A-t_B,0)$ and $P[x_B>x_A,x_B>t_B] = 1-\max(x_A,t_B)$. So we have $$E_{X_B}[\pi_A(P_A(x_A),t_B)] = P_A(x_A)[4\max(x_A,t_B)-2t_B-2+t_B-2x_A+1]+(2x_A-1)$$ We have two cases to consider. First $x_A>t_B$. We have $P_A(x_A)=1$ if $x_A>\frac{t_B+1}{2}$. Second, $x_A Now let's get back to $B$'s problem of setting his $t_B$. We know that $$3\int_0^{t_B}P_A(t)dt=\int_{t_B}^1 P_A(t)dt$$ must hold. Plugging in the above result, we have $$3\frac{3t_B-1}{2}=(1-\frac{2t_B+1}{2})$$ and we finally get $t^*_B=\frac{2}{5}$. So we conclude that in the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, $B$'s strategy is Call if $x_B>\frac{2}{5}$ and fold otherwise given that $A$ raised. And $A$'s strategy is Raise if $x_A \frac{7}{10}$, and Call otherwise. Expected values of each player can be easily calculated by drawing partitions on $X_A-X_B$ plane by each player's strategy. You can simply multiply the area and payoffs to get the expected values for each player. My calculation shows that the value is $\frac{1}{10}$ for player $A$ and $-\frac{1}{10}$ for $B$ as the game is zero-sum. Payoff at A = (-2,2), B = (-1,1), C = (1,-1), D = (2,-2). Area of A = $\frac{21}{200}$, B = $\frac{36}{100}$, C = $\frac{40}{100}$, D = $\frac{27}{200}$. Intuitively, $A$ gets some advantage with the right to choose whether to raise or call. However, the game will be played much differently if $B$ is able to raise upon $A$'s call.
