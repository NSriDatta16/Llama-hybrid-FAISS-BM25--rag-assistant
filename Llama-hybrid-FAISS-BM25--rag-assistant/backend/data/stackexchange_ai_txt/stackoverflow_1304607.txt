GWT DnD: Keep draggable within an AbsolutePanel

I made a MultiSlider widget using the GWT and the gwt-dnd addon to rate texts. On the screenshot, you can see the slider button with value 50 dragged outside the slider bar. It can't be dropped outside the bar, but it can be dragged outside of it. alt text http://lt3.hogent.be/hendi_docs/stackoverflow/gwt-dnd-multislider.png Is there a way in GWT to always keep the slider buttons inside the slider bar? EDIT: The slider bar is an AbsolutePanel, and it is also the only droptarget for the slider buttons. The slider bar panel is also the boundary panel for the drop controller. Dropping outside of the bar panel is not possible, but dragging is. Now what I really like to know is if it's possible to keep the mouse pointer on the bar panel. If a button is dragged out of it, it will remain on its old position when dropped (so that's OK). Is it possible to allow only vertical DRAGGING? Can the mouse position be set while dragging?
