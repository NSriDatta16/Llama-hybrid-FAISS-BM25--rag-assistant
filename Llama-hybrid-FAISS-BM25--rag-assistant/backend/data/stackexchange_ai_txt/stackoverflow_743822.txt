This is provided as a sample macro: Macros.Samples.VSEditor.FillCommentParagraph The first time you run it it'll ask you what fill width you want (i.e. 80). I bind this to Alt-Q since I'm an Emacs refugee. After that you just move into the comment you want to format, run the command, and it'll wrap your comments suitably. It ain't perfect, but it's pretty good.
