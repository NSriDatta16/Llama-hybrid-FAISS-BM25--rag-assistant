Confidence intervals. If you have a sample from (nearly normal) population A, you can make a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean $\mu_A$ of population A. The formula for the CI is $$\bar X \pm t_c\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}},$$ where $n, \bar X,$ and $S$ are, respectively the sample size, sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample, ane where $t_c$ cuts probability 0.025 from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Example: Let's use R statistical software to generate a normal sample of size $n = 20.$ Pretend these are your Sample A. set.seed(706) x = round(rnorm(20, 100, 15), 2); x [1] 89.87 90.01 93.57 92.70 122.69 89.29 73.04 [8] 138.78 112.08 123.58 79.63 105.90 128.22 109.33 [15] 77.97 90.30 99.72 120.50 100.40 94.39 Then we compute $\bar X = 101.60$ and $S = 18.02;$ also, $t_c = 2.093$ can be found from a printed table of t distributions (row 19) or from software. mean(x); sd(x); qt(.975, 19) [1] 101.5985 [1] 18.02439 [1] 2.093024 Then the 95% confidence interval for $\mu_A$ is $(93.16, 110.03).$ pm = c(-1,1); t.c = qt(.975, 19) mean(x) + pm*t.c*sd(x)/sqrt(20) [1] 93.16282 110.03418 In R, this CI is included in the t.test procedure, so it can also be found as follows: t.test(x)$conf.int [1] 93.16282 110.03418 attr(,"conf.level") # reminder that this is 95% CI [1] 0.95 Because I generated the sample x as a random sample from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 100, \sigma=15),$ it is no surprise that our CI contains $100.$ Over many such samples, the CI will include $100$ in 95% of the cases. Prediction intervals. However, the 95% CI made from a particular sample, will not necessarily contain a new observation from Population A. If we take five new observations from the same population, let's see what happens: Two of the five $(104.16$ and $106.44)$ happen to lie in the CI and the other three do not. set.seed(1234); round(rnorm(5, 100, 15), 2) [1] 81.89 104.16 116.27 64.81 106.44 By contrast, a 95% prediction interval (PI) should on average include 95% of such new observations. The 95% PI is of roughly the same form as the CI, but wider: $$\bar X \pm t_c\,S\sqrt{1 + \frac 1n}.$$ The quantity under the square-root sign allows for the variability of the original sample of size $n$ and also for the variability of the new observation. The 95% PI $(62.94, 104,26)$ can be computed as shown below. Notice that all five of our new observations from Population A happen to lie within this 95% PI. (Over the long run, about 95% of such new observations from Population A will lie in the PI.) mean(x) + pm*t.c*sd(x)*sqrt(1 + 1/20) [1] 62.94138 140.25562 So if you are want to check a few new observations from Sample B, from unknown population(s) might be consistent with Population A, you might use a 95% Pi for that purpose. If you knew more about Population B there might be better ways to discriminate whether observations in Sample B might have come from various sub-populations of Population B. [Perhaps google 'discriminant analysis'.] But just from what you say in your Question, I think using PI's might be useful.
