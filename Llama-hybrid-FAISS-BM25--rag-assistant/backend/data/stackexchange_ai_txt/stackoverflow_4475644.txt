Magento: How to move top links into nav block?

I am trying to figure out how to move the top links (My Account, Login, Checkout, etc) into the nav block that contains the list of category names. I'm using Magento 1.4.2. Here is a screenshot to show what i mean: http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/4043/11404620.jpg At the moment i believe the top links are in the links block. I'd like to achieve this by adding some xml to local.xml so that i can upgrade more easily in the future. So far i've only been able to remove the top.links with this: but i have no idea how to add them to the nav block. Hopefully once i know how to do this i will understand Magento better, the layout aspect of it has me confused. Thanks for your time.
