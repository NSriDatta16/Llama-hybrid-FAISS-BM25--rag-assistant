Maybe post a question about your pkt.matrix function by itself (seems like bad R code). That might be something that you can provide toy sample data for and give a simple description of. In fact, as near as I can tell, you'd be better off if that were a list. Do you really want it symmetric on every row? If packets are ragged then just make a list of packets. It's easier and will work faster. Isn't jam just a vector? If so then "sum(apply(jam, 2, sum) > 0)" is sort of nonsense. It should just be sum(jam).
