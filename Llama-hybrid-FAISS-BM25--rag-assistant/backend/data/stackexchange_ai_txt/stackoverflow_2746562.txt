Unfortunately, it appears as though the jQueryUI Autocomplete was made to not allow this on an array source. You can, however, hook the plugin's _initSource function to force a "starts with" regular expression token ( ^ ) on the search as below. I think this was probably overlooked because the majority of its usage was thought to be in the remote retrieval. Either way, not a pretty fix, but due to the regex stripping function, it's the only solution that came to mind. $.ui.autocomplete.prototype._initSource = function() { var array, url; if ( $.isArray(this.options.source) ) { array = this.options.source; this.source = function( request, response ) { // escape regex characters var matcher = new RegExp( "^"+$.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex(request.term), "i" ); response( $.grep( array, function(value) { return matcher.test( value.label || value.value || value ); }) ); }; } else if ( typeof this.options.source === "string" ) { url = this.options.source; this.source = function( request, response ) { $.getJSON( url, request, response ); }; } else { this.source = this.options.source; } }; $("#countries").autocomplete({ source: ["India","Indonesia","Argentina"], minLength: 2 });
