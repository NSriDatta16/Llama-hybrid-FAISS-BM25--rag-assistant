fastest way to sort the entries of a "smooth" 2D array

What is the fastest way to sort the values in a smooth 2D array? The input is a small filtered image: about 60 by 80 pixels single channel single or double precision float row major storage, sequential in memory values have mixed sign piecewise "smooth", with regions on the order of 10 pixels wide Output is a flat (about 4800 value) array of the sorted values, along with the indices that sort the original array.
