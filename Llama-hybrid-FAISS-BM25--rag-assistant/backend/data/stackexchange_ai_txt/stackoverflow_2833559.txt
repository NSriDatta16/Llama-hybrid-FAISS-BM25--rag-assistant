import data from a file and possibly reformat it Python excels at this. Be sure to read up on the csv module so you don't waste time inventing it yourself. For binary data, you may have to use the struct module. [If you wrote the C++ program that produces the binary data, consider rewriting that program to stop using binary data. Your life will be simpler in the long run. Disk storage is cheaper than your time; highly compressed binary formats are more cost than value.] Import the munged data into a database. Extract data from the database Perform calculations on the data and either insert or update tables in the database. Use the mysqldb module for MySQL. SQLite is built-in to Python. Often, you'll want to use Object-Relational mapping rather than write your own SQL. Look at sqlobject and sqlalchemy for this. Also, before doing too much of this, buy a good book on data warehousing. Your two "task groups" sound like you're starting down the data warehousing road. It's easy to get this all fouled up through poor database design. Learn what a "Star Schema" is before you do anything else.
