What caused change in percentile?

We report 95th percentile and 50th percentile of the time series data for every week. The data is time-series data in the following format date. sensor_id. sensor_location. hardware_version. sensor_value 2021-01-01. S1. L1. V1. 10. 2021-01-01. S2. L2. V2. 20. 2021-01-01. S3. L1. V1. 12. 2021-02-01. S1. L1. V3. 30. 2021-02-01. S2. L2. V3. 40. 2021-02-01. S3. L1. V2. 32. The problem we are facing is to understand what caused the change in percentile week over week. For example some weeks the p95 is very high and we would like to know what sensor or which location or which version caused the big jump in p95. Could you please help what's the best way to solve this problem?
