off the top of my head, here are a couple things you can try: 1) make 3 separate UIView objects in IB, but don't add them to the view heirarchy Assuming that you have a view controller where all three views are contained, you can, in IB, create the 3 views by dragging each view from the library to the window titled YourNib.nib or YourXib.xib. So don't drag the views into the view controller's main view. Now you can double click each one and edit them on their own, without having to try to select the different views because they're overlapped (because they aren't) in the connections tab, connect the view controller's view property to one of the views. this sets the default. now in your code, you can change which view is connected to: [myViewController setView:view2]; and reload the views. 2) make one really tall view (or really wide view) and change the y-position of the view w/ respect to the parent view's frame when you click a segmented view button so that it appears to user as if they're going to separate pages this makes it easy to animate and transition between "views". though will use more memory because you have all elements loaded even when they're not visible. but you were doing that anyway.
