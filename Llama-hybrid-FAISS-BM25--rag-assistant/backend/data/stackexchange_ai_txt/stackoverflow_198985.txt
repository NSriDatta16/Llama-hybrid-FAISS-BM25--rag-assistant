There are many things to consider. When you say access, do you want to prefix the tables with the other users name? You can use public synonyms so that you can hide the original owner, if that is an issue. And then grant privs on the synonym. You also want to plan ahead as best you can. Later, will you want Frank to be able to access Alice's schema as well? You don't want to have to regrant privileges on N number of tables. Using a database role would be a better solution. Grant the select to role "ALICE_TABLES" for example and when another user needs access, just grant them privilege to the role. This helps to organize the grants you make inside the DB.
