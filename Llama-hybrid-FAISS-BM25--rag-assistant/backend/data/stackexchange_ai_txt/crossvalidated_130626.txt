For the Pearson correlation coefficient, so long as the data are approximately normal, the asymptotic CI using the Fisher Z transformation will be quite accurate (more so than percentile or BCa bootstrap). By "accurate", I mean that the 95% confidence intervals cover the true parameter in approximately 95% of Monte Carlo samples. For non-normal distributions, the answer depends on the degree of non-normality and on the sample size. As the distribution becomes less normal and as the sample size increases, the bootstrap methods will provide better coverage than the Fisher Z method. Believe it or not, as the sample size increases, Fisher Z becomes more sensitive to violations of normality. For example, if both X & Y ~ Chi-squared(df=1) and rho=.5, the coverage rate of the 95% confidence interval for N=10 to 80 is: N FisherZ BS-perc BS-BCa 10 .8612 .9190 .9348 20 .8382 .9201 .9042 40 .8132 .9221 .8938 80 .7954 .9250 .8954 Notes: BS=bootstrap, perc=percentile, and numbers with decimals represent the probability of covering the true population rho. These estimates were achieved through 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario with the Ruscio & Kaczetow (2008) algorithm for generating non-normal correlated data.
