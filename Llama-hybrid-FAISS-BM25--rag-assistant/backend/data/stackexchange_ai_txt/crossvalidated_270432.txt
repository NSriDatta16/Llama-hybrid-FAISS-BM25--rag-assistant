I'd comment on @NeilG's answer if I had enough reputation, but alas... I disagree with you, Neil, on this. You say: ... the average activation of all of its inputs, which by the law of large numbers will be roughly normal. I'd argue against that, and say that the law of large number necessitates that all observations are independent of each other. This is very much not the case in something like neural nets. Even if each activation is normally distributed, if you observe one input value as being exceptionally high, it changes the probability of all the other inputs. Thus, the "observations", in this case, inputs, are not independent, and the law of large numbers does not apply. Unless I'm not understanding your answer.
