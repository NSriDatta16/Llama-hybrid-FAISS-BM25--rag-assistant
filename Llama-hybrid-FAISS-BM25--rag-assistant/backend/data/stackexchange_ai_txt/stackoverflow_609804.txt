Embedding Foxit PDF Reader into a webpage

I need to embed Foxit Reader (PDF reading software) into a web page. Does anybody know the correct classid and parameters to use in the following code: You must install Foxit Reader to view this document. Additionally if anyone has experience of enterprise deployment, silent installation, registry setting etc. These would also be welcomed. Thanks
