Problems creating ragged hierarchy with Analysis Services

I'm attempting to create a ragged hierarchy in SSAS 2005. The "Category Name" and "Sub-Category Name" levels should be hidden in the hierarchy if either of them is blank. Leaf nodes which always have a value must display even if these two levels are blank. An image of how the measure has been configured is as follows: Measure dimension http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9468/dimmeasuretrim.png I thought using HideMemberIf would fix this problem but it hasn't made any difference. Here is the Translations configuration: Dimension translations http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/3710/dimmeasuretranstrim.png According to MSDN, HideMemberIf with a NoName value hides the member when it is empty. Any ideas why this isn't working?
