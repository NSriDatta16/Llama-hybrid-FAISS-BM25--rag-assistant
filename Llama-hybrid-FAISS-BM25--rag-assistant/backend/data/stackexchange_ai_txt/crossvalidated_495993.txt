Cyclical time series classification with missing data

I have a time series binary classification problem. Each datapoint is an evenly-spaced, equal length time series , representing one full week of hourly measurements, where I expect to see strong daily patterns (think: human behaviour). For example, presence and magnitude of peaks on given weekdays should be strongly predictive of a class (but I expect some other, more subtle features to be predictive as well). I considered a few techniques that could work, like dynamic time warping, or bag of features. The main issue is that many samples (during both training and inference) have data gaps , sometimes of considerable size (e.g. full day of data missing). Discarding these samples is not an option. To use algorithms like kNN+DTW, I would need to impute the missing data, which would lead to incorrect results (e.g. simple interpolation may create fake plateaus, ARIMA may create fake peaks, etc.). My ideal solution would be to have a probability of belonging to each class, such that data gaps would add uncertainty, instead of invalidating the results (some sort of Bayesian algorithm?), but I'm interested in any useful suggestions. Question : What would be a recommended way of dealing with such problems? Is there any standard solution to this?
