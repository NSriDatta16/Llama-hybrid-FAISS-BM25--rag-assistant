How do I get SVG to render with transparency in web-kit?

I am having issues embedding SVG into a webpage. I have found the simplest method to just use an image tag. For example: Works in web-kit. I do not need to explicitly set the width and the browser will maintain the aspect ratio. Very nice! This doesn't work in Firefox though - it's not cross browser. So how about embedding as an object? This time I'm using svgz and the mime type has been added and voila! It works in both firefox and webkit. However, in webkit I need to explicitly state the width or we get some nasty containing element scrollbars. But what's worse is the background is no longer transparent. It's rendered with a white background. So one method works perfectly in webkit. The other works perfectly in mozilla. What can I do to get it working reliably in both? Interested in a demonstration of this? See my link for reference: http://sumocreations.com/demo/svg/new_dttg.html
