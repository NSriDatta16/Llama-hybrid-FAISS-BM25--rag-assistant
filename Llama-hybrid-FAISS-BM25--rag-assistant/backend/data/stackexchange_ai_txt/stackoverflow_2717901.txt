How to dynamically set control IDs inside a repeater template?

Here is a perplexing issue I have not seen a good answer to on StackOverflow, although there a couple stabs at it... I have a situation where I'd like to do this: All the other stuff The question... is how do I get the ID of my elements to be id1, id2, id3, etc., based on the ItemIndex they are bound to? So far the most... er..."elegant" solution I've come up with is to replace the with an asp:Literal and dump the ' text. But that just feels... so wrong. And no, I'm not using ASP.NET 4.0, which I've read will provide this functionality.
