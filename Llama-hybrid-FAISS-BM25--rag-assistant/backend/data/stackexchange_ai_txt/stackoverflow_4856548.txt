To go along with what the others have already added. You should take a look(if you haven't already) at Apple's ' View Controller Programming Guide '. It will provide some good insight into managing the views, and provide examples of the different methods for doing so(Pushing,Modal,etc). EDIT Since it sounds like you want to show one view at a time(no stack, no modal) then you should really look at a UITabBarController to help organize your View Controllers. This will allow you to switch from one to the other easily. Here is some detail on how to set one up, you will need to scroll down to the 'Tab Bar' section. Hope that helps!
