Look at the user-agent. It should be googlebot. A more reliable way is to do a reverse lookup of the IP adddress. It will tell you if it is a google bot or not. I'd use both methods. BUT NOTE: You will slow your site since you will be doing a reverse lookup for every visitor. http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=80553
