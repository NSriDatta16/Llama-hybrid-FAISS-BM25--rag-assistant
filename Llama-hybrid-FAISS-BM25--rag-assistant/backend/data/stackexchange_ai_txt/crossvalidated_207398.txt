Time Series Analysis vs Linear Regression for GDP data?

I am trying to build a simple econometrics model that uses urban population, total factor productivity among other things to predict future GDP of a country. First I approached the problem by using linear regression (using Python) on the data, there’s definitely a correlation between urban population & total productivity and the GDP of a country. Here’s the results of the model (Data for all predictors and the dependent variable is yearly & raw (no diff or log) and it’s for the US): What I am planning to do is to use time series analysis (ETS or ARIMA) to forecast the values in the factors, feed that in into the above linear model, then predict future GDP. Is this the right approach, or is vector autoregression more suitable for this? I understand there’s autocorrelation in GDP, but from what I have understood from this chapter in the Forecasting book, it seems like it’s not a very wrong approach to use linear regression on time series data.
