It is not possible to use ordinary least square method since the observations are not independent. This statement is false - it is possible to use Ordinary Least Squares providing that the residuals have been corrected for serial correlation , or correlation between the residuals over time. Serial correlation itself can be detected through use of the Durbin-Watson test. H0: No serial correlation present HA: Serial correlation present The Durbin Watson statistic is calculated as follows: Let us consider the following example. Suppose we wish to use an OLS regression to determine the relationship between oil prices and fluctuations in the S&P 500 stock market index. Initally, the following model is generated using R: SP500 Prices = Intercept + Oil Prices Call: lm(formula = gspc ~ oil) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -195.309 -46.802 6.726 45.612 139.918 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1768.1278 20.2744 87.21 However, this has not yet been tested (or corrected if necessary for serial correlation). > dwtest(reg1) Durbin-Watson test data: reg1 DW = 0.047108, p-value Next, we test the model for the presence of serial correlation using the Durbin-Watson test. With a p-value below 0.05 as shown, this is an indication that serial correlation is present in the model and needs to be remedied. To this end, the time series is differenced and the ACF and PACF plots are generated: ACF PACF Given a sudden drop in lags in the partial autocorrelation function, this indicates the presence of an AR(1) time series. In this regard, the Cochrane-Orcutt method is used to correct for the serial correlation. > orcuttreg1 Cochrane-orcutt estimation for first order autocorrelation Call: lm(formula = gspc ~ oil) number of interaction: 4 rho 0.977051 Durbin-Watson statistic (original): 0.04711 , p-value: 4.902e-107 (transformed): 2.08847 , p-value: 8.393e-01 coefficients: (Intercept) oil 1811.922439 5.737714 With a new p-value of 0.8393 , this indicates that the serial correlation has been eliminated. In summary, time series data can be modelled with OLS - providing that serial correlation has been corrected for.
