Edited because I had to leave a meeting when I originally submitted this, but wanted to complete the information Half of that material is learning about development in a Unix-like environment, and for that, I'd recommend a book since it's tougher to filter out useful information from the start. I'd urge you to go to a bookstore and browse through these books: Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens and Rago - this book covers threads, networking, IPC, signals, files, process management Unix Network Programming, Volume 1 by Stevens - This book is focused on network programming techniques, design - you might not need this until much later Unix/Linux System Administration - This book covers the more system administrator side of stuff, like directory structure of most Unix and Linux file systems (Linux distributions are more diverse than their Unix-named counterparts in how they might structure their file system) Other information accessible online: GCC Online Manual - the comprehensive GNU GCC documentation Beej's network programming guide - A really well written tutorial to network programming with the use of the BSD API. If you have done work with winsock , this should be mostly familiar to you. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5's Deployment Guide - talks specifically about Red Hat EL 5's basic administrative/deployment, like installing with package manager, a Red Hat system's directory structure... make - Wikipedia article that will have links to the various make documentation out there binutils - These are the Linux tools used for manipulating object/binaries. GNU Build System - Wikipedia article about the traditional build system of GNU software, using autoconf/automake/autogen Additionally, you will want to learn about ldd , which is like dependency walker in Windows. It lists a target binary's dependencies, if it has any. And for Debugging, check out this StackOverflow thread which talks about a well written GDB tutorial and also links to an IBM guide. Happy reading.
