Statistical significance will not tell you the magnitude of the effect in any way, and will consequently be uninformative if you use it as a metric of your coefficient effects. Even the word "effect" has to be chosen carefully here, as this is behavioral data and so you need to be a bit careful about the wording with relation to causality. As to actual responses to your question: So, the expected/predicted reading score, as a function of income given a particular school type, is two different lines with different intercepts and slopes. Your intercept, $\beta_0$ , will be the conditional mean of the reference group (if you had a treatment group and a control group, one of these is selected as a reference group to compare against). Your following coefficient $\beta_1$ will be adjustments to this conditional mean. So if the K-6 school's conditional mean is $90$ and K-8 school's slope is $2$ , then the conditional mean for K-8 school is equal to $92$ after controlling for all other predictors (I'm assuming you mean two distinct schools and not literally one school that has kindergarten kids, another with primary, and so on). A visualized example straight from Regression and Other Stories is shown below (though here I use a frequentist version rather than the Bayesian example they give for your purposes): #### Fit #### fit $mom_hs==1, "black", "gray") plot(kidiq$ mom_iq, kidiq$kid_score, xlab="Mother IQ score", ylab="Child test score", col=colors, pch=20) b_hat You can see that the association between mother IQ and student test scores are positive in general. However, the conditional mean (intercept) shifts by whether or not the mom graduated, and the magnitude of the relationship between each mother changes as well (the slope). Consequently, if you only have one continuous predictor and one categorical factor as main effects, along with their interaction, you should have 4 coefficients and their respective $p$ values, which match the number of $p$ values you have listed already: $\beta_0$ : Intercept (School 1) $\beta_1$ : School 2 $\beta_2$ : $X$ $\beta_3$ : School 2 $\times$ $X$ For comparison to our earlier regression, this can be easily shown by running the summary(fit) code above: Call: lm(formula = kid_score ~ mom_hs + mom_iq + mom_hs:mom_iq, data = kidiq) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -52.092 -11.332 2.066 11.663 43.880 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -11.4820 13.7580 -0.835 0.404422 mom_hs 51.2682 15.3376 3.343 0.000902 *** mom_iq 0.9689 0.1483 6.531 1.84e-10 *** mom_hs:mom_iq -0.4843 0.1622 -2.985 0.002994 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 17.97 on 430 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.2301, Adjusted R-squared: 0.2247 F-statistic: 42.84 on 3 and 430 DF, p-value: We can see everything noted in the plot reflects the point estimates shown here, however the regression isn't centered, so it is likely not super interpretable. Better to center the predictors in order to make it easier to read: #### Center Variable #### kidiq $iq_center mom_iq - mean(kidiq$mom_iq) #### Fit Again #### fit2 We now have something easier to interpret: Call: lm(formula = kid_score ~ mom_hs + iq_center + mom_hs:iq_center, data = kidiq) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -52.092 -11.332 2.066 11.663 43.880 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 85.4069 2.2182 38.502 The conditional mean test score is around $85$ for those who have mothers that did not graduate. We increase our mean by about $3$ if they have graduated. For the slope, we interpret as the average change in test score with each one unit increase in IQ. Our interaction estimate here adjusts the slope by the number given, shown by the different slopes for each line in the plot. Notice that the key here in the interaction is the slope change. If we simply fit the data like so with just the main effects: #### Fit Again #### fit3 $mom_hs==1, "black", "gray") plot(kidiq$ mom_iq, kidiq$kid_score, xlab="Mother IQ score", ylab="Child test score", col=colors, pch=20) b_hat We get our positive trends, but the magnitude does not change by group:
