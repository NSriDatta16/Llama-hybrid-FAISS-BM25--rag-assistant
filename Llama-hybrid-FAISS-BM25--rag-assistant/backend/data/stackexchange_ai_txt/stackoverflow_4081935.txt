Is it safe to assume that all bots' user agents always have URLs in the user agent strings? Nope. Check out this bot list , it has plenty of bots that don't sport a URL. Perhaps if I could reword my question better, is there any valid non-bot, non-crawler, non-spider or any non-filthy creature that has a URL in the user agent? I can't think of a browser that has a URL in the agent string, but this is definitely a dangerous assumption to work with. Remember that for example, Internet Explorer Add-Ons can add their signatures to the browser's user agent string. You can't guarantee there won't be a URL in it.
