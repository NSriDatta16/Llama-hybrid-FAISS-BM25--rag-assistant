Check /var/log/syslog for errors. DIAGNOSTICS cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline (ie, terminated by EOF), cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken. A warning will be written to syslog. Update: According to your log message, the script is running but returning an error code. Cron will email you the output, if you have a mail agent installed. Try either: install a mail agent, such as: apt-get install exim4 change your cron line to log to file, like so: * * * * * /usr/bin/rsm/samplesMonitor.py 2>&1 >> /tmp/script.log Update 2: I re-read your question and it acurred to me that maybe you are running into python import issues. You say that your script calls two other scripts. My suggestion would be to test running your script from / . Python has a default behavior to find imports in the current working directory, so make sure your script can run from any path location. In the crontab, you can set the starting working directory by calling your script from within another shell process. For example: bash -c "cd THE_WORKING_DIR;/usr/bin/rsm/samplesMonitor.py"
