Logistic regression on all data in order to analyze predictors

I have some experience working with classification, and in those instances we always use a training and a test set (and possibly validation sets). However, I'm currently facing a different problem. I want to test how well I can combine different predictors, and find the relative importance of each of them. I have a binary dependent variable and am therefore currently using logistic regression for this. My question is, is it weird to run logit on all the data, and then talk about the goodness of fit and coefficients? I've read some literature on the subject, and I think I'm simply having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that logit isn't (just) a classifier, but I just want to make sure that it makes sense to use it to investigate how my predictors behave on all of my data.
