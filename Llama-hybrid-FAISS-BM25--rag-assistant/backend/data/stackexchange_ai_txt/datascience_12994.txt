Only Domingos knows for sure, since he invented this taxonomy, but I'd guess it would fall under "connectionists" (which he associates with neural networks), since graphs are all about connections (between random variables). Bayesians would be my second choice. CRFs are not natively Bayesian (you don't use priors or posteriors of the model parameters), but they can be augmented into one .
