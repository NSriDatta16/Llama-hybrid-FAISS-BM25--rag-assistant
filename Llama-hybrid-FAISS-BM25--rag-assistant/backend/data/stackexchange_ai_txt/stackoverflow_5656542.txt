Running scripts in an ajax-loaded page fragment

My web app dynamically loads sections of its UI with jquery.ajax . The new UI sections come with script though. I'm loading them as such: Use... $.ajax({ url: url, dataType: 'html', success: function(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) { $(target_selector).html( data ); update_ui_after_load(); } }); This almost works. The problem is that the scripts included in the dynamic part of the page run before the new page fragment is inserted into the DOM. But often these scripts want to modify the HTML they're being delivered with. My best hacky solution so far is just to delay the scripts some reasonable amount of time to let the DOM insertion happen, by wrapping them in a setTimeout : window.setTimeout( function() { // process downloaded Fragment }, 300); Obviously this is unreliable and hideous. What's a better way?
