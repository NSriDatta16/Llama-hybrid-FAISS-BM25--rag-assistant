Best way to manage an S3 Bucket?

I have been trying for a month and a half now to transfer files and update ACL permissions. My bucket in question is 28gigs, and has over 45,000 objects in it. It generally takes three days to do it. I've tried the following : Bucket Explorer CloudBerry s3sync s3cmd s3 organizer s3fox And quite frankly, none of them can handle it. All of them die after a few hours of running the process of copying these files or updating their ACL's. Does anyone know what I can do?
