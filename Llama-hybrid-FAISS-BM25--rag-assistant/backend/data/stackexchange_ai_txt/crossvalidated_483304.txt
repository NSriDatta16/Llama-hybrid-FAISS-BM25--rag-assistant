I have never heard of Venetian blind cross-validation, but apparently it is a thing, and I've used it in the past without realizing it had a name. This site gives a definition, along with some others: Venetian Blinds: Each test set is determined by selecting every sth object in the data set, starting at objects numbered 1 through s. Contiguous Blocks: Each test sets is determined by selecting contiguous blocks of n/s objects in the data set, starting at object number 1. Random Subsets: s different test sets are determined through random selection of n/s objects in the data set, such that no single object is in more than one test set. This procedure is repeated r times, where r is the number of iterations. It is the averaged results of the iterations that is used in the report of the cross validation results. Leave-One-Out: Each single object in the data set is used as a test set. Custom: Each of the test sets is manually defined by the user. Provisions can be made to "force" specific objects to be in every test set, never be in a test set, or not be used in the cross validation procedure at all.
