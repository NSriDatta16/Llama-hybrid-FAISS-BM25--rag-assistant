Typically I write prototypes as part of the architecture/design process, to answer questions that can only be answered by actually working with the code. For example, questions such as: Can I do drag & drop in Silverlight? What framework would I use to draw interactive canvas objects in WinForms? Usually you can write a prototype fairly quickly to answer such questions. Obviously the code does not have to be production-quality, it just has to go far enough to answer these questions. Once you run out of open questions, I would scrap the prototype and finish your "design". Then you are ready to begin creating a production version.
