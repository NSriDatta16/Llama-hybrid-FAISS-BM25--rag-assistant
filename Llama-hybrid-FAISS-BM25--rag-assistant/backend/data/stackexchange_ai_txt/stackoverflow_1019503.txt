If another implementation of PersonFactory is provided, should it also need to provide a #getAll? If so, it belongs on the interface... and then it can't be a static method in Java. Given that, is it a function of your PersonFactory or should there be an abstraction for your storage mechanism as well? If so, a PersonRepository interface whose implementations accept a PersonFactory, and provides a natural home for getAll-type functionality seems more appropriate. If not, then as a member of the concrete PersonFactory could be appropriate enough...
