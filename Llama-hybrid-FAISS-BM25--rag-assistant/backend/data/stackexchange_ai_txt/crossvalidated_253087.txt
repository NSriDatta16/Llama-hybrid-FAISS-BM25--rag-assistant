Your model selection should be based on the type and distribution of your outcome variable. You say your DV is numeric but is it continuous, discrete, a scale, or some other type? Your answer to this question will determine to a large extent the best model to choose from. For continuous variables such as income, it is customary to do a log transformation to get it as close to a normal distribution as possible. You can then employ OLS and run some diagnostics to check your model fit. For other types of continuous variables, get a histogram and check the distribution. If it is somewhat normal, you can run an OLS and check the diagnostics and model fit. If you have a binary outcome, such as a Yes-No or 0-1 dichotomous variable, you can use logistic regression. For count variables, such as founding rates of new restaurants in a city, negative binomial or poisson regression is suitable depending on the nature of the variable. If you have lots of zeros, you can consider a zero-inflated negative binomial or poisson. If your DV is has more than two categories, multinomial regression is often the safest route although it largely depends on the nature of the DV, your theory, and how you decide to recode it, if you do at all. If you are new to regression and statistics in general, I would suggest you stay away from some of the highly-specialized models you mention in your post because they require a more advanced knowledge and understanding of statistical modeling than you probably possess right now.
