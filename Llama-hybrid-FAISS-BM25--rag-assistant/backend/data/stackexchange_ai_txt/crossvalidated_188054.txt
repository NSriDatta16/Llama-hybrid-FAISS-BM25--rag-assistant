At some stage you're going to have to label some data (eg with tusk sizes/tusk bounding boxes) and train a classifier/regressor on that. You may be able to get away with using less labelled data if you do unsupervised learning on your large batch of unlabelled images first. But as far as I know there's not a huge amount of work on deep unsupervised learning on full natural images (usually people just get big datasets and train supervised nowadays). Nobody really uses convolutional RBMs for full scale natural images (because there're some trickinesses involved in getting RBMs to work with natural images, and a whole lot of trickiness in training RBMs in general), so you'd be heading into uncharted waters there.... Your best bet is probably to start with a network that's already been pretrained for ImageNet (which contains elephants), then remove the last layer or 2, and use it as a feature extractor (which can optionally be finetuned by backprop). Many people use the "FC7" features - the features from fully-connected-layer-7 of the famous AlexNet. You can train a new MLP or SVM on top of these features using your small tusk-size detection dataset.
