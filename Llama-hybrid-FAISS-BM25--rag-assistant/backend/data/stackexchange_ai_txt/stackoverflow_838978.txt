How to check if mysql database exists

Is it possible to check if a (MySQL) database exists after having made a connection. I know how to check if a table exists in a DB, but I need to check if the DB exists. If not I have to call another piece of code to create it and populate it. I know this all sounds somewhat inelegant - this is a quick and dirty app.
