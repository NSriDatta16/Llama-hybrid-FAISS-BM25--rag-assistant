adding "last edit time" to trac wiki pages

My organization has a sprawling wiki that isn't kept up to date very well. To reduce the danger of new people reading a page and not realizing how outdated it is, I'd like to modify the page header so that instead of Page Name at the top, it says something like Page Name - last modified 5/8/10 by Joe I see that Trac allows page templates, but if we haven't used those before, is there a 'blank' template I could alter to change all existing pages?
