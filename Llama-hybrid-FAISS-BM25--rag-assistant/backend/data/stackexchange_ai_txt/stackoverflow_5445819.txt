Rails/ajax - whitespace and request.raw_post

I am starting to learn Ajax with rails. I have a catalog index page with a text_field_tag querying db if it finds similar "section" results. Index.html.erb Catalogs Search by Section: 0.1, :update=> "article_list", :url=>{ :action => :get_article_list }) %> Catalogs_controller.rb def index end def get_article_list @section = request.raw_post.split(/&/).first @catalogList = " " Catalog.find(:all, :conditions => ["section = ?", @section]).each do |catalog| @catalogList += " " + catalog.title + " " end @catalogList += " " render :text => @catalogList end Question: request.raw_post renders something like: xml&authenticity_token=tgtxV3knlPvrJqT9qazs4BIcKYeFy2hGDIrQxVUTvFM%3D so I use request.raw_post.split(/&/).first to get the section query ("xml"). It works, however how can I do if the query have a whitespace. (like "Open Source") In fact, I have Open Source sections in my db, but request.raw_post.split(/&/).first renders Open%20Source. How can I manage this? Did I have to use a full text search engine to achieve it or there is another way? Thanks a lot for your explanation!
