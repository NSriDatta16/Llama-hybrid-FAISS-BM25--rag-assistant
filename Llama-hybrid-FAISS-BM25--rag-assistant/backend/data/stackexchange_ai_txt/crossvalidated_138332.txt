Logistic regression and dependent variables in R

Iâ€™m trying to do logistic regression, I utilize the following command: mylogit And I obtain a p-value of 0.003 After that I want to know the effect of Var2 and Var3 and I use the following command: mylogit obtaining a p-value of 0.993 My problem is that Var1 and Var2 are dependent and for that reason I obtain such p value. Is there any method to indicate that Var1 and Var2 are dependent or I have to remove Var2 ?
