How to determine the optimal threshold for a classifier and generate ROC curve?

Let say we have a SVM classifier, how do we generate ROC curve? (Like theoretically) (because we are generate TPR and FPR with each of the threshold). And how do we determine the optimal threshold for this SVM classifier?
