6.2.2/5: "If the declaration of an identiﬁer for an object has ﬁle scope and no storage-class speciﬁer, its linkage is external." That's linkage , though, not scope . Your declaration of x would have file scope either way. static and extern don't affect scope. It's initialized to 0 because x has static storage duration (see 6.2.4/3 and /5). In general you also have to be aware of 6.2.2./4: For an identiﬁer declared with the storage-class speciﬁer extern in a scope in which a prior declaration of that identiﬁer is visible, if the prior declaration speciﬁes internal or external linkage, the linkage of the identiﬁer at the later declaration is the same as the linkage speciﬁed at the prior declaration. So declaring with extern is not quite the same as declaring with no storage-class specifier. In your example there is no prior declaration, though.
