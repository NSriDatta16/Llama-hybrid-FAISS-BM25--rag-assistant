How to extract entities from text using existing ontologies?

I am working on a entity extraction task and I am using Stanford CoreNLP NER. Here, I want to detect entities of type "Animal", "Building", "Imagery", etc., which are not covered in Stanford CoreNLP entity extraction method. Also, I want to detect organization entities which are not included in CoreNLP entity model. I have the data about the organizations with me. How can I do this?
