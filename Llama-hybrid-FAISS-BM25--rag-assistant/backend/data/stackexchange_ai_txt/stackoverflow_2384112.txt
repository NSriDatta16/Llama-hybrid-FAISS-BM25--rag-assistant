It doesn't really matter that you wrap it in an H2. It's semantically okay. Here's what the W3C has to say about heading tags (H1 - H6)- A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document automatically. Your H2 is a subdescription of the H1. ie: H1 describes the page subject, H2 describes the location. Works okay in my mind.
