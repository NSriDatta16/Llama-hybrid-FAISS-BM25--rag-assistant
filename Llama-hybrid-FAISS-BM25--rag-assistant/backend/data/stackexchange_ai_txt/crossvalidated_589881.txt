Making sense of testing guidelines from senior scientist on difference between Poissons

My boss asked a senior scientist in his network for recommendations about testing whether two Poisson random variables have the same mean. The context is differences in measurements from two radioactive samples. We need to decide whether the samples come from the same source and measurement differences are due to the randomness of the process, or whether they might come from different sources/have been handled differently. My boss trusts the senior scientist and would like to apply the guidelines that person gave us. But we're having a hard time parsing these guidelines (and it's hard to get back in touch with that person to ask for clarifications). I also want to believe that person though I can't help but wonder whether they might have been in a rush and sent an ad hoc somewhat improvised rule of thumb. The question was "how close must the count-per-minute be to confidently reject the hypothesis that the processes have the same mean?". To which the senior scientist responded: "The samples should be within 100% (2 sqrt(N)/N+0.05) of each other. This allows for statistical variation (two sigma) and sample pipetting error (5%). Note: N is count-per-minute*count-duration-in-minutes." There are a number of things we don't understand or are unsure about: The meaning of $N$ : Is $N$ supposed to be the sum of all detections across the two samples? The average number of detections across the two samples? Order of operations: is it $[2*\sqrt(N)/(N+0.05)]$ or $([2*\sqrt(N)/N]+0.05)$ ? Why the extra-term for pipetting error if such errors can be viewed as differentially affecting the count-per-minute which should itself be detected by a "mere" statistical test of mean equality? If the order of operations is $([2*\sqrt(N)/N]+0.05)$ , why not report it as $([2/\sqrt(N)]+0.05)$ ? Could that suggest there's a typo and the $N$ at the bottom of the fraction should be something else? -... So my question is : Can anyone help us make sense of the above formula? Does it resemble any valid test for equality of the mean of two Poissons you're aware of? Or perhaps can you confirm that it's a kind of rule of thumb? I found a lot of useful information on testing the equality of the mean of two Poissons, both here ( Checking if two Poisson samples have the same mean , Differences between poisson.test and E-test when testing Poisson parameters ) and elsewhere ( https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sample_Size_Calculations/3uqZ_81If4UC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Poisson 5.1). But the closest I've been to matching the above formula with a proper test is Trying to match the normal approximate test from 5.2.1.1 in Practical Methods for Engineers and Scientists by Paul Mathews (2010), Putting aside the "pipetting" term, Assuming that $N =$ sum of all detections across the two samples, Assuming there is a typo and the formula should read [2*\sqrt(N)/count-duration-in-minutes], and Assuming that 2 is an approximation of $z_{0.025} = 1.96$ (I guess you could also say that $2$ is just $z_\alpha$ for some other value of $\alpha ). If anyone has a better guess, I'd love to hear it.
