How to verify a CNN encoder works as expected?

I am using CNN as a part of kernel warping. The purpose here is to reduce input dimension (from N*M to K *1). The input data is not image data. I suspected that the CNN network might not work as I expected. How can I verify my assumption? I am using pytorch, by the way. Thank you in advance.
