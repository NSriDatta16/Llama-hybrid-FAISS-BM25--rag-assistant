Your code looks fine. Try using the debugger to pinpoint the location of the crash. You can see the debugger by pressing command+Shift+Y. Also, check the crash logs on your device, which are accessible through the Xcode organizer. (command+option+O) edit: You are trying to release your external class while the alert is still visible. Use an NSNotification (in the UIAlertView delegate method) to tell the rest of your app when the alert has been dismissed. Then it will be safe to release your external class.
