Neither phone has anywhere near sufficient memory. You need 96-128 mb, preferably more like 256 mb of ram. Something that was already linux-based would be simplest as you would start by adding the android kernel modifications. Alternatively, something that is a winmo cousin to a vendor's existing android phone and has basically comparable hardware so you can hopefully recycle drivers or leverage an existing porting effort. But if you need to aquire a phone anyway, get one that already runs android.
