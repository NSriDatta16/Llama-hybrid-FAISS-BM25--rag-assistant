Average extension method in Linq for default value

Anyone know how I can set a default value for an average? I have a line like this... dbPlugins = (from p in dbPlugins select new { Plugin = p, AvgScore = p.DbVersions.Average(x => x.DbRatings.Average(y => y.Score)) }) .OrderByDescending(x => x.AvgScore) .Select(x => x.Plugin).ToList(); which throws an error becase I have no ratings yet. If I have none I want the average to default to 0. I was thinking this should be an extension method where I could specify what the default value should be.
