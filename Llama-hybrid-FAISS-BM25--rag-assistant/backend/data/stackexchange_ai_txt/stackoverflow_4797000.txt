Augmented Reality (AR) is a generic term for an interactive 3D environment that blends with our physical reality, usually through a webcam, or in this case, a phone camera. You can develop AR apps for Android with nothing more than the Android SDK, since it provides API for interacting with the camera, and it supports OpenGL for 3D graphics. Since AR usually involves complex algorithms of image recognition, it's not a trivial task, so leveraging existing tools is definitely a good option. Since using Adobe AIR and Flash, is actually running the Flash virtual machine over the Dalvik virtual machine, you might experience performance issues for such a CPU intensive task such as AR. If using other tools is also an option for you, you can check out Qualcomm's Augmented Reality SDK
