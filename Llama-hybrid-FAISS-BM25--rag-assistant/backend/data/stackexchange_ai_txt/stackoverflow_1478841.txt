jQuery how to select all tr elements from one row and up to a stop

A little odd situation. I'm writing a greasemonkey script on some legacy HTML where everything is put into one table. I want to select all TR elements from the one I click and the next 3-4-5-6 rows up to the next row that contains a TD.class_name table ... tr -> td.class_name tr tr tr tr -> td.class_name ... /table So, in the above example I want to select rows 2,3,4 (and hide them, which is the trivial part). The challenge is that I don't know how many rows there are, and this table could be very long. How could I do that in an elegant way in jQuery?
