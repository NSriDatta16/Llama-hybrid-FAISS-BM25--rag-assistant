As mentioned, the fastest and painless way to sort this would be to stick the USER_ID in the session, period. Comments saying that you "pollute" session with that information are plainly uneducated, ignore them. The other thing I noticed in comments is the "check if the user has the rights to edit the entry" which implies there's some sort of hierarchical system in place, which seems not to be true. Alternative to session storage would be, as you assumed already, obfuscating the USER_ID value in the hidden field somehow. You could either encrypt it, or instead of integer ID - you could use GUIDs but that has implications of its own, tho it makes it incredibly hard for someone to "guess" the correct GUID to mess around with the records.
