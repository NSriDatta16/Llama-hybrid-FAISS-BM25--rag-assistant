I agreed that it is unclear on the focus of the initial inquiry given the usage of the term "mixture". However, I will also point out that some individuals may opt to use Bayesian models with non-informative priors not to incorporate prior information, but to get estimates that may be deemed more interpretable to their general audience. For example, the difference between frequentist versus the Bayesian model output interpretations. This would be an approach not based on prior domain knowledge though uses Bayesian modeling.
