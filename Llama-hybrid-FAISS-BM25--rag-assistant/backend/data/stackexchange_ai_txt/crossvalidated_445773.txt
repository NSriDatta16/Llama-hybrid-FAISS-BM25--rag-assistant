Early stopping in wilcoxon signed rank test?

I have decided to acquire N joint samples of variables X and Y (for example, N=200), and test whether their means are different using the signed-rank test . I will repeat this procedure many times, each time for a different pair of variables. In my application, acquiring samples is a very expensive procedure, so I would like to acquire as few samples as possible on average per procedure. I would like to try the following trick: acquire 1 sample at a time, and make a check after every sample on whether it is still realistic that the null-hypothesis will be rejected. If I am already convinced that I will not be able to reject the null hypothesis after e.g. 10 samples, then there is no need to repeat the procedure for the rest of them. I would like to further illustrate what I mean by early stopping using binomial distribution as an example. Let's say I want to check if a certain coin is more likely to flip heads than tails with p-value of 0.01 or better using N=200 samples. If my first 3 measurements are tails, then, even if all other 197 measurements end up heads, the p-value will be 3/200 = 0.015, so I will fail to reject the null hypothesis regardless of what the remaining 197 measurement results are, so I might as well stop after just 3 measurements
