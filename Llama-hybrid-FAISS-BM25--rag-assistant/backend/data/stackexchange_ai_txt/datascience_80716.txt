Column vector for training example

I have a question about the training example for machine learning. I know most people make training examples to a column vector. However, most of the time when we get a training example, like from a panda data frame object and transfer it to a NumPy array, each example will be a row vector. I know I can use transpose to change it to a column vector. But I want to ask why do we do that? What makes a column vector better suited for training examples?
