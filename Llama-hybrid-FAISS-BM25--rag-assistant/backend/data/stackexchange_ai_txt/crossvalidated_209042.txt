Points with leverage equal 1.0 indicates something strange about your model, it could be groups with only one member. But it could also be some error in model formulation, so should in all cases be thoroughly checked out! The leverages are the diagonal elements of the hat matrix $H= X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T$ and those diagonals satisfy $0 \le h_i \le 1$. The fitted values can be written $\hat{Y} = HY$ explaining the name "hat matrix": it puts the hat on $Y$ (it was named so by W Tukey). Writing this out for observation number $i$ we get: $$ \hat{y}_i = \sum_{j=1}^n h_{ij} y_j = h_i y_i + \sum_{j\not = i} h_{ij} y_j. $$ When $h_i=1.0$ we can show (*) that the other $h_{ij}=0, j\not= i$. So when $h_i$=1, we can se: $$ \hat{y_i} = y_i. $$ That is, only its own observation influences its prediction. All the other observations are irrelevant for observation $i$! That is quite strange, and could well be caused by some error in model formulation. You should investigate your model (and data!) and try to understand why that happens. Finally, let us prove our claim (*) : $H$ is an idempotent matrix, that is, $HH=H$. Using that we get for the element $h_i$: $$ h_i =\sum_{j=1}^n h_{ij}^2 = h_i^2 + \sum_{j\not = i} h_{ij}^2 $$ which simplifies to $1=1+ \sum_{j\not = i} h_{ij}^2$ proving the claim.
