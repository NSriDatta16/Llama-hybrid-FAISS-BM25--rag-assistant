Flex 4: Sparks text fields are not using the default font and giving warnings

I get the following warning when I run my application: warning: incompatible embedded font 'Arial' specified for spark.components::Label (Label104) . This component requires that the embedded font be declared with embedAsCff=true. The application I am working on is a mix of Halo and Sparks components as I am migrating it to Flex 4. The text that is showing in the text fields is defaulting the systems serif font. There are a few problems with this warning. 1) I am not embedding any fonts in the application. I am not even assigning the Arial font to any of the components. 2) If I check the "Use Flash Text Engine in MX components", then all the text fields in the app throw the warning. Not just the sparks text fields. Why does flex 4 think that I am using an embedded font with the sparks components? Is there any way to get around this warning and have the text fields use a non embedded font?
