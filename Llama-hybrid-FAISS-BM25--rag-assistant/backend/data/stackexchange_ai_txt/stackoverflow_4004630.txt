1.Store A[i]*B[j] for all pair (i,j) in another array D, organized in the hash data-structure. The complexity of this step is O(N*N). construct a hash named D for i = 1 to n for j = 1 to n insert A[i]*B[j] into D 2.For each C[i] in the array C, find if M-C[i] exists in D. The complexity of this step is O(N). for i = 1 to n check if M - C[i] is in D
