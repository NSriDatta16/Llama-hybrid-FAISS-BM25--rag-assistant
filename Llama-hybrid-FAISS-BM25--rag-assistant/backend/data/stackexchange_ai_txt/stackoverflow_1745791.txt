I'm guessing that it was to make mipmap generation easier, because it allows you to just average 2x2 pixels into one pixel all the way from NxN down to 1x1. Now that doesn't matter if you're not using mipmapping, but it's easier to have just one rule, and I think that mipmapping was the more common use case.
