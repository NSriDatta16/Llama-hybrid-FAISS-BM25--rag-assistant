That you are using the OdbcCommand would indicate that you are using a database other than SQL Server. SQL Server 2008 introduced table valuded parameters which might have been a solution. Assuming that the database that you are using does not support this feature, a split function such as the one that gjvdkamp suggested would be an option. If your database support dynamic sql (SQL Server provides the sp_executesql stored procedure for this purpose) you could also consider using that. A final option that you might want to consider ( not very elegant ) would be to allow for a limited number of email addresses and allow each to be passed via its own parameter. You would then use them in the where clause as follows. where E_MAIL in (@Address1, @Address2, @Address3)
