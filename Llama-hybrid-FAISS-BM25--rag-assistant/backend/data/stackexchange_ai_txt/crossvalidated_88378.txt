I will provide only a short informal answer and refer you to the section 4.3 of The Elements of Statistical Learning for the details. Update: "The Elements" happen to cover in great detail exactly the questions you are asking here, including what you wrote in your update. The relevant section is 4.3, and in particular 4.3.2-4.3.3. (2) Do and how the two approaches relate to each other? They certainly do. What you call "Bayesian" approach is more general and only assumes Gaussian distributions for each class. Your likelihood function is essentially Mahalanobis distance from $x$ to the centre of each class. You are of course right that for each class it is a linear function of $x$. However, note that the ratio of the likelihoods for two different classes (that you are going to use in order to perform an actual classification, i.e. choose between classes) -- this ratio is not going to be linear in $x$ if different classes have different covariance matrices. In fact, if one works out boundaries between classes, they turn out to be quadratic, so it is also called quadratic discriminant analysis , QDA. An important insight is that equations simplify considerably if one assumes that all classes have identical covariance [ Update: if you assumed it all along, this might have been part of the misunderstanding] . In that case decision boundaries become linear, and that is why this procedure is called linear discriminant analysis, LDA. It takes some algebraic manipulations to realize that in this case the formulas actually become exactly equivalent to what Fisher worked out using his approach. Think of that as a mathematical theorem. See Hastie's textbook for all the math. (1) Can we do dimension reduction using Bayesian approach? If by "Bayesian approach" you mean dealing with different covariance matrices in each class, then no. At least it will not be a linear dimensionality reduction (unlike LDA), because of what I wrote above. However, if you are happy to assume the shared covariance matrix, then yes, certainly, because "Bayesian approach" is simply equivalent to LDA. However, if you check Hastie 4.3.3, you will see that the correct projections are not given by $\Sigma^{-1} \mu_k$ as you wrote (I don't even understand what it should mean: these projections are dependent on $k$, and what is usually meant by projection is a way to project all points from all classes on to the same lower-dimensional manifold), but by first [generalized] eigenvectors of $\boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{M}$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a covariance matrix of class centroids $\mu_k$.
