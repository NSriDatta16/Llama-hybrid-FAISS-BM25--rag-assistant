What did Sentence-Bert return here?

I used sentence bert to embed sentences from this tutorial https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2') This is the event triples t I forgot to concat into sentences, [('U.S. stock index futures', 'points to', 'start'), ('U.S. stock index futures', 'points to', 'higher start')] model.encode(t) returns a 2d array of shape (2,768), with two idential 768-dimension vectors, and its value is different from both model.encode('U.S. stock index futures') and model.encode('U.S. stock index futures points to start') . What could possibly have it returned? It is the same situation for other models on huggingface such as https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/stsb-distilbert-base
