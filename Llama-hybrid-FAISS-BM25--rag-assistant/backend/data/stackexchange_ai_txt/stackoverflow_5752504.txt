Filter weekly from daily data and pick first occurence of the week

Assume you have a table with a stock time series on a daily basis. Now you need to filter one data point per week, because you need weekly data for some analysis. You don't to have weekly averages, since this would leave much of the variation out. This would be my initial approach, but it's not clear which of the data points falling in a given week is selected. SELECT date, price from stock_series GROUP BY WEEK(date) 1 How do I make sure it's always the first data point existing for a given week that gets picked? EDIT: 2 If the above query stayed the way it is - which data point gets chosen every week? What's the MySQL logic in this case? Or is it just unpredictible?
