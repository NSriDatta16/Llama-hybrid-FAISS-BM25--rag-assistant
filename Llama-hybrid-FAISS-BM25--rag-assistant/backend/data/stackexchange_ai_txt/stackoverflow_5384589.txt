File Reading Java

I am making a simple game with a save and load. So far, I have the save game working and it saves all the objects positions to a .dat file. Each line has 3 coordinates (x, y, z) split by a colon. Example: 23.762622833251953:3.887784719467163 22.5:0.5:18.5 23.5:0.5:20.5 26.5:0.5:5.5 28.5:0.5:21.5 30.5:0.5:4.5 33.5:0.5:19.5 35.5:0.5:4.5 38.5:0.5:15.5 39.5:0.5:3.5 41.5:0.5:9.5 The very first line is coordinates to the first-person view of the player. This is easy enough to implement since I pass each coordinate into an array, so the x-position is the first element [0] and the z coordinate is the second element [1]. The y coordinate is always the same, even for blocks, so I didn't bother saving it, but I did for the blocks for some reason. Here is the method to save a game: public void saveGame() { File file = new File("quickSave.dat"); try { FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file); writer.write(env.getCameraX()+":"+env.getCameraZ()+"\n"); for (int row = 0; row The problem is reading each line from the file and then passing those coordinates into the object. I only implemented passing coordinates into the players perspective, which was easy because I was working with only 2 elements. I was thinking of making another array with 2 dimensions (taking out the y-coordinate, the middle one), and each element is one line from the file, but how do I do this? Or is this another, more elegant way? Here is my load game method so far: public void loadGame() { File file = new File("quickSave.dat"); try { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String line = reader.readLine(); String[] elements = line.split(":"); env.setCameraXYZ(new Float(elements[0]), 0.5, new Float(elements[1])); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Game loaded"); } catch (Exception e) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, e); } }
