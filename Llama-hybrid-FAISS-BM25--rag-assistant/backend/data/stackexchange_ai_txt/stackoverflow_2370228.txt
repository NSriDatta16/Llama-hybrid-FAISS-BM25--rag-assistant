Problems positioning Flash graphic drawn with Graphics Class

I'm using Flash CS3 to build a simple drawing application. When the user clicks a button, they select a particular movieclip. After clicking elsewhere on the stage, the clip is instantiated and added to the stage at the position of the cursor. I've also added the option of being able to click on the added clip and drag it around on the screen. And this all works fine. The problem is that I also want to be able to dynamically draw and add objects to the stage via the Graphics class. Whenever I add objects in this manner, their x and y coordinates are always 0,0 no matter where I place them on the stage. This makes positioning these graphics very very problematic. I created a modified positioning function specifically for these dynamically drawn graphics and while it does "work", it feels less responsive than the positioning for movieclip objects. I'm still trying to optimize this function, but it seems to me that the ideal solution is for the graphics to have non-zero coordinates when placed in the middle of the stage like movieclip objects. Is there some "workaround" to achieve this?
