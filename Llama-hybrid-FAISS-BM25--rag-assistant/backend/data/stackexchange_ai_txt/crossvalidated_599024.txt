Mixed Model Logistic Regression, max 2 observations per group

I am working with twin data with my exposure variable being inflammatory marker level (continuous) and outcome being disease status (binary). In order to account for twin relatedness, I was trying to use a mixed effects logistic regression similar to: glmer(disease ~ x+(1|Family_No) in the lme4 package. But I have run into an issue regarding "boundary (singular) fit". After doing a bit of searching, I saw it was recommended that I run a Bayesian model instead so I attempted to run stanglmer in the rstanarm package. I received warnings of Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) being too low as well as divergent transitions. Based on my minimal understanding, I interpret this to be attributable to the fact that I have only one observation per twin for a total of 1050 observations but 820 families represented. This means that I have 820 groups, with the vast majority of them only having a single observation and the rest having two. I have previously been able to successfully run glmer with the exact above regression in the full dataset with approximately 2500 twins and 1000 families/groups. A few questions: How bad is it to have boundary/singular fit errors/warnings? Did I correctly interpret the warning? Can I continue pursuing a mixed effects logistic regression, given this warning? Even if I can, should I? Do I have alternative methods to account for family relatedness in my sample?
