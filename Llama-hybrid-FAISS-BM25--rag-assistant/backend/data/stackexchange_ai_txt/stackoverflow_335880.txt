Theoretically you can access the the content of the iframe using the standard DOM level2 contentDocument property. Practically you may have found out that most browsers deny the access to the DOM of the external document due to security concerns. Access to the full DOM AFAIK is not possible (though there might be some browser-specific tweak to disable the same-domain check); for cross-domain XHR a popular trick is to bounce the data back and forth the iframe and the main document using URL fragment identifiers (see e.g. this link ), you can use the same technique but: the document loaded in the iframe must cooperate, and you don't have access to the full document anyway (you can read back some parameters, or maybe you can try and URL-encode the whole document - but that would be very ugly)
