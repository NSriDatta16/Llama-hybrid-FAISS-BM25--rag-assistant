Relationship between ridge regression and PCA regression

I remember having read somewhere on the web a connection between ridge regression (with $\ell_2$ regularization) and PCA regression: while using $\ell_2$-regularized regression with hyperparameter $\lambda$, if $\lambda \to 0$, then the regression is equivalent to removing the PC variable with the smallest eigenvalue. Why is this true? Does this have anything to do with the optimization procedure? Naively, I would have expected it to be equivalent to OLS. Does anybody have a reference for this?
