After many rounds of changing the parameters, I was able to find a solution and get the build to deploy successfully. The parameters that I ended up using were: /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:DeployTarget=MSDeployPublish /p:MSDeployPublishMethod=**RemoteAgent** /p:MsDeployServiceUrl=http://my-server-name /p:username=myusername /p:password=mypassword It appears that when using InProc for the MSDeployPublishMethod MSBuild ignores MsDeployServiceUrl and always tries to deploy to the local server. I changed it to RemoteAgent and it deployed successfully. I did notice that the Package file is nolonger contained in the MyWebApplication_Package folder, but that isn't a big deal to me.
