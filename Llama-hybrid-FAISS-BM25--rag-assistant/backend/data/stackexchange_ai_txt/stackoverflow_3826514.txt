OpenSIPS is a SIP server application that includes a variety of components that are often needed for a SIP infrastructure such as Registrar, Proxy, Presence Agent etc. What OpenSIPS is not is a SIP user agent (or at least not one that's designed to work with a person as the end user). That means it's not built to make or receive calls. If you are planning on using OpenSIPS as the SIP Proxy on your network combined with a different piece of software, such as Sipdroid, acting as the user agent on your mobile devices then the answer to your question is yes. You will be able to configure OpenSIPS to allow calls between devices on the same local network.
