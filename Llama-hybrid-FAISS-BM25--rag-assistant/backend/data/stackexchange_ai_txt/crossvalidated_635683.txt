These days, you would never use matrix factorization for recommender systems. See "The YouTube Video Recommendation System" by James Davidson et al. for a very basic outline of the Youtube recommendation system. One key thing to note from these two stage systems is that they generally use a deep learning model for the final ranking system. This allows the flexibility to use a viewer/video embedding, but also any feature that may be generated. So one can also use a channel embedding, topic, country, or any other metadata available to improve the recommendation in the case where we need to cold start a video/viewer. You can also use computer vision methods to extract topics from a video before any viewer engagement data is collect. Similarly, the first stage of the recommendation system may use whatever model they want, such as a two tower model . So with these models, it is again possible to use some sort of metadata to improve recommendation compared to the random distribution you would need to do with a very simple matrix factorization model for new viewers/videos. With that said, these systems still tend to favor distribution of established content over new content. As such, there has been recent work, such as "Exploration in Recommender Systems" by Minmin Chen on forcing the recommendation system to explore new content with a small portion of traffic.
