What Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms can be used to detect Fraud in insurance?

I'm about to start a project regarding Fraud Detection in Insurance but there is no dependant variable to train the model and classify it. Please provide the algorithms that I can use to detect Fraud in both Auto and Health insurance industry. Thanks in advance!
