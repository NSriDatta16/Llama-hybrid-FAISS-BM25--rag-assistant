It looks as if you're trying to convert all paperwork for a company into digital documents. Some of this paper can be really old. Say your text is black, and any other color is the background. If you take two weighted averages, one consisting of what you think is the text, and one consisting of the background, you can compare those two and see if they're distant enough to consider further evaluation. This will removing any uneven aging of the paper. Staple holes and punched holes in paper are pretty standard in size, but they'd show up as gray or not at all if you're scanning on a white background. If not, then you can guess where these are and remove them. Now, we look at areas of high interest, areas where the black pixels are the most dense. Select a portion of that and OCR it. Place the starting top-left closest to an area where text begins. On a typical document, a solid blank linear area going left-to-right and another going top-to-bottom denotes the top and left sides of a paragraph. You can be sure that you got a line of text because below a line of text is another blank left-to-right area. So you don't need to worry about selecting a portion that will chop text in half.
