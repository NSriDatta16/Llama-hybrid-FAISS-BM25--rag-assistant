Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar is definitely one that rocks on IE for web development debugging. It's better for DOM inspection and browsing than firebug in my opinion and much less powerful when it comes to javascript. Google Chrome also comes with some handy little developer tools, especially for javascript, just use Page Control (the page icon beside address bar) -> Developer and you'll see a javascript debugger there. Opera has yet another developer menu: Tools -> Advanced -> Developer Tools ( http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/ ). My favorite is a combination of IE developer toolbar for HTML+CSS and Firebug for JavaScript and other stuff that's a little more sophisticated.
