Network architecture to predict zero-inflated output

I have a dataset of debt collections and I am trying to predict how much each person paid. The paid amounts are greatly zero-inflated. In the past I have built a two-stage model predicting the probability of payment followed by the payment amount. It seems that a neural network would be a good choice to learn both models at the same time. However, when it comes to activation and loss functions for the final output layer predicting payment amount I am stuck. I have tried a relu activation and an mse loss but it doesn't converge. What network architecture could be used to predict a heavily zero-inflated outcome?
