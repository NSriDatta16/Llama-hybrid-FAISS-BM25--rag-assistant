How to Combine Multiple Probabilities

I have a list of many products, each with a given probability of the owner's gender and I'd like to compute the gender probability for users who have multiple products. I am forced to assume that the gender of the users is independent of the products or combinations (since I don't have any additional information). For example: Product A is purchased 60% of the time by females and 40% by males Product B is purchased 80% of the time by females and 20% by males If I see a user with product A and B, what is the probability that the user is female? Male? I originally thought to average the probabilities, so in this case, it would lead to 70% probability of being female and 30% male. But this feels wrong, because of the following: In the case where, for example, a person of unknown gender has 10 products that where each product is associated with a probability of that user being female equal to 90%, that the resultant probability of being female would just be 90%. It should be much higher...intuitively. Any ideas?
