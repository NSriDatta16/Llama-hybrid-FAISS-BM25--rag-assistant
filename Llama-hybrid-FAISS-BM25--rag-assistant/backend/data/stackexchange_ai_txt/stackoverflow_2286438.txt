what this python code trying to do

The following python code is to traverse a 2D grid of (c, g) in some special order, which is stored in "jobs" and "job_queue". But I am not sure which kind of order it is after trying to understand the code. Is someone able to tell about the order and give some explanation for the purpose of each function? Thanks and regards! import Queue c_begin, c_end, c_step = -5, 15, 2 g_begin, g_end, g_step = 3, -15, -2 def range_f(begin,end,step): # like range, but works on non-integer too seq = [] while True: if step > 0 and begin > end: break if step EDIT: There is a value for each (c,g). The code actually is to search in the 2D grid of (c,g) to find a grid point where the value is the smallest. I guess the code is using some kind of heuristic search algorithm? The original code is here http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/gridsvr/gridregression.py , which is a script to search for svm algorithm the best values for two parameters c and g with minimum validation error.
