Problem in Supporting Multiple Screens in Android?

Hai Friends, I have developed an application which en-composes list views and posted that .apk file in my htc device, the design and alignment everything works fine,but the problem When i am testing in various devices such as Morotolo Droid,Nexus Devices the alignment of Listviews goes wrong, so i planned to use the Layout folder as layout-hdpi,layout-ldpi, and layout-mdpi, for that i changed my manifest file as Is it right putting android:anyDensity="true",also i used dp instead of dip. I went through this url, but still am not able to get a clear idea in this http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html . so friends pls tell me(help me) to get clear idea in this and tell what mistakes i have doing. This is my main page xml code frnds.
