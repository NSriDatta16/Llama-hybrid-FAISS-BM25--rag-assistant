Android - dragging imageview with finger does not update position

I'm using a frame layout and a top/left margin combination to drag an imageview around the screen. I've added all code in setOnTouchListener() of the imageview. The problem is the UI does not get repainted on MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE and i only see the update when MotionEvent.ACTION_UP is received. How could i force the view to redraw the image at its new position on MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE ?
