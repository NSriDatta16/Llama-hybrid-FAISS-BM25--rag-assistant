How to notify when a product is added within Magento?

I'm wondering what would be the best way to notify an user when a new product is added which matches his/her interests? I think of a cron running at least 2 times a days (or more, every hour for example) I can also imagine to implement kind of an event system but that one may be tricky. Do you have any feedback? Thanks
