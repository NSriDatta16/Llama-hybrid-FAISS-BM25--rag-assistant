1-) Cost function measures "distance" between the hypothesis and the groundtruth, so using norm, quadratic, or 4th degree doesn't matter. The cost value (dependant variable) changes, but optimum point doesn't change. Quandratic cost function is general practice. I think it is better than norm (abs) because it has fewer computation steps than norm ( square first than take its s-root). Also, higher terms may reduce efficient storage for variables. So, it is more about computation. 2-) You can use normal distribution as cost function. As the hypothesis gets closer to the ground truth, probability increases. So, maximizing probability, optimizes theta variables. If we compare it with normal distribution, I think $ y^{(i)}$ is assumed as $ \mu$ and as $ \Theta^Tx^{(i)}$ approaches to $ \mu$ the propability gets closer to its maximum value. It is a minor point but, there is something wrong in your formulation, sigma assumed as 1 in the 3th eq. but not it 2nd. I'm not so sure about details for other part of your question. Do you study it from Bishop's book? I've quit it several months ago at chapter 3 because it is not well-prepared for a beginner (At least for me).
