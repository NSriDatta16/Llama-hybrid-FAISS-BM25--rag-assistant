Scikit Learn Random Forest Classifier Hyperparameter Min Target Sample Size

From reading the docs on Scikit Learn, I haven't been able to find an answer, but does anyone know if there is a way to specify to always include a specific number out of the max sample size of samples where the answer is true? For example: Lets say I set my max sample size as 50 per tree, but out of the 50, I want it to alwayd have 15 of those be true, where as the other 35 are false. This would be pulled from my already split dataset. I would appreciate any input into this, thanks.
