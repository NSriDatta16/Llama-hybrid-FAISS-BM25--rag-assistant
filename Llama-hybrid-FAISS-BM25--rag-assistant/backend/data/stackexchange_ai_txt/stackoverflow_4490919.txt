IE6/7 Google Maps tile transparency - I can't see the map

I am currently building a site that utilises the Google Maps V3 API. It works as expected on Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Opera/IE8 - but in IE6 and 7 the map tiles are transparent. The overlay appears but the map tiles appear to be hidden. I say 'appear to be' because, if I drag the map quickly the tiles are there then they disappear - so it must be javascript hiding it? Here's an image of the problem: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10007971/mm/mm_google_map_error.jpg I am using opacity in my CSS which may be the root of the problem. If code is needed I am happy to post it. Thanks, Ollie
