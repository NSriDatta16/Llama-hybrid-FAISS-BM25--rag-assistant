Xcode4 Automatic Generation of @property declarations and all that goes with it

When I was using Xcode 3 I had configured it with a perl script I found on the web that allowed me to automatically generate the @property, @synthesize and dealloc code for new instance variables. Xcode 4 doesn't have that User Scripts menu though. Is there a way to plug in these kinds of User Scripts for Xcode 4 or does Xcode 4 have a new feature that generates that stuff automatically? (I've looked and can't find one though). I'm not talking about linking to IBOutlets. I know that I can drag from a xib and it will create all of the right stuff for IBOutlets, but I'm looking for something that will create @property, @synthesize and dealloc code for any instance variable. Thanks, Kenny
