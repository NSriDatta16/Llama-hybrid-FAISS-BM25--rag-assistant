Sigabrt on Main function

I've just began to learn iOS development and now I have a sigabrt on my main function. The error is triggered by calling: int retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, nil); As I am very new to iOS programming I have no idea on what could by causing this error. One thing that I have found on my callstack is the following exception being raised: dyld_stub_objc_exception_throw What could be causing this error?
