Tick the Export for Actionscript option in the library for the MovieClip you want to access in Flex. Then, in Flex you can access the class by that name. Since you are embedding the SWF, I would suggest using a SWC (as you should also get autocomplete support). Again, set the Export for Actionscript option for the MovieClips you want to access in xxx.swf, and in Publish Settings also tick Export SWC . Once you've linked that SWC to your Flex build path, the exported MovieClip should be available as classes. Now, I would like to load an instance (occurence) of the symbol (which has been created and named in Flash) You would nest that instance into a MovieClip exported for actionscript, if it isn't already.
