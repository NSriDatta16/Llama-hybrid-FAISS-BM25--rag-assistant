A toolbox can be a cage. If you are doing something new it can be instructive to write it without the toolbox the first time. The points in the 512 (or whatever) dimensional space might be able to be mapped to any subset of it. Without knowing something about the data, it could throw away all but 1/512th of the information to map to a 2d space. So not all spaces are created equal. Some are planes oriented with the axes (stunningly convenient but equally rare) but others are surfaces of spheres, or follow differential equations. Some may have projections to 2d surfaces for which we currently have no formalism, but future developments open them up to approach. If you do not have a clean way to do the projection, you are going to have to throw away information. The quick way, as @ttnphns suggested, to determine if you have plane-ish clouds of data, and throw away the non-informative dimensions perpendicular to those planes, is PCA (principle component analysis).
