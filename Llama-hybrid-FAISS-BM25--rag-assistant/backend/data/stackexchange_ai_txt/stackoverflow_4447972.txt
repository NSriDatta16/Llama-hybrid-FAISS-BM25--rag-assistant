In my own question thread how to calculate shortest 2D distance between a point and a line segment in all cases in C, C# / .NET 2.0 or Java? I was asked to put a C# answer here when I find one: so here it is, modified from http://www.topcoder.com/tc?d1=tutorials&d2=geometry1&module=Static : //Compute the dot product AB . BC private double DotProduct(double[] pointA, double[] pointB, double[] pointC) { double[] AB = new double[2]; double[] BC = new double[2]; AB[0] = pointB[0] - pointA[0]; AB[1] = pointB[1] - pointA[1]; BC[0] = pointC[0] - pointB[0]; BC[1] = pointC[1] - pointB[1]; double dot = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]; return dot; } //Compute the cross product AB x AC private double CrossProduct(double[] pointA, double[] pointB, double[] pointC) { double[] AB = new double[2]; double[] AC = new double[2]; AB[0] = pointB[0] - pointA[0]; AB[1] = pointB[1] - pointA[1]; AC[0] = pointC[0] - pointA[0]; AC[1] = pointC[1] - pointA[1]; double cross = AB[0] * AC[1] - AB[1] * AC[0]; return cross; } //Compute the distance from A to B double Distance(double[] pointA, double[] pointB) { double d1 = pointA[0] - pointB[0]; double d2 = pointA[1] - pointB[1]; return Math.Sqrt(d1 * d1 + d2 * d2); } //Compute the distance from AB to C //if isSegment is true, AB is a segment, not a line. double LineToPointDistance2D(double[] pointA, double[] pointB, double[] pointC, bool isSegment) { double dist = CrossProduct(pointA, pointB, pointC) / Distance(pointA, pointB); if (isSegment) { double dot1 = DotProduct(pointA, pointB, pointC); if (dot1 > 0) return Distance(pointB, pointC); double dot2 = DotProduct(pointB, pointA, pointC); if (dot2 > 0) return Distance(pointA, pointC); } return Math.Abs(dist); } I'm @SO not to answer but ask questions so I hope I don't get million down votes for some reasons but constructing critic. I just wanted (and was encouraged) to share somebody else's ideas since the solutions in this thread are either with some exotic language (Fortran, Mathematica) or tagged as faulty by somebody. The only useful one (by Grumdrig) for me is written with C++ and nobody tagged it faulty. But it's missing the methods (dot etc.) that are called.
