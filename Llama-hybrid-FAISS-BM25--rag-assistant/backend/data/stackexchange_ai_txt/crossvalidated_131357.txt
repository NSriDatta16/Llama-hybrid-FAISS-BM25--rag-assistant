Dimensionality reduction technique similar to LDA when class labels are probabilistic

Given discrete class labels, say True and False, LDA (linear discriminant analysis) can be used to perform discriminant dimensionality reduction and attempt to find a subspace that best separates the two classes. What if we are given, instead of the labels themselves, confidences of the labels? i.e. [0.2, 0.7, 0.3, 0.9, 0.1] instead of [F, T, F, T, F]. Is there a dimensionality reduction technique that works with this kind of data?
