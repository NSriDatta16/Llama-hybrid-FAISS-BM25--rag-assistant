You can actually do this pretty simply using both WinForms and ASP.NET. On your server, you create a web service with a single method that returns true . For your clients, you write a winforms application (something that sits in the tray would be ideal) that polls the web service every 5 or 10 seconds (or whatever interval you want) with a timeout of a few seconds less. If the web service call returns without throwing a timeout exception, then you know you're connected. If it times out, you know you're not connected (and you could, for example, show a little light that's green when connected and red when not connected). Note that you would not actually be measuring the WIFI availability (or its signal strength) in any way, but this is probably not something your field agents really care about anyway. They probably just want to know if they can connect or not.
