Pass Querystring parameter from SharePoint to Java Applet webpart

I have a SharePoint webpart page, with a parameter in the page Querystring (in the URL), and I also have a Page Viewer webpart (which effectively IFRAME's the specified webpage), which shows a Java applet. Is there any way I can get the parameter in the SharePoint Querystring to be recieved by the Java Applet ? The reason for doing a Java applet in a webpart is to allow a file to be dragged and dropped onto the Java applet, and the parameter shows where the file would be saved in the SharePoint Document Centre. I'd appreciate any and all suggestions. Cheers Nick Notes: The Querystring in the sharepoint page cannot be read by the Java Applet directly, due to the 'walls' setup around the Page Viewer webpart. I've tried creating a cookie when the SharePoint page is loaded, then reading the cookie when the Java applet is loaded (upon recieving the file, so it's not a timing thing), but it can't access the cookie (different domains ?)
