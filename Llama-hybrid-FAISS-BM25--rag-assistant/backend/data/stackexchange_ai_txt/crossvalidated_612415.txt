Distribution families whose likelihoods integrate to $+\infty$ for some sample values

I've recently started learning about Bayesian statistics, and I came across this very nice answer by Xi'an https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/129908/268693 , which [in my slight paraphrasing] says the following: Given a family of distributions $\{f(\cdot|\theta): \theta \in \Theta \}$ defined on a sample space $\mathcal{X}$ , and a prior distribution $\pi$ , we require that $$ \int_{\Theta} f(x|\theta) \pi(\theta) \,d\theta otherwise, we do not obtain a valid prior distribution $\pi(\theta)$ , and so Bayesian inference is not possible. This leads me to the following question: What are some families of distributions $\{f(\cdot|\theta): \theta \in \Theta \}$ that one might encounter in practice for which there exists a set $E \subset \mathcal{X}$ of positive measure such that $$ \int_{\Theta} f(x|\theta) \,d\theta = + \infty \quad \text{ for all } x \in E? $$ In other words, I'm curious if there is a family of distributions for which a uniform prior leads to an "improper posterior" such that the problem cannot be remedied by re-defining the $f(\cdot|\theta)$ 's on a set of measure zero. Here are a couple of examples I came up with: The Cauchy distribution: $f(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{\theta \pi [1 + (x/\theta)^2 ]}, \; x > 0, \; \theta > 0$ . In this case, $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x|\theta) \,d\theta = + \infty$ for all $x > 0$ . A rather contrived example: For each $\theta \in \Theta := (1,\infty)$ , let $f(x|\theta) := \frac{1}{\theta^x}$ for each $x \in \mathcal{X} := (0,\infty)$ . Then $$ \int_{\Theta} f(x|\theta) \,d\theta := \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x-1} & \text{ if } x > 1 \\ \infty & \text{ if } 0 (Would $f(x|\theta) = 1/\theta^x$ ever be used in practice?) Are there any other such examples? I am especially interested in examples such as last one, where the set $\{x \in \mathcal{X}: \int_{\Theta} f(x|\theta) \,d\theta = + \infty \}$ has positive and finite measure.
