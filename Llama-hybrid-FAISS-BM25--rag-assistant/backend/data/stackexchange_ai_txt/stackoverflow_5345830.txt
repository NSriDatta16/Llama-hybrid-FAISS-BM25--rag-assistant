The @ suppresses errors. This is generally discouraged, as when developing you want to see errors. Errors are easy to suppress when moving to a production environment with the display_errors setting to off . So yea, in most cases, there really is no need for the error to be suppressed. EDIT As an extra tidbit to "improve" that, what I used to do when dynamically including a file, is have an array which acts as a "white list" of valid requests. This does not "have" to be an array , just what I chose to do an example with. $whiteList = array('filename1', 'index', 'home', 'about'); if (in_array($filename, $whiteList)) { include($filename); }else { include('page/404.php'); } This would do a few things, 1 make you not need the error suppressor. Two, it would make it a bit more securer, as without this, you would need to do a basename call to filter the text to prevent certain type of include injections etc. (Not knowing if you did this already, just extra information). So yea, you may want analyze / look at other ways to achieve this and above is just one method :)
