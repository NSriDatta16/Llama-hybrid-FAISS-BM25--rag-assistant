How much data do I need? It depends (this is a popular answer in data science). If I recall correctly, you need upwards of 400 observations to estimate the intercept of a logistic regression to within a margin of error of 0.1. That should serve as a baseline. Any less than this, and the baseline for a very simple model may have a margin of error too big to accept. How should I choose the target data for the classification model? It depends (surprise!). Data From a year ago may be OK depending on the context. But it all depends on the context. How do you choose the data and what size of data set do you start? If all goes well, I do not choose the data. Rather, I select some time frame over which to collect data and that just happens to be the sample, be it balanced or imbalanced. The size of the data may depend on a power calculation, but again it depends on how the study was conducted and if I had control over data collection or not.
