Due to the no-free-lunch theorem, we can't say for sure which approach is superior (there's always a possible dataset where our approach of choice is not optimal). However, logistic regression is a linear learning algorithm that maximizes directly the Bernoulli likelihood. Bar considerations regarding bias and variance, maximizing the likelihood of choice if it matches the problem is a good idea, compared with, e.g. decision trees, where this notion of probability in terminal leafs is more ad-hoc than likelihood-based (the posterior probability is not optimized directly). Other methods, however, also do that, e.g. neural networks with sigmoid activation in the output layer and cross-entropy loss.
