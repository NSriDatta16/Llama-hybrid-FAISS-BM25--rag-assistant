Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but isn't the whole point of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to avoid Access Control Lists (ACLs)? RBAC differs from access control lists (ACLs) (...) in that it assigns permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low-level data objects. For example, an access control list could be used to grant or deny write access to a particular system file, but it would not say in what ways that file could be changed. In an RBAC-based system, an operation might be to create a 'credit account' transaction in a financial application (...). The assignment of permission to perform a particular operation is meaningful because the operations are fine-grained and themselves have meaning within the application. (Quote: Wikipedia ) I don't know the specifics on Zend_ACL or the other implementations mentioned, but if they are ACL-based, I would not recommend using them for role-based authorization.
