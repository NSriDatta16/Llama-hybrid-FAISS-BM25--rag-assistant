I ran the aformentioned sunspider javascript benchmark on FF3 and Chrome and got over a 2x speed increase moving from FF3 to Chrome (on a Vista 64 system - Core 2 duo 6600 2.4GHz, 2GB RAM). The links above show you my results - I'm very interested to see what, if any, difference the underlying OS makes. That being said, I agree with Google that Javascript is becoming more and more important, and that the other browser makers should spend some time on optimizing it. I love being able to drag and drop tabs - that's something I've needed for over 2 years now... -Adam
