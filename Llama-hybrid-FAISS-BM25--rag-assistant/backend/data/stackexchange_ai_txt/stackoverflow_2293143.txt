python script for robust multi-array average on microarray data

I have tried google with no luck. I have seen some weak references to robust multi-array averaging done with python but no code. I am not so interested in reinventing the wheel. Any suggestions on a python module, script .... If I could find a nice explanation or example of the algorithm I would write a python implementation to share. If you are not sure what I am talking about you could look at this although this is not the definition. http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/bioinfo/ref/gcrma.html
