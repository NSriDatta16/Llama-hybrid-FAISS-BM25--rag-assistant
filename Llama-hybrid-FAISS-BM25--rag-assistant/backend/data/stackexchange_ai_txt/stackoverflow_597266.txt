Higher level languages are meant to abstract us from the lower-level architecture of the system we're working on. While this doesn't mean that architectural information should be ignored, it does mean that the value of this information is diminished. Architecture specific knowledge can indeed help you to leverage the system in different ways, but usually these ways include bypassing the abstractions our high level languages provide for us. Whether this is a good thing or not I leave to you.
