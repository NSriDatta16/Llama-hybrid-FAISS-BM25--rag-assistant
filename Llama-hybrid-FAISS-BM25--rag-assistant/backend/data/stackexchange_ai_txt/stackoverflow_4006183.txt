Magento - Passing data between a controller and a block

Really quick and simple question but I can't find a decent answer to this - What is the best way to pass data from a controller to a block in Magento. Incase it makes a difference, I am loading the layout as follows: $this->loadLayout(array('default', 'myModule_default')); $this->_initLayoutMessages('customer/session') ->_initLayoutMessages('catalog/session') ->renderLayout(); I should add, that I have been using the registry as follows: In the controller: Mage::register('data', $data); In the block: $data = Mage::registry('data'); Not sure if this is the best way to do it though.
