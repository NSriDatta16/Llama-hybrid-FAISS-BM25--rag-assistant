Linear regression is a model that can predict values in unrestricted domain, from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ . If you want a regression model to predict probabilities, then the to-go model is logistic regression that restricts the outputs to $[0, 1]$ range. For more details see other questions tagged as logistic-regression , for example the What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression? thread.
