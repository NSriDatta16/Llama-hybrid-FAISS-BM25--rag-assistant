Seeding the random number generator is imperative for a system like load runner. Perfect example - I have a code change I want to test. I seed the random number generator and then run with and without the changed code. The sequence of functions executed will be random, but both tests will use the same sequence. This allows me to see the exact impact of my code change. Without the ability to see the random number generator, I would have to run very long tests under very high load to try to average out the randomness. Without the seed, the 2nd test would choose a completely different path. And on another iteration, yet another completely different path. I want RANDOM sequences, but REPEATABLE RANDOM sequences. This is why all modern languages allow you to seed a random number generator. The Load Runner client just needs to add a single text field that allows you to enter the "seed value" for their random number generator.
