Which machine learning algorithm should I use?

I have one dependent binary categorical variable, and one independent continuous variable. There is a lot of randomness deciding the result of the dependent variable. The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is linear. I have 2,000 data points to train data on. Some possibilities are: Logistic regression - simplest option SVM (support vector machines) Naive bayes Random forests - I see this does well on kaggle, but I have a simple one variable linear relationship, so it seems random trees isn't necessary here.
