Train data selection for model comparison

Let I have data to compare two models. My first model wil be based on Arificial Neural Network(ANN) My second model will based on linear regression(LR) For the ANN, I have to divide data into 3 parts: Train data Validation data Test data For LR, I have to divide data into 2 parts(since I dont need Validation data): Train data Test data And finaly I will compare performance two models using test data. But, I am confused how should I select Train data for LR. I mean for LR, should be same train data of ANN. Or should it consist of both Validation data of ANN and train data of ANN. Thanks a lot.
