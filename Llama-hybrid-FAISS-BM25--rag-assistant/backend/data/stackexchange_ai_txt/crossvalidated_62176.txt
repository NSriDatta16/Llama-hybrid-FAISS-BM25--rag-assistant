Can SVM be used for dimensionality reduction from n dimensions to n-1?

Consider a case when I have data that has $n$ dimensions and I want to transform this data into $n-1$ dimensions. For this problem in PCA we project all data points to a $n-1$ dimension plane preserving the variance. If I draw a hyperplane using SVM (that will be a $n-1$ dimension plane) and project all data points to that plane, how will it differ from the PCA plane?
