If I'm following your process, you're using the "Add Service Reference" option through your project in Visual Studio. By default, the 3.5 apps want to leverage the newer WCF framework, which doesn't use the older web service architecture found in your ASMX style pages. However, you can still add the older services, it just takes a little more work. When this dialog opens up, there should be a button at the bottom at the page that says "Add Web Reference." Click this button and it should expose the "legacy" methods that are available.
