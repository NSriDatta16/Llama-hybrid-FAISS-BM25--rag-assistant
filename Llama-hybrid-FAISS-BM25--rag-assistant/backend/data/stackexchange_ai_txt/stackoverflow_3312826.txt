I vote for throwing a checked exception here. Generally I dislike checked exceptions but it seems like a reasonable thing to do in this case. The case where the value is not present will need to be handled separately from the case where the value is present, using an exception would make that clear. Actually your idea to add a keyExists method is the best of the ideas you list, because it doesn't rely on the user knowing to look for a special value. If you go that way then you could throw an exception as a backup plan in case the map contents change between the call to keyExists and the retrieval.
