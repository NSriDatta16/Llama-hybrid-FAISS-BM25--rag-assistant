C# Drag and Drop between 2 Different Controls

We have a ListView control which triggers the DoDragDrop method. We have another control which is a TreeView control which has a DragDrop method. The problem is that the DragDrop method's sender parameter is not the ListView, despite the fact that the ListView initiated the DoDragDrop method. Instead, the sender is the TreeView itself. Any ideas why the sender is incorrect?
