You need to copy more than just the public key - you need the private key. In ssh, you place the public on the server side but the client side needs to have the private key. You want to copy over the id_dsa file (not id_dsa.pub) to your USB key (make sure it's protected with a passphrase, in case it gets lost!). You can then use that key to login to home_machine from any machine that has access to the key: ssh -i /path/to/id_dsa user@home_machine (it looks like you might already have a different private key on office_machine, judging by what you pasted - You might look into using ssh-agent ) Also, check /var/log/secure to see why your sshd might be rejecting key authentication (it's often an issue of permissions on the .ssh directory and its ancestors).
