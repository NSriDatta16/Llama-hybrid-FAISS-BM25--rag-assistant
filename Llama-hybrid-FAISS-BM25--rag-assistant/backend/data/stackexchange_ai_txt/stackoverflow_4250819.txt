Do supporting assemblies need to be registered in the GAC?

I recently had to register an assembly in my GAC for a custom sharepoint job I wrote. Once installed it began throwing an error saying that it could not load an assembly "or one of its dependencies". Do I need to register any of the supporting assemblies (System.Collections for instance) in the GAC in order to get my main assembly recognized?
