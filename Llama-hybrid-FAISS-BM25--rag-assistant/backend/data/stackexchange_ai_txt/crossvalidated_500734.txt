The restrictions on marginals implies some restriction on the joint, namely $$\sum_z p_\theta(x, z) = \sum_z p_\alpha(x, z)$$ This is exactly one degrees of freedom, meaning that if you fix the all $n$ components of $p_\theta(x, z) $ , then you are at liberty to choose $n-1$ element for $p_\alpha(x, z) $ anyway you want, with the last degree of freedom fixed by $$p_\alpha(x, z_n) = \sum_z p_\theta(x, z) - \sum_{z\neq z_n} p_\alpha(x, z)$$ . This might be a small constraint or a relatively large one when the support in the $z$ dimension is a small set, think n=3 or n=2!
