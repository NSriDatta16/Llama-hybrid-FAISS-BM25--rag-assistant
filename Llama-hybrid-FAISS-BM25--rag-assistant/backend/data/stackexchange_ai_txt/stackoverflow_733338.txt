Problem using SQL Agent to run SSIS Packages - fails with "DTSER_FAILURE(1)"

I have an SSIS Package stored in the MSDB database which works fine when I execute it. It will run under SA account or will use Windows security. I want to schedule this job to run with SQL Agent, but when I do I get a strange error and whatever configuration I try it fails with the following error: Executed as user: SERVER\SYSTEM. on returned DTSER_FAILURE (1). Started: 09:25:03 Finished: 09:25:04 Elapsed: 0.61 seconds. The package execution failed. The step failed. The SSIS package itself is reading and writing data to a remote server, but I don't think that it gets that far during the package execution. Any ideas?
