How to match words with common prefix in PHP?

I need to write a regex to match the word. To find exact word can be done using /\bword\b/ pattern. But I want the pattern to find word , words , wording and so on. for example i want to write a pattern to find terms account , accounting , accounts and accountant in a paragraph string.
