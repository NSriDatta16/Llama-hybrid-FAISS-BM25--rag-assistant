What's the tractable data size for Sparse PCA or LASSO?

I'm up to perform certain kinds of sparse decomposition methods on my dataset. However, I'm not sure: what's the tractable data size for the Sparse Decomposition methods? The dataset is a $10^3\times10^5$ binary matrix, and the expected methods are Sparse PCA, which aims to find a decomposition with minimized coordinate L1-norm and positive constraint. I found these things useful: penalized package for R language. nsprcomp pacakge for R
