Storage issues in cloud when creating multiple instances

In a cloud hosting environment (amazon, rackspace,) you can create multiple instances. Let's say I have a database server (mysql,) and other persistent data. If I create more instances, what happens to the data ? Ex. 1 Instance -> user table (in a db) I make another 3 instances 4 Instances -> each one has it's one user table Errors: if someone adds data to the table on instance 3 how does instance nr 4 see it ? If I merge the instances back to one, which instance data does it keep ? Thank you
