Drag and Drop outlook attachment in to Adobe AIR

I would like to know if there is a way to drag and drop an attachment file from an outlook email that is open into an AIR application and for that file to be then accessible to the AIR application. When I experimented with this the drag operation is giving AIR a File Promise List. But I'm not exactly sure how to make use of it once it is dropped. All the examples out there explain how to manupilate File Promises from an AIR application to the desktop. Nothing that explains a file promise into an AIR app. Any help is much appreciated.
