Android - WebViewClient loads pages extremely slowly

As a developer, I have had pretty bad experiences when it comes to building apps (with web pages) that run on the Android webviewclient on 3G connection. A few of my users are saying that some pages take up to 10 minutes to load. (I don't know if they have exaggerated because they are frustrated.) Personally, I use HTC Desire running Android 2.2 and have tested my apps with my own phone. Indeed, even for apps that use locally stored web pages to make AJAX requests, it is extremely slow on 3G. Most of the time, it will just timeout and show up a blank page. When it's on WIFI, it works fine and is real fast. I have heard many say that the native browser on Android 2.2 is extremely fast. For me, I must however say that the native browser app is also very slow on 3G. Sometimes, the Google mobile home page does not even finish loading. I'm in Singapore and so 3G coverage should be fine in most places. Is it the device hardware that is causing the problem?
