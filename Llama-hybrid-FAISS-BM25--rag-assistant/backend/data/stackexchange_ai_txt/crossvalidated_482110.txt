Various ways to estimate Kaplan-Meier (KM) confidence intervals (CI) in difficult situations like this--before the first event time, with heavy censoring, or at late times when few are still at risk--have been discussed by Fay et al. , "Pointwise confidence intervals for a survival distribution with small samples or heavy censoring," Biostatistics (2013), vol. 14, no. 4, pp. 723â€“736. Such estimates are possible with some CI methods, they just aren't provided by the default method in the survival package. For example, in the absence of censoring the binomial Clopper-Pearson exact interval for observing no events out of the total number of events, essentially as described in the question and in another answer, could be used. With censoring, as frequently occurs in survival analysis, things become more complicated. Fay et al. compare 10 KM CI methods against the "beta product confidence procedure (BPCP)" method they propose. BPCP is based on quantiles of a product of beta random variables that is defined in terms of the numbers at risk at each event time up to the survival time of interest. They show that their method provides correct CI coverage for the above types of difficult situations, under some assumptions. They argue for its superiority over other methods if censoring times are simply independent of failure times, and (in a supplement) document its asymptotic equivalence to the Nelson-Aalen and Greenwood CI estimates. There is an implementation in the R bpcp package . This implementation includes some extensions made since the paper cited above, including two-sample comparisons and handling of discrete-time data.
