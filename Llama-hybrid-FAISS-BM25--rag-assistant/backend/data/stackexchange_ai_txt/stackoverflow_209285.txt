Your question is a little abstract, but nested sets (scroll down, might be a little too mysql-specific) might be an option for you. It's extremely fast for read operations, though any modifications are quite complex (and have to modify half the tree on average). That requires the ability to modify your data structure, though. And I guess if you can modify the structure, you could just as well add references to child objects. If you can't modify the structure, I doubt there's anything faster than your ideas.
