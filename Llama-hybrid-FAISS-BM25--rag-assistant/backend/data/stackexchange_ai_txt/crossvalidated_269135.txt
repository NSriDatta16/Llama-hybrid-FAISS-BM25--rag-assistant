Why are my random forest results so variable?

I'm trying to test random forest's ability to classify samples between 2 groups; There are 54 samples and varying numbers of variables used for classification. I was wondering why the out-of-bag (OOB) estimates can vary as much as 5% from one another even when I'm using 50k trees? Is this something that bootstrapping could help with?
