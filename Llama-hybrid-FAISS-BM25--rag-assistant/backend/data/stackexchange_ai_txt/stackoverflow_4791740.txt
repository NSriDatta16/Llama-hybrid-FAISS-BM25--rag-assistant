You've run into a limitation of the S3 API, and the only way to do this is to do the filtering on the client. The best (and most performant) option would be to 'mirror' your S3 storage structure in a database/xml file etc. and do you querying against that instead. Then just retrieve the files from S3 when the user has found the files they want.
