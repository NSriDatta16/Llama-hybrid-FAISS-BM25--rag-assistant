Magento multiple stores, same installation, 3 checkout, 3 domains, 1 hosting: how to install SSL?

I have read about everything about this situation and had very different recommendations and read many differents scenarios from 2007 to 2010. But nothing exactly like my case even here on stackoverflow, so I'm here to ask the real experts. Considering this: website1.com - hosting: simplehelix - domain name: simplehelix - main magento installation (1.3.2.4) - SSL installed - paypal PRO (credit card taken directly on this site) website2.com - hosting: none - domain name: goddady - DNS/nameserver: to simplehelix servers - folder called /website2/ that loads magento - paypal PRO (credit card taken directly on this site) website3.com - hosting: geohost - domain name: geohost - DNS/nameserver: to simplehelix servers - folder called /website3/ that loads magento - paypal PRO (credit card taken directly on this site) All 3 sites share most of the same products (80%) because they are 3 real physical businesses from the same owner having mostly the same products. They use one Magento admin for products, categories, customers, sales. QUESTION: Now, in 2011, I'd like to know exactly what is the simplest, easiest, fastest way to have SSL on website2 and website3 so that all our transactions are secured? Can I just buy SSL on godaddy and geohost and install it there on the domain names and it will work even if the DNS is pointing to simplehelix? Do i have to reinstall magento on 2 new hosting plans + ssl and not be able to share same database? Note: - we do not want to share carts - we want people to stay on the respective websites - we want to use paypal pro - keep cost down - please be clear on your steps/description, as this might help many other people more/less technical Thank you for your help Joel
