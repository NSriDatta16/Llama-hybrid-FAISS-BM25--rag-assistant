I don't believe there is a way to know programatically if you compass sensor is calibrated correctly unless you use a secondary data source like GPS. If you can use GPS then when the user is moving you can compare the GPS movement with the compass heading and correct. Remember that local magnetic fields can screw up the compass readings and the devices has no idea if you are out in the middle of a forest or next to a transformer. With these micro devices there is always a bit of skew you'll have to deal with. If you check the values for the accelerometer as well you'll see that at rest they aren't always returning 9.8 m/s^2 (or at least consistently between devices). In your help you may just need to tell the user to rotate/twist their phone in a figure eight to reset the compass.
