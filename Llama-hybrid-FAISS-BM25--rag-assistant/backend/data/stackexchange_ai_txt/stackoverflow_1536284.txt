Yes, that would be slow, even with a StringBuilder . My question is: why are you trying to create a string 46 exabytes in size? At some point, a more conventional external-storage (i.e., on-disk) method becomes a good idea but you seem to have passed even that point (based on the disk arrays in common use today). I don't generally have this problem since I tend not to use strings for storing such huge things. String are generally meant for somewhat smaller objects. What you have there is a sizable data warehouse, not a name or address field :-)
