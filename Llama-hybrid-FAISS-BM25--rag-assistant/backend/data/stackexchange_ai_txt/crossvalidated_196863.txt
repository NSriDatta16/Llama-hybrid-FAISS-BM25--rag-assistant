SVM machine learning - How to define the target in the training set?

I am working on a project where I have to implement SVM machine learning algorithm. I am trying to predict the forearm movement intention. I am using accelometer (attached to my forearm) for measuring the angle change for x,y,z axes. I have never used machine before. The problem I am having is I do not exactly know how to structure the training set. I know the angle changes for each of the axis and I know i.e if x=45 degrees, y = 65 degrees, z=30 degrees gesture performed i performed is flexion. I would like to implement 3 gestures.So the data I am having is : x y z Target 20 60 90 flexion 100 63 23 internal rotation 89 23 74 twist . . . . I have a file with around 2000 entries. I know I have to normalize the training set so the data are scaled. I would like to scale it so they are in this range [0.9, 0.1]. The problem I am having is I do not know how to represent the target in my training set. Can I just use random numbers as 1 for flexion, 2 for internal rotation, 3 for twist?? Also once the training is completed can I do the predictions based on values for x,y,z only?? without having to supply the target value. Is my understanding correct?? Many thanks
