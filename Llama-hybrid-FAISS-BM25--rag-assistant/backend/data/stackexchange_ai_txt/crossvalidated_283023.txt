(1) The Chow test is for a change in the coefficients of a regression model at a known time. If you don't know at which point in time the (hypothesized) structural change occurs, don't use a Chow test. A natural alternative is to use Andrew's sup$F$ test which formalizes your approach (conducting the Chow test for all possible timings) but appropriately adjusts the corresponding $p$-values. It rejects if the maximum of the $F$ (or Chow) statistics becomes to large. See vignette("strucchange-intro", package = "strucchange") for worked examples and more references. Also, citation("strucchange") gives you more pointers. (2) The model Prize ~ Trend is surely not appropriate for your data. This would suggest that it is stationary around a deterministic linear trend. Even if you allow for structural breaks and relax it to a piecewise linear trend, you won't find a good model for the Prize time series. Probably it would make more sense to model the returns rather than the levels of this time series. But more context would be required for a better recommendation. I suggest you talk to your advisor and ask for more guidance and suitable references.
