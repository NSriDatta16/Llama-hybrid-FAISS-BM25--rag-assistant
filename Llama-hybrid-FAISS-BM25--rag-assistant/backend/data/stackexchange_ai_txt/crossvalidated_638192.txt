How to compute the correlations of extra features with respect to the principal components

I have a dataset with 4 features and n observations. I have done a Principal Components Analysis using only 3 features. Now I need to find the correlation between the extra feature and the principal components that I already have. How can I do this? I'm more interested in the mathematical explanation than in the python code. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn import datasets # load iris dataset iris = datasets.load_iris(as_frame=True) # Select the first 3 features data = iris.data.iloc[:, 0:3] scaler = StandardScaler().fit(data) normalized_data = scaler.transform(data) y = iris.target # apply PCA pca = PCA() pca_transformed = pca.fit_transform(normalized_data) ```
