O(1) lookup in non-contiguous memory?

Is there any known data structure that provides O(1) random access, without using a contiguous block of memory of size O(N) or greater? This was inspired by this answer and is being asked for curiosity's sake rather than for any specific practical use case, though it might hypothetically be useful in cases of a severely fragmented heap.
