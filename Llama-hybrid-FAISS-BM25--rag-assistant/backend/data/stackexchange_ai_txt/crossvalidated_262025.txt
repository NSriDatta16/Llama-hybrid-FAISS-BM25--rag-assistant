Why does a variational auto-encoder (VAE) have a random component?

I recently worked on Variational(VAE) Autoencoder. For me, Autoencoder works like this: In the loss function, we have a reconstruction error term which allows us to minimize the distance between input and output. a regularization term which allows us to match the latent variables(z1,z2) to a unit gaussian distribution. But does someone know why do we introduce the random effect? To match a gaussian distribution, why not just use a gaussian likehood as a regularization term of loss function? The answer might be from a bayes prospective of VAE autoencoder? Even a small hint might be of great help, thanks!
