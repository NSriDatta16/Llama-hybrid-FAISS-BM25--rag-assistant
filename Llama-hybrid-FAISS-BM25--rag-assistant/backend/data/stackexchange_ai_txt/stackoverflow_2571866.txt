Java XML Output - proper indenting for child items

I'd like to serialize some simple data model into xml, I've been using the standard java.org.w3c -related code (see below), the indentation is better than no "OutputKeys.INDENT", yet there is one little thing that remains - proper indentation for child elements. I know that this has been asked before on stackoverflow , yet that configuration did not work for me, this is the code I'm using : DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder(); Document doc = builder.newDocument(); doc = addItemsToDocument(doc); // The addItemsToDocument method adds childElements to the document. TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); transformerFactory.setAttribute("indent-number", new Integer(4)); // switching to setAttribute("indent-number", 4); doesn't help Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, "xml"); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(outFile); // outFile is a regular File outFile = new File("some/path/foo.xml"); transformer.transform(source, result); The output produced is : Whereas I would want it (for more clarity) like : I was just wondering if there is a way of doing this, make it properly indented for the child elements. Thank you in advance ! Happy Easter coding :-) !
