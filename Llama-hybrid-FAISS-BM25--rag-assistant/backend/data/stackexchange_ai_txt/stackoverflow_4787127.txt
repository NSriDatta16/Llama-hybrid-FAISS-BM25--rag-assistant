I guess the key question is whether the additional information you store would be of sufficient value to be worth the trouble. If you build it, will they come? I've seen lots of systems where someone went to a lot of work without bothering to ask, Will anyone care? I don't know what your users want or need, so without a lot more information I can't answer the question for you. Update In reply to your comment: I have stored information about files in a database when there were relationships that I needed to keep track of. The first example that comes to mind is a web app for tracking suggested design changes to equipment our organization produced, where users could add attachments (Word docs with more detail, engineering drawings, whatever) to their recommendations that would be uploaded and associated with the record for the design change. So we tossed all these files in a directory somewhere, and then in the database had a record for each attachment that tied it back to the design change record. I forget now if there was any data in there besides the key of the design change record and the file name, but there certainly could have been things like when uploaded, by whom, etc.
