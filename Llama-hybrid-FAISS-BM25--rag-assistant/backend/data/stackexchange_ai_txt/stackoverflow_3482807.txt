Mysql start fails with Operating System error 13

I have XAMPP on my Ubuntu Lucid system and everything worked fine. But there seems to be some problem now and mysql wouldn't start. I had tried to recover a few Drupal databases and hence copied the raw files to /opt/lampp/var/mysql folder like all other database folders. And, I guess that could have caused the problem. I am pasting the last few lines of the error log. Someone please help me out. 100814 15:08:29 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /opt/lampp/var/mysql/jitendra-laptop.pid ended 100814 15:17:47 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /opt/lampp/var/mysql 100814 15:17:47 [Note] Plugin 'FEDERATED' is disabled. 100814 15:17:47 [ERROR] Can't open shared library 'libpbxt.so' (errno: 0 API version for STORAGE ENGINE plugin is too different) 100814 15:17:47 [Warning] Couldn't load plugin named 'PBXT' with soname 'libpbxt.so'. 100814 15:17:48 InnoDB: Operating system error number 13 in a file operation.
