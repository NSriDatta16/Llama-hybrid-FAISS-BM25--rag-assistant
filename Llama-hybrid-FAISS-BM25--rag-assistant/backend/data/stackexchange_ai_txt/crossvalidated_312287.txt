Prediction after PCA and K-Means

I have a data set with a large amount of features. I'm applying PCA on it in order to run it through K-means, to discover clusters in my data set. I'd like to know what is the best practice to make predictions on new data points (with many features) on my clusters (which are defined using only two PCs). Thanks!
