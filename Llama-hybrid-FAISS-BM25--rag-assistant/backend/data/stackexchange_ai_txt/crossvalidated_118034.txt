Mixed logistic ridge regression

I would like to build a logistic regression model in which I will be looking for predictor variables having a significant effect on the breeding success of a raptor bird. The predictors in the dataset are highly correlated, which led me to consider logistic ridge regression. Furthermore, I investigated different breeding grounds in which one or multiple birds have been breeding. Since this makes the data clustered, I would need to add the breeding ground as a random effect in the model. Thus, I would need a 'mixed logistic ridge regression' approach if I am getting things right here. This paper suggests this approach too for another problem: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22049265 Are there any people aware of the availability of an R package or something related having implemented a mixed logistic ridge regression approach as the paper and myself just described? I did not succeed in finding one. Thank you.
