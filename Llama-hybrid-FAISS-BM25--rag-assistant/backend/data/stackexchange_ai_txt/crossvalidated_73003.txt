I say you are right. You should use OLS regression here, not logistic regression. The question of causality is a red herring. Causality is not required for either linear regression or logistic regression, and it is fine to model a cause as a (e.g., linear) function of an effect. In fact, there are predictive models that do so. As an example, researchers studying the collapse of the Mayan civilization have hypothesized that drought may have initiated its decline. Predictive models have been built that allow researchers to make an educated guess about rainfall levels (i.e., causes) from traces that remain (i.e., effects; e.g., analyses of core samples from lake beds), to clarify this possibility. Which variable should be made the response variable, and which the explanatory variable should be decided based on the question you want to answer. It is clear from your setup that you are wondering about possible differences in the level of $X$ given the disease state. Thus, $X$ should be the response variable, and disease state should be the explanatory variable.
