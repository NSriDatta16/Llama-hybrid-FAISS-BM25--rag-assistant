Serialization , which is not specific to .NET, is the process of converting an in-memory object into some form of bits and bytes that are suitable for transmission (e.g. over the internet) or storage (e.g. on disk). The complement to serialization is deserialization which takes the serialized data and reconstitutes the original object representation.
