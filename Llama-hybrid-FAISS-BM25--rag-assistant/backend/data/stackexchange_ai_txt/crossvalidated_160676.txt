I notice your response variable is expenditure . I'm guessing from your plots that you don't have any Y data that are negative, and it seems that you have lots of 0's. That all seems consistent with my conception of expenditure. It is not consistent with using a normal (OLS) linear regression model. You may want to switch to using a generalized linear model with a Gamma response. If that doesn't work, or is too complicated, you could use ordinal logistic regression, which is fine as long as you can assume the response is at least ordinal. Regarding the transformations, the fact that you transform one variable does not mean you have to transform any others. (For more on why you might transform variables, see this excellent CV thread: In linear regression, when is it appropriate to use the log of an independent variable instead of the actual values? ) There is no reason to transform the indicators for categorical variables. For a continuous response and explanatory variables, a log transformation may help achieve linearity and normality of residuals, but it is important to bear in mind that it also changes the meaning of your beta estimates. (For more detail on that, see this excellent CV thread: Interpretation of log transformed predictor .)
