As mentioned, Use R, not excel. My understanding of this process you are asking for. Say you have a data set with a linear trend. Let's assume that trend to be Y = 3t+1, also assume you have 15 data points. Use that model and find the residuals from that. Fit your time series model to these residuals. To forecast, use the 'predict' function in R. Get the next point. Let's assume the model tells you the next error will be -2. (If you wanted to predict the next point, this would be the 16th data point.) Take Y= 3*16+1 = 49,,, and now add in the -2 from the time series prediction. Your forecast is now :49+(-2) = 47.
