Yes thats hardly it. I tried that approch model=Model([A,B,C],[FakeA,B,C]) , as you said, it also works, but like you also mentioned, model_A isnt going to be updated. I tried something else in the past 2 days. Wrapping [FakeA,B,C] in a custom lambda-layer, to calculate combined loss (one value output of that custom layer). Than passing this loss, in a dummy custom loss-function, which just outputs the combined value of the lambda layer. Here is an example: # import A,B,C and than pass A into Generator .... and after that: combined_loss= Lambda(lambda x: combined_loss_func(x))([FakeA,B,C]) model=Model([A,B,C],[combined_loss],loss=dummy_loss) def dummy_loss(y_pred,y_true): return y_pred combined_loss could look like that: def combined_loss_func(x): FakeA,B,C=x[0],x[1],x[2] # transform all inputs into one row-tensors shape=tf.shape(FakeA) FakeA=tf.reshape(FakeA,[1,shape[0]*shape[1]*shape[2]*shape[3]]) shape=tf.shape(B) B=tf.reshape(B,[1,shape[0]*shape[1]*shape[2]*shape[3]]) shape=tf.shape(C) C=tf.reshape(C,[1,shape[0]*shape[1]*shape[2]*shape[3]]) # build up a hypothetical ground truth FakeA_ones=tf.ones_like(FakeA) A_ones=tf.ones_like(A) B_ones=tf.ones_like(B) # calculate losses loss0=keras.losses.mse(FakeA,FakeA_ones) loss1=keras.losses.mse(A,A_ones) loss2=keras.losses.mse(B,B_ones) # sum them up summe=tf.math.add(loss0,loss1) summe=tf.math.add(summe,loss2) # average them avg=tf.math.truediv(summe,3.0) avg=tf.expand_dims(summe,axis=-1) return avg If i now try, to set the FakeA loss to zero, now no backpropagation to modelA happens anymore, or at least nothing in the system changes anymore: # calculate losses loss0=keras.losses.mse(FakeA,FakeA_ones) * 0 loss1=keras.losses.mse(A,A_ones) loss2=keras.losses.mse(B,B_ones) First it seemes really good, but when i go now into the custom-function, and not use FakeA , which is the one and only tensor which passed through the generator. Than i stil get a value for my loss function, which seems to be rigth, but actually nothing is happening, my cycle Gan isnt improving at all, and all images passed though stil look the same, even after 100 epochs. Any ideas ? Thank you for your reply @Andrea Ilona
