On the predictive distribution regarding Bayesian methods for pattern recognition

I am following Pattern recognition and machine learning by Byshop and I was trying to derive myself the predictive distribution resulting from a new data point. For the sake of clarity I post the piece of text in question: where $w$ are the parameters of the model treated as a random variable since we are in the Bayesian setting. Anyhow I was trying to derive this myself and what I would do is $$p(t|x, \textbf{x}, \textbf{t}) = \int p(t|x, \textbf{x}, \textbf{t},w) dw = \int \frac{p(t,x, \textbf{x}, \textbf{t},w)}{p(x, \textbf{x}, \textbf{t},w)} dw = \dots$$ And then I am unsure how to proceed. How could this be done? EDIT: I was trying to apply Bayes rule with multiple conditions as shown here but to no avail.
