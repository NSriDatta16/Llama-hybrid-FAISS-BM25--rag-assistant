If you are not recieving a 503 error when navigating to the URL in your browser, but do recieve it when requesting the resource when using HttpWebRequest, the first thing I would recommend is that you specify a value for the UserAgent when making the request. You may also want to use Fiddler2 or another tool to get a better idea of what is happening during the lifetime of the request. It is hard to provide guidance without knowing more about the details of the service you are posting messages to.
