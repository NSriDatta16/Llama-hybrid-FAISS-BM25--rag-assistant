Remote debugging using Eclipse - How to set breakpoints?

I asked this question about how to debug server side applications and I think I was looking for Java remote Debugging . I have configured my server side startup script: JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2G -server -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=1044,server=y,suspend=n" By this, I assume the remote java app should be available on localhost:1044 (try it first using localhost) But, what do I do next? I have configured the debug options to the class to be debugged via Run-->Debug Configurations . But it asks me to click Debug. But my class does not have a main() method. Say, I want to debug getValue() in Methods.java , now getValue() is invoked from a client (via tcp). So, how do I attach the java process to eclipse remote debugger when that method is invoked? Am I missing out on something basic about remote debugging? UPDATE: (I can see this in my debug view, that means, the remote app is connected and in the debug mode, now how do I put a breakpoint in the file where I want)
