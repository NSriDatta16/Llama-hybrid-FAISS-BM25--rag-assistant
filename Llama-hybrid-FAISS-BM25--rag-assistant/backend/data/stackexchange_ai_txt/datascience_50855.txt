You can directly enforce monotonicity. sklearn s RF doesn't appear to support this ( https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/383423/how-to-enforce-a-monotonic-answer-in-a-single-feature-in-a-binary-classification ), but XGBoost ( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/monotonic.html ) and some others do. Of course, improving the model in general is good (see Carlo's answer for some initial steps); and it's possible that your intuition for monotonicity just doesn't hold in reality.
