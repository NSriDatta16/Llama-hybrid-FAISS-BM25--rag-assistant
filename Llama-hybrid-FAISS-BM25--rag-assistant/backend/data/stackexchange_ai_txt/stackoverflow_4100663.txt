EntityFramework 4.0 Get ComplexType Mapping

I'm trying to find the ComplexType that's mapped to my FunctionImport from my MetadataWorkspace. The related xml is there in the CSSpace of the edmx, but I can't figure out how to get it out. I can go for the EdmFunction itself from the SSpace, but that doesn't tell me the ComplexType that it's mapped to, does it? I can also go for the ComplexType itself in the CSpace, but that doesn't tell me the FunctionImport it's mapped to... The related xml in the edmx is: At runtime I can get a the StorageEntityMappingCollection but I'm not sure where to go from there: ((System.Data.Mapping.StorageMappingItemCollection) metadataWorkspace.GetItemCollection(DataSpace.CSSpace)).First() // then what....all I see after this is a bunch of MetadataProperties which seem to take me in circles...
