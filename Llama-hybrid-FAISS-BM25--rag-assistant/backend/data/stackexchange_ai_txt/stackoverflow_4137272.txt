If by "garbage values" you mean the values of uninitialized variables, it doesn't -- the value of an uninitialized variable is undefined by the standard. The garbage value you're thinking of is actually just whatever happened to be stored in that memory right before the storage for the variable was allocated from the stack or heap. That said, some compilers offer debugging aids that will fill uninitialized variables with some well-known "magic number" to help you catch errors of this sort. For example, Microsoft Visual C++ fills uninitialized stack variables with 0xCCCCCCCC. These are specific to the compiler and usually require that you compile with debugging turned on.
