@Terrapin: you got this exactly right (for me, anyways). I was running User Agent Switcher and had inadvertently left the Googlebot 2.1 agent selected. In Reporting Services 2008 it was causing the iframes that reports are actually rendered in to be about 300x200 px, and in Reporting Services 2008 R2 is was throwing "__doPostBack undefined" errors in the Error Console. Switching back to the Default User Agent fixed all my issues.
