Methodologies used to speed up the process of creating and coding subforms

My question is how programmers create, code, and organize subforms in general. By subforms, I mean those groups of controls that make up one UI experience. I'm looking for hints to help me better organize my form codes and to speed up the process of creating such forms. I swear to God, it takes way too long. I've identified three broad groups of subform elements: -Subforms have commands to do something. -Subforms have data elements to carry out those commands. -Subforms have states used to track things that aren't data. The approach I use is to focus on what it takes to perform the commands which will determine which data elements are needed and how they should be validated. Also, do programmers use check lists when creating forms? p.s. I program as a hobby.
