A simple way is to fit this with a logistic regression, probit regression, or some other model that models the probability to be picked. Say in one game the order of picking was A,K,G,B then you can encode this as 6 seperate games where A wins from K, A wins from G, A wins from B, K wins from G, K wins from B, and G wins from B. For $n$ players there will be $\frac{n}{2(n-1)}$ of such pairs. The probability for a win can be modelled by a probability $p$ which is based on a logistic curve or normal distribution curve and some latent parameters that relate to the popularity of the players. Those parameters is what you model and you can use it to predict the order in a new game. More complicated would be to include potential interactions between players. Possibly a particular player does not want to play with another no matter how good they are. Or players might have specialities that need to be matched. (E.g. only one keeper is necessary) If you have more information about the process underlying the picking, then you could possibly describe a better model. But this might be a topic that is too broad for a simple answer here. There are many ways how you could make the model more complicated. And, without a good initial exploration of the data, it is difficult for outsiders to suggest options to improve the logistic regression model. An approach that figures out most of the complexity by itselve could be to an artificial neural network. Although you have to be smart about a good layout. Also overfitting could happen if you only have 100 examples of previous games.
