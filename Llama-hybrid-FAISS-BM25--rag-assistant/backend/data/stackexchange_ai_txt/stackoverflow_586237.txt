I assume that the reason you want nested comments at all is because your users tend to want to read through a single thread of interest at a time. That is, you have reason to believe users will create threads of coherent chains of thought, and/or what gets discussed in one thread will interest some users but not others. If that’s the case, I don’t know why you would ever want to arbitrarily split a thread across pages by date (Option 1). Using a single page with culling of low-rated comments (Option 3) seems a little harsh and may discourage users from posting comments. That may be a good thing if you’ve got an audience mass like SlashDot, but it may be undesirable for sites with more typical visitation rates. Perhaps you can have something like Option 2, with all threads on the same page, but if a thread starts getting too long, it gets rolled up into a single link that takes the user to a page dedicated to that thread. Alternatively, long threads can be reduced to just display their subject lines and authors, each which in turn link to the appropriate place in a dedicated page for the thread. I suspect the tendency for users to post irrelevant comments in the largest thread is a product of users not wanting to be bothered with scrolling around to find the end of the thread, or find a thread that’s more suitable. By automatically compacting long threads, leaving the root of all threads displayed on a single page of manageable length, users can easily scan for a thread of interest and add to it if desired.
