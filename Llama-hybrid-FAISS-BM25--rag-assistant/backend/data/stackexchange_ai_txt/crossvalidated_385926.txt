number of parameters in Bayes Net

This might be a bit rudimentary. Have some problems in understanding the number of parameters in Bayes Net How do we calculate the number of parameters in the Bayes net in the preceding diagram? Let's go through each conditional probability table, one parameter at a time. Experience and Grades take two values, and therefore need one independent parameter each. The Interview table has 12 (3 x 4) parameters. However, each row sums up to 1, and therefore, we need two independent parameters per row. The whole table needs 8 (2 x 4) independent parameters. Similarly, the Offer table has six entries, but only 1 independent parameter per row is required, which makes 3 (1 x 3) independent parameters. Therefore, the total number of parameters is 1 (Experience) + 1 (Grades)+ 12 (Interview) + 3 (Offer) amount to 17, which is a lot lesser than 24 parameters to fully specify the joint distribution. Therefore, the independence assumptions in the Bayesian network helps us avoid specifying the joint distribution. I can understand that the total number of parameters is 24 without reduction the number independent parameters for each row in interview table is 2 the number independent parameters for each row in job offer table is 1 What I cannot understand is why in the final calculation the number of parameters to define interview table is 12 instead of 8? Can I seek your help in understanding this? Thanks in advance
