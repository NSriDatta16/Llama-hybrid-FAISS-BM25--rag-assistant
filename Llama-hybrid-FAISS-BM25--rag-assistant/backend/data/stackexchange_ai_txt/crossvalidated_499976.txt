Checking linearity in logistic regression

I am conducting logistic regression, and I am a bit confused about the linearity check? I have 18 independent variables, among them, 13 are continuous, and 5 are categorical variables. In this scenario, Do I need to check for violation of linearity assumption? I tried myself to check the assumption by creating an interaction term log(IV)*IV of a continuous variable. When I regressed (only with continuous variables), I found 4 variables were found significant (that means the violation of the assumption). Therefore, If I need to check and treat the model accordingly, how I can treat those variables? I hope to get your advice. Thank you
