You write "I then considered binarizing the dependent variable (e.g., takes less than standard leave vs. takes standard leave or more). This would allow me to use logistic regression and the weirdness of the distribution would be gone. I am fine with this." That sounds like a good starting point. You can definitely include interactions in a logistic regression. For example, you could predict "took a leave of length >= threshold" using indicators for income, gender, education, an indicator for whether we are in a timeperiod after the new laws have been passed, interactions of that indicator with income, interactions of that indicator with gender... actually if you are allowed to share coefficients, it would be pretty cool if you could run that model and post the results here. Instead of an indicator for whether the new laws have been passed, you could have year-specific effects -- and these could be interacted with income, gender, etc if you have enough data. If you have data on where the person lives, you could run a hierarchical logistic regression in which you have location effects that are modeled as coming from some common distribution.
