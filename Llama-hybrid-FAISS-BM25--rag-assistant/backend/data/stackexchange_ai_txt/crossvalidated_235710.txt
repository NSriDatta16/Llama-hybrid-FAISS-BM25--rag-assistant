AUC & Geometric mean for classifying imbalanced classes

I am doing a binary classification task with imbalanced classes and right now I am using both metrics : AUC + G-mean to check the classification rate of my classifier .. what is the difference between these tow metrics and is using both of them to measure the classification rate is sensible and have different indicates ? or one of them can be used instead of the other ? I am using Scikitlearn to compute the AUC : sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score, average='macro') enter link description here
