Do you mean that several objects in an image aim to one specific label? For example, if you have an image with an astronaut, buildings, a car, and a rocket, it has the label "Space"; and an image with buildings, cars, and a circuit has the label "Racing"? In that case, you would have to add one step to multi-label by making sense of several labels into one thanks to a logistic regression or something similar. In addition to that, here is a publication that might help: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08400 Nicolas
