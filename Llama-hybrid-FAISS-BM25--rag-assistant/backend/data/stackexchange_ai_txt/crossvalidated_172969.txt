Conceptual undersanding of linear discriminant analysis

Can someone explain to a newbie the concepts of linear discriminant analysis? I am not looking for a technical implementation like this . I wish to understand it conceptually. I understand logistic regression and a little bit about naive Bayes classification, but cannot make any sense of LDA. What problem does LDA solve that is not suited for Naive Bayes or logistic regression? More than two output categories?
