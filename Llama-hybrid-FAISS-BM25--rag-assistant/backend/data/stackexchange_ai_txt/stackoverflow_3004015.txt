jQuery and HTML visual glitches on table cell .toggle

I have table that gets dynamically created. When using jQuery and toggle, everything works. I however get a small visual glitch - it seems the HTML sometimes get selected. How would I disable this on a faulty drag or mouse operation? Is there a difference in the DOM between text in a cell and 'not text' or buffered space in a td?
