How do I determine the "narrowest" font on Windows?

I am looking for a way to find the font that uses the least average horizontal space per letter, since I have a few buttons in my application that need to show a rather long text in it, and the goal is to make the buttons with the minimal width necessary. Since I already know the environment where the application is going to be installed, the solution needs not necessarily be a script or program, it is sufficient for me to have the font at design time. For what it is worth, it is going to be an ms-Access application.
