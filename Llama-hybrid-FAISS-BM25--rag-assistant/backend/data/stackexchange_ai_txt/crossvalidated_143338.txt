You are probably supposed to assume that all possible strings are equally likely to occur--but you should make that assumption explicitly, because other distributions of the strings are possible. The phrasing of the question provides a strong hint about a simple and elegant solution: exploit properties of expectation. The useful one here is that the expected number of change points is the sum over all $a+b-1$ locations of the expectation of the number of changepoints at that location. Each of these locations is surrounded by two characters in the string; only these matter for determining whether a changepoint occurs at that location. There are only four possibilities: Event Number of changepoints -------- ---------------------- ...00... (0 changepoints) ...01... (1 changepoint) ...10... (1 changepoint) ...11... (0 changepoints) Because this analysis is independent of where the location is, you don't have to perform $a+b-1$ calculations--you only need to find this one expectation and multiply it by $a+b-1$. As always, it will come down to the definition of expectation: you multiply the values of the indicator ($0$ or $1$) by the probabilities. Since the $0$ values won't contribute anything, that reduces your work to computing the probabilities of the $1$ values: that is, of the events ...01... and ...10... . Because location does not matter, you might as well focus on the first location (between the first and second characters). So: what is the chance that a random string begins 01... ? What is the chance it begins 10... ? That's all you need to find in order to write down the answer immediately.
