The second paragraph in your question suggests that really what you might be after is straightforward IOC (Inversion of Control) Instead of declaring an instance of your class, you declare an instance of an interface and based on whatever condition you choose, you use the particular overriding class with the correct method in it. Hope that makes sense.
