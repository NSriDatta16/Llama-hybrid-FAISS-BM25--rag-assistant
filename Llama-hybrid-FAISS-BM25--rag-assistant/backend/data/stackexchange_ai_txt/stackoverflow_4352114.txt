What I usually do is enforce physical folders (and groups within Xcode) for the files and have them added to the project from where they are. From there you can group files logically however you want them. By default, it will create the file within the same Classes folder, and I find it difficult to navigate when dealing with an external source control client. Leverage Categories to have separate files for separate logic for a particular class. For example I will have private method interface in the implementation file with a separate category name so that it is somewhat "private" to other implementations. For uniqueness, you could try to prefix folders or groups of classes.
