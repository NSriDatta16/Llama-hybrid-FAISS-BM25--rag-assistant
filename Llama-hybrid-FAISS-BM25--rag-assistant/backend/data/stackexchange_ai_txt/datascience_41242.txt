Forecasting/Predicition for a specific date

First of all data science is not my experties so apologies if this sounds stupid. I have a data X that is either 1 or 0 and (possibly) dependent on some other variables. I have the values for these variables mesured at specific dates. Given a date, I need to predict whether X will be 1 or 0 on that day in the futire. I checked logistic regression which seems to fit my definition (multiple independent variables, binary result). The problem is that none of the agorithms take date as a parameter. They all try to predict a given value which I dont want. How do I forecast for any given date? EDIT: Given Traffic Volume (float), Active Users (integer), Throughput (float) Congestion Flag (0 or 1) (we need to forecast this)
