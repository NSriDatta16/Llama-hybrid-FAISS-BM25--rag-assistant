What loss function should one use to get a high precision or high recall binary classifier?

I'm trying to make a detector of objects that occur very rarely (in images), planning to use a CNN binary classifier applied in a sliding/resized window. I've constructed balanced 1:1 positive-negative training and test sets (is it a right thing to do in such case btw?), and classifier is doing fine on a test set in terms of accuracy. Now I want to control recall/precision of my classifier so, for example, it will not wrongly label too much of a majority class occurrences. Obvious (for me) solution is to use same logistic loss which is used now, but weight type I and type II errors differently by multiplying loss in one of the two cases on some constant, which can be tuned. Is it right? P.S. On a second thought this is equivalent to weighting some training samples more than the others. Just adding more of one class will achieve the same I think.
