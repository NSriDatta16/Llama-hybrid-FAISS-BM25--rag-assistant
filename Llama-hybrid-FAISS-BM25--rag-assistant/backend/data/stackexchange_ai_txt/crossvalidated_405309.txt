Simple elaboration on Joint Models' linear equations/trajectory functions

I have been struggling with grasping the intuition behind joint models, and I hope someone can elucidate a particular aspect of theirs. Joint models, first of all, are essentially combinations of linear model + survival model, in order to be able to estimate "the time left" to an "event" , at any arbitrary point within a time series. A good intuitive description is found here . The purpose of joint models is clear, as the above link demonstrates. A doctor might want to know, at any moment, how much longer (based on a patient's treatment and his/her biomarker history/time series data) they can be expected to survive. However, following this article , I would extremely appreciate help understanding the trajectory function mentioned on page 2. To make sure I am on the right track, I created some dummy data of 3 patients: the first 2 receive a treatment and survive longer (later Time-of-event ), while the last does not, and, unfortunately, dies earlier. There also exists an arbitrary Bio-marker that is being measured (like white blood cell count). On the same page, the linear model aspect of joint models is presented, $$Y_{ij} = X_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}\, ,$$ where $Y_{ij}$ is an "observed outcome" (so I assume it is some Bio-marker ), and $X_{ij}$ is some "trajectory function" that stands for the following: $$X_{ij} = \theta_{0i} + \theta_{1i} * t_{ij} + \gamma Z_i\, .$$ $Z_i$ is the presence (or not) of the treatment ( 1 or 0 ). However, the rest of the equation makes no sense to me. I agree that the Bio-marker should be affected by the presence of the treatment, but why would one assume that the Bio-marker grows with time so naively, in the first place? Wouldn't an ARIMA model (or any more robust time-series approach) be more believable for $X_{ij}$ ? If anyone could elaborate on the trajectory function (why it is assumed to be this way, what other structures could be used instead, etc), I would extremely appreciate it.
