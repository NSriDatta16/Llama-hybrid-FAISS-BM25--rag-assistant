How to calculate $P(A|B,C)$ from Bayesian Network?

Say I have a bayesian network B C. I need to calculate $P(A|B,C)$ . How can I do that? I tried doing: $P(A|B,C)=\frac{P(A,B,C)}{P(B,C)}$ I also tried various other combinations of formulae (I've been at this so long I've forgotten almost all of them and my calculations book is a mess). All of them lead up to requiring $P(B,C)$ which I have no idea how to obtain. I'm relatively new to this. Where should I go from here?
