Show average instead of median in boxplot

When plotting a boxplot with python matplotblib, the lines halfway the plot is the median of the distribution. Is there a possibility to instead have the line at the average. Or to plot it next to it in a different style. Also, because it is common for the line to be the median, will it really confuse my readers if I make it the average (off course I will add a note what the middle line is)?
