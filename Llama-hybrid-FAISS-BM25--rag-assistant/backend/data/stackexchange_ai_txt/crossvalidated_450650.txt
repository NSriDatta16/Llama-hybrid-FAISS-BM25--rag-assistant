What is the rationale for the rules for detecting an out of control process in Statistical Process Control?

Statistical Process Control (SPC) can be used to determine if a process is "in statistical control". A common tool for SPC is the "mean control chart" -- essentially a time series of sample means obtained from the process one seeks to analyze. A rule of thumb presented by John Oakland in his book Statistical Process Control is as follows. I quote: A trend is a succession of points on the chart that are rising or falling, and may indicate gradual changes, such as tool wear. The rules concerning the detection of runs and trends are based on finding a series of seven points in a rising or falling trend (Figure 6.5), or in a run above or below the mean value (Figure 6.6). These are treated as out of control signals. The reason for choosing seven is associated with the risk of finding one point above the average, but [within 2 $\sigma$ ] being ca=0.475. The probability of finding seven point in such a series will be (0.475)7 = ca. 0.005. This indicates how a run or trend of seven has approximately the same probability of occurring as a point [3 $\sigma$ away from the mean] (pg. 111, 7e) The authors here motivate the discussion with use of a normal distribution, and so it stands to reason that all computations are performed with the normal. The authors include the following figure as illustration of a "trend" The rationale behind this definition of "trend" is confusing. Oakland properly notes that $$ \mathbf{\Phi}(2) - \mathbf{\Phi}(0) \approx 0.47 $$ However, the probability of observing such a sequence of observations is not 7*0.46>1, nor is it $0.46)^7$ . The probability of observing a trend depends on the sequence of values observed. Assuming the points are independent, then the probability of observing a trend $x_1 \gt x_2 \gt \cdots \gt x_7 $ , where $x_i$ are iid, would be the probability I find $x_2 , multiplied by the probability that $x_3 , and so on. More compactly, $$ \prod_{i=1}^6 \mathbf{\Phi}(x_i) $$ This product very clearly depends on how "steep" this trend is. import numpy as np from scipy.stats import norm #Not so steep trend = np.linspace(2,1,7) np.prod(norm.cdf(trend)) >>>0.6094690320800531 #Very steep trend = np.linspace(2,-2,6) np.prod(norm.cdf(trend)) >>>0.0005112910660916415 Could someone more familiar with SCP justify to me why a trend of 7 points, regardless of where those points are observed, signals an out of control process. And more importantly, why do practitioners of SCP refer to these trends as "statistically significant"?
