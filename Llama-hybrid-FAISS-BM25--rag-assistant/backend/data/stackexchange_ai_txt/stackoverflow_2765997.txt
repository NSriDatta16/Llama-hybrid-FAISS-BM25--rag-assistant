If this application will be run on a dedicated machine (i.e. the machine's only job is to convert a gigantic collection of Office documents), your safest bet is probably to use Office automation in a single-threaded manner and let the app happily convert one file at a time. A multi-threaded Office Automation app would probably convert documents at a faster overall rate (especially on a multi-core processor), up to the point where the server crashes. Office Open XML is a non-Office-Automation alternative, but since I'm currently battling its tendency to produce OutOfMemoryException errors when exporting to relatively small Excel files (~1MB), I can't really recommend it.
