How do I interpret an independent variable which is a log(%)?

My linear regression is: School's average test score ~ log(%FSM) %FSM = the percentage of pupils at the school who are eligible for free school meals (an indicator of low socio-economic status). The coefficient for log(%FSM) is -10. Do I interpret this as: a 1% increase in the %FSM pupils is associated with a decrease of 0.1 in average test score? Or, because this is a log of a % is the interpretation different from the above? I think this is also a 1% increase, NOT a 1 percentage point increase. Is there a clearer way to make this distinction in my interpretation?
