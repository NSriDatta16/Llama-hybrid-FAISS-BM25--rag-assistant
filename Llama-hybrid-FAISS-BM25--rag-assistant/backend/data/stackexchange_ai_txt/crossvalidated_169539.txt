Explained variance in dimensionality reduction

I am new to dimensionality reduction and I am trying to learn different techniques about it. I am noticing that, unlike PCA, many other algorithms do not provide the explained variance of each feature (or am I wrong?). That said, how do I choose the size of the reduced feature? I would appreciate also some reference to read about the state-of-the-art algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
