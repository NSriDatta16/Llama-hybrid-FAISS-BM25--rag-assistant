a is a - b so why don't you generate a new feature feature1_feature2_diff = norm(feature_1) - norm(feature_2) and let the decision tree decide if it should do feature1_feature2_diff or not? Edit: if there is some sort of window aggregation involved, say a moving average, you need to use a value within that window to normalize your aggregated data. Otherwise the new feature might vary over time and there will be too much noise, lowering the information gain from it.
