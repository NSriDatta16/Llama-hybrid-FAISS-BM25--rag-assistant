Is the first principal component the one with the largest eigenvalue and how to convert it to explained variance?

In PCA, after we calculate the eigenvalues of each variable, we need to get the explained variance, I read an article which suggests: significance = [np.abs(i)/np.sum(eigenval) for i in eigenval]' I have three questions: In this code, why don't we use the sum of the absolute value of 'eigenval'? Why we use 'np.abs(i)/np.sum(eigenval) ' to get the explained variance? Is the first principal component the one with the largest eigenvalue or the largest absolute eigenvalue?
