You are certainly addressing the problem in the correct manner: creating surrogate "source" time series by randomising/shuffling (while leaving the "destination" unchanged), then computing TE for each surrogate, so as to obtain the distribution of surrogate TEs that one would see were there no source-destination relationship (while other aspects of the time-series are controlled). You can then make a statistical comparison of your measured TE to this distribution so as to check if there is a statistically significant source-destination relationship. This approach is described formally in the following papers: Chavez et. al., "Statistical assessment of nonlinear causality: application to epileptic EEG signals", Journal of Neuroscience Methods 124 (2003) 113-128. Verdes, P.F., "Assessing causality from multivariate time series", Phys. Rev. E 72(2), 026222–9 (2005) Vicente et al., "Transfer entropy—a model-free measure of effective connectivity for the neurosciences", Journal of Computational Neuroscience, Vol. 30, No. 1. (2011), pp. 45-67 Lizier et al., "Multivariate information-theoretic measures reveal directed information structure and task relevant changes in fMRI connectivity", Journal of Computational Neuroscience, Vol. 30, No. 1. (2011), pp. 85-107. Assuming your surrogate distribution followed a normal distribution, you could do Student's t-test for significance of the measured values; while their p-values are high, neither is statistically significant at alpha=0.05; I would say that you don't have a statistically significant relationship there.
