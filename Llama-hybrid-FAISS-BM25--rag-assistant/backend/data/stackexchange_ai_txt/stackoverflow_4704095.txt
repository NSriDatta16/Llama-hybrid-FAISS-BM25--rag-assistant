mySQL Left Join on multiple tables with conditions

I have a problem. I have 4 tables: Invoice_Payment, Invoice, Client, and Calendar Basically, I have the below query, which works well, except, months with no date_due don't return. I.E only months with a date_due will be returned. Note: the calendar table simply lists every day of the year. It contains a single col call date_field Database: http://oberto.co.nz/jInvoice.txt Expected output: my current query, below, will return something like: month total August 5 September 0 October 196 November 205 December 214 January 229 Notice how September isn't returned? It's because table Invoice_Payment has no date_due record I think I have to use a left join and join the calendar table with something like: LEFT JOIN Calendar ON Invoice_Payments.date_paid = Calendar.date_field. But I'm having no luck SELECT MONTHNAME(Invoice_Payments.date_paid) as month, SUM(Invoice_Payments.paid_amount) AS total FROM Invoice, Client, Invoice_Payments WHERE Client.registered_id = 1 AND Client.id = Invoice.client_id And Invoice.id = Invoice_Payments.invoice_id AND date_paid IS NOT NULL GROUP BY YEAR(Invoice_Payments.date_paid), MONTH(Invoice_Payments.date_paid) Any help appreciated.
