Should be an easy question but Google failed me. This should totally be an easy question, you only need the technical name for what you need: the "inputs" are covariates, and in the context of time series they are usually called predictors I think. For example, Hyndman explains how to run ARIMA with covariates and he even includes a comment about R. You can find more material if you look up "time series covariates", "arima covariates", "arima covariates in r", etc, in Google. Enjoy your time series!
