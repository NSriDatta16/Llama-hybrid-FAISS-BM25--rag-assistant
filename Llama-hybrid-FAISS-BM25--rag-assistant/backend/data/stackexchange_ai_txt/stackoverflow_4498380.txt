Resizing a component added to the canvas by dragging along the edge

I am developing an application where I need to place rectangular slabs of different shapes to create the shape of a Bench Top. I am placing the rectangular slabs of different shapes(I am using a the Canvas container as the slab) in a repeater and dragging them on the main canvas. One functionality that needs to be implemented is the ability to resize these slabs once the are dragged from the repeater into the drawing canvas by dragging along their edges like we resize the windows that we normally see. Is there any way this can be done.
