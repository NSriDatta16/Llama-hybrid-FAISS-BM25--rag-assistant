you can apply any Machine Learning model on this. This will be regression problem. if number of classes to particular column are not to many then try to do "one-hot encoding" eg: get_dummy in sklearn. if there are too many classes for any column try to regroup some of similar to single class. then apply any Machine learning/ Deep learning model to solve regression problem
