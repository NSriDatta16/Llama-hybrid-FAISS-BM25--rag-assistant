Let's say I'm working with divs that "for some reason" (there is one pretty good reason) can only have one line....and I want to justify them. Why don't you use text-align: justify; ? It does justify every line. Even if there is just one line. Edit : I think you are looking for this , as scragz said. Anyway, this works only in IE 5.5 and IE 6.
