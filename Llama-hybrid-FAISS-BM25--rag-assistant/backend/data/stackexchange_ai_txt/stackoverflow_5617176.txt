A way to store web app userdata offsite (local + common cloud storage)

I like to serve an application with personal (per user) data. The easy way would be to store it in my database. But I don't like to do that. I like the data to be stored in a cloud service that only the particular User can reach, and he gives the application permission to it. I had an idea to use Google Sheets for such a thing, but it feels a bit clunky. So my question is - do anyone know of a good per user cloud data storage? And even better - one that also has a local webstorage ability. With the latter I mean the user should have the data locally until he asks to upload it. That part might of course be something for my app, but perhaps there is some storage where it's already built in.
