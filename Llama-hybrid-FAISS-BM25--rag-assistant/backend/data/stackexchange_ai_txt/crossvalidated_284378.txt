How are degrees of freedom related to the alpha level criterion?

I think I grasped what degrees of freedom are. In Fox (2008) Applied Regression Analysis and the GLM (2nd. edition) chapter ten, on page 225 the geometrical representation of degrees of freedom is explained in a lot of detail: Degrees of freedom associated with a sum of squares represent the dimension of the subspace to which the corresponding vector is confined. I am currently reading Using Multivariate Statistics by Barbara G. Tabachnick and Linda S. Fidell. (6th. edition) In chapter 2.6, page 81 they discuss degrees of freedom in the context of Specific Comparisons. In analysis, degrees of freedom are best thought of as a nonrenewable ressource. They are analyzed once with conventional alpha levels, but further analysis require very stringent alpha levels. They then lament that researches often "spend" degrees of freedom on uninteresting ANOVAS while planned comparisons are neglected. I added the specific paragraph in question: So. I thought that I understand what degrees of freedom are. I also thought that I know that you have to limit the number of statistical tests/comparisons in your analysis (or adjust your alpha level) to avoid a rejection of H0 when it is actually "true". However, I fail to see how degrees of freedom and multiple comparison testings are linked. In what way do we "spend" a degree of freedom for each test? How are they nonrenewable ressources ? How are degrees of freedom relevant for your comparisons in the way it is suggested by Tabachnick and Fidell?
