Is the Durbin-Watson test appropriate for count data

In determining if there is any serial correlation in a time series of count data, is the Durbin-Watson statistic or similar approaches appropriate? I ask this question because the dwtest implemented in R can take an lm object as an input, but my time series comprises count data, which can be approximated by a negative binomial distribution, and lm would not be the appropriate model choice.
