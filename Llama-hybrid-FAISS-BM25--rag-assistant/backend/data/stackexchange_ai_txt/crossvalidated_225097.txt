Fixed parameters entered into Arima() will be interpreted as known parameters. (Whether this makes sense is a different question.) As such, it would rather be questionable if standard errors were calculated for them - after all, SEs are measures of the parameter estimates' variability, and in this interpretation, there is none. The prediction intervals should still be valid - of course, under the assumption of known parameters. They should therefore only include the variability from the noise or innovations term. As above, whether this makes sense or not is a different question. (Note that there is a difference between a confidence interval , which refers to an unobservable parameter, and a prediction interval , which refers to a realization that is in principle observable later on.) If the parameters you provide are not known , but rather "a good guess", then the best way of dealing with this is quantifying your uncertainty and running a Bayesian ARIMA model. This would allow the model to update your guesses, and resulting prediction intervals should reflect both your posterior uncertainty and the remaining noise terms. Unfortunately, I don't know of an implementation of Bayesian ARIMA, but I assume there is one.
