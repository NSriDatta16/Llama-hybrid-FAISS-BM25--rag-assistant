If you subclass UITextView and override each of it's touch events: touchesBegan:withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: touchesEnded:withEvent: touchesCancelled:withEvent: with this: - (void) touchesXXX:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesXXX:touches withEvent:event]; [[self nextResponder] touchesXXX:touches withEvent:event]; } This will allow handling of all touches by both the UITextView and its parent view. Since your UITextView scrolls exclusively vertically and your UIScrollView scrolls exclusively horizontally, this will work out fine.
