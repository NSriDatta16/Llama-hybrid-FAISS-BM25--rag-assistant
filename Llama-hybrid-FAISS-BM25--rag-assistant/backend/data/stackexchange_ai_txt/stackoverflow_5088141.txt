Qt for Android (Alpha version) got launched last week. Motorola has a custom dev environment built on top of eclipse ( MOTODEV ). It is not Motorola specific and you can use it for regular development. I have been playing around with it for a week and it is much more convenient than the standard Android Eclipse plugin. EDIT: Forgot to mention there is AppInventor (currently in Beta) which is a drag and drop development environment from Google. It is a useful tool if you want to get a feel for development or you are developing just for your phone. It does not generate Java code (as yet) and there some restrictions on it like only single screen apps are supported. It has got a healthy community and lot of college students (in the U.S) seem to be using it.
