Tough problem but typical of early web app development. First things first you need to start thinking about which logic constitutes business behavior, which logic constitutes "flow" (i.e. what the user sees), and which logic gets the content for what he sees. You don't have to go down the route of factories and interfaces and all that; retroactive implementation is far less useful... but consolidating business logic and data retrieval logic into delegates of some kind... and leaving the struts actions to determine page flow based on success/failure of that logic. From there you just have to take a few weeks and grind it out
