I am assuming the context is office setting. Study of an Impact of a systemic event. e.g. how an organizational event impacted the attendance, or reverse of it (what happened which caused a shift in pattern). Build employee profile based on localized events e.g. school vacations, time-off patterns, response to extra workload. May not necessarily be "fun" (your question), but profiling can also be done on demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) Department or team analysis. e.g. generate networking index of a person, team or department (how correlated are their activities). Possible impact on internal org design (e.g. scale/reduce support staff services, resource waste reduction, etc. ), use occupancy rate of property to decide on hotel office model, or relocation.
