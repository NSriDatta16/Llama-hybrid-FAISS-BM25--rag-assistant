In general, older references to the object model are probably still valid given the attention Microsoft pays to backwards-compatability. As for whether or not you will be able to use win32com in python for Outlook, yes, you should be able to use that to make late-bound calls to the Outlook object model. Here is a page that describes how to do it with Excel: http://oreilly.com/catalog/pythonwin32/chapter/ch12.html A problem that you should be made aware of is the fact that Outlook has a security dialog that is thrown up when external programs try to access the object model and perform operations in outlook. You are not going to be able to suppress this dialog. If you want to avoid the dialog, you are better off creating macros in VBA for Outlook that are loaded in a session, and put buttons on a new CommandBar to execute them.
