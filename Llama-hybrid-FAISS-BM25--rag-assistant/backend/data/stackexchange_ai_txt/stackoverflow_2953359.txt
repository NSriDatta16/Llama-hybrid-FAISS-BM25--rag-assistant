To help you to assess your options you need to consider what your requirements are in a disaster recovery scenario (i.e. total loss of the system in one data-centre). In particular for this scenario, how much data can you afford to lose (recovery point objective - RPO), and how quickly do you need to have the standby data-centre version of the site up and running (recovery time objective - RTO). For example if your RPO is no transactions lost and recovery in 5 minutes, then the solution would be different than if you can afford to lose 5 mins of transactions and an hour to recover. Another question I'd ask is if you're using SAN storage at all? This gives you options for replication at the storage level (SAN array to SAN array), rather than at the database level (e.g. MySQL replication). Also to consider is the distance between the data-centres (e.g. timewise can you afford to perform a synchronous write to both databases, or would an asynchronous replication approach be more appropriate)
