*resumable * html5 drag-drop file uploads

I'd like to know if it's possible/advisable to build the following JPG uploader: - use html5 drag-drop to select files for upload - filter drop list to upload JPG files only - use html5 to save upload list in local storage - initiate html5 file uploads And in case the uploads did not successfully complete, on reload of page: - check local storage for list of uploaded files - resume upload from last successful file. Is it possible/What kind of user interaction is necessary to allow HTML5 to get a list of OS filepaths and initiate file uploads? The idea is to make easy/reliable to upload say 500 JPGs.
