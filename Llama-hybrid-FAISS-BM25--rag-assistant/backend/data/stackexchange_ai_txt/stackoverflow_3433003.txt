You have to tell jHtmlArea to update itself after you set the value of the underlying textarea: $("#txtOrganizationTitle").val(item.OrganizationHTML).htmlarea('updateHtmlArea'); In response to your comment: jHtmlArea doesn't have great documentation (unless you're using intellisense in Visual Studio along with jHtmlArea's vsdoc file .) but it's code is not too hard to read through. It follows the same pattern that most jQuery plugins do, so I was able to find out what methods they make available, updateHtmlArea being one of them.
