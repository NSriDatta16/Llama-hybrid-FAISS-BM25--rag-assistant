Beginner in programming and data science with 100 hours to spend learning the basics

I started using the below link to teach myself data science, with some mathematical knowledge (including calculus, linear algebra, stats/probability) but very little programming experience: Quora - Roman Trusov's answer on how to learn Data Science in 100 hours . The above link has the following starting advice: You will need an RDBMS to handle the data, so the first day would look like this: Install and configure MySQL. Import the dump into the database Read SQL basics. Spend some time doing simple exercises to get the hang of manipulating the data... After a few days, I'm still stuck at this stage. I'd like to learn how to do data science, and was hoping that following the plan in the above link would achieve that quickly. But I'm starting to feel it is not working. Is debugging MySQL installations an important part of becoming a data scientist - so I should just get advice on that and try harder? If not, what can I do differently to achieve my goals of learning data science in similar time frame?
