Rotating blocks in JavaScript

I'd like to create a JavaScript web app that makes blocks appear on the page that can be dragged around by the user. If I used DIVs with background colors, it would be easy to rotate them by 90 degrees at a time. However, if I wanted to rotate them arbitrarily, how could I accomplish this? I'd rather not have to resort to Flash, images, Java applets or HTML5. (I'd like it to be a plain DHTML app, maybe with a cgi script on the backend, but limit the number of plugins I need.) (EDIT: The draggable DIVs isn't the hard part, I have that down. It's the rotating that I'd like ideas on.)
