Using a probability distribution as a feature is not possible in most commonly-used machine learning frameworks. Most commonly-used machine learning frameworks only accept scalar-like values as inputs. In the case of height, it would be a single numeric measurement. If you willing to go outside of established frameworks, you could model the problem in a Bayesian way with probabilistic programming where all quantities are distributions.
