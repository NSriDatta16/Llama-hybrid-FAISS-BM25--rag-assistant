Disclaimer : I am speaking form the graph analysis standpoint. There are several file formats for storing graph data: GraphML , GXL and several others. But storage usually is not a problem. Working with the graphs without fully loading them into RAM is the tricky part. The RDF model is too generic to do serious graph analysis stuff. If you don't mind your analysis being slow and programming the algorithms yourself, go with the existing graph databases - see wikipedia on this. For real analysis, load all data into RAM using existing graph analysis libraries, like SNAP or see This question .
