Since boolean expressions evaluation uses shortcut semantics, you can move subexpressions that are cheaper to calculate to the front: if (CountAllFilesOnDrive('C:\') > 7 && useFileScan) { ... } will run the expensive call anytime the expression is evaluated, even if it isn't needed. Turning around that statement skips the file check if useFileScan is false: if (useFileScan && CountAllFilesOnDrive('C:\') > 7) { ... } DeMorgan's might help you move "early exits" to the front, and thus get better average performance. Note that due to the guarantee of left-to-right evaluation, the optimizer doesn't have much freedom to modify the expression.
