Do we always assume cross entropy cost function for logistic regression solution unless stated otherwise?

I am using Matlab glmfit for logistic regression. Now I know that usually people use the cross entropy to evaluate the error in predictions against the true labels ( which different than the linear regression where they use Mean Square Error (MSE) or Sum of Squares SS). My questions: 1) Is true that whenever I use builtin logistic regression function (as in glmfit in matlab) I would assume they use the cross entropy as a cost function? I read through the documentation of glmfit here but nothing mentioned about that. https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/glmfit.html 2) And in general if someone handed me a logistic regression solution (or read a paper that says they implemented a logistic regression) is it fair to assume that they used cross entropy as a cost function unless stated otherwise? Note my question is mathematical, rather it is about the implementation in matlab and the norm in this field..
