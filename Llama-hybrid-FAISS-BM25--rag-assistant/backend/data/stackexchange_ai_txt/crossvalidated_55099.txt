You should use fixed effects if I understand your example correctly: You are using a difference-in-difference approach, where the groups ("schools") have different averages to begin with (for unobserved reasons) and were not randomly selected. Using fixed effects in the regression gives the the model different y-intercepts for each "school" in your example. Essentially, you are assuming the treatment effect (slope / beta) is the same for all schools, but the mean score is different. Clustering standard errors should be used when the standard errors are correlated within groups but not across groups. For example, a stratified sample where neighborhoods were randomly chosen and then students were randomly chosen within that neighborhood. We'd expect the treatment effect to be correlated within neighborhoods but not across neighborhoods. In either case, clustering standard errors with only three clusters is not asymptotically valid, as pointed out above (you'd need at LEAST 42 clusters).
