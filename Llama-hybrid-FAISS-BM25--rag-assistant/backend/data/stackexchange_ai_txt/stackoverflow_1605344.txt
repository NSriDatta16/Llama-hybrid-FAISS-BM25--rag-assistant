If no other/better means are available, put a UIView over the ad area, detect touches on it, make a note then pass that to the next responder (which is the ad's view). In other words, you need a method you can call to tell you that admob was clicked, and a subclass of UIView, which is positioned right over the admod view, that has the following touchesBegan: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // you may want to do some extra work here to detect whether the touch is a // touchUp in the view, vs. a touchUpOutside which is not the same. It all // depends on how admob treats touches. If it immediately quits your app on // touchdown, then you call your method immediately. If admob waits to see // if there is a touchUp in its view, then you need to detect the same and // call your method after that. Play around to see what you need to mimic. [self adViewHasBeenTouched]; // The following is needed to let admob get the touch, after you are done // with your method. [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
