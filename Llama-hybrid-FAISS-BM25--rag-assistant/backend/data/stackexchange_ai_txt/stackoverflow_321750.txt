I would say to try to follow a changelog style. The first line should be a short summary, and include the issue/ticket number (if any). This should possibly be followed by a blank line depending on how your VCS handles multi-line commit messages, then a fuller multiline description. I would say it's unreasonable to impose any strict formatting since it will discourage frequent commits, but so long as the important commits (the ones closing issues, or major changes) are done this way you should be ok. If you use something like Trac or roundup + svn integration, it can pick out issue numbers from the commit messages. I would always put these in the first line since they're so useful.
