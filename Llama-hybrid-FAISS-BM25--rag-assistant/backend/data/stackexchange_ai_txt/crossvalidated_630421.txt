Effect of leverage on residuals

The variance of residuals in a linear regression is given by : $$Var(e_i)=(1-h_{ii})\sigma^2$$ This means that residuals have a lower variance than the error terms, and the variance of residuals is smaller for observations with higher leverage. I see that from the equation above but I can't get an intuitive explanation of these facts. The only explanation I can think of for the 2nd point is : high leverage makes the fitted value $\hat y_i$ close to $y_i$ , which means that their difference (= $e_i$ ) cannot vary a lot. Are there better explanations.
