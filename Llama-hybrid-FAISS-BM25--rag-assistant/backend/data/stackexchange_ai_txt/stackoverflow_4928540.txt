Safari tries to be helpful when there's a select box partially out of view, if you see: http://jsfiddle.net/H5J27/ The first example doesn't have -webkit-transform, but when you click on it, it will be displaced in order to reveal it fully. Now, Safari apparently isn't aware that, once transformed, the select box is in full view. The engine still thinks it's partially obstructed and it will move the select box and it's parent container to a point where it thinks you can see it. The workarounds are not very encouraging. I'm guessing you're doing this coupled with animation in order to enjoy the benefits of hardware acceleration, so I'd add an event listener and the end of the animation, remove the css transform and apply normal positioning. This will get complicated if you have to do it on several elements, but it's good enough for a one time thing.
