On average how many observations per item? I agree with your naive approach and wanting something more robust. There are many robust nonparametric tests to compare two samples, such as permutation tests or Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests. You can compare these to the results of the two-sample t-tests and look more closely at the discrepancies. Obviously you'll want to automate this to do all variables at once using one function/command, which it sounds like you've already accomplished.
