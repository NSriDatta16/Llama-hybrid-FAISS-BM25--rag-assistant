Logistic Regression in R with GLM giving negative probabilities even with type already as "response"

I'm trying to verify the assumptions of logistic regression in R. To do this I first computed the probabilities as in the following code for the sample dataset here : data $outcome ~ data$ f1 + data $f2 + data$ f3 probabilities 0.5, "pos", "neg") logit However, some of these probabilities turned out to be negative negative which is causing problems when I try to compute the logit. How is it possible that there are negative probabilities? I've looked at many answers on here that just suggest to use "response" type but I already had that from the beginning. Any ideas?
