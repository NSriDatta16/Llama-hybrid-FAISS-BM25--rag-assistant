composite features can be useful but you probably wouldn't want to use the elements of a composite feature and the composite feature itself as inputs to the same model unless each was meaningful a priori (and even then, maybe not). The net will be able to learn about the summation of two features (and other relationships) without combining them. a great use for composite features can be when you want to do large scale machine learning and cut down on processing requirements so not necessary but occasionally useful one caveat - the nature of a feature might call for a transformation (square root, polynomial transformation) to increase the fit of a simple model but that is a separate issue from combining features into a composite feature
