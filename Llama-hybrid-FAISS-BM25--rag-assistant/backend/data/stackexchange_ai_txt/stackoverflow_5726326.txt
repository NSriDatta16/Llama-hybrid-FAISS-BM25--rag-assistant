what's different between lib and lib-devel in yum?

I'm compiling a software that depends on libpcap ,so I yum install libpcap ,but when I ./configure it still reports can't find libpcap,so I run yum install libpcap-devel and this time it works. My question is,what's the difference and what exactly was ./configure looking for when it says libpcap not found?
