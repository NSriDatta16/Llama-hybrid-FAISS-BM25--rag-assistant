Is it possible to have a rotationally invariant identifier of a boolean matrix?

Say I have a matrix of ones and zeros, and I would like a 'identifier' for this matrix that takes the same value regardless of whether the matrix is rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, i.e. a 4-to-1 mapping. Ideally, this identifier should be 1/4 the size of the matrix. Is it possible to write a function that does this mapping? Background: I was looking at this problem on the UVa problem set. I don't exactly need such a function to solve the problem, but it seems reasonable that it would exist, and using it would make for a more elegant solution.
