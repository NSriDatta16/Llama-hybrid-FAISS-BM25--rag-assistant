How to create a user interface like Google maps (a draggable map)?

I have to draw a graph with many nodes, and I thought that an user interface like what Google maps offers could be nice to navigate the graph. I'm currently using Java for my application (a web application): what technologies/libraries should I use to build an interface like google maps? What approach? edit: I'm interested mainly in creating a draggable map with zooming capabilities edit2: I'm not looking for the exact solution of the problem, but for some starting point
