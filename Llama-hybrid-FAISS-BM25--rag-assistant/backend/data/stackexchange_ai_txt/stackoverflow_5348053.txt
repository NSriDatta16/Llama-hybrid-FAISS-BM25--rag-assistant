embed serial number to PDF file?

To prevent the casual distribution of pdf document, is there any way such as embedding the serial number to the file? My idea is to embed the id bound to user and enable to find who distribute the file. I know it's not preventing the distribution but may discourage the casual distribution by the certain level. Any other solution is also welcome. Thanks!
