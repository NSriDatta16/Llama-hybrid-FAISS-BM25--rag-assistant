I have a music listing that is well over 75,000 records and I had encountered a similar situation. I wrote a PHP script that checked for all string that began with 'A ', 'An ' or 'The ' and truncated that part off the string. I also converted all uppercase letters to lowercase and stored that string in a new column. After setting an index on that column, I was done. Obviously you display the initial column but sort by the newly-created indexed column. I get results in a second or so now.
