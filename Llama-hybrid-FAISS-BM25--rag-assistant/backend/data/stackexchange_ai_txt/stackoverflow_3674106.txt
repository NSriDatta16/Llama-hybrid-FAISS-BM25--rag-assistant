Cannot overwrite Cache-Control in PHP

I've moved a older site to a new server, and the client has found a very odd behaviour. Very close to the end, I have this code: if (!$this->cache) { header('Expires: '.gmdate('d M Y H:i:s', 946684800).' GMT'); header('Cache-Control: no-cache'); header('Pragma: no-cache'); } Now the odd thing is the Cache-Control line doesnt work. After packet sniffing I see this: Expires: 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=300, public Pragma: no-cache The order of the headers is exactly how I set them, but the Cache-Control is completely different. I've grepped my code for any mention of cache-control and there is only that mention, and another one designed to force caching in a different file but it is a different line to what I'm seeing so it cant be the culprit. Does anyone know why Cache-Control is changing?
