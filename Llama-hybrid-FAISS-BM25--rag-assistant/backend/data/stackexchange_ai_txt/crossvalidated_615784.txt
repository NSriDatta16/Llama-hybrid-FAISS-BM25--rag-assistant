Is there an "antipodal" conditional disintegration of the von Mises Fisher distribution?

For more on conditional disintegration, cf. e.g. the references [1] [2], or these questions [a] [b] on math stackexchange. Question: For the von-Mises Fisher distribution , is there a conditional disintegration via antipodal pairs of points? I.e. so each conditional distribution would be a Bernoulli and have as values the two points of an antipodal pair? Observation: At least in the case that $\kappa$ (concentration) equals $0$ , and thus the von Mises-Fisher distribution reduces to the uniform distribution on the (hyper)sphere, the answer would clearly seem to be yes. Namely the resulting conditional distributions of the disintegration would just be "fair coins", i.e. Bernoullis giving equal probability to each antipode. Comment: A reference would suffice, although something like a derivation / calculation would be amazing of course. If it's relevant, I'm most interested in the case that $p=3$ (i.e. distributions on the 2D sphere in 3D space).
