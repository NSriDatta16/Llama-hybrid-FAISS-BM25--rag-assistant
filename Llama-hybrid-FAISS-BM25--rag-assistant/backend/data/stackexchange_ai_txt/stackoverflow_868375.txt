How do i limit the amount of LI in using jQuery

I'm using the jQuery UI to develop a drag and drop favourites UI, I want to limit the amount of LI's (limited to 5) dropped in a specific region, and replace current ones if a user drop one over the other. How can this be done? I'm currently using a modified version of the photomanager on the jQuery UI site.
