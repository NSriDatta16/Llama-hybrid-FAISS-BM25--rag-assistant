Your code is a bit disorganised. Debugging is generally easier with better-organised code. Anyway, enough of the trash-talking. You're assigning the result of a datastore query to persons ... persons = person.fetch(limit = 1) ...but then in your template you use person : Nome: {{ person.name}} Apelido: {{ person.phone}} It is difficult to tell if this is your only problem (I highly doubt it), but perhaps you can try fixing that and get back to us. Best of luck to you. Aside: instead of .fetch(limit=1) you can simply use .get() as mentioned in the documentation : get() implies a "limit" of 1. At most 1 result is fetched from the datastore.
