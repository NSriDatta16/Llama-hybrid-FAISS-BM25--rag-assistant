How to debug a TSQL in VISUAL STUDIO 2005?

I am trying to debug a TSQL via Visual Studio 2005. I added the database connection and are now able to connect. But I initially I couldn't see the "Attach To Process" under tools. I went into the customize option and drag and dropped the "Attach To Process" under tools. Now I can see the "Attach To Process" under tools, but it is disabled. Can someone please let me know how to enable this and debug a TSQL? Thanks in advance :)
