I suggest you start learning from a book that will introduce you both to .NET and C#. When you will understand .NET world, you can go further to ASP.NET. Since you come from *nix world, you should learn how different .NET world is from your previous experiences, and even from Windows itself. I spent some time reading Andrew Troelsen’s book, and I think they are quite ok to start, and then move to ASP.NET. From the list above I have heard, that Liberty’s book is quite ok.
