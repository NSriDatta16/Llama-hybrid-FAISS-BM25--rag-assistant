Predictive model for categorical data?

I have a data with majority of data being binary(0&1) and I would like to predict a numerical outcome time. All the columns are anonymized; Size columns:385, rows:4209. Can anyone suggest what predictive model should I use and how should I transform the data to use in model? I have tried Neural networks, but it could explain only 48% of variability. Also tried Simple regression, it does not give good results. I am looking to Xgboost and catboost for improving the prediction. Any suggestions? Example: X1
