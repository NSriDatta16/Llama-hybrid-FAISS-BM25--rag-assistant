The situation you describe might be handled well with either Poisson regression or with Cox PH regression. (Although there are some hints in your question that the constant hazards and/or the uninformative censoring assumptions may be violated.) In Poisson regression the time aspect can be entered as a weighting variable; typically one would add an offset term where the 'offset' was the log(time). This would implicitly model the risks associated with the other elements as being constant since the link function is also the logarithm of the sum of predictors. In Cox PH modeling the time variable serves to determine which cases are in the risk set at the time of each of the events. You can examine the validity of the implicit assumptions of constant risk (for Poisson regression) or constant relative risk (for Cox models). Alternative approaches using parametric models may impose further (or quite different) assumptions, which if met may allow more statistically powerful tests. Including time as a weighting factor in a logistic regression model has been proposed in the past (before Cox models were widely accessible). That approach performed fairly well, but it might be seen by reviewers of submissions to academic journals as been a method from the "last century".
