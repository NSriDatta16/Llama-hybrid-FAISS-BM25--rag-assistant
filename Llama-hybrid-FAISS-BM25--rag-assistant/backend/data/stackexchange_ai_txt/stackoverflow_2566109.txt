There is no way to pause profiled application until profiler "connects"; you simply do not need to do so. Instead, please do the following: Turn on desired profiling modes from startup. For example, if you need to profile CPU usage, start either CPU sampling or CPU tracing with corresponding startup options "sampling" or "tracing". See http://www.yourkit.com/docs/80/help/additional_agent_options.jsp If profiled application is short-running, enable snapshot capture on exit with "onexit=snapshot" startup option. Later open captured snapshot in the profiler UI for analysis.
