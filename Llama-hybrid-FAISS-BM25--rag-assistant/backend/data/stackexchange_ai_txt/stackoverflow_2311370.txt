You need to look up NSFormatter , specifically NSDateFormatter or NSNumberFormatter . A formatter can be added directly to a text field in InterfaceBuilder; you simply drag it from the palette onto the text field. You could also use a datepicker ( NSDatePicker ). You will find all of these in the various palettes in IB.
