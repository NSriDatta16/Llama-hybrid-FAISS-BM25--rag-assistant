The reason could be that the categorical variable you are leaving out has too many levels compared the other variables. From The Elements of Statistical Learning : The partitioning algorithm tends to favor categorical predictors with many levels q; the number of partitions grows exponentially in q, and the more choices we have, the more likely we can find a good one for the data at hand. This can lead to severe overfitting if q is large, and such variables should be avoided. (at paragraph 9.2.4, page 310 -some more references included there). Is is the case that the other 12 categorical variables have much fewer levels compared to the province/county? If that's the case, this could be your issue. From the results you are providing, you could leave it out, also taking into account that "REGIONE" must be (I guess) a higher level version of the info in the county column. Hope it helps.
