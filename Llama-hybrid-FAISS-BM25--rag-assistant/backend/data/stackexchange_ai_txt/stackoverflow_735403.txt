One of the best books is (as mentioned above) the Head First series because it gives great analogies and real-world examples. There are also other decent Java Design Pattern books available. Also, web sites that are specialized on the subject (see posts above for some) Although the Gang of Four book was my first read on this subject, it is my opinion that you should avoid it especially if your starting out. At the time this was the reference, but today many books exist giving you many to choose from. BUT, and I clearly emphasize this point... practice is the ultimate learning tool. After having read several books on the subject, I was 100% certain of knowing and understanding these patterns. When I attempted to actually implement some of them I soon realized that my knowledge was mostly 'theory' and my comprehension wasn't even close. A huge blow to my ego! I set out to test and challenge my peers and quickly learned that they were in the same boat as I was. I find that 99% of programmers proclaim to know patterns but when really put to the test, only about 1/3 actual know the subject well. I set out to implement as many patterns as I could in one or more complex systems. I put theory to practiced and what I learned was a gold mine. One of the most challenging aspects of my experience was that each pattern alone look simple. But sometimes linking a bunch of patterns together can be even more challenging. I encourage you to put theory to practice! Jeach!
