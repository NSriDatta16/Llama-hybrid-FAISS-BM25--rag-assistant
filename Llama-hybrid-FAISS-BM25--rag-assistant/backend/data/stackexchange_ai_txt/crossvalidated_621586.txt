How to address the heteroskedasticity and non-normality of my residuals in my model?

My study is about the influence of board diversity (gender and age) and fund size on the voting behavior of pension funds. I have also included control variables that concern the board type, board size, fund type, and also control for time. This is only a snippet, but I have data on 38 pension funds who have voted on 8 different companies across multiple years. This is why I included random effects (my observations are not independent from each other). Furthermore, Vote is the dependent variable and Gender, Age, Fund_Size are my independent variables. My code looks like this: gam(list(VoteInt ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re"), ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re"), ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size+ Board_Type+ Fund_Type+ Time_Linear+ s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re")+ s(Company, bs = "re"), ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size+ Board_Type+ Fund_Type+ Time_Linear+ s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re")+ s(Company, bs = "re")), family = multinom(K = 4), data = Data_FINAL) And the summary of my model looks like this: Family: multinom Link function: Formula: `VoteInt ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + Time_Quadratic + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re") ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + Time_Quadratic + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re") ~Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + Time_Quadratic + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re") ~ Gender + Age + Board_Size + Board_Type + Fund_Type + Time_Linear + Time_Quadratic + s(Pension_Fund, bs = "re") + s(Company, bs = "re")` Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std.

Does anyone know how I can solve this?
