Theoretical justification for bag of words

Bag of words and visual bag of words are successful machine learning approaches. Does anyone know of a theoretical justification for why / when they work? What I am trying to explain is the good performance on image classification tasks. Why does a 'fingerprint' of low level image features (Eg sift) allow discrimination between object classes and generalisation to new images. So the explanation I think I am after perhaps deals with the statistics of SIFT features. Is it even true that it is good performance, or are the images collected (Eg imagenet) stereotypical, so that training and test set are more related than real world images as might be gathered by a robot exploring its environment.
