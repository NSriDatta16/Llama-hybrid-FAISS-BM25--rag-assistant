Embedding Facebook Connect In A Facebook Page

Our site allows users to register using Facebook Connect . We also have a Facebook page. We'd like to include the "Connect with Facebook" button in our page so a user could instantly connect (aka register) and then be forwarded on to their account on our site. I was hoping to use the Static FBML page application and the FBML iFrame tag to simply embed the button but it looks like the iFrame tag isn't allowed in Facebook pages. Facebook Connect uses JavaScript so I'm wondering if there is some kind of trick I could use like popping up a page in a new window that would automatically display the connect dialog box. Any ideas on how I would include a Facebook Connect button on our Facebook page would awesome! Thanks in advance for your help.
