I can disagree with most comments at my risk. In a more general setting, where a researcher would have a continuous dependent variable and binary independent variable, the logistic regression can be useful in a way, the the input can be the continuous variable and the output will be the binary (independent) variable. This modelling would contain the same estimate of the model but coefficient meaning seems tricky.
