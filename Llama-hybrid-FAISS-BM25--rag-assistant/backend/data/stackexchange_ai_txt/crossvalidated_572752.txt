How to find what categorical variables explain a continuous dependent variable?

I am currently working on a statistical analysis for a project, I have a dependent variable ( $y$ ) that represents delays in days, it's continuous and take integer values. I also have a set of over 90 features/dimensions/predictors, most of them are categorical by nature and nominal. The Problem : I am having a hard time to measure how much a categorical variable (dimension) explain the dependent variable (target), for numerical dimensions I would have used something like the pearson's correlation coefficient. But I'm struggling with categorical variables. I only have 140 rows worth of data, the dependent variable is strongly skewed and heteroscedastic. What I've tried so far First, For some categorical variables I already konw that they do influence the target variable $y$ from business understanding. However I am looking to use a statistical method that would confirm my own intuition. For a bunch of other variables/predictors, I don't have a clue if they do influence or don't. Here's what I have tried : Using Box plots for each categorical predictor, although some charts do confirm my intuition, I am looking for a more formal method. Doing a one way ANOVA, Welch-Anova, and Kruskal-Wallis Test, each of them give quite different results that don't really confirm what I was looking for. The main problem with this is that for each categorical variable, I have different sample sizes with different variances (and sometimes the difference is quite huge). Point biserial correlation : some of the categorical variables are not binary and have 3-10 possible values sometimes. I thought about training a random forest regressor than using the Feature Importance plot, however, I only have 140 rows which is very small for ensemble methods (they might overfit very easily). Any other tests or coefficients or techniques that could help with my situation ? Note : This article suggest to build a classifier for each categorical variable and then using the accuracy of the classifier to assess if a categorical variable is correlated with the target variable, but this doesn't seem right, because if $y$ explains $X$ , doesn't mean that $X$ explains $y$ or did I miss something ?
