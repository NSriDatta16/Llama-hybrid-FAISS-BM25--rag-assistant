Aggregating possible answers from other sources as per my comment: and relatives. If you have places where you generate the src attribute of the img tag, make sure it isn't empty in any freak cases; a handful of browsers take the empty src as a prompt to load the page again. 1 , 2 , 3 The same is true for an empty favicon, javascript or css href - generally anything where you're asking the browser to fetch an external resource, but no url is supplied, even in css 1 . The phenomenom is perhaps a more understandable if you consider, for example, where you're sending form data when you do (or even just ) - namely the same page. .htaccess shenanigans. Check your rewrite rule(s): Are you making the server take a roundtrip to your script for any static content (e.g. favicon 1 )? Do non-existent files trigger a call to your script, and is an external resource link pointing to one (e.g. an ancient css stylesheet that was finally deleted from the filesystem but someone forgot to remove it from the HTML source)? Browser-based debuggers. Some browser-based debuggers, e.g. firebug 1 , will send a second request to the page depending on circumstances, to gather data that wasn't natively supplied to them by the browser itself. Make sure you're not getting that. See if any of those help you.
