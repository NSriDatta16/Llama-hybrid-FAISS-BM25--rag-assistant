You could try fitting an exponential distribution to the inter-arrival times (if you have the times of arrivals in your dataset). In this case, you can do a simple KS Test for the exponential fit. If it fits, then the Poisson fits your count data. See the following reference: ON THE KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST FOR THE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION WITH MEAN UNKNOWN -HUBERT W. LILLIEFORS, AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL, MARCH 1969
