Image autoencoder w/o thousands of dense neurons? prevent large model

I am trying to get around producing large models. If my desired output is a 120x100 image, then do I need a 120*100= 12,000 neuron dense layer preceding it? ... model.add(Dense(120*100))) # The model size comes out to 5GB+ if I do.
