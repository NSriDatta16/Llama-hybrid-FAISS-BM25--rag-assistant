Classic randomized clinical trial analysis uses the intention to treat approach in which all patients are analyzed and they are analyzed using the randomization codes. Secondary analyses may require methods of causal inference. In Demetri’s excellent example, estimation of what would happen were a person to actually engage with the educational intervention requires understanding of causal methods, and in that case there is a perfect instrumental variable (the randomization code) that can lead to unbiased causal estimation of the target effect through an instrumental variable analysis. For the standard primary intent-to-treat analysis no causal inference calculus is needed to make a causal inference about the effect of the plan to give treatment B instead of treatment A. That’s because there are no alternate explanations for the B-A effect other than the planned treatment. This is true in the Bayesian sense of data generating mechanisms or in the frequentist sense of getting the right B-A estimate on the average (over samples). When randomization is properly carried out (including masking when needed), there are no post-randomization exclusions, and there are no post-randomization covariates being adjusted for, the interpretation of the estimated B-A effect is simple and is causal.
