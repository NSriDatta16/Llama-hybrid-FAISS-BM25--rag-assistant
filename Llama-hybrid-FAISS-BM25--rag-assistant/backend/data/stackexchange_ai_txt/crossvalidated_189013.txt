If what you want is to look for a long term steady increase you may want to do a simple regression of SAT vs YEAR. Excel will do just that once you install the data analysis add-on. A test on the slope will tell you if the average yearly increase is statistically significant (I assume you are aware of the many criticisms of statistically significance). The trend is mildly significant (p=0.12) and the regression slope is small (0.0066 points per year). Probably not a very rigorous analysis but likely enough for a managerial report powerpoint (!)
