What is the purpose of a neural network activation function?

What is the purpose of a neural network having a non-linear activation function? Is it correct to say that the non-linear activation function's main purpose is to allow the neural network's decision boundary to be non-linear? I've read in other StackOverflow answers that the activation function " introduces non-linearity ", but that is rather vague. Another posting states that an answer in the context of deep learning features , but again that is not exactly what I'm asking.
