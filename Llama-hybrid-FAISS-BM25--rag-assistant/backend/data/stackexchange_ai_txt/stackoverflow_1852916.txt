We use PHP + Cake. Absolutely avoid Cake. They have painted themselves into a corner by insisting on PHP 4 compatibility. The ad-hoc growth of PHP has made it a bit of a Franken-language. I yearn to use python on a daily basis instead of PHP. This is just a personal opinion, but I encourage you to go the python route. The PHP documentation is sufficient, but excessive. The user-contributed notes create the impression of bulk, but they are often inconsistent. The official documentation is sometimes lacking, and it merges the PHP versions together. By comparison, the python documentation is thoughtful, well organized, and separated by version.
