This is a complex topic - good AI algorithms are generally the ones which can generalize well to "unseen" data. The simplest method is to have two datasets: a training set and an evaluation set used for measuring the performances. But generally, you want to "tune" your algorithm so you may want 3 datasets, one for learning, one for tuning, and one for evaluation. What defines tuning depends on your algorithm, but a typical example is a model where you have a few hyper-parameters (for example parameters in your Bayesian prior under the Bayesian view of learning) that you would like to tune on a separate dataset. The learning procedure would already have set a value for it (or maybe you hardcoded their value), but having enough data may help so that you can tune them separately. As for making those separate datasets, there are many ways to do so, for example by dividing the data you have available into subsets used for different purposes. There is a tradeoff to be made because you want as much data as possible for training, but you want enough data for evaluation too (assuming you are in the design phase of your new algorithm/product). A standard method to do so in a systematic way from a known dataset is cross validation.
