You cannot do DDL in a PL/SQL block like that. You'll need to use execute immediate. You would need to do it like this CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p_createLocaltable IS table_already_exist EXCEPTION; PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT (table_already_exist, -00955); BEGIN execute immediate 'create table local_objects as select * from all_objects where 1=0'; EXCEPTION when table_already_exist then DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('Table already exists , does not need to recreate it'); END; Check the orafaq page on this
