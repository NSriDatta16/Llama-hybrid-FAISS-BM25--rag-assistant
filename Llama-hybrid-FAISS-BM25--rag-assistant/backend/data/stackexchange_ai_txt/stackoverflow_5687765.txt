The buoyant force is equal to the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid displaced (which gives you the mass of the fluid displaced) times the acceleration due to gravity. The volume of fluid displaced can be costly to compute however. I would suggest making a simple estimate of the volume displaced based on the size of the object and how far it is submerged in the liquid. Another very important force in fluid is the drag force. This is what makes it more difficult to move objects at high velocity through thick fluids. The drag force can easily be estimated by simply damping the velocity by some constant value: Force_drag = -b * v where b is your damping value and v is the object's velocity.
