Drag & Drop in KListWidget (PyQt/PyKde programming)

I'm developing a little app (precisely it's a KDE4 plasmoid) in PyQt/PyKde. In my app I have a KListWidget filled with some rows, see this picture: http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/8444/sshot3.jpg I need to implement a drag&drop action for the list rows, for example I should be able to put any file over a row, then the app will send this file to the name on the list. The list has been created by this snippet of code: self.contactsList = KListWidget() self.contactsList.setFrameShape(QFrame.StyledPanel) self.contactsList.setFrameShadow(QFrame.Sunken) self.contactsList.setIconSize(QSize(35, 35)); Method to call when drag&drop happens is already implemented, I need only to connect the method to the list in a way similar to: self.connect(self.contactsList, SIGNAL("signal_()"), self.method) Any help will be appreciated
