Product Mix vs. Sales

I work for a company that sells a small portfolio of products - we'll call them toasters. These toasters vary in quality and price, but all of them will toast your food. We have historic data on our toaster prices, quality, and sales. We had some periods where we were selling only 1 toaster, and other periods where we were selling up to 4 at a time. We'd like to see if there's a way to model the underlying demand for price/quality of toasters. We want to answer questions like: if we launch a new toaster that's a 7/10 on the quality scale, and priced at $26.99, how many sales can we expect? What will that do to sales of our other toasters? Obviously, this is somewhat related to a marketing mix model, but not really the same. We've also thought about simply creating some summary variables about our products and our product portfolio (e.g., ratio of device A's price to average price, current size of portfolio, etc) to get at this. Is there a better way?
