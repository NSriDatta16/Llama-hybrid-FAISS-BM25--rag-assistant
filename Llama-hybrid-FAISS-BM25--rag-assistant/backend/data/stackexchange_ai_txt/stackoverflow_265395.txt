Expression Blend 2 Issue with Creating Silverlight 2 Projects?

I have Expression Blend 2, Service Pack 1, and cannot create a Silverlight 2 project. When I attempt to create a Silverlight 2 project, I get the following error: Blend cannot continue because a compatible Silverlight version could not be found. I installed Blend a few weeks ago, and service packed it yesterday. The order I did things is as follows: "old school" dev stack (VS 2005 Pro, SQL Server 2005 Express, SQL Server Mgmt Studio 2005, Infragistics, etc., all ages ago) Visual Studio 2008 Developer Team Edition SQL Server Management Studio 2008 Expression Web 2 Expression Blend 2 (2 - 5 were a few weeks ago.) Silverlight SDK 2 (yesterday) Expression Blend 2 SP1 (downloaded then installed, yesterday) Expression Blend 2 SP1 (installed straight from Microsoft site, yesterday, after reading this and this online. Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 (yesterday, after giving up on Blend) Aside from the techniques described in the two links (which I've exhausted, and none have worked), does anyone have any advice? Preferably advice that doesn't involve uninstalling and reinstalling my entire dev stack? :) Oh, and for what it's worth, I'm on 64-bit Vista. However, Expression is a 32-bit app (and of course the runtime is 32-bit only). I've posted (essentially) this same question on Blend's own forums . If I get a response there that works, I'll post it here in case anyone else ever has this issue.
