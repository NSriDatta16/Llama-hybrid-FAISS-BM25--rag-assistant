Is it ok if I log/square root transform my variables and then scale them to perform a PCA?

My goal is to carry out an hierarchical cluster analysis using the principal components that explain most of the variance. None of my variables is normal and therefore I think I should transform them (I am following a paper that worked with similar data and they square root and log transformed the variables with a non-normal distribution). Nevertheless, I am unsure if it is ok to transform and then scale the variables before the PCA. Could you confirm if this is correct? Also, to choose the best type of transformation should I try both and then check the normality again of the transformed variables or is there a better method? Thank you in advance.
