Is it possible to have recall and precision of 0 while having an area under PR ~0.5?

As the title suggests, I am running a Random Forest classifier using Scala. To evaluate this classifier (and since I am handling highly imbalanced classes), I used the BinaryClassificationEvaluator library. The area under PR is >0.5 but when I print the confusion matrix, it looks like my recall and precision are 0 (I have 0 TP predictions). Is this mathematically possible?
