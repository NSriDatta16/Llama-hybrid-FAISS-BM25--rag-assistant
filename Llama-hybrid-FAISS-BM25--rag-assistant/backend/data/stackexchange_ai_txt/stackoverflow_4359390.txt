Android Animate Rotate

I did some digging in Android code, and saw the use of in the indeterminate progress bar. after trying to create my own drawable with this tag: I get an error: "No resource identifier found for attribute 'frameDuration' in package 'android'" - which means that frameDuration is a private attribute. Is there a way to use this "animate-rotate" feature? My task is to replace the system's default indeterminate progress bar. I'd like to do it with as little code as possible (just change few attributes if possible). Using the ProgressBar view, setting: android:indeterminateOnly="true" android:indeterminateBehavior="cycle" android:indeterminateDuration="3500" android:indeterminateDrawable="@drawable/pia_sivuvator" and point "@drawable/pia_sivuvator" to that object would've make my task as elegant as they come but I'm stuck on those private attributes. help?
