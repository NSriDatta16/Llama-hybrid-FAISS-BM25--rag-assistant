You can easily search both parameters in a single GridSearchCV: param_grid = {'n_features': [1, 2, 3], 'estimator__C': [0.1, 0.001]} This will be "inefficient" in that it will rebuild RFE from scratch for 1, 2, 3 features. The most efficient way would be running RFECV several times for different values of C and let RFECV do the cross-validation. That's not very elegant, though, and being able to do this efficiently with GridSearchCV would be ideal. I have been wanting to work for this apparently since 2013: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1626
