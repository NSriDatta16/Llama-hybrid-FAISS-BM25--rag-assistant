You can first learn the time series properties by modeling them using a method which determines the Trend, Seasonality, and the Intercept. One such algorithm is the Holt-Winters algorithm. E.g. from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing esm = ExponentialSmoothing(ts).fit() # ts is the time series # Then retrieve trend and other components from the `esm` model On the same model, you now need to build the upper and lower bounds for your data. You can do so by leveraging the residual errors and other components. I can expand on that if needed.
