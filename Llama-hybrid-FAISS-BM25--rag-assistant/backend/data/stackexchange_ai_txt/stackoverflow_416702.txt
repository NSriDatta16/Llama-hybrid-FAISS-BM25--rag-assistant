Have you looked at YUI Calendar Control (from Yahoo)? It is open source and seems to have a lot of functionality. All of their controls are very well documented. The questioner is asking for a full calendar, not just a date picker. The linked page says this: you may also find that the Calendar's foundation classes are a good place to start for more complex interfaces that visually organize date-tagged information (like appointments, photos, events, etc.) I am not aware of any full ajax calendars (like an open source Google Calendar), but it seems like this control might be a good place to start if you wanted to roll your own.
