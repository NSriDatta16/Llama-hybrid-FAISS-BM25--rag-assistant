it looks like TOTAL is the name of a schema ( SELECT * FROM all_users WHERE username = 'TOTAL' ). If this is the case then lecgrouplecture must be a pl/sql function. You will find what it does with Robert 's query: SELECT * FROM all_source WHERE owner = 'TOTAL' AND name = 'LECGROUPLECTURE' ORDER BY line;
