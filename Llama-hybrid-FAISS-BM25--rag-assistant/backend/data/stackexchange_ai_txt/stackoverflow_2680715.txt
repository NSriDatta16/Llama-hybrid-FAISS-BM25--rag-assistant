Here's how it's done generally: (defun sum-squares (list) (loop for x in list for y = (* x x) summing y into total finally (return total))) A do loop solution is even simpler, but not half as elegant: (defun sum-squares (list) (let ((sum 0)) (do ((i 0 (1+ i))) ((>= i (length list))) (setq sum (+ sum (* (nth i list) (nth i list))))) sum))
