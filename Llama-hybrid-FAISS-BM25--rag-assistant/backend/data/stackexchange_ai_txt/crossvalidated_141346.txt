There are situations where it can be much better to take multiple samples of a population rather than a single large one: in agencies where the smaller samples are spread out over time. I've known of organizations that take one large client survey during a year, usually in a single month. In one agency the number was 1,800 out of 9,000 clients, who were given survey forms when they came in for monthly benefits and counseling. There was no time for staff to answer questions about the survey; they were too busy doing their regular jobs; response was low; and the quality of the data were poor. The final numbers, ~1,000, always looked impressive large, but the bias was never investigated. In contrast, another organization took monthly smaller surveys. The number of clients sampled was never more than 50 a month. They were picked at random in advance of their appointments and asked to come in 10 minutes early. A single staffer could administer the interview. She and one other devoted part of their time to managing the survey and to personalized follow ups. contacts. This process had two main benefits from the organization's point of view: 1) Though the monthly samples were small, response was high, and the overall quality of the data was higher; 2) Perhaps more important, the survey information was *current(; it was easy to keep keep running statistics for the survey month, the past two months, and even longer periods. The agency higher ups, knowing the quality of the survey, actually paid attention to the results and suggested topics.
