Any experience with Django multithreading problems?

I'm starting to learn Django through the use of Aymen Hourieh's Book. As I've asked a few developers why Django isn't used in a certain application, I was told there are multi-threading issues with Django. could you tell me what the extent of the multi-threading problems are or were if they've been resolved? I'm also partly basing my question on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)#Server_arrangements (paragraph three): Versions of Django prior to 1.0 had multithreading issues [6] and it would be recommended that those versions of Django only be used in a single threaded server configuration, such as with Apache prefork MPM using mod_python or embedded mode of mod_wsgi. Although Django 1.0 is principally believed to now be thread safe, some minor threading issues are still occasionally being found; it may be prudent to continue to use a single threaded server configuration and/or stay current with Django releases and notices about the multithreading issues.
