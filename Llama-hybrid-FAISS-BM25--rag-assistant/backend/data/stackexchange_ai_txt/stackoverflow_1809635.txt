It looks like you're creating a triangle out of three points. The normals are normals for each point in that triangle. It just so happens that in this case all the normals point in the same direction. That is, they are the same as the surface normal. There are times when you'd want your point normals to be different from the surface normal. Like, when the triangle is a part of an object like a sphere. Then you'd want the point normals to be an average of the surface normals around it. That would allow you to do smooth shading and highlighting instead of just flat shading.
