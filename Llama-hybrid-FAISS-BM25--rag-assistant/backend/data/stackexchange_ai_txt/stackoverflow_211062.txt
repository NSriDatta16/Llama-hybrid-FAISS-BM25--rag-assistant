Copy every nth line from one sheet to another

I have an Excel spreadsheet with 1 column, 700 rows. I care about every seventh line. I don't want to have to go in and delete the 6 rows between each row I care about. So my solution was to create another sheet and specify a reference to each cell I want. =sheet1!a1 =sheet1!a8 =sheet1!a15 But I don't want to type in each of these formulas ... `100 times.I thought if I selected the three and dragged the box around, it would understand what I was trying to do, but no luck. Any ideas on how to do this elegantly/efficiently?
