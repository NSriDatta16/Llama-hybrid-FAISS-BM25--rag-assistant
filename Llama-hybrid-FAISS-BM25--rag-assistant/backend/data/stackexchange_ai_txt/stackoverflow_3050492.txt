How can I set default storage engine used by MySQL?

I've been working on writing SQL to create a MySQL database with several default options, including character set and collation. Is it possible to set the default storage engine for tables in this database to InnoDB? I've been looking through the MySQL 5.1 manual and I've found the statement ENGINE=innodb which would be appended to a CREATE TABLE statement, but I haven't found anything related to a CREATE DATABASE statement. Is there a normal way to do this as part of the database creation, or does it need to be specified on a table-by-table basis?
