If time series are cointegrated they admit VECM representation according to Granger Representation theorem. This is scantily explained in this wikipedia page . So if we have I(1) process: $$X_t=\mu+\Phi D_t+\Pi_1 X_{t-1}+...+\Pi_p X_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t$$ it admits VECM representation $$\Delta X_t=\mu+\Phi D_t+\Pi X_{t-p}+ \Gamma_1 \Delta X_{t-1}+...+\Gamma_p \Delta X_{t-p+1}+\varepsilon_t$$ What this means is that if you difference time series and do a linear regression as per your second approach you are not including the cointegration term $\Pi X_{t-p}$. So your regression suffers from omitted variable problem , which in turn makes the test you are trying to use not viable.
