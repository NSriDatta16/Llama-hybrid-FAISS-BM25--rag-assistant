Well if I'm understanding the problem correctly you can make a binary classification model which takes as input the outputs of the fuzzy model, and then compare it to your original logistic regression model. These are my assumptions: Lets assume you have two systems regarding transaction fraud. Historically you already know if that transaction was indeed a fraud, i.e. $y\in\{0,1\}$. Vector $Y$ represents if each $y_t$ trasaction was a fraud or not, $Y=[y_0,y_1,..,y_t]$. If $X$ is the matrix containing the samples and its features then the logistic regression model will be something like, \begin{equation} \hat{Y} = \hat{f}_1(X,\hat{\theta}_1). \end{equation} where $\hat{f}_1$ is a sigmoid with a linear combination of features ($\hat{\theta}_1$ are the coefficients of the linear regression). If you make a matrix with the outputs of the fuzzy model, let's call it $X_{fuzzyfeatures}$ you can train a new model, \begin{equation} \hat{Y} = \hat{f}_2(X_{fuzzyfeatures},\hat{\theta}_2). \end{equation} Now you can compare $f_1$ and $f_2$ models using ROC. $f_2$ can and should be nonlinear.
