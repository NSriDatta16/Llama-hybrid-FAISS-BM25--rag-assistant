How about if you make a Hudson node on linux? The Windows Hudson server will cheerfully farm out the RPM build to the Linux node (if you tag the build properly or bind it to the agent). Or, you could do the opposite and run a Linux Hudson server and then a Windows node. One day we'll work out how to roll out Windows nodes over EC2 and then we'll be able to fire up a Windows node for the duration of the build.
