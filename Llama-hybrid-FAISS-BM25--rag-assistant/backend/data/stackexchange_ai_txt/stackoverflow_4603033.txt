Merging reports and charts

We are planning to use one of the Pentaho, Birt or Jasper for our reporting and charting needs. We will be embedding the reporting and charting component in our web applications. All these reporting tools have report and chart designed in a XML format. We are looking for a capability where we can merge different individual charts and report to build a super report. Does anyone has any idea, insight, links in this direction? Thanks in advance
