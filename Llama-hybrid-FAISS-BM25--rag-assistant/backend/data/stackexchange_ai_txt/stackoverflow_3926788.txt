Javascript engine with good interoperability with JVM and CLR

Due to the huge resources behind it, Javascript seems to rapidly becoming the scripting language of choice for applications, particularly those with a web front end. I have an application that requires extensibility both on the front and backend. Javascript, or a thin wrapper like CoffeeScript, seems like an excellent, future-oriented, choice. The problem I'm having with using Javascript as the target is interoperability with existing server side libraries. V8 requires custom C++ code. I'd much prefer to leverage the vast resources of the JDK/.NET class libraries and our code that exposes APIs to these languages. Are there any robust efforts that would allow users to call JVM/CLR libraries from Javascript, similar to the elegance of the IronPython-CLR and Jython-JVM link? The alternative is to use something like IronPython/Jython, but both projects have only a fraction of the resources devoted to Javascript and it makes client-side extensibility story very difficult. Has anybody successfully confronted similar issues?
