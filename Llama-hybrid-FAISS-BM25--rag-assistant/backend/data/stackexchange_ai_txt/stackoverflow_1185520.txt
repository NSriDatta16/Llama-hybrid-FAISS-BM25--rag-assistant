I used Silverstripe to develop a heavily trafficked site for a company in the multimedia and entertainment industry. Most of the work was done a year ago, but there has been on going enhancement and maintenance work. I can give you specific details if you want -- DM me on Twitter or email me. In short: if I could go back in time and do it over in another PHP CMS/Framework, I'd probably have used Drupal. It could work well for a simple site that's not too deep and not too wide. But any site that has a complex IA will likely run into trouble. Some issues I ran into: Documentation was incomplete, fragmented and in many cases, non-existent. The administration interface quickly becomes untenable with a site becomes wide and deep. They load every pane via javascript, and things slow to a crawl on a slow computer. (com. wiki note: fixed in 2.4) Silverstripe is incapable of having URLs beyond the first level. Meaning, they only allow urls like /about and not /about/team . You'd need to do /about_team . (wiki note: fixed in 2.4) The separation between Sapphire and Silverstripe is tenuous. Although an attempt has been made to loosely couple the two, it's difficult to truly separate them. (note: much better in 2.4) Every major content type exists on the site tree. Silverstripe is a strictly page based CMS. For example, when creating blog posts, each individual blog post is an item on the site tree. This makes it impractical when scaling out a site with hundreds of blog posts. (note: fixed in 2.3 - ModelAdmin) Frankly, it's slow. The admin is slow. The front-end is slow. opcode caching helps, but it's still slow. (wiki note: better in 2.4) The templating system is weird. It allows you to use custom HTML, which is nice, but the template tags are a little limited. An if conditional in a template, for example, can only except a single AND or OR . You can't chain multiple ones together. It's buggy. During the course of development, I fixed at least 10 bugs in Silverstripe core. Bugs I submitted to their bug tracker were not fixed for months, even when the fix was simple.
