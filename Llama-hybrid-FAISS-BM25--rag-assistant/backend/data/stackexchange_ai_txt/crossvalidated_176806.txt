R: Adjusting exploratory variable's distribution to known (non-normal) distribution

My team is studying ways to improve pharmacy chain sales by using drug coupons. Each row in our dataset, which is just a 10,000-row sample that hopefully reflects the U.S. population --- represents a transaction at a pharmacy's counter. We hope to understand how explanatory variables such as drug price E , along with others such as the kind of illness that a patient has or his level of insurance coverage, could enhance the effectiveness of drug coupons at reducing the probability R that people return a bought item. It is necessary for the sample and population to have similar distribution of E to ensure validity of statistical models linking it to R . Unfortunately, there is a significant discrepancy between the frequency distributions of E in the U.S. population and in the sample (see summary below). In particular, a normal distribution does not seem to describe well the population distribution. What are good things to do in R to make the sample's E -distribution more akin to the population's, hopefully to match it? I have tried filtering off sample data with low E values to no avail. At the same time, I am not quite sure which transformations to use since most of the common transformations attempt to fit data to a normal distribution --- which does not seem applicable here. I myself think that transformations (possibly including weightings) of E are permissible, deletion of rows borderline acceptable, and creation of new rows forbidden --- but I would appreciate any input on what operations are usually considered permissible in contexts similar to mine. Thanks for your input. Best, PDE
