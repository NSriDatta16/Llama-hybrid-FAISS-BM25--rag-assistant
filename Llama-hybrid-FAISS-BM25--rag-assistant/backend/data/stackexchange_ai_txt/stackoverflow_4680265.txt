Paperclip: How to store a picture in a Rails console?

I tried storing a local image in a rails console. Because I have many pictures in my local storage (I use crawler to download tons of pictures), I want to store them into a database, with the benefit of paperclip to do some image job, like thumbnail etc. If I use a webpage to save new pictures to database one by one, it will cost a lot of time. So I want to find a way in rails console (some code) that can batch save-picture-into-database.
