Your colleague is correct, BUT there's where you need to put aside the comp sci textbook and be pragmatic. How often will you be accessing this data from your application? If it's fairly frequently then don't incur the costs of access overhead. Instead of reading from a flat file you could still gain the advantages of a db, but use a caching strategy in your application. Depending on your development language you could look at something like memcache or jtreecache.
