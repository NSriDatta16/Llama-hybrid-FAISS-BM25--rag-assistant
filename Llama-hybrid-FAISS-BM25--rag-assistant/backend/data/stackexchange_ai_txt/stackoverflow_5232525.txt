Recommended Project Structure for Domain Models, Fluent Mappings, Service & Repository

I generally work on web (forms) projects now that contain the following elements: Web Application Domain Models Fluent NHibernate Mappings Repositories Services I would like to know if there is a recommended structure for these? I've seen some solutions that contain: Organization.App.Website The website Organization.App.Core Mappings Models Services Repositories Extensions Helpers Others that split 'Domain' out into a seperate library of its own etc. I just wondered if there is a generally recommended approach that I should adopt going forward?
