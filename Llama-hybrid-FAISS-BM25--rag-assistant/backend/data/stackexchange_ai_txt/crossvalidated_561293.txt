longitudinal data collected over time

I have a data set of 183 subjects in whom I have recorded their oxygen saturations (in percentage units) every 10 second intervals for 60 minutes (360 time points). I have a specific question: I wish to create a nomogram for oxygen saturations in this population for this 60 minutes. Should this be handled as a "time series data" or a relational data (longitudinal data)? Regards
