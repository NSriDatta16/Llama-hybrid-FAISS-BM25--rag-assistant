Calculate posterior probability with given condition

I am new to the world of Bayesian data analysis and I am trying to calculate the posterior probability with a given condition. I know how to calculate the posterior probability, but I am not sure how to do this when having a given condition. Suppose we have two globes: Earth and Mars. The Earth globe is 30% covered with land. The Mars globe covers 100% of the land. Suppose that the tossed observation was a globe with "land". Furthermore each globe was equally likely to be tossed. So I was wondering how can we calculate the posterior probability that the globe was Earth conditional seeing "land"? I know that this could be written to this for posterior probability: $$ P(Earth|land)=\frac{P(Earth)*P(land|Earth)}{P(land)} $$ Then we know the following: $$ P(Earth) = 0.5 $$ $$ P(land|Earth) = 0.7 $$ But how can we calculate the given condition $P(land)$ to determine the posterior probability?
