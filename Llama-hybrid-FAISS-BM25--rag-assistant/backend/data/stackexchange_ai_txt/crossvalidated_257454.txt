Finding correlations between financial time series

I have a task which is related to finding correlations between time series. I have two financial time series given, which contain daily interest rate offers of two financial contributors and I want to find correlations (over time) between these quotes. The frequency and length is equal. The shape of the two time series is very similiar and looks like a upside down V. (upward trend followed by a downward trend) My background in statistics, and particularly in time series analysis, is not very distinct. I know a few basics because I study mathematics but not more. I use the software R. My first approach was to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, but then I read a few topics about spurious correlation and fake correlations in trending time series so this could be not appropriate. Furthermore I read a few topics how to handle such problems, but I am still not sure how to solve my problem with my knowledge. I would start as follows: 1) Use first differences or link relatives (which I found here: http://svds.com/avoiding-common-mistakes-with-time-series/ ) instead of absolute interest rates. 2) The hope is to get weak-stationary series so that I can calculate correlation coefficients (Pearson/Spearman) and cross correlation for different lags. Am I getting this right? Would this course of action be appropriate to get meaningful results? How should I go on to solve the task? Im not looking for the perfect scientific solution, but I want to do a meaningful and solid analysis. Many thanks in advance!
