Construct a tree structure from list of string paths

I have a collection of string paths like ["x1/x2/x3","x1/x2/x4","x1/x5"] in a list. I need to construct a tree-like structure from this list which can be iterated to get a pretty printed tree. like this x1 / \ x5 x2 / \ x3 x4 Any ideas/suggestions? I believe that the problem can be attacked first by processing the list of strings EDIT: The correct answer chosen was an elegant implementation, other suggestions were good too.
