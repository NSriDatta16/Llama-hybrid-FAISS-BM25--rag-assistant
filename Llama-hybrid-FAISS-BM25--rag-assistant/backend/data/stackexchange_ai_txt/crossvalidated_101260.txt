That is a beautiful Coupon Collector's Problem, with a little twist introduced by the fact that stickers come in packs of 5. If the stickers were bought individually the result are known, as you can see here . All the estimates for a 90% upper bound for individually-bought stickers are also upper bounds for the problem with a pack of 5, but a less close upper bound. I think that getting a better 90%-probability upper bound, using the pack of 5 dependence, would get a lot more difficult and would not give you a far better result. So, using the tail estimate $ P[T>\beta n \log n] \leq n^{-\beta+1}$ with $n=424$ and $n^{-\beta+1} = 0.1$ , you'll get to a good answer. EDIT : The article "The collectorâ€™s problem with group drawings" (Wolfgang Stadje), a reference of the article brought by Assuranceturix, presents an exact analytical solution for the Coupon Collector's Problem with "sticker packs". Before writing the theorem, some notation definitions: $S$ would be the set of all possible stickers, $s = |S|$ . $A \subset S$ would be the subset that interests you (in the OP, $A = S$ ), and $l = |A|$ . We're going to draw, with replacement, $k$ random subsets of $m$ different stickers. $X_{k}(A)$ will be the number of elements of $A$ that appear in at least one of those subsets. The theorem says that: $$ P(X_{k}(A) = n) = {l \choose n} \sum_{j=0}^{n}(-1)^j {n \choose j}\left[\frac{s+n-l-j \choose m}{s \choose m}\right]^k $$ So, for the OP we have $ l=s=n=424$ and $m=5$ . I did some tries with values of $k$ near the estimate for the classical coupon collector's problem (729 packs) and I got a probability of 90.02% for k equals to 700 . So it was not so far from the upper bound :)
