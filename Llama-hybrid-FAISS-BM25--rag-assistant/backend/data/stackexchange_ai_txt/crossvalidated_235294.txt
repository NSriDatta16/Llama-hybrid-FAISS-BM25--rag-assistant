If you expect a linear trend then I would suggest using logistic regression where proportion of successes are predicted by Year . This means that you are modeling the increase/decrease of probability of success over time. Given your data this leads to pretty nice fit over short term, but extrapolating it into more distant future would be risky, as such extrapolation is always risky (see plot below).
