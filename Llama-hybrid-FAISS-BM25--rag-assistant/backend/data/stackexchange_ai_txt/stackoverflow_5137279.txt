DUnit may be a better choice that DUnit2. With DUnit you can use the jcl and USE_JEDI_JCL to get the line numbers of failures . DUnit2 doesn't appear to support this. DUNit2 doesn't seem to be getting much attention since Peter's death either. I don't know if it has been updated to use the latest version of delphi but it doesn't look like it.
