Should I keep or remove random effects?

After attempting to produce a linear mixed model, I was left with a great deal of heterogeneity. lme1 The response term Average.payoff is continuous, whilst all explanatory variables are binary. When I look to validate, I can clearly see that the spread of the residuals decreases with the larger fitted values. I decided alternatively to see what would happen if I just fit using gls() . gls1 As you can see the gls() model gives a better fit than the lme() model. Even though I know from the experimental design that I have random effects, am I justified to remove them from the model if the fit is better without them?
