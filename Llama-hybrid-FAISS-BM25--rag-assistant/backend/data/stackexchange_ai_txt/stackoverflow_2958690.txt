Your question is like arguing that race cars don't need steering wheels because it slows them down - nonsensical. All cars need a steering wheel (at least the cars that are built today). Others have already explained in detail why foreign keys are useful for data integrity. In addition, I would like to point out that modern languages and frameworks can use the foreign key metadata in the database to establish object relationships. Linq-to-SQL does this very elegantly. You cannot really work with an Object-relational mapping framework without defining foreign keys whenever data relationships mandate them.
