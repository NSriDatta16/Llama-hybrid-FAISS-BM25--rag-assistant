Removing individuals & properties from RDF

I have a RDF file in my semantic web project and I use Rowlex for manipulating it. I've needed to remove an individual from RDF, so I used .RemoveIndividual(new OwlThing( , )); With this code, I had my individual gone, but it's properties still remained. So I figured out that I should remove it's properties first. Besides I didn't find a command for removing all properties together. So, Question1 : is there a way to remove an individual with all it's properties? or, can I remove all properties in one line of code and not one by one? And how can I remove properties with multiple values. For instance three StudyLists, in example down page. On the other hand, when I tried to remove a property, for example 'useSudyList' from student individual, by this code: student.RemoveuseStudyList(student.useStudyList); I found my RDF file: //other properties ... became like this: //other properties Thus the property was thrown out. I don't have this issue with literal properties. Question2 : what's the problem? Thanks for your attention, and help, in advance.
