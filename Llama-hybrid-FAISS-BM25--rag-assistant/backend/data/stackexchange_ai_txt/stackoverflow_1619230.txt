Instance variables of objects are initialized to nil in alloc (the whole object is bzeroed). Edit: Also, global and static storage variables are initialized to zero (6.7.8 10 of the C99 Standard , thanks Derek for pointing that out). Local stack variables are not initialized automatically. This did not change in known history.
