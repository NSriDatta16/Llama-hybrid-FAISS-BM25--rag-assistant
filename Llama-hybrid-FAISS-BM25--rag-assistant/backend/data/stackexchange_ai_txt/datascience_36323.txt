Grouping/clustering similar words python

I have a question regarding grouping of similar words for example I have list of words give below: artificialintelligence Artificial Intelligence AI Machine Learning ML Data Analytics Data & Analytics I want to group these words into [Artificial intelligence, machine Learning, Data Analytics] I have used difflib.get_close_matches() but that does not give me desired result For example this is how difflib group: Information Technology': ['Information Technology','Mobile Technology', 'newtechnology'] I have also used fuzz.token_set_ratio() but that also does not provide me the desired result. Neither Levenshtein does. If there is any Machine learning algorithm or any python library please let me know. Thank you
