Consider an active learning approach. From Wikipedia's Active learning (machine learning) article: There are situations in which unlabeled data is abundant but labeling data is expensive. In such a scenario the learning algorithm can actively query the user/teacher for labels. This type of iterative supervised learning is called active learning. Since the learner chooses the examples, the number of examples to learn a concept can often be much lower than the number required in normal supervised learning. With this approach there is a risk that the algorithm might focus on unimportant or even invalid examples.
