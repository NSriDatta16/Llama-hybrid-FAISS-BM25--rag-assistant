Have you tried searching CPAN? http://search.cpan.org/search?query=NLP&mode=all I also tried searching for "Natural Language" and found the following that you might be interested in: Lingua::EN::Tagger Also, if you must roll your own, with regards to NLP, you want to check out Regexp::Grammars . This is the successor to Parse::RecDesent.
