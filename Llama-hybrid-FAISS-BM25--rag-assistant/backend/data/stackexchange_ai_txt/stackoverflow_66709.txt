EDI Converter Tool 850 to 940

I need to convert an x12 850 v4010 to a x12 940 v4010. Most of the tools convert from x12 to xml then I would need to map the xml to a 940. I am hoping there is a tool that could convert from one edi document to another. EDIT FOR INFORMATION: Quick Background Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is classically defined as the application-to-application exchange of structured business data between organizations. X12 is an ANSI standard that supplies that structure. There are many good books concerned with the business benefits of EDI, implementation considerations, and operational aspects
