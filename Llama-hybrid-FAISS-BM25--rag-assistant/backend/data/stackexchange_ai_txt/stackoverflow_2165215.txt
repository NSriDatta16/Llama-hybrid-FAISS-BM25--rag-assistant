Yes, there's a way to accomplish what you want in .NET 3.5, without writing separate methods. This blog post deals with the situation you describe: varying the content-type of the response based in the incoming request. But, the post describes a slightly different approach to the solution. In particular, the requester specifies the desired content type NOT in the request URL, but rather in the Accept header of the request. The solution involves the use of a custom WebHttpBehavior that inspects the Accept header and formats the response appropriately. A very elegant solution, in my opinion. There's nothing you have to do in your business logic to get the adaptive formatting. Just attach the behaviour and it works. Also check out the WCF REST Contrib library on CodePlex.
