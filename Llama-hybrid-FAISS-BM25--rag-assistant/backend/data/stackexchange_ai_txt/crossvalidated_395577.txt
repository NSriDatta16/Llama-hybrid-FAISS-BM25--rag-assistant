Adding "Unknown" is a valid way to model missingness explicitly. It would not break your data. Missing data is usually classified as Missing at Random (MAR), Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), or Not Missing at Random (NMAR). This is covered in many places, check this link for a gentle intro. Modelling missingness explicitly is applicable for any of the classifications including NMAR, which is the trickiest to deal with / impute. By the way, there are some algorithms, like Bayesian Networks or XGBoost , that deal with missing values automatically so you do not need to treat them. Indeed Bayesian Networks are usually more practically suitable for use cases where all variables are categorical (which simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities). Hope these help.
