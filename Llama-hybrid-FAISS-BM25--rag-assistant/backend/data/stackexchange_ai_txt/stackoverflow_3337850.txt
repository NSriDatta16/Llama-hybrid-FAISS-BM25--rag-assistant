Yes, you can change the file templates (or simply provide secondary file templates), like so . However, before you do that, I would ask myself: does it really take that much effort to add the desired accessibility? I tend to err on the side of the pragmatic when it comes to this... if I wanted significantly different templates, I might do it. Otherwise... meh.
