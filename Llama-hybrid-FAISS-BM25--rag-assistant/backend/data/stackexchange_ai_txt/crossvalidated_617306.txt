You are making a big assumption that the proportion of "noise" to "length" should be constant over a wide range of "length" values, only differentiated by "group" membership. A simple plot shows an issue in your data that might require more attention: library(ggplot2) ggplot(data=df,mapping=aes(x=log(length),y=log(noise),group=grupo,color=grupo)) + geom_point()+geom_smooth() Group A has a set of much lower values than Group B. The lowest/highest "length" values in Group A are 1520 and 158695. The corresponding value in Group B are 38157 and 147737. Almost half of the Group A "length" values are lower than the lowest value in Group B. Think about why the groups differ so much in the distributions of their "length" values first. Once you've done that there are a few ways to proceed, if your assumption is valid. Beta regression is one choice for proportion data, although I'm not sure it would be good here. You could structure this as a binomial regression. The R glm() function allows for proportion outcomes represented "as a numerical vector with values between 0 and 1, interpreted as the proportion of successful cases (with the total number of cases given by the weights)." You could use "length" as the weights argument, with your proportions as the outcomes. An alternative could be a regression model of "noise" as a continuous function of "length" that includes "group" as a predictor. Including an interaction term between "group" and "length" would allow for a different association between "noise" and "length" depending on "group." It doesn't seem that your data set is large enough to distinguish the groups reliably, but these are general methods to consider for this type of data.
