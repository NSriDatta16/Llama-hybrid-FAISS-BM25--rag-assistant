Bootstrapped coefficients for ordinal logistic regression with R

I am trying to get the bootstrapped confidence intervals of the coefficients for an ordinal logistic regression. Here below, my R code on fake data (reproducible example here below). This one does not work properly. I suppose I need to enter a list of data with one line for each of the 20 subjects (this is the most simple way to proceed). Then the bootstrap with randomly select 20 rows (using sampling with replacement) to generate a new data set with 20 rows. That data set is converted into a new table of counts and a coefficient value is computed from that new “bootstrapped” table. This is repeated for each bootstrap sample. I can't get it! Thanks for your help. #################### library(rms) x=c(1,2,3,2,3,1,2,3,3,3,2,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2) y=c("math","eco","eco","lit","lit","eco","eco","math","math","lit","lit","math","eco","eco","math","lit","lit","math","eco","math") Dataset
