Is there any difference between training a stacked autoencoder and a 2-layers neural network?

Let's say I am writing an algorithm for building 2-layers stacked autoencoder and 2-layers neural network. Are they the same things or difference? What I understand is that when I build a stacked autoencoder, I would build layer by layer. For neural network, I would initialize all the parameters in the netowork, and then for each data point, I pass it through the network and calculate the loss (e.g., euclean distance) and do backpropagation.
