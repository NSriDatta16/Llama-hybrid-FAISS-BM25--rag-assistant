You actually already have a salt value stored in the user table: the pkey of the table. You don't have to invent a new column for storing the salt. Just use the pkey. This idea of course presumes that you do have a pkey associated with a user name. e.g. the user name is not the pkey in the table. This is a near dup wtb: Password hashing, salt and storage of hashed values
