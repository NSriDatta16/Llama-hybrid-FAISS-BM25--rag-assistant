These spontaneous wakeups are also called "spurious wakeups". In the Java specification, the spurious wakeups are permitted (though not encouraged) for jvm implementations. The reason they are permitted is because many implementations may be based on pthreads (POSIX threads), that have this behaviour. Why? Wikipedia: According to David R. Butenhof's Programming with POSIX Threads ISBN 0-201-63392-2: "This means that when you wait on a condition variable, the wait may (occasionally) return when no thread specifically broadcast or signalled that condition variable. Spurious wakeups may sound strange, but on some multiprocessor systems, making condition wakeup completely predictable might substantially slow all condition variable operations. The race conditions that cause spurious wakeups should be considered rare."
