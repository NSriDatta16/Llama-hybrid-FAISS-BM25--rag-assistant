every symbol declared in C++ standard library is part of the std namespace. In order to use these declarations you have to refer it by its full name. namely std::. As MichaelM answered you should use std::vector instead of vector. You can, however, use the following "using declarations": 1. using std::vector; 2. using namespace std; // using namespace ...; is mostly discouraged as it causes a mass-import of symbols into the global namespace On any case, most of the time you should avoid using declaration in header files as it pollutes the global namespace for every user of your header. good luck
