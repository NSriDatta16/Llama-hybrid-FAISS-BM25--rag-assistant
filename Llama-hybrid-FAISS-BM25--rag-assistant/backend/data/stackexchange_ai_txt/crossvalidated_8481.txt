There isn't any indication that your variables here are correlated so I dont know why you would use MCMC as opposed to regular Monte Carlo. There are many different sampling methods including the mentioned stratified sampling (Latin hypercube) and QMC. Sparse quadrature methods are very good if the dimension of the problem is not too high (not more than 10) since sparse quadrature grids grow geometrically (curse of dimensionality). But it sounds like you are on the right track with respect to importance sampling. The key here is to choose a biased distribution that has large probability concentrated near your region of interest and that it has thicker tails than the nominal distribution. I'd like to add that this is an open research problem so if you can come up with something good it would be of great interest to the community!
