JSONP requires the server to support JSONP requests. However if you visit http://api.drop.io/drops/greganddonny/assets.json?api_key=API_KEY_HERE&version=2.0&callback=x the document returned looks like [{"converted..) although it should look like x([{"converted"..) because of the x callback. Apparently drop.io doesn't support JSONP (documentation doesn't tell so either). The only option that's left for you is the classic approach to cross-domain js: Use a Proxy .
