you could probably define an event on base view model, which is fired inside view model whenever an error occurs, then in view, you can subscribe to this event and display the popup. You can carry error context in EventArgs of the fired event. Additionally you could unify the logic for displaying the popup but that's probably another story :) This is testable and nicely decoupled from the view. Hope this helps, Robert
