My two cents... Jini was/is nice, but I think it tried to be a Java-centric CORBA back in the day when corporations were beginning to be reluctant regarding paying the big bucks for what CORBA brought to the table. WS-* specs began to acquire the "accepted-solution" mind-share in the industry. I think there was a small window where Jini could have grabbed substantial market share, but it never happened. Sun wanted too much money for what Jini brought to the table compared to other alternatives. I would love to hear from folks that disagree! My opinion is that Jini is sound tech, but business-wise has no future in the enterprise. It may find a niche elsewhere, depending on what Oracle decides to do with it.
