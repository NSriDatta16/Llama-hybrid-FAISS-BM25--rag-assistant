What is quite funny is that you could get away with it by initializing it later on: Derived::Derived(): Base() { this->setInter(this); } is fine, because all attributes have been initialized. This way you won't have to change your whole design just to get away with the warning. However, unless the setInter does not do anything with this apart some storage, you might access an object you did not fully initialized (so storing a hash value could be awkward).
