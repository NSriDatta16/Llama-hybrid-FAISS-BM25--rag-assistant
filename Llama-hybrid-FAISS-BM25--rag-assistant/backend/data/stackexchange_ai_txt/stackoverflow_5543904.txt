Hrm. Ok.... We work using a UIAutomation opensource framework called, "alexvollmer-tuneup_js" taken off of SourceForge. It is freely available, and modifications are encouraged (and the author requests that you branch your versions of his code to share with others). He has a file named assertions.js to which he has two functions assertTrue(), and assertFalse(). I use those in another file that he includes called 'uiautomation-ext.js' that is imported into my test file(s). In uiautomation-ext.js, I have added two functions: /** * Asserts that the given button is disabled. */ buttonIsDisabled: function(buttonName) { assertFalse(UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().mainWindow().buttons()[buttonName].isEnabled(), "The button: " + buttonName + " is disabled."); }, /** * Asserts that the given button is ENABLED. */ buttonIsEnabled: function(buttonName) { assertTrue(UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().mainWindow().buttons()[buttonName].isEnabled(), "The button: " + buttonName + " is enabled."); } These two functions are placed within a JDOS object within uiautomation-ext.js called 'extend(UIAWindow.prototype'. I am not entirely sure that I have conveyed what I/we have done as clearly as I would like, but I have done my best here. Good luck to all! SteveO
