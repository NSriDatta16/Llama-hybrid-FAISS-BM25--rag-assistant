I'll take the liberty of suggesting you use a custom control of my own invention. It's called a ProportionalPanel and it does just what you need - spaces items evenly. You could use it for the ItemsPanel in the inner ListBox instead of the StackPanel. I also provide the source code, so you can tweak the logic any way you like. The relevant post on my blog is here .
