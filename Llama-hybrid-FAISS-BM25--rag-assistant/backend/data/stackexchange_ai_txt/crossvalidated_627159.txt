If the Bayesian believes that just about all coins are fair, yes, the Bayesian would use a prior that emphasizes $0.5$ . However, if the Bayesian starts flipping the coin and gets a billion straight heads, the posterior will (or at least should) start to favor a high probability of flipping heads, unless the prior puts all density on $0.5$ (or no density toward the coin favoring heads). Remember that frequentist and Bayesian inferences are used to use the known data to infer something about the unknown, such as the probability parameter of a Bernoulli distribution. Once you show the Bayesian the coin for her to see that it has heads on both sides, she no longer has to make an inference about the probability. She knows the population distribution.
