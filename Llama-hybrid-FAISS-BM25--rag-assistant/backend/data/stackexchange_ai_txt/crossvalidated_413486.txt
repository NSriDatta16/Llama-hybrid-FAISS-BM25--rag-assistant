My instincts say to normalize after extracting the time invariant features. Generally the purpose of normalization is to comparably scale different input values for the benefit of (or requirements of) a particular learning algorithm (or feature selection/dimensionality reduction). Also, in your particular case, if by “scaling before extracted features” you mean scaling the individual time series, the “min” and “max” features will most likely (depending on your choice of scaler) be “0” and “1” respectively (for each time series), so that feature would be useless.
