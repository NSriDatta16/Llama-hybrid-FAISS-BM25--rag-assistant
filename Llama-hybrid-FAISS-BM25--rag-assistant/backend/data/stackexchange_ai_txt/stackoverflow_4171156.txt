question on C preprocessor definitions

Hi I am currently installing a software called super LU and in the README file there is the following instruction for modifying a makefile depending on system set-up. C preprocessor definition CDEFS. In the header file SRC/Cnames.h, we use macros to determine how C routines should be named so that they are callable by Fortran. (Some vendor-supplied BLAS libraries do not have C interfaces. So the re-naming is needed in order for the SuperLU BLAS calls (in C) to interface with the Fortran-style BLAS.) The possible options for CDEFS are: o -DAdd_: Fortran expects a C routine to have an underscore postfixed to the name; o -DNoChange: Fortran expects a C routine name to be identical to that compiled by C; o -DUpCase: Fortran expects a C routine name to be all uppercase. A Makefile is provided in each subdirectory. The installation can be done completely automatically by simply typing "make" at the top level. I am not really sure what this instruction means. Which of these three options should I choose?
