Methods for guestimating upstream bitrate using http streams

I'm writing a little Java client side app which uploads things using http streams to remote servers, i've included a progress bar to provide the user with an estimate of completion. Currently the program sends a small file to a remote server and calculates the upstream bitrate based on the filesize/total transfer time. I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this? Any thoughts/tips? Thanks
