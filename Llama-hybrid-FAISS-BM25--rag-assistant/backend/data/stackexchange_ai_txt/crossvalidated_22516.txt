First, categorizing continuous variables is generally a bad idea; Royston, Altman and Saurbrei wrote a good article on why dichotomizing is bad, and the same arguments apply to more categories. Altman wrote an article on categorizing variables, but only the abstract is freely available, and I have not read the whole article. Second, the assumptions of linear regression are not that the dependent variable is normally distributed, but that the residuals from the model are. So, before you can see if your model violates the assumptions, you need to run it and look at the results. Third, if the residuals are not normally distributed, you have several choices: Multinomial logistic regression with the four categories you list Ordinal logistic regression with "mixed" excluded. Looking at each category separately Some sort of robust regression Before doing any of these, my impulse would be to look at the variables graphically, with density plots and possibly quantile normal plots.
