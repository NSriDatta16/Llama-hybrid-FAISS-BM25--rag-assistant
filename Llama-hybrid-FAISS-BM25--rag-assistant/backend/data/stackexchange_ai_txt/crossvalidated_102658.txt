Why does PCA maximize total variance of the projection?

Christopher Bishop writes in his book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning a proof, that each consecutive principal component maximizes the variance of the projection to one dimension, after the data has been projected to orthogonal space to the previously selected components. Others show similar proofs. However, this only proves that each consecutive component is the best projection to one dimension, in terms of maximizing the variance. Why does this imply, that variance of a projection to say 5 dimensions is maximized choosing first such components?
