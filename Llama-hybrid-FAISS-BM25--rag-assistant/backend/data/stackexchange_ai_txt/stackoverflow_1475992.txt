C++ thinks '<<' is not a member of class, but it is

I have to write a simple log class, that would write the output to a file. I want it to work with overloading the MyLog log("C:\\log.txt"); log But Visual C++ tells me: "error C2039: ' I don't know what I am doing wrong. Here is the code: MyLog.h #pragma once #include #include #include using namespace std; class MyLog { private: ofstream logfile; public: MyLog(char* filename); friend MyLog& operator MyLog.cpp #include "MyLog.h" MyLog::MyLog(char* filename) { logfile.open(filename); } MyLog& MyLog::operator Does anyone know what is wrong?
