Drag drop to a Silverlight application from other surfaces outside of the Silverlight application is available only in Silverlight 4 and is limited to a file list payload. Hence the only drag drop function you may be able to achieve between a WPF app and Silverlight is if you initiate the drag operation in the WPF app and include a standard file list as part of the Data attached to the drag.
