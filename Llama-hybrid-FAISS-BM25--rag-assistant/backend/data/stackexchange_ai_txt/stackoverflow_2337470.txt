SVN move single directory into other repository (with history)

Related question: Moving repository trunk to anotherâ€™s branch (with history) I know that one can dump a complete SVN repository with history and load it into a user-defined (sub)directory of the target repository using: // in source repo > svnadmin dump . > mydumpfilename // in destination repo (backslashes because I'm using Windows) > svnadmin load . But this will import the full repository into the target repository's sub-directory. What I want is to define a sub-directory in the source repository that should be exported. Something like svnadmin dump . --source-path old\sub\dir > mydumpfilename . How can I achieve that? If TortoiseSVN can do that, please say so ;) SOLUTION: Thanks to Tim Henigan's answer, here's the correct way to do it: // execute in destination repo svndumpfilter include source\sub\dir Hope this will help others, too...
