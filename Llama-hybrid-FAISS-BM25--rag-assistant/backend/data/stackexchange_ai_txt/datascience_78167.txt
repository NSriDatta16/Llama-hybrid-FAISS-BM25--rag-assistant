Negative correlation is not the same as low correlation. If variables $x$ and $y$ have a correlation value of $c$ , then $-x$ and $y$ will have a correlation of $-c$ . When people talk about "low correlation" they usually mean correlation that is close to 0. In the context of machine learning, negative correlation is just as good as positive correlation; do your filtering based on the absolute value of the correlation.
