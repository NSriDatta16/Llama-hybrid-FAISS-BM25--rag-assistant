New to Encryption with PHP, Direction Please?

I'm working on a very small form that accepts credit card numbers, which will be cleaned out shortly thereafter. For the time they exist in the database, I'd like them to exist in a comfortable state of encryption. Unfortunately, in my many years of web-development, programming, and database-development, I've not once had the opportunity to educate myself in the area of encryption. Is there are relatively easy-to-implement method of encrypting credit card numbers that I can implement quickly? A set of functions, class, anything at all that will get the job done, and done well? I am taking this opportunity to educate myself on the issue, but due to time-sensitivity, more than just a nudge in the right direction is requested. Language: PHP / Storage: MySQL
