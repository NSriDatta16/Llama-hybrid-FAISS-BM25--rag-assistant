Is there a suggested solution structure for ASP.NET MVC Production Apps

In general, I don't like to keep code (BaseClasses or DataAccess Code) in the App_Code directory of an ASP.NET Site. I'll usually pull this stuff out into a MySite.BusinessLogic & MySite.DataAccess DLL's respectively. I'm wondering should I be doing the same for ASP.NET MVC. Would it be better to Organise the solution something along the lines of MySite.Common - DLL - (Basic Functionality built on .NET System Dlls) MySite.DAL - DLL - (DataAccessLayer & DBML Files) MySite.Models - DLL - (MVC Models e.g. Repository Classes) MySite.Controllers - DLL (MVC Controllers which use Models) MySite - ASP.NET MVC Site. Or am I missing something... presumably, I'll lose some of the nice (Add View, Go To Controller, context menu items that have been added)
