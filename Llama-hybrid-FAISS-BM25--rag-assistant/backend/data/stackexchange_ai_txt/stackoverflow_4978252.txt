How to detect when a SWT Shell is being dragged to a new location on the screen

I am a newbie to SWT, but I have been unable to detect when my Shell begins being dragged by the user to a new location on the screen. I can get a controlMoved event when the dragging has been completed, but that is too late because I want to take some actions when the movement begins. I thought of trying to detect when the mouse was pressed in the shell Title Bar and then when it was subsequently released, but I have not found a way to detect that either. I am working on OSX with Cocoa. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Brian McGann
