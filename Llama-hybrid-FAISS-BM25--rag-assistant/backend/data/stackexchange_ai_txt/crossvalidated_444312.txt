Is autoencoder for anomaly detection a transfer learning?

I am doing a binary classification with unsupervised learning. I learn an autoencoder on samples from class0 and then predict samples from both class0 and class1. Then I classify sample according to reconstruction error (small = class0, high = class1). Is this a transfer learning? I mean, the main task is to learn representation of class0, which is then transfered to decide between class0 and class1. If no, why?
