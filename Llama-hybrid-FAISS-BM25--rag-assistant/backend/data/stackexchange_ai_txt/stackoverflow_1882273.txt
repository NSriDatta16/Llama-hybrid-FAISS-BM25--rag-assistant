Storing resources into "sub-bundle"?

I'd like to know if it is possible to store resources data into "sub-bundles" or "sub-packages" that I could put into my main AppBundle. Indeed, I'd like to create a kind of player that reads "content packages", which are all organized the same way, with a standard hierarchical organization : Package1: - index.txt - credits.txt - Pictures/ -- Pic1.png -- Pic2.png - Movies/ -- intro.mov -- outro.mov My problem is that I can't find any way to make benefit of a hierarchical organisation into my Application package - I mean that I don't know how to distinguish "Folder1/index.txt" from "Folder2/index.txt", because I just use the "index.txt" identifier when I try to load the content of the file ... I hope someone could help me, by the way I apologize for my poor english, Cheers,
