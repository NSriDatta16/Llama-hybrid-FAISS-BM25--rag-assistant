(This isn't a direct answer to the question, more a bunch of references relating to why the approach should be avoided.) Some of the issues include downward bias in estimation of effects, inflation of error variance and (consequently) low power. There's also the dependence issue that impacts the calculation of p-values (i.e. p-values calculated in the 'usual' way are not correct). There's a wealth of material on why median (etc) splits of variables are a bad idea. http://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/gradstat/psych341/lectures/Factorial2Folder/Median-split.html http://psych.colorado.edu/~mcclella/MedianSplit/ http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/stathelp/Dichot-Not.doc MacCallum, R. C., Zhang, S., Preacher, K. J., & Rucker, D. D. (2002). On the practice of dichotomization of quantitative variables. Psychological Methods, 7, 19â€“40. here Aiken, L. S., & West, S. G. (1991). Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/continuous-and-categorical-variables-the-trouble-with-median-splits/ Google turns up a bunch more references and links Cutting in 3 or 4 doesn't avoid the problems but it's not quite as bad. If you do cut into more than two segments, you're not necessarily best off making them all the same size, or giving them all the same weight, though optimal sizes and weights will depend on what you are doing (a straight up ANOVA would be different from a regression-like model where you're trying to find how much the response changes on average with a given amount of change in the predictor).
