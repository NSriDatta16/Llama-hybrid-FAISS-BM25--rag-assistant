Maping one spectral data to another with CNN

We have a data from Vis spectrometer that is normalized but needs correction. We also have data from calibrated colorimeter. Idea is to learn a neural network that will correct spectra from the vis spectrometer so they would resemble spectra from the colorimeter. I trained convolutional auto-encoder to do this but results are barely satisfying. Are there any known architectures and papers on this matter? I wasn't able to find any. Architecture of my auto-encoder looks like that: c1 = Conv1D(16, 11, strides=1, padding='same')(input) a1 = Activation('relu')(c1) m1 = MaxPool1D(pool_size=2, padding='same')(a1) c2 = Conv1D(32, 9, padding='same')(m1) a2 = Activation('relu')(c2) m2 = MaxPool1D(pool_size=2, padding='same')(a2) c3 = Conv1D(64, 7, padding='same')(m2) a3 = Activation('relu')(c3) m3 = MaxPool1D(pool_size=2, padding='same')(a3) c4 = Conv1D(128, 5, padding='same')(m3) a4 = Activation('relu')(c4) u1 = UpSampling1D(2)(a4) uc2 = Conv1D(64, 7, padding='same')(u1) a7 = Activation('relu')(uc2) u2 = UpSampling1D(2)(a7) uc3 = Conv1D(32, 9, strides=1, padding='same')(u2) a8 = Activation('relu')(uc3) u3 = UpSampling1D(2)(a8) uc4 = Conv1D(16, 11, strides=1, padding='same')(u3) a9 = Activation('relu')(uc4) u4 = UpSampling1D(2)(a9) flat = Flatten()(a9) dens = Dense(input_size, activation='sigmoid')(flat) return Model(inputs=[input], outputs=[dens]) Edit: I have over 660 spectra of colores measured by colorimeter on calibration plate. I also have vis-spectrometer that measured the same calibration plate. Data from spectrometer is normalized. Neural network is trained on 660 spectra, where each training set consists of 224 bands of data from spectrometer as training data and 224 bands of data from colorimeter as ground truth. That gives 147840 data points of both training and ground truth data. Presented model work to some degree in correcting spectrometer data. This is representation of the calibration plate with spectra from colorimeter and from predictions from trained model
