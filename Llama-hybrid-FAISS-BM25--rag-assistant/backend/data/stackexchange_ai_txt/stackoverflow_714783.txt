Personally, I'd couple your special character removing with a date so your example would look like: http://myblogsite.xom/posts/2009/04/03/my_first_yet_not_so_bad_cupcake That way, if you content with the same title, it gets differentiated by date too. I see this often on some blogs I visit where they use "Five Random Things Make A Post" a lot (but not within the same day).
