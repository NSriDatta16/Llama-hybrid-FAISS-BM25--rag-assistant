Using Bayes Rule to make inference about conditional probability using sample proportions

Suppose your target is to estimate $P(A|B)$, but it is impossible to do so directly. However, you have reasonable estimates of $P(B|A)$ $P(B)$ $P(A)$ from separate sources. Generally these are estimated with error, but in my application, it's likely that the first two are measured with basically no error (e.g. using population census data). So, it seems reasonable to estimate the target probability as $$ \widehat{P}(A|B) = \frac{ \widehat{P}(B|A) \cdot \widehat{P}(A)}{\widehat{P}(B)} $$ I don't see how to formulate this as a Bayesian modeling problem, using the usual tricks. The idea I keep coming back to is this: Obtain a 95% confidence interval for $P(A)$ Across a grid of values for that CI, calculate $\widehat{P}(A|B)$ My questions: (1) Would that give a valid 95% CI for $P(A|B)$? (2) In greater generality, is there a clever way to get a CI if all three probabilities on the right hand side are measured with error? (3) What if, for example, I didn't know $P(A)$ and instead specified a prior probability. Does this change anything, relative to (1), or would this just be called "sensitivity analysis"?
