SVM is a linear classifier which means that it can only learn to decide which side of a straight line the points should go. To make a square you obviously need four straight lines. So the short answer is no a linear SVM can not learn a square. However, you can apply a kernel function to your data to map it into a higher dimension. If you choose the right kernel, there could be a high dimensional line that corresponds roughly to a square in the lower dimensional space. Think of it like this. Your points lie on a piece of paper and the SVM is a pair of scissors that gets to make one straight cut. You want to capture just the points in the square with that one cut. If the page is flat you can't do it. If you pinch the paper in the middle of the square so that part is raised. you could cut below the pinch and with a single cut select those points.
