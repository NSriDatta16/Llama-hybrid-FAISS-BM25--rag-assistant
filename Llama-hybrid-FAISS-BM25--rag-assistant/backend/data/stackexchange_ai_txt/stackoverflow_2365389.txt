variable instance number in snmp traps

Suppose I'm writing an SNMP v1/2 agent. Is it mandatory to append the instance number to the variable OIDs in a trap PDU? In SNMP V1 for instance a trap is defined in RFC 1157, with these fields: Enterprise Agent address Generic trap type Specific trap code Time stamp Variable bindings The "variable bindings" section consist of a list of variable names and values. According to RFC 1157 : In general, the name of an SNMP variable is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the form x.y, where x is the name of a non-aggregate object type defined in the MIB and y is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment that, in a way specific to the named object type, identifies the desired instance. What's bothering me is the "In general", is the .y mandatory?
