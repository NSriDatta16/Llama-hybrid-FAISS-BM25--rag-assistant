What do these vertical lines mean in a cross validation result?

I'm doing a regression problem using a convolutional neural network. When I was checking my model using 6-fold cross validation. There are always several vertical lines in which samples are dramatically predicted incorrectly. I tried tuning many parameters, the Pearson correlation coefficient will increase or decrease. But no matter what my model is, there are always those vertical lines. I just have no idea what does these vertical lines mean. What does it imply my model's capability? More details: Data My data are binary encoded sequence data, just like '010001001'. The input sequence are 9-length sequence ,I padded as 13-length. Model Input layer (1x13) || Conv layer (512 filters, 1x2) || Batch_norm || Exponential Linear Units || MaxPool (1x2) || Conv layer (512 filters, 1x3) || Batch_norm || Exponential Linear Units || Fully connected layer (400 neurons), use tanh activation || Fully connected layer (1 neuron), output layer
