There's only two ways to get info from an email account, connect to it, reading it regularly (for example, by a cron-job) for new messages, or have the email forwarded to your own server, which pipes new email arriving into a PHP script. Zend_Mail , part of the Zend Framework has Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap (which can be used without the rest of the MVC structure) which can connect to Gmail to poll an account.
