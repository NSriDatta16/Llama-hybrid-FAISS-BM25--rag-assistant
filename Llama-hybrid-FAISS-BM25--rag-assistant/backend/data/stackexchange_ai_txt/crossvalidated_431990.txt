How does square of dot product can be compared to a similarity in terms of circle

When reading about SVM and Kernel Trick, a common similarity function which is often used is which is taken from this blog I am trying to understand how this is related to equation of circle. Since this Kernel is being used to separate data which is distributed like a circle. Following the complete math which is not in this blog but explained in this video, this is equivalent to square of dot products in lower dimension $(X^TY)^2$ . This is explained in this video tutorial in detail (around 3:00). However, I do not get it how he arrived from $(X^TY)^2$ to equation of circle .
