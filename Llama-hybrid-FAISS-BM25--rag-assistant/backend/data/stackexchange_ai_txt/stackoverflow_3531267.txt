The parameter in the callback function ( dadosResposta in this case) contains whatever the server-side script returns. For example, if the server side script was just returning the word "completed" in plain text, dadosResposta would be the string "completed" . In this particular case, the data is JSON, which allows the data to be better organized so that specific fields can be accessed as in dadosResposta.nsName .
