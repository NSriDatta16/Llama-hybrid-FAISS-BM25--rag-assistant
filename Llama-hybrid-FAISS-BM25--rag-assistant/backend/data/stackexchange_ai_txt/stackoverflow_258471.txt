Look for the amount of ViewState being created and the execution time of your database calls needed to create the controls. Use the page trace option to do this. This should show you where the executing time goes and which controls a the largest in means of html-size. In your specific case (Tabstrip) it could be a good strategy leveraging the page by implementing the content of some tabs (tabs which are not always opened by the user) as dedicated pages loaded in an iframe on demand - activated by a Javascript function.
