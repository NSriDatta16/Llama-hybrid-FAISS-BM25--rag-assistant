This seems to be a known error in the package that can be solved by installing googletrans==4.0.0rc1 as mentioned in the github issue . This indeed seems to solves the issue when trying it myself: from googletrans import Translator translator = Translator() translator.translate('Buongiorno mi chiamo Alberto').text # Good morning my name is Alberto
