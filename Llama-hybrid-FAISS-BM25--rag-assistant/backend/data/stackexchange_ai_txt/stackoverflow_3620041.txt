Your Timing is not a singleton. Multiple objects can be created. Singleton's typically rely on a static method and a private ctor and no copy ctor or op= . You have two choices: Either create a static member Timing for Agent Or, create a Timing& member for Agent and convert Timing to a proper singleton Depending on your design, if the Timing object is never changed by the Agent objects you may go ahead const qualify the member.
