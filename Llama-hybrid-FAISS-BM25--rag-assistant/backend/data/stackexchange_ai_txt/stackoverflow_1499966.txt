Integrating Interwoven Teamsite into SharePoint for Content Management

I'm working on a roadmap to re-architect our corporate intranet, and I'm stuck on a hard decision around content management. We own licences for Interwoven TeamSite , and we use it to manage our content for our externally-facing internet site, our main intranet, and a couple of big internal knowledge exchanges. It's looking likely that I'll recommend Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 for the main platform for the intranet. I saw a demo yesterday of a great intranet based on SharePoint with the Microsoft CMS for content management, and I'd like to do something similar, except leveraging our current Interwoven installation. Does anyone have any experience with this type of integration? Any 'gotchas' or lessons learned from integrating Interwoven and SharePoint?
