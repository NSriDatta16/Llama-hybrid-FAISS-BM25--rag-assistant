Can Hosmer-lemeshow chi-square statistic explain calibration?

I'm doing a logistic regression and created a calibration plot. I also conducted a Hosmer-Lemeshow test and got the corresponding chi-square. Is there any relationship between the calibration plot and the chi-square? It is reasonable to put the chi-square value on the calibration plot (to show the result)?
