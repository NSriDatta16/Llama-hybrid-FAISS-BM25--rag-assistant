Possible infinite loop on math equation?

I have the following problem, and am having trouble understanding part of the equation: Monte Carlo methods to estimate an integral is basically, take a lot of random samples and determined a weighted average. For example, the integral of f(x) can be estimated from N independent random samples x r by alt text http://www.goftam.com/images/area.gif for a uniform probability distribution of xr in the range [x1, x2]. Since each function evaluation f(xr) is independent, it is easy to distribute this work over a set of processes. What I don't understand is what f(x r ) is supposed to do? Does it feed back into the same equation? Wouldn't that be an infinite loop?
