Excellent answers already. One domain which I can think of, and is working extensively in, is the customer analytics domain. I have to understand and predict the moves and motives of the customers in order to inform and warn both the customer support, the marketing and also the growth teams. So here, neural networks do a really good job in churn prediction, etc. But, I found and prefer the Bayesian networks style, and here are the reasons for preferring it: Customers always have a pattern. They always have a reason to act. And that reason would be something which my team has done for them, or they have learnt themselves. So, everything has a prior here, and in fact that reason is very important as it fuels most of the decision taken by the customer. Every move by the customer and the growth teams in the marketing/sales funnel is cause-effect. So, prior knowledge is vital when it comes to converting a prospective lead into a customer. So, the concept of prior is very important when it comes to customer analytics, which makes the concept of Bayesian networks very important to this domain.
