Terminate a sockert.recv in a thread in Python

To implement a simple protocol in python, I've used a thread to monitor acknowledgements send by the receiver. To do this, I use a thread in a function def ackListener(self): while self.waitingforack: ack = self.socket_agent.recv(4) ... exit() where self.waitingforack is a boolean I set to False when I've received an acknowledgement for every messages I've sent. The problem is that my code is blocking at the self.socket_agent.recv(4) operation, the modification of the value of waitingforack is done too late Is there a way to force the Thread to terminate when I'm not waiting for ack anymore ? Thank you
