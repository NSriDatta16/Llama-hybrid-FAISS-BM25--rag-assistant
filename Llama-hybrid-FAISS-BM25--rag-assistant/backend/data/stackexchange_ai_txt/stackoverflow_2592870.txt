NCover couldn't create a coverage report. 0 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Skipped

I am using Visual Studio 2008 Professional with TestDriven.NET 2.14.2190, Windows XP (x86). When i right click on my unit tests project, test with - Coverage, I obtain the following output: NCover couldn't create a coverage report. and the result: 0 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Skipped I have no other versions of NCover installed, just the VS and TestDriven .NET The actual testing is performed as expected - all tests successfully pass (so, there's nothing wrong with my class) Does anyone know what could be the problem?
