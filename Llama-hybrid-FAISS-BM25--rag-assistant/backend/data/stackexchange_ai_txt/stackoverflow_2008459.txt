What do you need to store as a value ? Strings ? Ints ? Objects (e.g. serialized Java objects). A simple implementation would work with a 3 column table looking like: NAME(VARCHAR) TYPE(VARCHAR) VALUE(VARCHAR) (perhaps the TYPE is some enumeration). The above wouldn't work for binary data like serialised objects, though and perhaps you need a BLOB there. Alternatively (and probably a much better idea), have you seen Apache Commons Configuration ? You can back that with a database (via JDBC) and you can store properties such that you retrieve them thus: // get a property called 'number' Double double = config.getDouble("number"); Integer integer = config.getInteger("number"); That may save you a lot of grief in terms of implementation. You may have a problem with saving binary data, in that you'd have to serialise it prior to insertion and post-retrieval. But I've used this in the past for storing ints,doubles and serialised Java objects via XStream, so I can confirm it works well.
