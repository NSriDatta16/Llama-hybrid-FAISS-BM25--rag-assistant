How can I find text nodes in an HTML snippet?

I'm trying to parse an HTML snippet, using the PHP DOM functions. I have stripped out everything apart from paragraph, span and line break tags, and now I want to retrieve all the text, along with its accompanying styles. So, I'd like to get each piece of text, one by one, and for each one I can then go back up the tree to get the values of particular attributes (I'm only interested in some specific ones, like color etc.). How can I do this? Or am I thinking about it the wrong way?
