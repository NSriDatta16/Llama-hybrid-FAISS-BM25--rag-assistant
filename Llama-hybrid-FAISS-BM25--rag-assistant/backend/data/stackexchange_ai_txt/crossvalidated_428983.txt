Chi squared test to confirm game is fair and consistent with paytable

I have a game that people can play. They play 1.0 in game currency and can win an amount of in game currency ranging from 0.0 to 25.000 in game currency. I have orchestrated it so the expected return for a customer is 0.35. The game has been played 17000 times and the average amount of in game currency won is 0.298 of the total amount played. How can I craft a test to check whether there is some bias somewhere? I was thinking a ch i squared test but would I need to do 17000 calculations of (win - 0.35)^2/0.35 and then sum these and compare to the chi squared table with n=17000 degrees of freedom? Or am I totally off the mark?
