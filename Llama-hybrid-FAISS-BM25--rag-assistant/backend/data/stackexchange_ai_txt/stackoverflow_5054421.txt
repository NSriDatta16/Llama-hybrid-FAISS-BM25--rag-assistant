If you have a working method, and you haven't identified a performance problem, then the method you have now is just fine. Don't go trying to find a better way to do it unless you know it doesn't meet your needs. On inspection it seems that on the java side, a double (64 bytes) will be about 4 characters (16 bytes * 4). Now, when I think of your average double, let's say 10 digits and a decimal point, plus some delimiter like a space of semicolon, you're looking at about 12 characters per decimal. That's only 3x as much. So you originally had 80k of data, and now you have 240k of data. Is that really that much of a difference?
