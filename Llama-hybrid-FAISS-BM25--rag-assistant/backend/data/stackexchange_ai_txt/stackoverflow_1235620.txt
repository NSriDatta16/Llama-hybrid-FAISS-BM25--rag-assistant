A RDBMS. Nothing is more realiable than using tables on a well known RDBMS. Postgresql comes to mind. That automatically gives you some choices for the future like clustering. Also you automatically have a lot of tools to administer your database, and you can use it from other software written in virtually any language. It is really fast. In the "feel like python" point, I might add that you can use an ORM. A strong name is sqlalchemy . Maybe with the elixir " extension ". Using sqlalchemy you can leave your user/sysadmin choose which database backend he wants to use. Maybe they already have MySql installed - no problem. RDBMSs are still the best choice for data storage.
