You can consider using MongoDB , and this could be a good exercise to learn a NoSQL database. It uses BSON as the storage format, and has a very simple query language . You can write complex queries (including mapreduce) in Javascript. Since you want to program in Java, it has a Java Driver , and if you want, you can use an ORM like Morphia to make it even simpler. It supports indices and in-place updates/upserts for your update requirements. You can replicate it by setting up a Master-Slave replication in no time, just by flipping the startup argument. I would like to know more about your requirements before answering the map-reduce question though. Feel free to read about Mongo and Morphia, I am sure you'd find it both interesting and exciting to dive in.
