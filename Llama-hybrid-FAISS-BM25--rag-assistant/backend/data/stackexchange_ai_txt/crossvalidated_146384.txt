If you're variable of interest is age, I'm not quite sure why you're worried about how you set your dummy/categorical variables. The mean is better when speaking about people in general. It's the same as a variable like age--no one has precisely the specific mean age--but you're talking about the most representative which is the average. If you're really concerned about the different probabilities of being married for different people, you can individually represent the types of people you're interested in, for example a female high school graduate. However, unless you're included interaction terms, the effect of age on marriage is by construction independent of the other variables in the model as specified currently.
