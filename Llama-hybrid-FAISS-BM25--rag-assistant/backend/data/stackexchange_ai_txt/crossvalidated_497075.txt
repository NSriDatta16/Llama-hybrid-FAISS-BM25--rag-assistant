Intepreting results of Granger Causality test on a sparseVAR

I want to run a Granger Causaity test on a pair of time series using the R library sparsevar embedded within python code (I am using rpy2). I am building a VAR model with fitVAR() with two time series with a p (lag) of 6. I then run the testGranger() function on the VAR model and it returns matrices for each lag. I thought this would be the p-values but some of the values are negative. I thought it might be the test statistic or a correlation coefficient, but it's strange that there isn't a p-value. The result object does not have any attributes. testGranger source code: https://github.com/svazzole/sparsevar/blob/master/R/utilsVAR.R impulseResponse and errorBandsIRF source code: https://github.com/svazzole/sparsevar/blob/master/R/impulseResponse.R original documentation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparsevar/sparsevar.pdf Apologies in the advance; the result was printed weirdly on my console. robjects.globalenv['sparsevar'] = robjects.r('fitVAR(endog, p=6)') robjects.r('irf
