Upgrading XML Schema programmatically

I'm in the process of having to re-write a project due to the platform vendor needing the storage mechanism be in an XElement object instead of storing in data tables that I create in their database. It's becoming painful, and I need some insight. I can morph my object graph to/from Xml using the XmlSerializer and read/write to/from the XElement object that I'm given, but I'm not sure how to upgrade the Xml Data when I need to change the object graph. Has anyone confronted this, and what articles have proven the best to learn how to build such an update methodology. Thanks.
