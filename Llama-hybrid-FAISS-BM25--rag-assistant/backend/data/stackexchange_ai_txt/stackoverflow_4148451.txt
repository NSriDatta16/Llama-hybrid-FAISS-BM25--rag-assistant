Table Valued Param UdtTypeName

.NET 4.0, Visual Studio 2010. In MSSQL 2008, I have a simple table Type, a stored proc that takes the TVP as a parameter. It works fine in management studio. I created a new Linq-to-SQL designer, drug my tables and procs onto the design surface, everything worked fine. I then tried to drag the stored procedure with the table-valued-parameter on the design surface, and got this red-X error: UdtTypeName property must be set for UDT parameters. What did I miss?
