You describe a problem solved by Virtual Database Engines (also referred to as Federated DBMS Engines). I suspect the ideal situation for you is a Conceptual Layer that sits atop disparate logical sources which could be any combination of: relational dbms engines (behind ERP, CRM, HR, Accounting systems), web services, XML, etc.. Virtuoso (my company's product) handles this by allowing you to attach exernal/remote data sources associated with a myriad data representation formats (as per list above). It then allows you to use an EAV/CR model (e.g. RDF Graph Model) as the basis for a Conceptual Layer that is both concrete and the focus of all subsequent data interaction. This conceptual layer endows each Data item with an HTTP scheme based Identifier; thus, you only need an HTTP aware user agent as you commence exploring the rich conceptual graph that now fronts your disparate logical data sources. What I describe above is basically what's commonly known today as: HTTP based Linked Data. Links: http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com Kingsley
