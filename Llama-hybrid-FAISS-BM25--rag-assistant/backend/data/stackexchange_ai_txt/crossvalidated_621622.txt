The reverse process is works by sampling from the distribution $q(x_{t - 1} | x_t, x_0)$ , but with $x_0$ replaced by an estimate. The distribution $q(x_{t - 1} | x_t, x_0)$ is an isotropic Gaussian with mean $\mu (x_t, x_0)$ and variance $\sigma_t = \frac{(1 - \alpha_t) (1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1})}{(1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)}$ (see p12 of Luo's "Understanding Diffusion Models: ... " ). However, we don't have access to $x_0$ , so we need to estimate it by some $\widehat{x}_0$ . We do this indirectly, by estimating the noise added to $x_0$ to obtain $x_t$ (p15, same manuscript). The sampling formula you quote from the DDPM paper is exactly sampling from an isotropic Gaussian with mean $\mu(x_t, \widehat{x}_0)$ and variance $\sigma(t)$ . Hope that helps!
