Your expression of $E[N|A] = \frac{1}{1-A}$ is correct. Actually this is a general expression for the probability that an event does not occur in the first $(N-1)$ tests followed by a test with the event occurs, regardless of what distribution it is, where $A$ represents the probability that an event does not occur in a single test while $(1-A)$ represents the probability that the event occur in a single test. This expression is easy to understand and remember, since it simply says that if the probability that an event occurs in a single test is 0.1, then on average it needs 10 tests to see the event occurs. Your result for $E[(1−A)^{−1}]$ goes to infinity is also correct. The reason is that "Aaron samples from the Uniform(0,1) distribution". As two extreme cases, if Aaron's number is 0, obviously Brooke only needs to sample once $(N=1)$ ; However, if Aaron's number is 1 (or infinitely approaches 1), then even Brooke samples infinite times she still can not get a number greater than 1. Anyway, since the sampled number is from the Uniform(0,1), indeed, $E[N]$ is infinite.
