Appcelerator Titanium is an awesome environment for using web-ish skills (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to build native apps for Android (and iPhone, and desktops, etc.). For example, the gang at Intridea have made several popular Android & iPhone apps with Titanium Mobile , including the OilReporter app that has been used for gathering data on the extent of the Gulf oil spill.
