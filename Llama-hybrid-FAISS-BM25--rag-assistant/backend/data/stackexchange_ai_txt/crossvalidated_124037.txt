Prediction with categorical variables in Cox regression

I'm doing survival analysis with Cox PH. I have my final model based on averaged models and I have four categorical variables with multiple levels each. I computed the fitted values using predict function from R, varying the values of one variable and maintaining the values of the other variables in the most common level (if I had continuous variables it would be the mean level). My question is, with this predicted values, and having multiple levels for each variable, can I trust the confidence intervals?
