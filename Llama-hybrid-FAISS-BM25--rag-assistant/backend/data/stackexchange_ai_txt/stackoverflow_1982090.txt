Override machine.config with web.config

I have recently decided to move my connection strings to machine.config as this seems to be by far the most elegant approach for managing multiple environments. However, I would still like to be able to override these settings in my local web.config if the need arises (or the non-enlightened masses begin to complain). How can I override settings from machine.config in my web.config without getting a ConfigurationErrorsException because the value has already been set?
