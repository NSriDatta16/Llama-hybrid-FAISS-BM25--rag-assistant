Does it make sense to test significance levels of correlation matrix obtained with glm

I am using a logistic regression and always like to have a look at the coefficient correlation. For example, here is a code where I am looking at a simple logistic regression between an outcome variable (x, dichotomous) and a few predictor variables (continuous and ordinal: a, b, c, d, e). a $x x) glmModel = glm(I(x == "case") ~ ., family = binomial(), data = df) corrMat = summary(glmModel, corr=TRUE)$correlation (Intercept) a b c d e (Intercept) 1.00000000 -0.05807459 -0.03594247 -0.54462425 -0.74059196 -0.33549389 a -0.05807459 1.00000000 -0.17826515 0.02423815 -0.01155441 0.01789369 b -0.03594247 -0.17826515 1.00000000 -0.04101731 0.10723187 -0.03763901 c -0.54462425 0.02423815 -0.04101731 1.00000000 0.01218383 -0.01340827 d -0.74059196 -0.01155441 0.10723187 0.01218383 1.00000000 0.02651398 e -0.33549389 0.01789369 -0.03763901 -0.01340827 0.02651398 1.00000000 Would it make sense to test this matrix for significance between those correlation coefficients?
