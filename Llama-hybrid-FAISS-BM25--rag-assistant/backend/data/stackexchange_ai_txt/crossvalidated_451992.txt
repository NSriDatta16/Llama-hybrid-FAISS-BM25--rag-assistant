You don't want to do the averaging approach. MANOVA might be an appropriate path. Or conducting anovas on each of the attributes separately. If you conduct several anovas, you should acquaint yourself with the problem of multiple testing. That is, if you conduct several hypothesis tests, the chances of a false positive result increase above the nominal alpha level (e.g. 0.05). In response to this, you may want to adjust the resulting p values for false discovery rate or familywise error rate . Or you might just accept that you might get a false positive for some attributes, and live with it. It really depends upon the objectives of the analysis.
