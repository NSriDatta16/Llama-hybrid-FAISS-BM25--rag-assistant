SQL can create running totals without using cursors, but it's one of the few cases where a cursor is actually more performant than a set-based solution (given the operators currently available in SQL Server). Alternatively, a CLR function can sometimes shine well. Itzik Ben-Gan did an excellent series in SQL Server Magazine on running aggregates. The series concluded last month, but you can get access to all of the articles if you have an online subscription. Edit: here's his latest article in the series (SQL CLR). Given that you can access the whole series by purchasing an online monthly pass for one month - less than 6 bucks - it's worth your while if you're interested in looking at the problem from all angles. Itzik is a Microsoft MVP and a very bright TSQL coder.
