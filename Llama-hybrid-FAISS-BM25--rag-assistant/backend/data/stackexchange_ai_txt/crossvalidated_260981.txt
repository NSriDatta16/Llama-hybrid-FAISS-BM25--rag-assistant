Bayes decision boundary naming

Why the optimal classifier is called "Bayes". I do not see the connection with being Bayesian or so. Edit: This question asks about naming. Not about math. Another phrasing of the question: Given that the Bayesian classifier is optimal (under certain constraints) does not explain why that particular classifier is called "Bayesian." Why do we call such a classifier "Bayesian" rather than some other name?
