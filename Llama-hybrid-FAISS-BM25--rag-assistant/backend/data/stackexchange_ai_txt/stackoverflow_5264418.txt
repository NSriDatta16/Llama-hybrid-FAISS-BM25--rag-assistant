SQL Server Connection String

OK, total noob question here. I'm toying around with Silverlight, and need to connect to a database. When I connect in server explorer (VS 2010) it works fine, because it's using my windows account to authenticate. However, when I start debugging the server side stuff is running on a different account (NT-SERVICE or something to that effect) which has no privileges on the SQL server. I've tried embedding my username/password like this: connectionString="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog={DATABASE};Integrated Security=True;User={DOMAIN}\{USERNAME};Password={redacted}" but it doesn't seem to be working. I keep getting an error: The server did not provide a meaningful reply; this might be caused by a contract mismatch, a premature session shutdown or an internal server error. Thanks for helping, Eric
