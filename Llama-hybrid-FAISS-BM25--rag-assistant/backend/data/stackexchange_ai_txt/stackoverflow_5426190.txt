How to enable drag-selection in Berkelium?

I've got an application that's using Berkelium for an embedded web browser, and I'm having trouble getting the drag-selection to work. I've seen examples of other WebKit-based applications that have it working just like a normal browser (Steam, Awesomium demo), so I feel like it shouldn't be that difficult to get working, but I don't know what may be wrong. I'm passing in all of the mouse down, mouse move, and mouse up events to the Berkelium browser (mouseButton and mouseMoved functions on the Window) and I feel like that's all I should need to do? I wasn't able to find any help online about this, so hopefully someone here might know what's going on or where to look! Thanks!
