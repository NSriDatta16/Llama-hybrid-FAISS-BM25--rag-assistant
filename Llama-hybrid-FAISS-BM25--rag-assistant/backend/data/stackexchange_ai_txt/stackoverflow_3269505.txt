Explain my AppStats graph for a db.get

I did a db.get([356 keys]) and it took 8 seconds. Here is an excerpt of the AppStats graph for this operation: http://vvcap.net/db/iXvU5LtfG6tp04-kjqvp.htp Is 8 seconds normal for 356 keys? And why is the CPU time be bigger than the API CPU time? If anything I would expect the API CPU time to be bigger, since entities are fetched in parallel. All 356 keys are for this model: class Molecule(db.Model): meaning = db.StringProperty() short_desc = db.StringProperty() official = db.BooleanProperty(default=False) phrasing = db.ReferenceProperty() atoms = db.ListProperty(db.Key) # ~3 list elements on average keywords = db.ListProperty(db.Key) # ~20 list elements on average phrasings = db.ListProperty(db.Key) # ~1 list element on average add_dt = db.DateTimeProperty() modify_dt = db.DateTimeProperty() delete_dt = db.DateTimeProperty() _ucase_meaning = db.StringProperty()
