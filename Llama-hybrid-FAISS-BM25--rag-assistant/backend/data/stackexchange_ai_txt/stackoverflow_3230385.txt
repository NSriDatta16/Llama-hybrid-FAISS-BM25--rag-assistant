Using JQuery to create hyperlink found in a paragraph

How can you use JQuery to find URLs within some text and automatically convert them into an actual hyperlink? Example text, var TextMemo = "This is some random paragraph text, but i mention a link to a website here. www.stackoverflow.com and another one here this time with http ( http://www.google.co.uk )" Is this a simple task?
