Coverage probability of credible intervals if we take Bayesian model literally

Let's say I have a Bayesian model with a proper prior $\pi$, likelihood $L$, data distribution $p(x|\theta)$ (assume $\theta$ is a scalar) and the vector of sample values $x$: $$p(\theta|x) = \frac{\pi(\theta)L(\theta|x)}{p(x)}$$ If I took my model seriously as a hierarchical description of the data generating process, $$ \theta \sim \pi$$ $$ x\sim p(\theta)$$ then how often would a 95% credibility interval (constructed from the posterior distribution) contain the generated $\theta$? Also, would this coverage statement be conditional on the collected data, or would it be unconditional and hence vulnerable to the usual relevant subset arguments directed at confidence intervals?
