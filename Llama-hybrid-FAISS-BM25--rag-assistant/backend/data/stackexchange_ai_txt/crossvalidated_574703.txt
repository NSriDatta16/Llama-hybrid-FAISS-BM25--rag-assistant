The two most common methods are Grid Search and Random Search. For both of these you specify a set or a range of hyperparameter values and then iteratively try combinations of hyperparameters to find the best combination. For a grid search, a set of values is provided for each hyperparameter to be tuned and each combination is tried systematically. For a random search, the values are selected randomly and tried, until a stopping condition is met. Typically, cross-validation is used to test the various hyperparameter combinations. If you're using Python, there are several packages that can help you do this. If you search for "hyperparameter tuning python" you will find plenty of information on these packages and how to use them. To get started, have a look at Jason Brownlee's Machine Learning Mastery blog: Hyperparameter Optimization With Random Search and Grid Search How to Grid Search Hyperparameters for Deep Learning Models in Python With Keras
