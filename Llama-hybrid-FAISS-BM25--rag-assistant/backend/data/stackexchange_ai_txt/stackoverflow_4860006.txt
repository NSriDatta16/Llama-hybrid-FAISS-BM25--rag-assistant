Use the FTP protocol for this. On the second PC install and configure an FTP server application, and then in your C# client code, use something like http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetftpclient/ to do the FTP protocol work. Alternately, if you really need encryption of communications, use HTTPS which means configuring a web server on the second PC and using something like the System.NET classes to implement a web client. Whatever you do, do not write your own protocol and do leverage existing .NET libraries to handle the lower level FTP or HTTP communications.
