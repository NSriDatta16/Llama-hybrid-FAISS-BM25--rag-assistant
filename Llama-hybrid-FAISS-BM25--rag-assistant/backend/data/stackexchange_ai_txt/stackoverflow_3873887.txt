That's the header of your HTML file, not the HTTP headers the server is sending. The meta element defines equivalents to HTTP headers. If both an HTTP header is sent and a meta element exists with the equivalent, the user agent must decide which to use. It might work in your browser but it seems the validator your are using gives precedence to the actual HTTP header. So you have to figure out how to make your server send the correct Content-type header. If your page is generated by a PHP script you can use header('Content-type:text/html;charset=UTF-8'); at the beginning of your script to fix it.
