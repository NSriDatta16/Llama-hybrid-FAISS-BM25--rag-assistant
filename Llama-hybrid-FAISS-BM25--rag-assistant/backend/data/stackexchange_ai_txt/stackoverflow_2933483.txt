It really depends on how this was counted. But anyways, once a good framework for testing a specific class/library/unit/whatever is set up, adding a new test is usually only a few lines. If they were writing tests with a goal of high code coverage percentages then those tests are typically even shorter because you do a lot of tests that vary only by the value of a single variable in order to get a different code path.
