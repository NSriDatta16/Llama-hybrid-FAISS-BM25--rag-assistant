Lightweight Prototype-based floating/resizable popup window

What's the best way to implement Meebo-style floating windows? I'd prefer to use Prototype (but if there's a good Jquery implementation I'd be happy to look into it as well). I'd like windows to be draggable/resizable and generally "lightweight" and responsive.
