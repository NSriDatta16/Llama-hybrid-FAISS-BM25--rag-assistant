Random oversampling versus classes weighting for class-imbalanced dataset

I want to train a multi-class classification deep learning model. But my dataset is class-imbalanced. So considering 2 solutions, random oversampling and classes weighting, I have some questions: Do random oversampling and classes weighting have the same effect on the model training? If they don't, what are the differences? Which method is better? Why?
