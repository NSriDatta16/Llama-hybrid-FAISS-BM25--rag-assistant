Based on previous questions you've been asking I think your directories are something problematic for you. here is a functionnal and secure example or directory organization for Zend Framework (partial) var/ www/ vhosts/ otherproject/ project/ src/ So apache documentRoot is /var/www/project/htdocs . Here we can find the index.php file, the only php file available on public access. In htdocs/js & htdocs/css you can put some of your project js & css files. And then you've got the problem of css and js files of your external php libs that are now completly outside of the web root. What I usually do is, like others have said here, links from external directories to the js directory inside the web root. But to be more precise and keep things well organized here what you should do there: ln -s /var/www/project/libraries/my-lib/js /var/www/project/htdocs/js/my-lib ln -s /var/www/project/libraries/my-lib/css /var/www/project/htdocs/css/my-lib And you should do it for all external lib having files that should be in the document root. This way the base url for the js files of my-lib is /js/my-lib/. Do not fear of using symlinks (junctions on windows), you can even store them in subversion repository. Just check that your apache configuration allow symlinks (Options +FollowSymlinks)
