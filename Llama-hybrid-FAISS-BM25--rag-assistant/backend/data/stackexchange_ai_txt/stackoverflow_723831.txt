Tabs, etc are just tools. How we decide to lay them out and use them is what determines their effectiveness. What I try to keep in mind is: 1) Keep it close. The things we use the most should be on the front or up close to the top as much as possible and bury the rest based on how often they are used/adjusted. 2) Easy enough for Mom to use. All interfaces are confusing if they are not laid out in a clear and logical manner. 3) Organize how it's used, not how you think it makes sense.* I often use tabs to break up steps in a process, or to break up areas such as basic / advanced options. I group them based on similarity or usage depending on what works better 4) Keep them few Either way I try to stay below the 7-10 range tops as the human brain has a hard time jumping beyond 7-10 digits, so I assume the same for pieces of information. Vertical Accordians might be something you want to look into as well. I have also embedded tabs within tabs before. Works well but only one layer deep most of the time.
