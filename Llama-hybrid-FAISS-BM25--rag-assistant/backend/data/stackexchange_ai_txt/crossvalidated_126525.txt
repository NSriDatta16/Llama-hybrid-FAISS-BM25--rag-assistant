Time Series Forecast: Convert differenced forecast back to before difference level

I am using R and I need an easier way to produce forecasts of data at the original level based on forecasts using differenced data. The situation, in more detail, is this: I am using several different models (including SVM and a few others) to forecast a time series. My models are based on differenced data since the original data is not stationary. Now I have a vector of predicted values for each model, but all the forecasts are for the differenced data. How can I get forecasts of the original data before it's differenced? In other words, if I have forecasts of returns, how do I automatically get the forecasts of stock prices of the same period in R? I know the hard-coded way to do it, but I am looking for an easier way. In testing situations like rolling windows with different forecast horizons, things could be trickier I believe. To be more specific, if the window is rolling with horizon 7 (days), then $\hat{y}_{t+1}$ until $\hat{y}_{t+7}$ is easy to calculate by Glen's answer below. However, after we roll the window once we will be standing at time $t+7$, where we have both $y_{t+7}$ and $\hat{y}_{t+7}$. I want to calculate $\hat{y}_{t+8}$ as $y_{t+7}+\hat{z}_{t+8}$ and $\hat{y}_{t+9}$ as $y_{t+7}+\hat{z}_{t+8}+\hat{z}_{t+9}$, and so on. So, for $\hat{y}_{t+8}$ to $\hat{y}_{t+14}$ the value $y_{t+7}$ needs to be used and this could go on until the end of the dataset. Is there any R function I can use to make this calculation conveniently?
