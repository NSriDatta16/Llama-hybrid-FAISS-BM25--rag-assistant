That's seems very fragile, better would be to communicate via sockets in a well established protocol or with some sort of RCP ( perhaps Google's protobuf ) or even webservices. If you still insists you can launch a process in Java with ProcessBuilder that will give you a Process reference of which you can get the InputStream to read the standard output, but again, that seems very fragile to me. I hope this helps.
