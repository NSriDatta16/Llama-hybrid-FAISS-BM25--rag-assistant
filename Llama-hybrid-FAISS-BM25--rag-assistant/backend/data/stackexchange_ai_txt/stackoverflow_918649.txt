C# GUI uses a lot of ram?

I am mostly curious and this isnt a problem. Typically my (C++) apps use very little memory. I thought my current app would take little memory but it uses 3.7mb and VM size of 17.3mb. The app has 4 icons in its resource file, 4 ints in the local(user)settings and is the app LoC is Theres no arrays or any storage except for a few structs that are less 256bytes together. Why is my app using 17mb+ of VM?
