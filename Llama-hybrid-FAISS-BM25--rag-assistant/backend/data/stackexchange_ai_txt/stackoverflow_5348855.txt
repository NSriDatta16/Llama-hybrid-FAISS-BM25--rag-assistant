R time series, complicated sequence

I am attempting to merge two different time-series in R with the following characteristics: Data must be between 08:30 and 15:00 on a daily basis. Data spans several weeks, not just one particular day. There are gaps in the data at random intervals. The two datasets will not have gaps at the same intervals necessarily I would like to merge the two datasets, with all times in the sequence from 08:30 to 15:00 and where there was a gap in each, I would like the previous value (or following value) carried over. # I have verified that the csv files are imported correctly # The first column contains dates. and the strptime # function can convert strings into Date/Time objects. # sec1_dates James you were right about Problem 1. Thank you. I verified that the csv file was pulling the data in twice and removing the data fixed the issue. I used your solution for Problem 2 as well, but I am not certain that this is the most efficient way of going about doing what I'm trying to do. Ultimately I may want to use this to run regressions, and at that point might need a loop of some sort to pull any number of datasets. Any optimizations that I might make would be greatly appreciated. UPDATED SOLUTION library(zoo) library(tseries) # Read the CSV files into data frames sec1 "08:30" & strftime(time(template),"%H:%M")
