How to scale the squares in a forest plot? I'd argue for scaling the size (area) of the squares proportional to the weight that the study contributed to the meta-analysis. By scaling by weight, the area of the square is a direct visual cue of the relative impact a study had on the summary effect. The weight is among other things proportional to the standard error (precision) which, in turn, is usually (but not always!) directly related to the study sample size. This makes the most sense to me because the forest plot is a visual display of a statistical analysis which, in effect, is a weighted mean. Scaling by quality seems problematic to me because quality is difficult to measure objectively and the summary effect is not calculated using "quality-weights" (at least I've never seen it). This seems to be supported by a number of authors. Steff Lewis and Mike Clarke $^{[1]}$ go into the history of the forest plot and write The area of each square was proportional to the weight that the individual study contributed to the meta­ analysis. Michael Borenstein et al. $^{[2]}$ recommend the same when they explain [...] the point is a box, proportional (in area) to that study’s weight in the analysis. This is again mirrored in Jonathan Sterne's book $^{[3]}$ : The size of the plotting symbol for the point estimate in each study is proportional to the weight that each trial contributes in the meta-analysis. Lastly, in The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis $^{[4]}$ we read In this plot, each study is represented by a square, bounded on either side by a confidence interval. The location of each square on the horizontal axis represents the effect size for that study. The confidence interval represents the precision with which the effect size has been estimated, and the size of each square is proportional to the weight that will be assigned to the study when computing the combined effect. A disadvantage of this approach becomes obvious when you want to present the results of a fixed-effects and a random-effects meta-analysis (or just two different analysis methods) in the same forest plot. Different analysis methods likely assign different weights to the studies and so the scaling of the area of the squares becomes ambiguous. Estimators of between-study variance: Which one to use? The metafor package for R offers no less than nine different estimators for the amount of heterogeneity: DerSimonian-Laird Hedges Hunter-Schmidt Sidik-Jonkman Maximum-likelihood Restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) Empirical Bayes Paule-Mandel Generalized Q-statistic Descriptions of these estimators can be found in references $[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]$ . The question remains which one to use? Veroniki et al. $^{[7]}$ and Langan et al. $^{[8]}$ recommend the Paule-Mandel estimator or restricted maximum likelihood based on simulation studies. A never publication by Langan et al. $^{[9]}$ made the following recommendations: See also this question . References $[1]$ Lewis Steff, Clarke Mike.
