System.Data.SqlTypes.SqlDateTime and System.DateTime use different underlying structures to represent dates. SqlDateTime represents the range January 1, 1753 to December 31, 9999 to an accuracy of 3.33 milliseconds DateTime(.NET Framework type) represents the range between Jan 1, 0001 to Dec,31 9999 to the accuracy of 100 nanoseconds You should be careful of these boundaries when comparing dates. One tactic to alleviate problems in comparisons could be to cast everything to System.DateTime and then perform the compare. You can use the Value property of the SqlDateTime struct (which returns a System.DateTime) to do the comparison elegantly and without explicit casting. You might find this article informative.
