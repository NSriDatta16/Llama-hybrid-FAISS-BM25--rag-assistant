There isn't any validators that I'm aware of. Sometimes the best thing to do is to start a new module and slowly re-build it. Keep adding very small pieces of functionality or configuration at a time. You'll eventually find out what doesn't work. With Magento, there are so many places it can go wrong, even down to improper capitalization of words in your config.xml file. I can't tell you how many times I've made dumb mistakes that I spent hours trying to figure out, and it was a misspelling or something silly. Good luck. I hope you can figure it out soon!
