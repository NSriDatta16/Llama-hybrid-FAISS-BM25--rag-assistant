Okay, seems my quest to avoid writing/ deploying some php code is in vain... here's what i'm going to run with on the file (php) server: http://www.zubrag.com/scripts/download.php Then the links from my asp.net web server will point to that script, which will then download the relevant file (hence avoiding direct downloads, and allowing tracking of downloads via google analytics)... i think that'll do the trick Thanks all Greg
