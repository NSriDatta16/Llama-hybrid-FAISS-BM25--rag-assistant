I would do this using #pragma warning disable . The .NET Framework Guidelines recommend to implement IDisposable.Dispose in such a way that it can be called multiple times. From the MSDN description of IDisposable.Dispose : The object must not throw an exception if its Dispose method is called multiple times Therefore the warning seems to be almost meaningless: To avoid generating a System.ObjectDisposedException you should not call Dispose more than one time on an object I guess it could be argued that the warning may be helpful if you're using a badly-implemented IDisposable object that does not follow the standard implementation guidelines. But when using classes from the .NET Framework like you are doing, I'd say it's safe to suppress the warning using a #pragma. And IMHO this is preferable to going through hoops as suggested in the MSDN documentation for this warning .
