IronPython performance

I'm considering embedding IronPython as a scripting language for an application that I'm writing. So to try it out, I downloaded IronPython 2.0 and fired up the interactive interpreter. Just starting the thing up takes about 5 seconds on my Intel Quad Core with 6 Gigs of memory. I can hardly imagine how much of a delay this would be for a less powerful machine. Based on these benchmarks , it seems as though IronPython's performance actually isn't too terribly bad. Or is it? Have I misconfigured something during installation? Or is this a problem with the interactive interpreter?
