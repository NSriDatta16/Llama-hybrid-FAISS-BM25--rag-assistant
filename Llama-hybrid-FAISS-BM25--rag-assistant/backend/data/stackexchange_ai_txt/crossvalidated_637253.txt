Logistic regression: restrict the prediction range

I am running a basic logistic regression with a single independent variable ( X ) and one dependent variable ( y ). In the accompanying figure, the logistic regression predicts values that tend to 0 and 1 for low and large X values, respectively. However, the probabilities computed from the data tend to be 0.2 and 0.8 for large and small X values. I am seeking a modified version of the logistic regression that better fits my data and Ideally, I would like a solution that still allows for the interpretation of model results in terms of odds ratios, if possible. Any suggestions?
