You are organizing your hierarchical data using the adjacency list model . The fact that such recursive operations tend to be difficult is in fact one major drawback of this model. Some DBMSes, such as SQL Server 2005, Postgres 8.4 and Oracle 11g R2, support recursive queries using common table expressions with the WITH keyword (also see @OMG Ponies' comment below). This feature allows queries such as this to be implemented easily, but unfortunately MySQL does not support recursive queries yet. In the following series of articles, @Quassnoi suggests one solution to tackle hierarchical queries in MySQL, which you may want to check out: Quassnoi: Hierarchical queries in MySQL You may also may be interested in checking out the following article which describes an alternative model (the nested set model ), which makes recursive operations easier: Mike Hillyer: Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL In addition, I also suggest checking out the following presentation by @Bill Karwin : Bill Karwin: Models for hierarchical data with SQL and PHP The closure table model described in the presentation is a very valid alternative to the nested set. He further describes this model in his SQL Antipatterns book ( excerpt from the chapter on this topic [PDF]). Otherwise, you could also consider downloading all the data to your application, building a tree, and walking through it.
