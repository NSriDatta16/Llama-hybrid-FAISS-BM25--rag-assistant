Mixed effects model with between subjects dependent variable

I've got a dataset where I try to predict a between-subject dependent variable (continuous), the average number of times a participant made a mistake on a cognitive task, with a within-subject predictor (categorical), hard vs easy trial, and a between-subject predictor (continuous), mean activation in a brain region for this trial. There are approximately 3000 observations, with approximately 70 observations per participant. I am not sure whether a mixed-effects model is the right approach or whether there is a better way to approach this? Does someone have any suggestions?
