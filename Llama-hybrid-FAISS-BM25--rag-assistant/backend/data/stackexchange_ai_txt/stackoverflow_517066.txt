Your question is really about using a page file, and not virtual memory, as kdgregory said. Probably the most important use for virtual memory is so that the OS can protect once process's memory from another processes memory, while still giving each process the illusion of a contiguous, flat virtual address space. The actual physical addresses can and will become fragmented, but the virtual addresses will appear contiguous. Yes, virtual memory is vital. The page file, maybe not.
