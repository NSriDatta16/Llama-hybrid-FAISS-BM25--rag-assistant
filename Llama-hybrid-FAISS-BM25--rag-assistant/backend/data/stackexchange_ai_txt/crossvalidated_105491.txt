If you're still looking for insight regarding financial time series & machine learning , you might want to check out this article from the Journal of Economic Perspectives , which gives a great overview of various ML methods pertaining to Economics/Finance. Essentially, the main problem you have is that most traditional machine learning techniques deal with cross-sectional data "where independently distributed data is a plausible assumption" (quoted from said article). However, since with Financial Time Series you, by and large, can't make that assumption, you're better off taking a totally different approach than the 'ole Training/Test set split-'em-up. Your best bet--as mentioned in that article (Seriously, it's really good)--may be to read up on Bayesian Structural Time Series ( BFTS ) (briefly mentioned in that article that you should be reading by now and described in more detail here and, well, I don't have the reps for a third link...). Now, if you're just looking to do some run-of-the-mill Time Series estimation you can settle for the choose-the-model-with-the-lowest-out-of-sample- RMSE approach. However, that may cause you to forfeit all your " Machine Learning " name-dropping privileges. Just a warning... Good luck!
