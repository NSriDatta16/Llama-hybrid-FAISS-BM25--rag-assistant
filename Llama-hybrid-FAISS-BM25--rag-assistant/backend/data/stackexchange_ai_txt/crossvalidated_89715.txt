Is it ok to aggregate the samples to larger sampling intervals, e.g. days or even years, despite the information loss that comes with aggregation? Isn't aggregation some form of data tampering? If not, how do I chose the appropriate temporal unit for aggregation? I am not a criminologist but i am a researcher of crime analysis. It really depends on the method you are using to cluster. There are methods that can dimensionally reduce a time series with little loss of data at all such as PAA. I am conducting a similar data mining exercise and have found the need to aggregate daily crime into Monthly crime. I am also using a bioinformatic technique to cluster the series.
