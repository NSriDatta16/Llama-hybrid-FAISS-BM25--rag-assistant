Thanks to KevinP and Darin for their answers. I had actually forgotton about the instance request handlers on script manager. Unfortunetly, in my case I would be firing the end_request everytime the person navigated in the calendar control. I take the blame as I was not clear on all requirements. I have upvoted both of their answers. Here is my final solutions. (Forgive me this is in VB) Protected Sub mainCalendar_SelectionChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal ev As EventArgs) Dim dtStart As DateTime = mainCalendar.SelectedDates(0) Dim dtEnd As DateTime = mainCalendar.SelectedDates(6) Dim alertString As String = _ String.Format( "alert('{0}');", dtStart.ToString("d") + " - " + dtEnd.ToString("d") ) scriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(upCalendar, GetType(String), _ "alert", alertString, True) End Sub In this context the alert is only ever displayed on the selection of a week in the calendar, not when the user changes the month or does something else relating to navigation. Thanks again to both responders for their help
