Your original model was incorrectly specified; it should have been mdl1 Where beyond some technical things — method and choosing an appropriate family for size (is it really conditionally Gaussian? 0 or negative size values don't make immediate sense to me and if so that might preclude using family = gaussian() ) — note that I have included the mean response for each vowel through the parametric factor term. You could replace this with s(vowel, bs = "re") instead. With that specification you have the main effect for the vowel means but there is no average effect for cuteness , which is what I presume the reviewer means by "main effect". To specify that model, I would suggest using the new-ish "sz" basis: mdl1 With this basis, you don't need the explicit parametric term for the group means; those are included in the "sz" basis, as deviations from the overall mean of the response (the model constant / Intercept term).
