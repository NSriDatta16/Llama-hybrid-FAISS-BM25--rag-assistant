Determining Electricity Usage by Machine / Time Series Analysis?

We are trying to identify the electricity needs of individual machines (efficiency) at our manufacturing facility in order to know the electricity-per-unit produced. Over a series of shifts, we know: 1/ the electricity usage of clusters of machines - Draw(total), and 2/ the units produced by each individual machine - Production Bold is known , Italics are unknown Is there a type of analysis that I should be searching for? I have started looking at Multivariate Time Series Analysis and ARIMA, but don't know what next steps to take. Thank you!
