How to sort my categories in Magento

In the admin, you have an "order" option, you can also drag&drop categories to get it in the right order, however in the layered navigation, it doesn't seems to be take in account, the order is different. I found Mage_Category_Helper_Category::getStoreCategories() helper method which seems to load categories, but I've not found any order option. Any ideas?
