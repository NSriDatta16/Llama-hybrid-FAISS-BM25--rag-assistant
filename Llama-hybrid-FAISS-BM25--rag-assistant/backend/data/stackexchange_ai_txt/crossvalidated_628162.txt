My question is this: in a bayesian test of proportion with more than 2 variants, is there a pretty standard approach for evaluating the statistical significance of the difference between their posts? Can anyone point to a repo where I can see such stat sig eval for >2 variants in action? There is no such thing as statistical significance for the Bayesian framework. Remember, significance is a single word to mean that a statistic computed under certain assumptions of the parameters is sufficiently extreme. Because Bayesians put probabilities on parameters, and not data given parameters, the concept of significance doesn't really apply. Often, Bayesians will select an action which is expected to minimize some loss function. I demonstrate how to do this with a 3 variant AB test in this post here .
