Why label encoding for categorical features should not be used for deep learning/neural network?

Many online posts( here and here ) say label encoding would make NN/DL models think there is an ordering among categories, so it should not be used for categorical encoding for NN/DL models. But wouldn't NN/DL models be capable of modeling any non-linear relationship like XGboost? If this is the case, why NN/DL can't figure out whether or not an ordering is actually present among categories when label encoding is used?
