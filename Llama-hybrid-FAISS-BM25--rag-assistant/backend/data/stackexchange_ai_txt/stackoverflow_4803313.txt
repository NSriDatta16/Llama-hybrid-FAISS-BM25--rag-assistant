Does anybody know why Yahoo! OpenID login with DotNetOpenAuth stopped working?

Yesterday I realised that Yahoo! OpenID login with DotNetOpenAuth wasn't working anymore on my site. Then I came to StackOverflow and tried to log-in here. Same problem. Is this a temporary Yahoo! problem or is it a DotNetOpenAuth problem? I tried using version 3.4.2 as well as the latest verstion, 3.4.6. I don't know what version does StackOverflow use. EDIT The details of what happens is the following (in both my site and StackOverflow) I start a request do Yahoo OpenID IdP Yahoo asks me to login I log in successfully The browser requests the following page and then gets stuck there: https://open.login.yahoo.com/openid/op/start?z=Fi9ONwS5_ujGQwM.JCJN1IyY.5w.vlV7Ggr1yu..tHIkgZPpcVu68UMDlEWer5J9.mAVLddDMuOY8S5RZY31D3id.h7GMHHrgUT6RzniHCpAIj09Xrv5yAH2ltYe4Ubr9lvUu2MksoFCdBKfq7XjKALCT4Ln_ziCs9tQRAkHUDk4NdJqypZ.h16i8pnoUZIYXeX3XMLum4Xtk2ZdVr4CLNrIZWHN.Qxz3_GdG.P4hv1_ynq936zVeARvJZRB3EWhlXtX79eFF3d.JmUG.2zPAHa8L9UAbV6fug8r7qzYSLhhV2rNvhozoa5JuyZv5RY6jDFTeuG2NRv6KVNNi5iIrPA.j_KbjssQfGptofYct759pYkzEG_Adm0Jyo_RAER_MtXEXvWdlpffaL7q5ZEpglWTzw_Om7hYOB40WZuYVqXsMYtkSxGtOmk-&.scrumb=DcjHdwTmC5j After the browser requests this page it does not return to my site neither to Stackoverflow. Either my site and Stackoverflow log successfully to Google.
