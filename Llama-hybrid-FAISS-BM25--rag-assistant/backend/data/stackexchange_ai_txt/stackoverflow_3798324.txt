Scalability issues for a complex process consuming php application?

Hi Consider a somewhat process consuming PHP application that works heavily with complex DB transactions, and doesn't have any choice but to have fairly high memory consuming algorithms. Like up to 4MB memory usage per request. (1 MB on average for those certain requests, less than 200KB of variable data for regular requests) Its obvious that we are gonna use something like Amazon S3 to host our static data, but it's apparent that most of the load is on the dynamic parts. The app will run on multiple servers, but how does that work? Do we make it like an ordinary application that runs on a single server, and the additional servers will just make it act like one big server with huge amounts of memory and processing power? Our problem is, although the app is written in an extremely modular fashion, the process forces us to have everything in the same environment. We can put the database on a machine that's optimized for serving that, but there is almost no way to like put different modules of the application code itself on different servers. So, what are the common solutions for this?
