With 10g and higher version of oracle, up to date statistics on tables and indexes are needed by the optimizer to make "good" execution plan decision. How often you collect statistics is a tricky call. It depends on your application, schema, data rate and business practice. Some third party apps which are written to be backward compatible with older version of oracle do not perform well with the new optimizer. Those application require that tables have no stats so that the db resorts back to rule base execution plan. But on the average oracle recommends that stats be collected on tables with stale statistics. You can set tables to be monitor and check their state and have them analyze if/when stale. Often that is enough, sometime it is not. It really depend on your database. For my database we have a set of OLTP tables that need nightly stats collection to maintain performance. Other tables are analyze once a week. On our large dw database, we analyze as needed as the tables are too large for regular analysis without affecting overall db load and performance. So the correct answer is, it depends on the application, data change and business needs.
