The problem is that $title is being referenced on line 5 before it's being assigned on line 58. Rearranging your code isn't easy, because the data is both retrieved and output at the same time. Just to test, how does something like this work? Because you're only retrieving one row, you don't need to use a while loop, but I left it with hopes that it'll make it easier for you to relate to your current code. All I've done is removed the actual output from your data retrieval, and added variables for category and category name which are then referred to as usual later on. Also, I haven't tested this. :)
