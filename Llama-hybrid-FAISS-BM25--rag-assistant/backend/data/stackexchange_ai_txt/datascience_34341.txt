How to join 2 neural networks in tensorflow?

Suppose that by using Tensorflow, I'm able to construct to 2 functions: f(x ,w1)=y (The first model- a FFNN) g(x, w2)=t (The second model - an RNN) where: x , y , w1 are respectively the input, output, and weights of the first model; the same goes for x , t , w2 My goal is to construct a hybrid model whose weights only depend on w1 as follows: g(x, f(x,w1))=t To achieve that, I think the solution is to make the computational graph consider the weights w2 as a function of x and w1 . This is where I'm stuck. How can I solve it? P/s : I do agree that reimplementing RNNcell is also a solution, but I'm looking for a more witty one. Because the reimplementation demands more lines of codes and we know the motto 'the fewer code, the fewer bugs'. Furthermore, that solution makes it more complicated to use many useful methods like Dropout, Bidirectional
