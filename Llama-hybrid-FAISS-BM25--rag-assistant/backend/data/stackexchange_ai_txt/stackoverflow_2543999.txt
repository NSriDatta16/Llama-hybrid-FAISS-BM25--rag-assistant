What's elegant way to rewrite following LINQ statement using extension methods?

I have following LINQ statement and I want to rewrite it using extension methods. from x in e from y in e from z in e select new { x, z } One possible solution is: e.Join(e, x => 42, y => 42, (x, y) => new { x, y }) Join(e, _ => 42, z => 42, (_, z) => new { _.x, z }); However this is everything but elegant. Do you any idea how to improve beauty of second expression?
