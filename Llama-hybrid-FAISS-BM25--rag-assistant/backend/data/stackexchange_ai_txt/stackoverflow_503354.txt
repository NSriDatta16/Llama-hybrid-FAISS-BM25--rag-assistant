During databind, wouldn't you just use whatever Infragistics's method is for getting/setting the selected value/index i.e. ultracombo.selectedvalue = "My Value" or ultracombo.selectedindex = 1 Edit: I did a little google searching and found a topic on their support forum of what appears to be someone asking near the same thing. They are saying there that to select an answer you would just set the .Value property, so I am imagining it might be something along the lines of ultracombo.value = 1 Here is the link for more the full support thread .
