The Venables Ripley book discusses periodic splines. Basically, by specifying (correctly) the periodicity, the data are aggregated into replications over a period and splines are fit to interpolate the trend. For instance, using the AirPassengers dataset from R to model flight trends, I might use a categorical fixed effect for annual effects and a spline to interpolate the residual monthly trends. My spline interpolation is arguably a bad one, but finding a good fitting spline is another topic altogether :) This example is perhaps a bit more useful because it deals with averaging out other auto-regressive trends. My from-scratch method fits the periodic spline with a discontinuity at the end-point, but one could easily address this by duplicating these data over two periods and fitting the spline to the central half. matplot(matrix(log(AirPassengers), ncol=12), type='l', axes=F, ylab='log(Passengers)', xlab='Month') axis(1, at=1:12, labels=month.abb) axis(2) box() title('Monthly air passenger data 1949:1960') ap
