Sampling marginal distribution from joint density

Suppose we know that random vectors $x, y$ have joint density $p(x, y) \propto \exp(-U(x_1, \ldots, x_m, y_1, \ldots, y_n))$ , and we want to draw a random sample from the marginal $p(x)$ (i.e. we want a random sample of $x$ but are not interested in $y$ .) Naively, we can do an MCMC on the jointly density $p(x, y)$ , getting a joint vector $(x, y)$ and taking the $x$ part as the sample. But when $n \gg m$ , I speculate that this is not very efficient since we also draw a 'useless' sample of $y$ , which we do not want. (e.g. papers like this indicate that the complexity of MCMC sampling scales polynomially with dimension) Question: Are there better techniques to sample from $p(x)$ when $n \gg m$ ?
