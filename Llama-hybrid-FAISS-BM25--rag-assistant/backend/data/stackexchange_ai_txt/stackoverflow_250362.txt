You could begin with the PHP manual . It's rather well organised now. But now that my sarcastic bit's out of the way... One of the best ways to work with your database (at the moment, your choice is MySQL, but this could change) is to abstract your code from direct interaction with it. A tool such as ADODB is well worth getting to know and makes the task of "obtain a list of all the rows in the database" rather trivial. The main advantage of this is that it insulates you somewhat from having to rewrite lots of code if you find you need to migrate your application to a server with a different database running on it. Better still (imho) would be to look at a framework such as Zend's (well, they do MAKE php afterall) with it's DB abstraction called Zend_Db. This might be overkill for you right now as it appears, from looking at your other questions, that you're quite new to PHP/MySQL development. Also good: Smarty (for abstracting your presentation from your logic)
