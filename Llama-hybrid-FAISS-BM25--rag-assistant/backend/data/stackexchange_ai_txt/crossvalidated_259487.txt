The odds ratio is invariant to exchange of rows and columns (note that for the two tables you constructed the odds ratio is the same) therefore any method such as logistic regression which focuses on the odds ratio will be the same EDIT: For Fisher's exact test consider the two tables. +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | | A | B | | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | 1 | a | b | a+b | | 2 | c | d | c+d | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | | a+c | b+d | n | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ In this table the Fisher's exact test statistic can be calculated as $$ \dfrac{{a + b\choose a}{c + d \choose c}}{{n\choose a+c}} = \dfrac{(a+b)!(c+d)!(a+c)!(b+d)!}{a!b!c!d!n!} $$ +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | | A | B | | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | 1 | a | c | a+c | | 2 | b | d | b+d | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ | | a+b | c+d | n | +------------+---------+---------+--------+ For this table we get $$ \dfrac{{a + c\choose a}{b + d \choose b}}{{n\choose a+b}} = \dfrac{(a+b)!(c+d)!(a+c)!(b+d)!}{a!b!c!d!n!} $$ So the Fisher exact test is also invariant to switching the rows and columns.
