What research tool to use when researching a project?

I am currently working towards a Statistics BSc and am frequently having to organise my research. I am currently using a mixture of a mediawiki, and a bibliography browser plugin, to make an archive of my online data sources, and references to pdfs with useful information. but its becoming a bit of a mess. Is there any research tool that is orientated towards statistics? would-likes include //TODO, task tracking so I can have a central list of outstanding tasks some cloud storage, so I can access my archive from any machine some suggestions have been org-mode zotero mediawiki (I guess that anything I could store the files as text, I can distribute my work using SVN/git etc)
