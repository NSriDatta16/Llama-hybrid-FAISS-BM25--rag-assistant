Extracting random effects from a two-level logistic regression model in R

I am running a two-level logistic model using glmer from lme4 in R. I would like to extract the random effect terms of such a model (random effect estimate as a probability per cluster) and the standard error of this effect per cluster. Is it possible to do so (i.e. does it make sense?) and how would one go about doing that? Thank you very much!
