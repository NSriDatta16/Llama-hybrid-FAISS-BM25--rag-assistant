What is causing these browser rendering issues? Z-index conflicts? Positioning rules?

I'm developing a product to be used by a number of customers alongside our Web application. Quick background: These customers have incorporated into their pages a widget that we've developed. The widget's content can be modified by using our application. The idea behind this product is a bookmarklet that we supply, which will "highlight" our widget on their page, turning it into a clickable link that leads to an administration panel in our app. The "highlight" effect actually involves some z-index tricks; we create a semi-transparent "backdrop" just a few ticks below the maximum-supported z-index to gray out the page; then, we adjust the z-index of our widget to sit on top of that translucent backdrop. The visual effect should look about like this: http://skitch.com/troywarr/dtexp/example-good However, in Safari, as well as Firefox under certain conditions, there seem to be some sort of rendering artifacts that prevent this from looking as intended: http://skitch.com/troywarr/dteqx/example-bad As you can tell from the screenshot, a couple of elements (our logo image and the that holds an advertisement) are still "bright," as intended. But, the rest of the widget is still shaded-out. I've been poking around with Firebug for quite a while to try to get at the source of the problem, but I haven't had any revelations. I'm hoping that someone has experienced a similar issue, or recognizes the "visual signature" of this kind of problem. Or, if you're simply adept at JavaScript/jQuery and/or Firebug, I could really use your help trying to figure out where this approach is falling short. I created a test bookmarklet as a live example. To see it, please: Open Firefox (the version under development currently only works there reliably). Go to this page and drag the link there to your Bookmarks Bar: Example Bookmarklet Navigate to: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/07/30/sports/s170637D86.DTL Click the bookmarklet while on that page, and you should see what I'm referring to. Thanks very much in advance for any help! This has me baffled.
