First, let me suggest that your question is not necessarily obvious, but it uncovers one of the extreme complications surrounding factor analysis (and I, too, struggled with this while I was learning these concepts). In brief, there is a difference between a latent construct influencing how observed variables are related to each other and measuring a latent construct by taking weighted averages of those observe variables. I'll stick with the congeneric (single) factor analysis model in this answer. Technically, factors are not measured by weighted averages of indicators variables...though based on any reading of most texts that introduce these concepts, that is a reasonable error to make. In truth, factors are estimated using weighted averages of indicators. The distinction may seem minor, but in truth, it is very important. And this distinction stems from the direction of the arrows between the latent factor and the manifest (observed) variables. The arrows point from the latent factor to the manifest variables. This means that the value of the latent variable (that which we cannot see) is directly influencing the variables that we can see (that which we measured). So, if I have a set of variables that I believe are influenced by one single factor, then the observations you cite in the question are correct: there should be one large eigenvalue, that should be the only eigenvalue greater than one, the (standardized) factor loadings should be at least 0.4, etc. But, remember the direction of the arrows for this process. The latent variable exists first; the measured items exist second. But, if this is theoretically sound way to measure that which we cannot see, then going in reverse, taking a weighted average of these values should provide a reasonable estimate for that latent factor that I can't measure directly. This brings us to the next issue of confirmatory factor analysis (starting with a model that dictates which items load on which factors) vs. exploratory factor analysis (which attempts to locate possible factors among the measured variables). If you don't know how many factors there may be that are influencing your observed responses, then it is useful to employ a technique that generates multiple factors. With that info, you can then use various criteria to decide how many factors are appropriate. If you believe it is only one factor, then this would employ criteria comparable to what you mentioned above. However, the output of most procedures (like the example you provide from Stata) provides information on all the other possible factors. So, ¿what are those other factors? Well, here's where a bit of 9-dimensional geometry is needed. Well, maybe not...because we can possible reduce the cloud of data in 9-dimensional space to a smaller dimension. The image that helps here is to think about a cigar, a frisbee, and a rugby ball. If the cloud of points can essentially be contained in a cigar shaped cloud, then there is really only one dimension...or, there is only one factor. If the cloud of points is more frisbee shaped, then there are two dimensions (or two factors) that best describe the data. If the cloud of points is more contained in an oval shaped football, then there are three dimensions/factors. If you have a strong theoretical construct, then the single factor should be sufficient ( i.e. , the data can be described using one dimension—one factor). Happy to clarify as needed.
