From the C# Language Specification 3.0 , 1.10: An enum typeâ€™s storage format and range of possible values are determined by its underlying type. While I'm not 100% sure I would expect Microsoft C# compiler only allowing non-negative enum values, so if the underlying type is an Int32 (it is, by default) then I would expect about 2^31 possible values, but this is an implementation detail as it is not specified. If you need more than that, you're probably doing something wrong.
