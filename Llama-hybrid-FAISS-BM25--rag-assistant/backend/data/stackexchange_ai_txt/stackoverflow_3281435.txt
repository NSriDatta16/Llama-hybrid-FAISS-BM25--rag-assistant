Others have mentioned refactoring, and also focusing on breaking the class down to do just 1x responsibility (part of the S.O.L.I.D. rules for OOP). However; if your class is still 500x lines, and performing one responsibility, then you're not in too terrible a position. If your code-file contains XML documentation and white-spaces, then 500x lines is only slightly large (and that's dependent on what it does). Many of my "simple" classes end up around 350 lines once completed. Smaller is better, but concise is really what you want. Another good book for understanding how your code should look is Robert C. Martin's Clean Code . It lays down many good rules in designing well thought-out classes and methods.
