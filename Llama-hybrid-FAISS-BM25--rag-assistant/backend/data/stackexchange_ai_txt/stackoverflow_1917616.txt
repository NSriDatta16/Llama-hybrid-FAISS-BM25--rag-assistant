When using jquery the selectors work like they do in css. If you want to select all paragraphs you can just say $("p").do somthing They can of course get much more complex as well as adding classes, names, ect as well as a few extra jquery specific selectors. You can read more about selectors on their api page . select a form element with the name hello $("input[name=hello]").do something or the class hello $(".hello").do something If you want to do a mouseover you can do something like this. $(".hello").mouseover(function(){ //do something }).mouseout(function(){ //do something }); update: using firefox's web developer toolbar you can view the generated source. This will add all of the source generated by the search addon. This will help you in selecting your img correctly.
