What is a probability heat map?

What is a probability heat map? In general, what is a heat map? Many papers on neural networks use probability heat maps for visualisation. My understanding is that heat maps are plots of (typically continuous) values where there is a one-one correspondence between the range of values displayed and a spectrum of colours. Probability heat map is similar with different colours indicating regions of different probability. Is this intuition correct? For example, see the paper Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation which uses probability heatmaps for different human keypoints (although it doesn't explicitly use the term probability heatmap).
