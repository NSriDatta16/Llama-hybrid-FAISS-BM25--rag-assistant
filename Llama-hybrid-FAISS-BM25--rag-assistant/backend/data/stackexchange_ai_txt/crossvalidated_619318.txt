If you are doing EDA then you will get to know about if there is a bias or not from data side. On the other hand, if you ask me about the model being biased then I can say that if you can reduce the overfitting then it's highly likely that you will reduce some of the bias. Or you can choose another model to train. Second, if you think that nested cross validation is introducing some bias, then you can try with other cross validation techniques. But cross validation techniques are there to deal with these cases. Third, about which hyperparameters to tune, there is a framework called optuna: https://optuna.org/ . It uses random search over the range of parameters. Now why I am suggesting you is because it can plot the hyperparameters that are actually influencing the model. So you can see the hyperparameters that are actually useful to tune. So do check it out. Lastly, choosing a final model could be tricky. Why? Because different domains have different use cases. For e.g. banking, domain needs the models that can be explained easily. Other domain might require you to create a model that gives the metric score as good as possible. So, it depends on your domain and use case. But in general case, you need model to be less biased, highly explainable (except you are using black box model like Neural Network). RandomForest is a good start as it has low bias and low variance. Hope I answered your questions.
