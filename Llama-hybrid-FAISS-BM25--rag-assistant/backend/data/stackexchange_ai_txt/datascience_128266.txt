Treat Age as Categorical or Continuous

I am in the middle of processing data for feature reduction (haven't decided the method yet). The data consists of a row of people and ~3000 column of attributes that correspond to that person and is a mix of numeric and categorical. For most of the columns, the values are 0 to 1 (least likely to likely) in terms of probability they have this attributes. However, I do have some attributes like age and income. My questions are: For feature reduction/model training purposes - do I treat this age/income column as numeric where I normalize between 0 and 1 or categorical where each age is treated as category and one hot encoded. Does it make sense to normalize age between 0 and 1 considering most of the other columns have values between 0 and 1 that translate to probabilities. Does it makes sense for feature reduction to do PCA on continuous and MCA on categorical and combine them? Or is there a better approach?
