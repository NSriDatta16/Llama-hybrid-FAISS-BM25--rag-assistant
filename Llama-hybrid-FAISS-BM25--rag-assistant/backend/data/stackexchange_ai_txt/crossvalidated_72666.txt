Meta Analysis: Pooling samples or determine an average effect size

I am new to meta analysis and how I understood the terminology is that there are actually two ways of performing a meta analysis. Let's consider 5 clinical studies with fixed effects. Fixed effects in terms of the same medical treatment as well as demographic details of the participants. One way of analysing these data would be to pool all 5 studies together to obtain a very large study to increase the power to detect the effect of the medical treatment. The other would be to try to detect the effect in each analysis separately and then determine the average effect across the studies. As I understood meta analysis, both seem to be reasonable techniques. However, can anyone tell me pro's and con's for both techniques? When should I use which method? I would assume the results to be pretty similar anyhow or is that wrong to assume?
