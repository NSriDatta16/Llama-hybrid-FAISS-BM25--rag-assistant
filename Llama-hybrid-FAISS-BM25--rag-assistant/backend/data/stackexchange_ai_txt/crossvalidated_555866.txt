Determine Predictors Based on Logistic Regression p-values

I'm learning about logistic regression and have come across an interesting idea. Say I am given a dataset such as ISLR::default which comes from ISLR2 in R. I then make a model using all predictors and call a summary on the model to see the p-values of the predictors. Is it then valid to include or disclude certain predictors from my next model based on the significance of the predictors in the first model?
