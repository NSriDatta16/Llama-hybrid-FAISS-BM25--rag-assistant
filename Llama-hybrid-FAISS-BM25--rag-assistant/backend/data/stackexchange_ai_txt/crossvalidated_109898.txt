The coefficients obtained from an ordinal logistic regression model are called proportional odds ratios; you interpret them just like the coefficients from binary logistic regression models. In your case, I assume that the data are taken from a customer survey. The exponentiated coefficient value of 1.83 for Q10_1 means that one point increase in Q10_1 is associated with an 83% (i.e., 1.83 times) increase in the odds of a customer rating the DV one point higher, with all other predictors held constant. The same interpretation goes for the other variables. It is hard to judge which variables are important just based on the coefficient values, but just eyeballing them, Q10_3 appears to be the "most important" predictor, assuming it is also significant (i.e., its 95% confidence interval does not include 1). That is, higher performance (I suppose perceived by customers) is associated with higher satisfaction. You should test if this is really the case using the step function or the varImp function in the caret package, although I'm not sure if the latter supports polr . Also you should check the proportional odds assumption as well. See this webpage for detailed information.
