Assigning scrollByX and scrollByY to jspDrag in jScrollPane?

I am implementing jScrollPane for a project that involves horizontal scrolling. The client wants the horizontal scrolling to take place in increments, so that the user can basically jump from slide to slide. I can do this on the arrows using jScrollPane's API and "scrollByX". However, the problem lies with the scrollbar that the user can click on and drag back and forth and scroll the content that way. Is there any way to assign "scrollByX" (or "scrollByY", for that matter) to jspDrag so that when the user drags the scrollbar, the scrolling isn't continuous, but in increments as well? Thanks in advance.
