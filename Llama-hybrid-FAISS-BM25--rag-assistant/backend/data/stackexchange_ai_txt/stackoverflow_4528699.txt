This kind of stuttering is generally caused by the garbage collector. Monitor your collection count and check whether they correspond to stuttering periods (call GC.CollectionCount() with 0, 1 and 2 as parameters). If this is indeed the cause, you will need to profile and reduce memory allocations (object pools can help significantly here, as can structures in place of short-lived classes). As a rule of thumb, you don't want any gen-1 or gen-2 collections during regular gameplay. Edit: disable the soft frame-limiter (i.e. call Run() or Run(60) but not Run(60, 60)) and enable vsync. This might help reduce stutter. Additionally, make sure both monitors are synced to the same rate. Even slight differences will introduce stutter when dragging a window from the primary to a secondary monitor (I've seen this happen in differences as small as 60Hz vs 59.9Hz).
