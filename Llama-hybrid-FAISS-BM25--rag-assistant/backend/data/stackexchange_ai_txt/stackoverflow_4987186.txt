How can I wire up commands when a control is dragged from the toolbox (WPF)

I'm developing a user control. My control should be visible whenever the user presses ALT + S anywhere in the active Window. I'm going to use an ICommand and input bindings to achieve this. My question is: how can I wire this code up when a developer drags my control from the toolbox to their Window design surface? I know the code I want to generate (Window.CommandBindings etc) but don't know how to make that happen from the toolbox. Is there a way to do this? Thanks!
