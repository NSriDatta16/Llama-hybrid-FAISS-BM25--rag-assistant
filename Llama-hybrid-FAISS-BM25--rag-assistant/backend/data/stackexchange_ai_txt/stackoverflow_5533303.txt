My quick and dirty solution: I made the the 'email' and 'url' fields hidden fields, with an arbitrary value to get rid of 'this field is required' errors. It's not elegant, but it's quick and I didn't have to subclass CommentForm. All the work of adding comments was done in the template, which is nice. It looks like this (warning: not tested, since it's a simplified version of my actual code): {% get_comment_form for entry as form %} {% csrf_token %} {% for field in form %} {% if field.name != 'email' and field.name != 'url' %} {{field.label}} {{field}} {% endif %} {% endfor %}
