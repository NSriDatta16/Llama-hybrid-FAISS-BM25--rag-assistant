Notwithstanding the problems with CLT described by Glen_b, if we are talking about econometric analysis, then practicaly all results are asymptotic (except when Bayesian analysis is used). Hence any application which is based on econometrics is based on CLT. For example Lars Hansen got the Nobel prize last year for work on generalized method of moments, which is based on CLT. It might seem that such reliance on CLT is not a good thing, but on the other hand any econometric paper relying on asymptotics usually has a chapter with Monte Carlo simulations exploring the reliability of asymptotic results on small samples, and more often than not the results are not that bad.
