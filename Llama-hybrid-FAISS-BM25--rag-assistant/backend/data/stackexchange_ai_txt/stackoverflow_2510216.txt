I think the advice is not meant for scala especially, but for OO in general (so far I know scala is supposed to be a best-of-breed between OO and functional). Overriding is fine, it's the heart of polymorphism and is central to OO design. Overloading on the other hand is more problematic. With method overloading it's hard to discern which method will be really invoked and it's indeed a frequently a source of confusion. There is also rarely a justification why overloading is really necessary. The problem can most of the time be solved another way and I agree that overloading is a smell. Here is an article that explain nicely what I mean with "overloading is a source of confusion", which I think is the prime reason why it's discouraged. It's for java but I think it applies to scala as well.
