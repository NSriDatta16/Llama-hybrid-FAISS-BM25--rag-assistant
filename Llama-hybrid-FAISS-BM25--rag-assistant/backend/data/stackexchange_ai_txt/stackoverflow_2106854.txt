Codeigniter: Models questions!

i just got this doubt about models... This is my first 100% MVC project (kind of)... my doubt is...when ill do a join, union or whatever function with more than one table... how i do this? use the same model file of the "main table" or i need to create a new model file using the two or whatever tables?? Tkz... Roberto!
