I assume you've tried setting the timeout to 0. What HTTP status codes are these sites returning? Check curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE); . Something else to try could be spoofing the User-Agent header, perhaps with that of your own browser since you know that works to access these pages. They may just be trying to stop bots accessing the page. Investigating the headers and http codes should give you a little more information. Edit: I looked into this a bit more. One thing is that you've got a typo for the connection timeout - should be CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT . Anyway, I ran this script (below) which returned what you're looking for (I think). Check to see what's different between it and yours. I'm using PHP 5.2.8 if it helps. Which returns the following (TL;DR: my cURL can read the pages fine): C:\Users\Ross>php -e D:\sandbox\curl.php Address: http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi?dataSource=Chemical&modeInput=Absolute&primaryGene=At5g02310&orthoListOn=0 Info: Array ( [url] => http://atensembl.arabidopsis.info/Arabidopsis_thaliana_TAIR/unisearch?species=Arabidopsis_thaliana_TAIR;idx=;q=At5g02310 [content_type] => text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1 [http_code] => 200 [header_size] => 168 [request_size] => 151 [filetime] => -1 [ssl_verify_result] => 0 [redirect_count] => 0 [total_time] => 0.654 [namelookup_time] => 0.004 [connect_time] => 0.044 [pretransfer_time] => 0.044 [size_upload] => 0 [size_download] => 7531 [speed_download] => 11515 [speed_upload] => 0 [download_content_length] => 0 [upload_content_length] => 0 [starttransfer_time] => 0.57 [redirect_time] => 0 ) AtEnsembl release 49: Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR EnsEMBL UniSearch results @import url(/css/ensembl.css); @import url(/css/content.css); @import url(/css/printer-styles.css); @import url(/css/screen-styles.css); Address: http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi?dataSource=Chemical&modeInput=Absolute&primaryGene=At5g02310&orthoListOn=0 Info: Array ( [url] => http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi?dataSource=Chemical&modeInput=Absolute&primaryGene=At5g02310&orthoListOn=0 [content_type] => text/html; charset=UTF-8 [http_code] => 200 [header_size] => 146 [request_size] => 155 [filetime] => -1 [ssl_verify_result] => 0 [redirect_count] => 0 [total_time] => 2.695 [namelookup_time] => 0.004 [connect_time] => 0.131 [pretransfer_time] => 0.131 [size_upload] => 0 [size_download] => 14156 [speed_download] => 5252 [speed_upload] => 0 [download_content_length] => 0 [upload_content_length] => 0 [starttransfer_time] => 2.306 [redirect_time] => 0 ) Arabidopsis eFP Browser So what this means? Not entirely sure. I doubt that they're blocking you specifically (as you can access the page, unless you're running this script on a webserver). Try running my code above - if that works then try commenting out parts of your code to see what's different (and possibly causing a stoppage). Also what PHP version are you running?
