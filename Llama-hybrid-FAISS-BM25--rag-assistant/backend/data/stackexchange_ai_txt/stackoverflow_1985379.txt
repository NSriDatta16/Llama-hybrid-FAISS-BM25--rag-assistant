If you have the function that was registered as the listener: mybutton.removeEventListener( 'click', theFunction ); If you don't... well, consider reorganizing the code? You might also be able to add another handler something like this: mybutton.addEventListener( 'click', function( e:Event ):void { e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false; }, false, 1 ); Which might prevent further handlers from running (the 1 at the end is the priority )... Hard to say sometimes with flex.
