Why is the term "Monte Carlo simulation" used instead of "Random simulation"?

I always read/hear "Monte Carlo" simulations. I have done "Monte Carlo" simulations before to calculate the odds in certain gambling games as part of my job and it was nothing more than basically using an RNG to simulate random results (slot machines spinning wheels) and build upon them to get the final result of the game, repeat and get an estimated average outcome. Anyone would be doing this without ever knowing that what they're doing is called "Monte Carlo" X. My question is, is there any reason to call a random simulation a "Monte Carlo" simulation other than sounding sophisticated/clever? Any technical/legitimate reasons? EDIT: I suggest people read this question's answers . It represents what I wanted to ask about better. I was trying to find out if there are technical reasons to distinguish between a "Monte Carlo" and a "random" simulation, disregarding any historical reasons.
