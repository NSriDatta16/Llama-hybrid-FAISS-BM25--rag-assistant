How to test hypothesis?

I have a table named app_satisfaction which has user_id, satisfaction, # of people they've invited. I've grouped by satisfaction and found that on averge. people in satisfaction ="BAD" group invted 2.25 people, "GOOD" group invited 2.09 people, and "EXECELLENT" group invited 1.89 people. So my hypothesis is people who dislike the app are more likely to invite people since inviting people gives them free coupon and they do not like to spend their own money on app they dislike. I have a problem, just by looking at average invite in each group it seems unreasonable to draw conclusion. Also there are more people in "GOOD", "EXCELLENT" group compared to "BAD" group. How can I test my hypothesis? what are the approaches one might take in real world problems?
