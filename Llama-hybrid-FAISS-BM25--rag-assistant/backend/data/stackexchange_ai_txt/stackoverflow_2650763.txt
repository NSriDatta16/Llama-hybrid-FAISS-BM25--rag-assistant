Confused about method definition: def req=(request)

I found this in Ryan Bates' railscast site, but not sure how it works. #models/comment.rb def req=(request) self.user_ip = request.remote_ip self.user_agent = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] self.referrer = request.env['HTTP_REFERER'] end #blogs_controller.rb def create @blog = Blog.new(params[:blog]) @blog.req = request if @blog.save ... I see he is saving the user ip, user agent and referrer, but am confused with the req=(request) line.
