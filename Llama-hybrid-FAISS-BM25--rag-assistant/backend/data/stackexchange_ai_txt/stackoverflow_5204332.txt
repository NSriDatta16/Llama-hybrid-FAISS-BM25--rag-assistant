If you have the estimation in man-hour, you just have to divide that number by the number of people working on it to get the number of hours it will require. So a 6 man-hour project will take 6/1 = 6 hours with 1 programmer, 6/2 = 3 hours with 2 programmers. I think wikipedia has a good article on this topic : see Here EDIT: ok since people tends to make me believe this is more than a "use of the man-hour system" question, here is some more tips : To manage a project with more accuracy than the system you have multiples tools that can help your. Many of them are included in project management systems. First of all you need to identify sub units of the development. Then you'll be able to make a GANTT chart with dependencies that will build a structure in your project. By doing so, and assigning people to sub units, you can by the mean of man-hour system estimate the time required for this particular unit. Then the different constrains put up by dependencies, vacation days (and so on), will give you the estimate date of end of works. GANTT also allow you to work backwards: setting up constraint on end of project and using the dependencies constraints to compute the beginning date of your project. Pieces of software that will help you do that are (non exhaustively) MS Project, Gantt project (open source) and surely a lot more. You can also look on different tools use by project managers : PERT chart, activity diagram and many other I do not use and/or know about. I hope this provides more useful help than the previous edit.
