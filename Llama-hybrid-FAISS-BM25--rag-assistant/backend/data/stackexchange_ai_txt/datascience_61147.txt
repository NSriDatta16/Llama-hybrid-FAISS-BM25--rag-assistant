How to construct validation set for time series for NN?

I would like to train my model with a validation set. As the data is a time series I have to use timeseriessplit : import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]]) y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5) print(tscv) TimeSeriesSplit(max_train_size=None, n_splits=5) for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X): ... print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index) ... X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index] ... y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index] TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1] TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2] TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3] TRAIN: [0 1 2 3] TEST: [4] TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4] TEST: [5] Using this method, I obtain a train and test set. But how can I generate a validation set now?
