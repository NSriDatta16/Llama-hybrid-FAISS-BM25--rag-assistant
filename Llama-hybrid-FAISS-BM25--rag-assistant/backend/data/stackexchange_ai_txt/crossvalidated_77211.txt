Estimating population size of a subgroup based on independent samples without replacement

Let a bag have 1000 balls, 100 red and 900 blue. Now, let us get ten independent samples (without replacement within each sample) of the original population (10% each). Proceed to count the number of red balls in each sample, i.e.: (9, 10, 10, 11, 13, 8, 5, 15, 12, 9) To estimate the number of red balls in the original population, one can calculate the average of the above list and divide by the sample. In this case: (9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 8 + 5 + 15 + 12 + 9) / 10 / 0.1 = 102 My questions are thus: Instead of a number, how can I obtain the probability mass function of the estimated population? Is it sound to use the central limit theorem here, where the distribution $N = (\mu,\sigma^2/n)$ ? I have a problem with this approach since negative values don't make sense. Now imagine I have an infinite numbers of samples (all w/ 10% of the population), or at least a very high (but known) number of samples, and keep getting the result for each of them, one by one. How do I decide when it is likely ok to stop (within a certain confidence)? Some clarifications over the original problem: The population size is known à priori . But the number of colors is not known à priori . Neither their ratio. Each sample take balls without replacement. Samples are independent (after a sample is taken, all balls are replaced).
