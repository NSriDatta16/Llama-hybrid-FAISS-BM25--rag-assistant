For a class named Foo: public class Foo { public static int add(int x, int y) { return x+y; } } write a JUnit test like this: public class FooTest: { @Test public void testAdd() { int expected = 5; int actual = Foo.add(2, 3); Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual); } } I create /src and /test folders in my IntelliJ project and mirror the package structure under each one. You can have IntelliJ run all the tests in your project by right clicking on the /test folder and selecting "Run all tests". If you edit configurations on your "all tests" task, you'll see a checkbox to ask IntelliJ to check code coverage for you. It'll refresh the values after every test run.
