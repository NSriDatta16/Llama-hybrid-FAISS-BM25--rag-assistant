There is no particular reason why the code you have shouldn't work. You can assign a NSManageObject instance as an attribute. The simplest explanation for the crash is an out of bounds error for the array. When you don't get an error from the consoles its usually because the debugger has crashed. That is usually caused by having some kind of recursion that causes the debugger stack to overflow. However, putting data logic in a view element like a button is very, very poor practice. This completely breaks the MVC design pattern and will make your code fragile and hard to maintain. UI elements should be "dumb" and only understand how to display any data handed to them, they shouldn't be involved in actually tracking the data itself. That is the function of the controller and the data model respectively. Ideally, the "player" object should be tracked by the data model which the controller then links to the appropriate UI button or other UI element. Putting the tracking of the player in the data model makes the design flexible which makes it easy to expand, reuse and maintain.
