How to identify curl request

Is there a way to detect in my script whether the request is coming from normal web browser or some script executing curl. I can see the headers and can distinguish with "User-Agent and other few headers" but in curl fake headers can be set, so i am not able to track the request. Please suggest me ways about identifying the curl or other similar non browser request.
