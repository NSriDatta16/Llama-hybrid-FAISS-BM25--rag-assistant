An average of averages problem, or two valid results?

From an event log I have derived the days between each user's logins. This leaves me with a dataframe like this: I then took the average of column 'days_between_logins' which gave me a result of 15.9 days. But then, if I calculate the average number of days between logins on an individual user basis and then average that across all users, the result is 34 days. I think I have an average of averages problem? Then again, I think both results are valid. I would really welcome any thoughts or supporting/opposing conclusions.
