Package javax.xml.registry.infomodel.* What is it for? Forget or implement?

Looking through Java EE6 API I've found interesting package javax.xml.registry.infomodel , containing such interfaces as PostalAddress (having city, street, zip ...) Organization (having users, child structures, contacts, phone numbers) PersonName (first/last/middle name) EmailAddress TelephoneNumber (country/ area codes, type, extension, etc) User (person name, web page, address, etc) .... As it's stated in API, This package describes the information model for JAXR API which is dated April 2002 and, in turn, in it's abstract says: Currently there are numerous overlapping specifications for business registries. Examples include ISO 11179, OASIS, eCo Framework, ebXML and UDDI. JAXR provides a uniform and standard API for accessing such registries within the Java platform. Most of Java developers are dealing with these entities every day, implementing them in their own way. Meaning this top, infomodel, level of the package with widely known entities, when should we consider implement them? Potentially google-sized projects? Interfacing with ERP systems? Or is it that our world is moving towards standardization and it's becoming a matter of good manners, or even requirements, to follow these standards? Can it be that in a couple of years customer will call to me and say 'I want everything to be ebXML compliant, now!' and I'd say 'I am already!' ? Is JAXR something growing and promising?
