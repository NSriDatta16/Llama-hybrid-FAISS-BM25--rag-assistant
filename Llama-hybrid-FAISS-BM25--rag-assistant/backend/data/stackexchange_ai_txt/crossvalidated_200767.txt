I do not see how could subtracting means be used in cluster analysis research. If you subtract grand mean from each of the variables, this would not impact the results anyhow since clustering algorithms do not care what are the actual values of datapoints in your variables. You can subtract, add, or multiply the values by any constant and the values should be the same since clustering algorithm is interested only in similarities between cases (e.g. a group of observations has both high values in X1 and X2 so they are grouped together, no matter what are the variables and what are the actual values). Below you can see an R example of clustering with k-means after subtracting grand means. As you can see, the results are exactly the same (notice that the algorithm uses some randomization so they can differ by chance). > table(kmeans(mtcars, centers = 4)$cluster, kmeans(scale(mtcars, scale = FALSE), centers = 4)$cluster) 1 2 3 4 1 16 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 4 0 0 0 4 If you subtracted group means this will result in grouping together by similarities in their distances from group means. It is hard for me to imagine how this could lead to any interpretable results (besides of obviously grouping together cases that are close to their group average on all variables).
