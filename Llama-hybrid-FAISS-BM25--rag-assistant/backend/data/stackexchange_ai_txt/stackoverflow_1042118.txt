Try this setting: (setq paragraph-separate "[ ]*\\(//+\\|\\**\\)\\([ ]*\\| \\)$\\|^\f") That tells fill-paragraph what separates paragraphs, and I customized it to include a a space and a matching pair of angle brackets. This might get you what you want. It worked for the example you provided. Of course you'll have to set that variable in one of the c-mode hooks, like: (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook '(lambda () (setq paragraph-separate "...")))
