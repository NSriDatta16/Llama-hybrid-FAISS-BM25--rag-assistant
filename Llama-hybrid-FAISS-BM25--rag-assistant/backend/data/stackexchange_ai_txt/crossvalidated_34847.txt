This is answered by Gauss-Markov theorem. If the residuals are mean zero, homoscedastic and uncorrelated the OLS estimates have minimum variance among all unbiased estimates. Since there are distributions which are asymmetrical, but with zero mean, as long as you only care about minimum variance and not normality, the answer to both of your question is yes. A side note. Skewness is a property of single distribution. In time series the sample is a draw from stochastic process. Unless you are working with strictly stationary variables each $Y_t$ might have different distribution.
