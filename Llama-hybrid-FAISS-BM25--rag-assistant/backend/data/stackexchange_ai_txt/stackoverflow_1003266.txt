These are two distinct problems. Capturing/processing sounds like a render farm-like problem. Those are scaled trivially horizontally. Most solutions involve a queue of jobs, you don't even need to do this in Java; just find a simple solution you like. "render farm ffmpeg" or stuff like that should yield results in Google. Your 'serving out as a web service' part is somewhat undefined. If you want those videos to be accesible, you might just need to put them on an HTTP server- those can be load-balanced easily and thus be horizontally scalable- storage speed or network bandwidth would probably be your first bottlenecks there.
