Is Reinforcement Learning suitable for optimal control problems in which actions influence rewards but not states?

In particular, rewards $r = f(s, a, s')$, but states are independent of actions $s' = g(s)$. A example could be asset trading that actions (long, short, hold) of a small trader won't affect market prices. Edit: Just did some quick search and seems like this is a contextual bandit problem. Then is it possible to directly apply RL algorithms to these problems? Intuitively it might be less efficient to directly apply the methods, since $a$ is redundant for the state transition.
