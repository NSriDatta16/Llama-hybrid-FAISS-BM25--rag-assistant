It depends on the compiler/runtime and on the operator new that you are using (e.g. certain versions of Visual Studio will not throw out of the box , but would rather return a NULL pointer a la malloc instead.) You can always catch a std::bad_alloc exception, or explicitly use nothrow new to return NULL instead of throwing. (Also see past StackOverflow posts revolving around the subject.) Note that operator new , like malloc , will fail when you have run out of memory, out of address space (e.g. 2-3GB in a 32-bit process depending on the OS), out of quota ( ulimit was already mentioned) or out of contiguous address space (e.g. fragmented heap.)
