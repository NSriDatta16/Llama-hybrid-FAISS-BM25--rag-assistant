Handle multiple categorial features in character level RNN

I am working on a fantasy name generator and I have 2 auxiliary categorical features (gender and race). I initially tried concatenating their one hot tensors directly into the input tensor (I think it's the most popular approach), but the model failed to differentiate between continues and categorical features (ignores the categorical features). I read several similar questions and the closest ones I found were this and this , which suggested first combining these features via a Dense layer(or multiple layers) and then concatenate Dense layer's output with input tensor (of names). One alternative approach I have found is using thi Are there any other alternate approaches ? also one question I have about this approach is that here too, ultimately the auxiliary features are concatenated with input tensor. Why should the model not ignore features with this approach ?
