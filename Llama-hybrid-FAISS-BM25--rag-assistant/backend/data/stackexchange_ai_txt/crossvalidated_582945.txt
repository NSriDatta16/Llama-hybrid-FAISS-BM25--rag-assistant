I would be careful with this method. Usually, the importance attribute given by a model only refers to this model, i.e. it is just saying that, for this particular model, this column has this special importance. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it is as important in other models. So the real question is rather about how you want to use the importance. For the application of e.g. Random Forest, you should use only the importance given by Random Forest.
