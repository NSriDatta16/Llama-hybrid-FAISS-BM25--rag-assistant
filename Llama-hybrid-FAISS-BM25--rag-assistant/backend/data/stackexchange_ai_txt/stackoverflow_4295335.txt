Are there HTTP header fields I could use to spot spam bots?

It stands to reason that scrapers and spambots wouldn't be built as well as normal web browsers. With this in mind, it seems like there should be some way to spot blatant spambots by just looking at the way they make requests. Are there any methods for analyzing HTTP headers or is this just a pipe-dream? Array ( [Host] => example.com [Connection] => keep-alive [Referer] => http://example.com/headers/ [Cache-Control] => max-age=0 [Accept] => application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 [User-Agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.44 Safari/534.7 [Accept-Encoding] => gzip,deflate,sdch [Accept-Language] => en-US,en;q=0.8 [Accept-Charset] => ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 )
