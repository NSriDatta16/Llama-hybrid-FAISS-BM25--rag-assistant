I'm wondering why you could use the dot-notation to access the presentationLayer . It is a method, not a property of CALayer . Note: "Use of [UIView beginAnimations:context:] is discouraged in iPhone OS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead." (Apple Docs). If you don't know what block-based animations are, read: What are block-based animation methods in iPhone OS 4.0? If it still doesn't work with block-based animations, try to set the layer's delegate to nil or use CABasicAnimation either implicitly or explicitly.
