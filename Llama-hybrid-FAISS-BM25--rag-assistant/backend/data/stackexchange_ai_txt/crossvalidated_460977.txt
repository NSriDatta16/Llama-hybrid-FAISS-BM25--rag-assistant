Identifiability is determined by the sampling distribution, not the prior. It means that different parameter combinations lead to the exact same sampling distribution, so they cannot be distinguished based on the data. (Bayesian analysis for a non-identifiable parameters is explained in this related answer ; short version is that adding a prior distribution to the parameters does not fix the identifiability problem.) In this case, the fact that the parameters enter the model only through the term $\alpha \beta^2$ means that neither $\alpha$ or $\beta$ are identifiable parameters. The minimum sufficient parameter in the model is $\phi \equiv \alpha \beta^2$ . This parameter can be estimated from the data, but it is not possible to use the data to decompose this into its parts based on the other two parameters.
