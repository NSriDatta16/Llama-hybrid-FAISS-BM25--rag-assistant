I don't believe you can stop user agents that don't obey your advice. Before going down this route I would really want to make ascertain that bots/spiders are a problem - doing anything that prevents natural navigation of your site should be seen as a last resort. If your really want to stop spiders what you might want to consider is using javascript in the your links so that navigation only happens after the link is clicked. This should stop spiders. Personally I'm not fussed about spiders or bots.
