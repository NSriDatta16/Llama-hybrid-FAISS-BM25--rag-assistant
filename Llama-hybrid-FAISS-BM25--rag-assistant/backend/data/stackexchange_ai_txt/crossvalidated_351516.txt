You would have to output vectors of means and standard deviations rather than discrete values to achieve that. One solution to get those vectors would be variational inference - generate those, sample w/reparametrization, then optimize so the results of the sampling match the original values like in normal regression (i.e. MSE/MAPE/MAE/whatever loss) and regularize the means and stddev to 0/1 respectively. Essentially the same process as a vanilla Variational Autoencoder, except you're not bound by the Autoencoder architecture, and you want the means/stddevs as the outputs of the trained network rather than the sampled values.
