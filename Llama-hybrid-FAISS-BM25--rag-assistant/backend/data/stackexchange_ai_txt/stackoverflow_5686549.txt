Indeed, when you call exit ; it means "immediately stop all processing; this script is finished." Anything that comes after it — including HTML — will not be interpreted. A better organization would be to make this code a function, to the effect of: function uploadMyStuffPlease() { if($_POST['upload']) { if($_FILES['image']['name'] == "") { #there's no file name return an error echo " Please select a file to upload!\n "; return; } #we have a filename, continue // .... } Now you can simply call uploadMyStuffPlease() , which will do as much processing as it can, and perhaps return early in the event of an error. Either way, the function will return, and so the rest of your script (including that HTML) can still be interpreted.
