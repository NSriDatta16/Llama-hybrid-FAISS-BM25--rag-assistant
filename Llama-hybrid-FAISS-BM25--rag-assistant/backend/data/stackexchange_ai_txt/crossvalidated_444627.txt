What does it mean if a regression model is not significant, but individual variables are?

With a logistic regression model of 3 independent variables, one of the variables is significant while the other two are not. The significant variable is my variable of interest while the other two are control variables (age and gender). The model is not significant either. The aim is to answer whether or not my variable of interest increases the odds of outcome y independent of age and gender. What does this mean for the interpretation of the model?
