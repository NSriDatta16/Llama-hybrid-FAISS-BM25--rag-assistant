Why do you need a GUI to craft your emails? It is best to keep the email content as simple as possible instead of embedding HTML tags in it. If your user decides to open the email with plain/text, then all they see are just bunch of ugly tags. Using template engine such as Velocity or Freemarker is the way to go to craft your email template. Even with adhoc emails, you may want to keep the header and footer to be the same using the email template and you can swap out the body content with your adhoc messages. In my project, I have an email template using Velocity, like this:- exception-email.vm file ** Please do not reply to this message ** The project administrator has been notified regarding this error. Remote Host : $remoteHost Server : $serverName Request URI : $requestURI User ID : $currentUser Exception : $stackTrace To get the constructed email as string, I do the following:- private String getMessage(HttpServletRequest request, Throwable t) { Map values = new HashMap (); values.put("remoteHost", request.getRemoteHost()); values.put("serverName", request.getServerName()); values.put("requestURI", request.getRequestURI()); values.put("currentUser", ((currentUser != null) ? currentUser.getLanId() : "(User is undefined)")); StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(500); t.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(sw)); values.put("stackTrace", sw.toString()); return VelocityEngineUtils.mergeTemplateIntoString(velocityEngine, "exception-email.vm", values); } Granted, I'm using Spring to wire in velocityEngine :- class org.apache.velocity.runtime.resource.loader.ClasspathResourceLoader
