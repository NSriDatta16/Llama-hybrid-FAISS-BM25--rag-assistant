Spring 3.x and Hibernate Envers

I'm having a problem getting Hibernate Envers to work in our environment. We are using Spring 3.x with LoadTimeWeaving. Below is our context file: Here is our persistence.xml org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence The audit tables are setup correctly, but when an entity is persisted there are no records stored in the audit tables. There are only two fields that are audited. Also, because we are using loadTimeWeaving, when we run unit test, we are required to have -javaagent:/Users/TEST/.m2/repository/org/springframework/spring-instrument/3.0.3.RELEASE/spring-instrument-3.0.3.RELEASE.jar as a JVM argument so the loadTimeWeaving works. Aside from Envers, everything else works fine. Any help would be much appreciated.
