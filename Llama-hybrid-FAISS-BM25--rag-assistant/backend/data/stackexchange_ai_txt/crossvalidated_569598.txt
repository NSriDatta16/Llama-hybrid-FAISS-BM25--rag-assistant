Approximate output of unknown function using neural networks

I have a block that outputs a single value when fed with a time series containing a 1000 points. I also have a dataset of records of about 20000 input time series (each containing a 1000 points) and their corresponding 20000 output values. I want to model this (unknown) block. I thought that a neural network might help with that. I'm not sure, however, how to go about implementing this. Any help is appreciated. Precision: I'm not looking to predict or forecast time series data. My input I referred to as time series is actually a signal (a measurement taken from a sensor). The unknown function computes a (single-value) characteristic/parameter. A similar case would be a function that computes the mean value of the signal, only here I don't know what the function really is. What I'm looking for is therefore not prediction or forecasting (I already looked at recurrent NN) but rather a model that allows me to model this unknown function to be able to get an estimate of this characteristic for inputs other than the ones I already have in my dataset.
