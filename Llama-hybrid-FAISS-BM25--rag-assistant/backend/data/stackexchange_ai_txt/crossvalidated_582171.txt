It is to be expected that your tuned BERT model, MLM tuned over the complete domain (containing all the product categories (classes)), performs better than a vanilla off-the-shelf BERT model. Of course, you should use some hyperparameter tuning software like keras tuner or optuna which can use Bayesian optimization to tweak the search. Also, you might want to compare your results with that of a vanilla BERT to see how much effect this additional work has.
