@ Staale It is certainly possibly, but as you note, that would make it blocking (at home for something like 10 seconds due to sleeping disks), meaning I can't use it to update the UI directly. I could use the iterator to create a copy of the result in a separate thread and then send that to the UI, but while the iterator solution by itself is rather elegant, it won't fit in very well. In the end, something implementing IStructuredContentProvider needs to return an array of all the objects in order to display it in a TableViewer , so if I can get away with getting something like that out of a callback... :) I'll give it some more thought. I might just be able to work out something. It does give the code a nice look.
