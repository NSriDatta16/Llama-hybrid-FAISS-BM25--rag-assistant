Why aren't ASP.Net MVC Portable Areas Thriving Like Rails Plugins?

I love the idea of the Portable Areas in MvcContrib. After reading up on it, and building a couple for practice, I was surprised not to find a plethora of open source projects leveraging this neat way to distribute features across MVC applications. Being a guy who has messed around with Rails frequently, I love that I can find a plugin for just about anything. (Comments, Authentication, Search, CMS, Logging, etc.) However, when searching for Portable Areas, the only ones I see are the samples and an OpenId implementation. Where is the love for Portable Areas? Is it too new? Is there something wrong with the architecture? Is there just not as thriving an open source community as there is in Ruby world?
