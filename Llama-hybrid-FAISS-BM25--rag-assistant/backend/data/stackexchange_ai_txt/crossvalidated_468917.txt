Random Forest Regressor/Classifier is an appealing option, because: It is very fast and easy to setup and train (especially with the Sklearn package). It handles both categorical and numerical features. The "feature importance" property provides a really nice analysis tool. it requires less preprocessing than other supervised algorithms. I am not saying it is the best model for your problem. I'm saying it's a good algorithm to start with.
