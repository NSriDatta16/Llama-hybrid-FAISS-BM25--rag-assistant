SGDClassifier and PCA

In here Mentioned: If you apply SGD to features extracted using PCA we found that it is often wise to scale the feature values by some constant c such that the average L2 norm of the training data equals one. I don't get how can i scale the feature values by some constant c. Would you please write some line of python code for this scaling?
