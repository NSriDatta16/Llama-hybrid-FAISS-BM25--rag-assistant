Looking for ideas to improve Weighted Moving Average result

I have two data sets: Dataset#1: Frequency | Score ------------------ 1 | 100 Dataset#2: Frequency | Score ------------------ 50 | 80 60 | 90 The Weighted average of the Dataset #1 is 100 The Weighted average of the Dataset #2 is 85.45 The dataset#2 is much more credible and reliable since it has more data, What techniques can I use such that it discredit outliers low frequency datasets like Dataset#1 above and boost highly populated high score datasets like Dataset#2?
