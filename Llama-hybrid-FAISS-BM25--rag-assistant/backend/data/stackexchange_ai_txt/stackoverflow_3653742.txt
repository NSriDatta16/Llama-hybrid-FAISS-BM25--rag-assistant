Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves transforming or extracting useful information from natural language data. Methods include machine-learning and rule-based approaches. It is often regarded as the engineering arm of Computational Linguistics. NOTE: If you want to use this tag for a question not directly concerning implementation , then consider posting on Data Science , or Artificial Intelligence instead; otherwise you're probably off-topic.
