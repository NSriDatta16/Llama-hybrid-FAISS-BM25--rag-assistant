Issues with running SSIS packages programmatically

I have spent days trying to solve this problem and still stuck with this and I have posted some questions already on this website, but didn't get satisfactory answers. I am trying to be more clear this time and hope to get a better answer. I have gone through this article already http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michen/archive/2007/03/22/running-ssis-package-programmatically.aspx and here are my issues (I need to run the SSIS package from ASP.NET) option 1 is not suitable for me, because it may recycle worker process if it consumes memory option 2 is also not suitable because of security issues in creating a new process and passing the context to new process looks very complicated for me (according to the support article) option 3 is not suitable because using SQL Server Agent to run SSIS package is not allowed by the company I am working for(I guesss it requires installation of db engine on application server, not sure). but SSIS is installed on the application server. option 4&5 will have the same issues as options 1&2. I guess the only option left now is to create a windows service and start the service from ASP.NET. but will this allow running multiple packages in parallel? OR is there a better alternate solution for this? please let me know. Thanks.
