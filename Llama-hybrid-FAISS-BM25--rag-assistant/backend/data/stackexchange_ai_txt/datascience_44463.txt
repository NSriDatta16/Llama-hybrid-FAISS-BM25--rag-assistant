Detect presence of text in image

I want a simple image classifier to detect (No need to recognize) whether an image contains text or not. Some of the approaches I thought of: Single class image classifier with a Threshold Fast/Faster RNN technique Which is the best approach? And if I have to detect text or logo, is it efficient to use single class and feed all data together or use 2 classes? Thank you
