Measure ASP.NET page load time

I'm currently developing an ASP.NET application which uses a MasterPage and I want to measure my application webform's loading time and display that information to the client. My current strategy involves using the Application_BeginRequest event associated callback (in the Global.asax file of my website solution), to start the measurement of the time spent on the server-side process (as follows) protected void Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) { Context.Items.Add("Request_Start_Time", DateTime.Now); } and calculate the elapsed time on the webform's OnPreRender event associated callback, printing it on a placeholder element (as follows) protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) { base.OnPreRender(e); TimeSpan tsDuration = DateTime.Now.Subtract((DateTime)Context.Items["Request_Start_Time"]); ExecutionTime.InnerHtml = " Server-side processing duration: " + tsDuration.TotalMilliseconds + " miliseconds. "; } is this the best way to measure loading time? Is there a more "elegant" way to accomplish this? Thanks in advance for your time and cooperation.
