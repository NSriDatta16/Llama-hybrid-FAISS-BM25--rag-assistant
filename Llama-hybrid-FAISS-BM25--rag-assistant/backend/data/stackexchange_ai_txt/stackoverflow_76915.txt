If you ask 100 different CMS users about the most important thing about their CMS, you'll probably get 80+ different answers. The biggest roadblock is probably going to be people asking you why you built a new CMS from scratch. If you don't know the answer to that question, I'm not sure why you're going down this path. One thing to keep in mind is that for an internet CMS, folks are going to want integration points with many of the "usual" services. Leverage existing services such as photo sharing sites, Twitter, OpenID and the like before building your own proprietary solutions.
