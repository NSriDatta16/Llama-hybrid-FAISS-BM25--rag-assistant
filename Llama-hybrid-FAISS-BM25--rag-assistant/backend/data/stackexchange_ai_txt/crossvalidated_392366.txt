Indeed in GLMs and because you have no random effects, the inverse-link transformed regression coefficients have an interpretation for the for the mean of the outcome. However, in GLMMs and because there you do have random effects, the inverse-link transformed regression coefficients have an interpretation for the for the mean of the outcome conditional on the random effects. Most often you are interested in the marginal mean of the outcome averaged over the random effects distribution, but the coefficients you obtained from the GLMMs do not have this interpretation.
