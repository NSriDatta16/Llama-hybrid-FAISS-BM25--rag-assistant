The Test Statistic of the Neyman - Pearson Lemma

I cannot understand this statement from the book Robust Statistics : The most powerful tests between two densities $p_0$ and $p_1$ , are based on a statistic of the form $$\int \psi F_n(dx) = \frac{1}{n}\Sigma \psi (x_i), \text{ where } \psi(x) = \log\left(\frac{p_0}{p_1}\right)$$ There are two densities $p_0$ and $p_1$ but in the integral $\psi$ is multiplied by empirical distribution $F_n$ , why? Also, it looks like the integral is not over x but over density $f_n(x)$ ? And I cannot understand why the integral is equal to the average of the logarithm of the ratio of two densities? I guess, that makes sense, if $\int F_n(dx) = \psi f_n$ , but then what is $f_n$ ?
