Resource allocation is a delicate balance between keeping primary storage available for use and preventing needing to go to secondary as much as possible. If a process tries to allocate memory and can't that's usually an exception and sometimes a fatal exception. Essentially, you can't keep everything in RAM with no free resources available because when a program starts or asks for more it will crash.
