Is an artificial neural network a kind of metaheuristic?

In a research paper i have written i am solving a problem through the use of an ANN, which learns to model a technical process through training data. I compare that to metaheuristic approaches, which can also find relevant outputs from inputs by searching, e.g., with a genetic algorithm and an appropriate cost function. A reviewer gave me the feedback that ANN are also a kind of metaheuristics, so i should not compare ANN vs. metaheuristics as different kinds of approaches in the paper. Is this correct? I have looked up the definition of metaheuristic and while i think that i could use a metaheuristic optimizer instead of a gradient based one, an ANN itself is not a metaheuristic.
