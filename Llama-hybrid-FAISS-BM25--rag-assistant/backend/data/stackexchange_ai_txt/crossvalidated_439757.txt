Not necessarily for Bayes factors. But Bayes factors require conversion to posterior probabilities for proper inference, and posterior probabilities most definitely can require a Bonferroni-style multiplicity adjustment of sorts. Here is the explanation: If the hypotheses are independent a priori , then probability that all nulls are simultaneously true decreases to zero very rapidly as the number of hypotheses tested increases. But there may be scientific doubt as to whether any effect exists: For example, in a neuroimaging study there can be doubt as to whether the association studied has any neuronal basis whatsoever. (Nevertheless, the most extreme statistics are likely to suggest an association, simply because when you look at a large number of statistics, the extreme values will likely be quite atypical.) In cases such as this where there is scientific doubt about whether there is any association whatsoever, you must set your prior probability on the global null hypothesis to some non-infinitesimal value in order to correctly model such doubt. In doing so, your prior probabilities on the component nulls are necessarily increased from commonly-used levels (such as 0.5), depending on the number of hypotheses tested, and depending on your assessment of their degree of prior dependence. Such a change in the prior probabilities on the component nulls causes a change (or adjustment) in the posterior probabilities on the component nulls. This adjustment is similar to the usual Bonferroni adjustment when the components are assumed independent a priori , and is less extreme than the Bonferroni adjustment when the components are assumed dependent. This issue is discussed in the following literature. The last reference discusses how to do the analysis when you assume prior dependence. Jeffreys, H. Theory of Probability. Oxford press.
