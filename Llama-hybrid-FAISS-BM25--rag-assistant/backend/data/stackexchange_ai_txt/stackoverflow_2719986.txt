In OnLButtonDown() call SetTimer() to start a timer running, eg. every 100ms. Then add OnLButtonUp() and call KillTimer() to stop the timer running. Then, do your code in the OnTimer() function (add WM_TIMER to the message map) and it will run while the mouse is held down. Note if the user clicks and drags the mouse outside your window, you get OnLButtonDown() called but not OnLButtonUp() which can leave the program thinking the mouse button is stuck down. The functions to deal with this are: call SetCapture() at the same time as SetTimer() and ReleaseCapture() at the same time as KillTimer() to keep receiving mouse messages no matter where the mouse is. I'd advise looking up all the functions I've mentioned in this answer on MSDN and reading up on them for more information.
