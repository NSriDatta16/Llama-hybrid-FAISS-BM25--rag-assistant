if there are conditions when something acts differently like in the case of color when the output is a tty vs a pipe it should be clear what this condition is but git log doesn't check for this but some other programs do like ls in it's --color=auto mode in the case of git log with --color it uses less with color escape code pass though on if you want to override it give them a like a --color[=WHEH] option like ls has which can force color on regardless of the type of the output --color[=WHEN] control whether color is used to distinguish file types. WHEN may be `never', `always', or `auto' the auto mode is what i describe in the first paragraph the default should be the one useful to the users of the program, if there are cases where that default isn't what is wanted that's what options are for
