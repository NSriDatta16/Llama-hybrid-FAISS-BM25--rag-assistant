There are dedicated clustering algorithms for binary data. You may want to get e.g. the book G. Gan, C. Ma, and J. Wu. Data Clustering. Theory, Algorithms, and Applications. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), 2007 which should discuss methods such as COOLCAT, ROCK, STUCCO. Frequent itemset methods may also be applicable, i.e. APRIORI, FPGrowth, Eclat, etc. If you want to use methods such as hierarchical clustering (which probably won't scale up to 135000 rows anyway), you will need to define a good measure of similarity first . Then think of ways to search for similar items more efficiently than performing all pairwise comparisons.
