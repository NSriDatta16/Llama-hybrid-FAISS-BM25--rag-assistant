Embedding php and html

Ok, it might be a banal question but i'm a little bit confused. I'm going to develop a project by my own. This means i'll build the HTML template, the PHP scripts, MYSQL query, AJAX calls and CSS styles. This means no other people will touch any part of the code. I know templates are good ways to make the entire application easy to be modified. But is that so necessary to do it? Since i'm the only one who got to know what that files and what that page do?
