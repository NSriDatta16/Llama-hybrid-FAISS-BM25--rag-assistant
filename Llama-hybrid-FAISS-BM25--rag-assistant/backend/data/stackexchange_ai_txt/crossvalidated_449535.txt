Is the NN trying to estimating the distribution of the classes? No, you are not estimating the parameters of a distribution. The idea is similar to the logistic regression. The logistic regression provides the probability the dependent variable is one or zero using a generalized linear model. In the case of the logistic distribution, the dependent variable $y$ has a bernoulli distribution and you are not in fact estimating it. Why do we not use the sigmoid function? You may use a sigmoid in a binary classification problem. You may also use a sigmoid curve in a different fashion (some people actually do that). You may estimate $N$ different models where each one is a classifier for each class. I mean classifier 1 predicts the probability that a given input belongs to class 1 and not to any other class, classifier 2 predicts the probability that a given input belongs to class 2 and not to any other class and so on. ... I am not sure for me if you understand that the softmax function is N dimensional and it is normalized. So you can interpret each output as the probability associated with that class.
