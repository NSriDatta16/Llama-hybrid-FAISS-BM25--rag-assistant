Writing a windows driver for an emulated input device

My application needs to behave as a virtual joystick (imagine dragging a square with the mouse and translating that to the output of an analog joystick) and send some keystrokes over the network to another computer where the driver would receive that input. I only need to support XP, Vista and Win7. Maybe it can be done without writing a driver. I tried sending keystrokes with SendKey() which seemed to work but don't know how to emulate an analog joystick. I've downloaded the VDK and been reading everything I can find on the subject but there are lots of things I still don't understand. Can you please point me in the right direction? Should I build a kernel-mode or user-mode driver? Can my driver act as a server for an app on the network? Do you know good tutorials / books / samples that can help me with this. Thanks
