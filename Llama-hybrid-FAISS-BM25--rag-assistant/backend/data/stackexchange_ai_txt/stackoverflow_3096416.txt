Don't know if your doing it wrong or not as I don't know what these mile logs are supposed to mean (see my next paragraph). At least I can point out the behavior your seeing. In your first .sort() call, you first compare the first number (let's look at the row in question 2.000 and 20.070). 2.000 is not greater than 20.070 which equates to false, but the OrElse equates to true (9.000 > 6.788), and you return a 1. Are you sure your input data is OK? I read this as start mile and end mile. How can you start @ mile 20.070 and end on mile 6.788 (Going backwards?). If the data is bad, then your function is probably fine. Else, you probably just want to focus on comparing one column or the other.
