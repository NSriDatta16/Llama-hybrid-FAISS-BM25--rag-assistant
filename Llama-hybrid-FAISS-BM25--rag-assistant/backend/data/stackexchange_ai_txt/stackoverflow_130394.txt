IIRC both AnkhSVN, and VSS implements version-control binding strictly by .sln / .csproj files (the version control plugin interface of VS facilitate this kind of storage). Therefore, the short answer is no. However, you can still use subversion as an outside version-control solution, which, in terms of security, and stability, would be much better, that VSS, using either the command line (the book is your friend), or TortoiseSVN .
