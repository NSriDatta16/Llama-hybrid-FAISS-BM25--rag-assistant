I think I understand what you're trying to do here, and it looks like some simple joins could get rid of all the complex stuff you're doing at the end of your query. (It's in C# but it should be pretty straight forward to get it to VB) from loc in dc.Locations join ol in dc.organization_locations on loc.ID equals ol.location join orn in dc.organization_names on ol.organization_id equals orn.organization_id where loc.AltLong != null && loc.AltLong != null && ol.eff_date Let me know if this works or if it needs any fine tuning...
