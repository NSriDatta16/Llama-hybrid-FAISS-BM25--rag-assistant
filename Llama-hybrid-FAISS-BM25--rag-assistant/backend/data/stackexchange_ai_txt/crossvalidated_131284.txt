Yes, you can use DTW approach for classification and clustering of time series . I've compiled the following resources , which are focused on this very topic (I've recently answered a similar question, but not on this site, so I'm copying the contents here for everybody's convenience): UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering : main page , software page and corresponding paper Time Series Classification and Clustering with Python : a blog post Capital Bikeshare: Time Series Clustering : another blog post Time Series Classification and Clustering : ipython notebook Dynamic Time Warping using rpy and Python : another blog post Mining Time-series with Trillions of Points: Dynamic Time Warping at Scale : another blog post Time Series Analysis and Mining in R (to add R to the mix): yet another blog post And, finally, two tools implementing/supporting DTW , to top it off: R package and Python module
