Hyperparameter Tuning - What is possible in terms of accuracy gain?

A question from a newbie: I played around with parameter tuning (grid, random search) in R (caret, xgboost) and my observation is as follows: in terms of accuracy gains I was able to get 3 - 7% but not more. And that's the limit. Meaning that higher accuracy gains could be reached with new features as well as other models/ensembles. Am I wrong? If someone could point me to a tutorial for parameter tuning exploration, would be nice.
