What frequentist statistics topics should I know before learning Bayesian statistics?

I was wondering if there is a subset of topics of frequentist statistics that one should know before starting to learn Bayesian statistics. Once I read that it seems that the two trends are antagonistic to each other; like for example frequentist analysis is based heavily on assumptions (hypothesis) that are made over observed data; while Bayesian statistics rely more in the construction of a prior model to infer posterior information about it. In any case, which topics of frequentist or general statistics should I know before embarking upon Bayesian statistics?
