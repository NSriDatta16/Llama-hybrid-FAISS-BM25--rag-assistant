Delphi: How to put the data from TStream into TStgMedium for OLE processing?

I need to manage OLE drag-drop operations with Delphi. Now I got a problem - I need to put some data from TStream into global TStgMedium (to send it through OLE methods using IDataObject). I guess there should be some commonly used pattern to do this? Can you provide some sample code?
