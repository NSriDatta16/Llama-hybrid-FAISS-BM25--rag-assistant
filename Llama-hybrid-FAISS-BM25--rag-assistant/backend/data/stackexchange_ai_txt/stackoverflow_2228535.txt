You're working in two different sandboxes so you'll need to set up a sandbox bridge. In your case you'll have to expose in interface to methods in the application sandbox using the parentSandboxBridge here are the docs in case you don't have them So in the top window // quoting from the docs var interface = {}; interface.save = function(text){ var saveFile = air.File("app-storage:/save.txt"); //write text to file } document.getElementById("yourIframe").contentWindow.parentSandboxBridge = interface; Of course this won't make your libraries available in the parent but you can process in the child and use the parent to do the air stuff
