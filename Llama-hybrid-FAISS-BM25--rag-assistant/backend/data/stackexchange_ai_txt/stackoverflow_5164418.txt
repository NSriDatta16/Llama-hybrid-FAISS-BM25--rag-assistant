Why does git commit after a merge by default?

I'm curious about this behavior and maybe its just because I've come from using SVN and bazaar mostly. (I'm learning git to interface with the excellent github.) It seems counter intuitive to me and as if it would be better for git merge [branch] --no-commit to be the default to encourage people to make sure the merge went the way they wanted it to before committing.
