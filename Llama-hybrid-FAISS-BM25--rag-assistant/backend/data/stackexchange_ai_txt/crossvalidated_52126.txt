One paper you definitely ought to read is: Williams, P. M., "Modelling Seasonality and Trends in Daily Rainfall Data", ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS, 1998, volume 10, pages 985-991 MORGAN KAUFMANN PUBLISHERS, ISSN 1049-5258. For representing the input, I would suggest you read a good book on neural network techniques before you begin. The book by Chris Bishop on "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" is excellent, it focusses mainly on pattern recognition, but most of the issues apply equally to regression problems.
