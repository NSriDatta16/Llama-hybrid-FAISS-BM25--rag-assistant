Simple answer: No, you shouldn't. A few points about each engine: InnoDB Full support for Foreign Key restraints and transactions. (ACID compliant) Row-level locking. Arguably faster INSERT statements. (And possibly UPDATE as well) MyISAM Faster SELECT statements. Support for Full-Text searches BLOB and TEXT columns can be indexed 4x max storage limit, compared to InnoDB (256TB vs 64TB) See more in the Manual: MyISAM InnoDB
