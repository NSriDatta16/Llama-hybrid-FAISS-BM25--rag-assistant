dragging during runtime

the user has the option of dragging several pictureboxes around the form. when he lets go of the mouse, the picturebox will take on a new position on the form. this i have done succesfully thanks to the stackoverflow community. i would like to implement the following: on mouseup, if the picturebox position is within some amount maybe 50 or 100 (i dont know what units VB.net) uses, i would like it to be dropped exactly in a defined position. sort of like if you play checkers on yahoo games, you dont have to place the piece exactly on the square only approximately. please help me with a solution in vb.net
