I don't know if this is something you'd want. But a thing that comes up to mind is the HTML5 Web Storage functionality.With that feature you can store data on the computer of the user. So whenever a user changes an input field you can create a javascript call that stores the value into the localstorage: localStorage.setItem(“inputName”, “value”); Then when you load the page, you see if any of these values are stored and then fill them in.
