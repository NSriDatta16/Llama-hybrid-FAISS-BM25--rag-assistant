Robustness of t Tests for Huge Badly-Skewed Samples Failing to reject when null hypothesis is true. I won't use your data, leaving that for you to explore. However, consider a sample of size $n = 7000$ simulated using R from a (highly skewed) exponential population with $\mu=14.$ set.seed(2020) x = rexp(7000, 1/14) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.00208 4.19694 10.06145 14.25631 19.42518 126.88984 boxplot(x, horizontal=T, col="skyblue2") abline(v=mean(x), col="red", lwd=2) Now I do a t test of $H_0: \mu = 14$ against $H_a: \mu \ne 14.$ Does the t test fail to reject, which would be the correct result? t.test(x, mu=14) One Sample t-test data: x t = 1.5181, df = 6999, p-value = 0.129 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 14 95 percent confidence interval: 13.92534 14.58729 sample estimates: mean of x 14.25631 Fails to reject and the confidence interval includes $14.$ Rejecting when null hypothesis is false. Now consider a sample of the same size from an exponential population with $\mu = 14.5.$ Again testing $H_0: \mu = 14$ against $H_a: \mu \ne 14,$ one would hope to reject $H_0.$ set.seed(428) y = rexp(7000, 1/14.5) summary(y) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.00473 4.26687 10.00742 14.45444 19.99045 139.90676 t.test(y, mu=14)$p.val [1] 0.008786323 Rejects $H_0$ with P-value $0.0088 Summary. My simulated exponential samples may not be as unruly as your real data. And two tests doesn't provide a lot of evidence. However, experience has shown that t tests perform well even with skewed data when sample sizes are very large. Means of huge exponential samples are nearly normal With an exponential distribution I can show you that a sample mean of $n=7000$ observations is nearly normally distributed. Here is a simulation to show this using 100,000 averages. (The theory isn't difficult because then average of 7000 exponential random variables is a gamma random variable with shape parameter 7000, which is very nearly normal---according to the Central Limit Theorem.) a = replicate(10^5, mean(rexp(7000, 1/14))) hist(a, br=40, prob=T, col="skyblue2") curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) The red curve through the histogram of sample means is the best-fitting normal distribution. Clearly averages of 7000 exponential observations are nearly normal.
