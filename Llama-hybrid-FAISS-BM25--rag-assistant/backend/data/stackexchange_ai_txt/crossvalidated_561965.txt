Can I use Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as metrics for multi-class time series classification?

I am doing a 3-class time series classification problem, where classes are 0,1 and 2. For example, the test set is [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1] for 22 consecutive days, and the prediction is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] . I think we usually use accuracy, Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 score as metrics for multi-class classification tasks. (recommendation ahout some other useful metrics for multi-class classification is welcomed) I am reading the book Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading by Stefan Jansen. He uses IC (information coefficient) as metrics, which is measured as the Spearman rank correlation. However, from the parts I have read in this book, IC seems to only appear in time series regression tasks (there might not be many classification tasks in this book though). He has used IC in S&P 500 prediction, which is a time series regression task. So my question is, can I use Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as metrics for multi-class time series classification? For example, the above case? PS: In my problem setting, I set 0 to represent index decreasing comparing to the last day, 1 to be small movements, and 2 to be ascending.
