Do different Transfer Function produce different prediction in neural network model? Most of the times, yes. It may matter a little or a lot, depending on the network, dataset, transfer functions, etc. How do we know which transfer function suitable for the data we used? One way is to look at the transfer function existing models doing similar tasks use. Also: Comprehensive list of activation functions in neural networks with pros/cons
