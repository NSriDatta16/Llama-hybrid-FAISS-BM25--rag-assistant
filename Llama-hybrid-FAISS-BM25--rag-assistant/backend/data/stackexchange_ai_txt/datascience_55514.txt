does KNN have a hypothesis space? if yes, Is there a way to clearly define the hypothesis space with the instances?

I am learning this post, "A few useful things to know about machine learning" The author says A classifier must be represented in some formal language that the computer can handle.Conversely, choosing a representation for a learner is tantamount to choosing the set of classifiers that it can possibly learn. This set is called the hypothesis space of the learner. and put KNN and SVM in the instance-based category. I assume the instance here mean each individual example, for instance, KNN needs to compute the distance to each example. Assume there are 300 examples to train a KNN classifier, how to understand choosing this specific representation is tantamount to choose hypothesis space? to clarify the question. does KNN have a hypothesis space? if yes, Is there a way to clearly define the hypothesis space with the instances?
