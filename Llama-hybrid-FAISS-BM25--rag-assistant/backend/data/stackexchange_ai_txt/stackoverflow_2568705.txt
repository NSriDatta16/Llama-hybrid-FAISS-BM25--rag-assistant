After playing around with it for a while, I came up with a module that does what I want. Inside app/models/shared/attachment_helper.rb : module Shared module AttachmentHelper def self.included(base) base.extend ClassMethods end module ClassMethods def has_attachment(name, options = {}) # generates a string containing the singular model name and the pluralized attachment name. # Examples: "user_avatars" or "asset_uploads" or "message_previews" attachment_owner = self.table_name.singularize attachment_folder = "#{attachment_owner}_#{name.to_s.pluralize}" # we want to create a path for the upload that looks like: # message_previews/00/11/22/001122deadbeef/thumbnail.png attachment_path = "#{attachment_folder}/:uuid_partition/:uuid/:style.:extension" if Rails.env.production? options[:path] ||= attachment_path options[:storage] ||= :s3 options[:url] ||= ':s3_authenticated_url' options[:s3_credentials] ||= File.join(Rails.root, 'config', 's3.yml') options[:s3_permissions] ||= 'private' options[:s3_protocol] ||= 'https' else # For local Dev/Test envs, use the default filesystem, but separate the environments # into different folders, so you can delete test files without breaking dev files. options[:path] ||= ":rails_root/public/system/attachments/#{Rails.env}/#{attachment_path}" options[:url] ||= "/system/attachments/#{Rails.env}/#{attachment_path}" end # pass things off to paperclip. has_attached_file name, options end end end end (Note: I'm using some custom paperclip interpolations above, like :uuid_partition , :uuid and :s3_authenticated_url . You'll need to modify things as needed for your particular application) Now, for every model that has paperclip attachments, you just have to include this shared module, and call the has_attachment method (instead of paperclip's has_attached_file ) An example model file: app/models/user.rb : class User { :thumbnail => "100x100>" } end With this in place, you'll have files saved to the following locations, depending on your environment: Development: RAILS_ROOT + public/attachments/development/user_avatars/aa/bb/cc/aabbccddeeff/thumbnail.jpg Test: RAILS_ROOT + public/attachments/test/user_avatars/aa/bb/cc/aabbccddeeff/thumbnail.jpg Production: https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/user_avatars/aa/bb/cc/aabbccddeeff/thumbnail.jpg This does exactly what I'm looking for, hopefully it'll prove useful to someone else too. :) -John
