It would help if you could clarify your ultimate inference goal, maybe tell us the concrete context. Failing that, you seem to have data which can be presented as a contingency table with, say, 2 rows and 20 columns (plus the margins.) So your twenty groups are the columns, count of positives in first row, count of negatives in second row. Then, as a start a test of the null hypothesis of homegeneity, that is all the $p_i$ 's are equal, is given by the chisquare test. Except that some small counts might make that a bad approximation. One way of getting confidence intervals for the individual $p$ 's is via logistic regression. For more specific ideas we need some detailed context!
