I believe that "put" will put the answer in the log, not the listing. The title will work, but it only puts the title at the top of the page. There's no elegant way within SAS to combine textual comments with output. The best tools I'm aware of for this are SASweave and StatWeave, both developed by Russ Lenth. They might require more investment of time than you're willing to give. Or, you could use R and Sweave. An ugly way to do this, however, is to make a data set with the text you want, and to use a routine such as the following: data mytext; text = "This is the output for tbl_TestMacro"; run; proc print noobs data = mytext split='*'; var text; label text = '*'; run; (There's meant to be a better shortcut for no variable label, but I failed to make it work.)
