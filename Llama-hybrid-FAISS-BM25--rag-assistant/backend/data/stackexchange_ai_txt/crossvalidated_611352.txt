Scaling does not affect most of the statistics of the dataset. It is a recommended - sometimes even required - pre-processing step for some machine learning algorithms. However, note that it is a transformation that takes in consideration all observations in the dataset, affecting the true value of each observation for that particular dataset. It's not a transformation that can be done to a single isolated observation. Thus, you may struggle if you build a classification model from scaled data and then you want to classify a new isolated observation which has not been scaled with the original dataset. Take a decision tree for instance. This is a simple model, mainly used for its explainability and interpretability, rather than its predictive power. A decision tree can be easily used by anyone without any specific training. The algorithm would work fine if you scale the data prior to fitting the model. But if you do so, then you could not easily apply the model to new data for classification. Example: where a decision tree would have a decision node on " age " (which is understandable), with scaled data you might end up with that node reading " age " (which is meaningless).
