TukeyHSD for non-pairwise comparisons

Following this question: Pairwise comparisons I'm not sure if I can perform a Tukey Honest Significant Difference test on the data I have. I've thought Tukey's method was only valid for pairwise comparisons, in which each factor has a multiple levels, and you would compare the means of those levels for significance. I have N States, each of which have anywhere from 100-1000 ratings, to which I've averaged their ratings per-State to get the means for each State. Each individual rating is completely independent (so each rating only corresponding to a specific thing in that State, which makes me think that I can't use Tukey's method). In table form, it would look like: (State) (Rating) VA 69 VA 56 VA 78 TX 99 TN 84 TN 96 . . . Which I have shrunk down to: (State) (Rating) VA 67.6 TX 99 TN 90 . . . Can I run a TukeyHSD test to see if I can (100-a)% confidently say which means are significantly different?
