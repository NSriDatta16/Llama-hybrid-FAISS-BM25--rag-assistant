From my copy of n2798: 5.3.4 New 21 Whether the allocation function is called before evaluating the constructor arguments or after evaluating the constructor arguments but before entering the constructor is unspecified. It is also unspecified whether the arguments to a constructor are evaluated if the allocation function returns the null pointer or exits using an exception. Read in conjunction with (to avoid ambiguities): 5.3.4 New 8 A new-expression obtains storage for the object by calling an allocation function (3.7.4.1). If the newexpression terminates by throwing an exception, it may release storage by calling a deallocation function (3.7.4.2). If the allocated type is a non-array type, the allocation function’s name is operator new and the deallocation function’s name is operator delete. If the allocated type is an array type, the allocation function’s name is operator new[] and the deallocation function’s name is operator delete[]. [...] This pretty much answers the question. The answer is 'No'.
