Please help me design a database schema for this:

I'm designing a python application which works with a database. I'm planning to use sqlite. There are 15000 objects, and each object has a few attributes. every day I need to add some data for each object.(Maybe create a column with the date as its name). However, I would like to easily delete the data which is too old but it is very hard to delete columns using sqlite(and it might be slow because I need to copy the required columns and then delete the old table) Is there a better way to organize this data other than creating a column for every date? Or should I use something other than sqlite?
