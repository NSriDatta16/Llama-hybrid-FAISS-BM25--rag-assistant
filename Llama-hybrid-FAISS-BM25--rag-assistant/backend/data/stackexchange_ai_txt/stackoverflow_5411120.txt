Magento Payment Review/Suspected Fraud workflow

I'm working on a Magento store where the client has requested a few custom filters on orders so that they can be manually reviewed before being sent off to fulfillment. When these cases come up, the orders are marked with the built in Payment Review / Suspected Fraud state/status. My problem is that, in the admin interface, you don't seem to be able to do much with an order in the Payment Review state. I added a custom 'Approve'-type button for manual approval of the order, but if it's reviewed and confirmed as fraud, what is the expected action to take? I would think to cancel or refund the order but that doesn't seem to be allowed. Checking canCancel or canCreditmemo on the order returns false. Would it be better to use a Hold state or something over Payment Review for a scenario like this?
