When working with non-normally distributed time series data, how can I determine when metric is significantly (@ 95% CI) lower/higher than historical?

I'm working with time series data that looks at a conversion rate day by day. I have the data going back a few years. I'd like to build in some logic/alert/etc. so that I know when the conversion rate for a specific day is meaningfully lower/higher than what we've seen historically. When I say "meaningfully", I'm referring to a 95% tolerance interval. My data isn't normally distributed (I've run a QQ plot & Shapiro test), and this is where I get stumped. I'd appreciate any help anyone can provide - my stats knowledge is a bit rusty as of late :)
