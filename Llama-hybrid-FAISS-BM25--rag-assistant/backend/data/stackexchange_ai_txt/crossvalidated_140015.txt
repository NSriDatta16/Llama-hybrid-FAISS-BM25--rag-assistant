There are some statistical misunderstandings here. The mean squared error (MSE) is primarily associated with linear (OLS) models. It isn't really used with logistic regression. For example, calculating the MSE for a model and then multiplying it by the variance-covariance matrix is something that is done in linear regression, but not logistic regression. You should not be trying to get the MSE from a glm model fitted with family=binomial . The linear predictor (which I believe is what you mean by "link function" here) is not bound by 0 and infinity, but ranges from -infinity to +infinity. The se.fit value is on the scale of the linear predictor (i.e., the log odds of Y=1 at X=x0). It would be for both the "fitted line at point x0 " and the "predicted link function value of y at point x0 ", as they are the same thing. In general, the standard error of a predicted point on the scale of the linear predictor needs to take into account the uncertainty of the estimated slope and intercept, and also how far the x-value of the predicted point is from the mean of x.
