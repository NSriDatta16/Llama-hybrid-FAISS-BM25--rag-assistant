What is test and what is training data in this SVM formula?

I am studying how to use Gaussian RBF kernels for mapping 2D data to 3D. In this link: Use Gaussian RBF kernel for mapping of 2D data to 3D , @MaxS provides an answer on this topic, but I can't understand this formula: $$ \newcommand{\x}{\mathbf{x}} z(\x) = \sum_{i=1}^n\exp\left\{-\frac{||\x-\x_i||^2}{2\gamma^2}\right\} $$ If I want to use SVM, is $\x$ the test data? Is $n$ number of training data? Is $\x_i$ one of training data in this formula?
