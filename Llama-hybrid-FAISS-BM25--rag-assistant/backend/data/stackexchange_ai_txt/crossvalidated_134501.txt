How to use ANOVA with two or more data points per condition per participant?

I'm preparing my first ever experiment for my PhD and am currently facing some difficulties with statistics. Here is my draft experimental design: 3 factors with 5, 3, 3 levels. As a result I have 45 conditions. (These numbers should be irrelevant for my question). For each condition, I measure the time it takes a participant to answer a question. These questions are in a sense "generated" by the condition and are different for the different conditions. This is a repeated-measures study, where all participants are measured in all conditions. So I get 45 data points per participant. Here is the interesting bit: For each condition I can come up with multiple possible questions that test the response time in that condition. So I figured, why not ask each participant multiple questions per condition and record multiple response time values. More data points should be better after all. So I could for example get 90 data points per participant, 2 for each condition. However, I am not sure how to handle this during the analysis: Is it a good idea to do these multiple measurements per condition and participant? Each question is rather short, so fatigue should not be an issue. How to best analyze such data? Should I just take the average of the multiple data values? Another option would be to pretend I have double the number of participants, but then a "pair" of participants is not independent. Would this have an effect on how many participants I need? Any other advise on this issue is much appreciated.
