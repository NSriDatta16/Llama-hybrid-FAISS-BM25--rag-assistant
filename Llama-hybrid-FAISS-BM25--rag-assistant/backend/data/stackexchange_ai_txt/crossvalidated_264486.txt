Perhaps you could start reading about the beta regression first and then move to the multivariate case (Dirichlet). Ferrari has written a lot of papers on beta regression and many of them are open access (google them and see). The GLM framework comes from the fact that you can use the logit link to model the mean of the distribution (beta or Dirichlet). There are more papers about Dirichlet regression and Dirichlet distribution (again open access). In the Dirichlet regression, one variable is chosen as the baseline, essentially, and the regression takes place with one variable less. logistic regression uses the same link as beta regression and multinomial logistic regression uses the same link as Dirichlet regression.
