In CNN, why do we increase the number of filters in deeper Convolution layers for complex images?

I have been doing this online course Introduction to TensorFlow for AI, ML and DL . Here in one part, they were showing a CNN model for classifying human and horses. In this model, the first Conv2D layer had 16 filters , followed by two more Conv2D layers with 32 and 64 filters respectively. I am not sure how the number of filters is correlated with the deeper convolution layers.
