Think about a simpler problem: estimating the mean $\mu$ in a frequentist setting. It is sensible to use the MLE, $\bar X$ , as our estimator. How accurate is this on average? We know that $\bar X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ so the mean squared error is $\sigma^2/n$ , i.e proportional to the population variance. This is quite a fundamental point. It is easier to estimate a population mean when the population variance is low, because (on average) your observations will be closer to this mean. For example, if the effect of a medical intervention is very similar for all patients (low $\sigma$ ), you don't need a large sample to estimate the mean effect accurately.
