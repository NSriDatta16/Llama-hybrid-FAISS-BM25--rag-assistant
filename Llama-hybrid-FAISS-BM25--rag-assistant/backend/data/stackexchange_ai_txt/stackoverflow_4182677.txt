I use iframes to modularize my app too. They are a kind of includes embedding all CSS, HTML and JS for a module. My first attempts were by returning a function too, but then I found it quite hard for sharing scopes. Now I make directly a reference to the main parent object in the iframe. eg: var Svc = parent.Svc, JSON = parent.JSON, $ = parent.$; Svc.module1 = { method1:function(arg){ ... }, ... } The global var JSON and jQuery references are here to have them available inside the methods.
