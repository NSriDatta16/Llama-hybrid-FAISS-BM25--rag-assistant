Yes As Yi Jiang pointed out, these are not validators. These are tools to help you evaluate the performance of your page. You need to consider their recommendations. However, setting something like the Expires Header doesn't necessarily mean the user agent will honor that. Personally, I've seen the YSlow add-on in Firebug not list certain resources as having their Header set even though I have. The point is consider output from both tools, but I wouldn't beat yourself up over trying to make both happy. Of course. Your first expires code set's all graphical resources to not expire for the next 40 years. That would have a huge impact on download times for return visitors. As well as site maintenance - i.e. ensuring to invalidate the cache as the site changes. Your second rule caches everything for a year. That would have very serious impact on your site - e.g. caching all your resources, including html pages!
