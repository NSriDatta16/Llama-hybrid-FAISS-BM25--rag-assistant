Tomcat per webapp memory settings

I am having two webapplication running inside tomcat. Java Heap space is allocated for Tomcat and it is shared for both appliaction. In that one application consumes more and other is getting OUT_OF_MEMORY. Is there any way to set memory settings per web application. Say 70% for one webapp and 30% for other from the overall memory allocated to Tomcat. Regards Ganesh
