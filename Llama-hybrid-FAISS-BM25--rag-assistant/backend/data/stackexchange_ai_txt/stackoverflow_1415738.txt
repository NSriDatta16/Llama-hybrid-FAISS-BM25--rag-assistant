I'm not really sure about how you plan the application to function based on the the information you have provided. If you have a service and ActiveX controls you are really limited to certain Windows platforms. Assuming the ActiveX controls need to run inside a browser, you are limited to Internet Explorer. Consider whether you need the service to communicate with other computers. Perhaps exposing the server with some sort of web services or web-based protocol would allow: Access from other computers Browsers other than IE to access your service Update: To follow on from @voyager's comment on web services you are building a communications layer which could be written in TCP/IP sockets (low-level) up to Web Services (mostly XML over HTTP). Your service could listen on port 80 for HTTP requests and respond accordingly, or you could leverage a web server like IIS. This means you don't need to have your own HTTP/Web stack which may be desirable. With IIS you would have some web services which exposed your logic implemented by your service (service iis client/browser). IIS provides a range of security options for intranet or internet. Connections can be secured with SSL and you can leverage various authentication methods (NTLM, Kerberos, Basic).
