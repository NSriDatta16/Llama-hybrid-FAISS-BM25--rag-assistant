Magento 1.3 Custom layout cache issue

I have a custom module to display a very simple page on my magento site. Its using its own layout file which is specified in the config.xml file. When the cache is turned off and all the cache files are manually deleted, the page renders just fine. Once the cache is turned on, or refreshed once on the page doesn't pickup the layout file anymore so a blank page with default layout is displayed. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks for your help in advance!
