ListView's DragEnter, DragOver, DragDrop event not raised (AllowDrop=True)

This one is very weird: My app works just fine, but suddenly the damn ListView control's events are not raised any more. It just comes and goes without any clear reason. (Obviously) I've set the AllowDrop property to True and handled the DragEnter, DragOver and DragDrop events as follows: Private Sub lstApplications_DragDrop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles lstApplications.DragDrop, Me.DragDrop m_fileNames = CType(e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop), String()) mnuType.Show(Cursor.Position, ToolStripDropDownDirection.BelowLeft) End Sub Private Sub lstApplications_DragEnter(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles lstApplications.DragEnter, Me.DragEnter, lstApplications.DragOver, Me.DragOver If chkMode.Checked OrElse Not e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.FileDrop, True) Then e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None Else e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy End If End Sub It doesn't matter what code I wrote in these two methods because none of the events are raised. Is there anything I'm missing here? I run the same app on another machine and it worked just fine. I then restarted my own machine and everything started working again. I'm not sure, but seems like something was wrong with Windows.
