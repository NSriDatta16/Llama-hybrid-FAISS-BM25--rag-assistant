As noted by tj111 and others, there are times when the risk of an elegant solution are greater than that of the quick and dirty. I.e., you deliver something beautiful, but by that time the customers no longer want it, want something different, or are pissed off. To be sure though, there is always a long-term cost with doing a quick and dirty solution and it is important to deliver a firm and forceful "by the way" caveat to management. Else the quick and dirty becomes like crack to management who often do not know or care of the difference between the elegant and dirty (especially when it is under the hood). That is until things start to go to hell, and even then the fixitnow stress is offloaded to the hapless (often new) technical team. So yeah, sometimes you have to do it because of $$ and time considerations, but don't cloak it or forget it and strive and push to re-factor soon when the crisis wanes.
