Interesting question. I don't know if you can do this as part of the build phase. To get something into the Documents directory, I have a method that runs at app startup like this: NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; NSError *error; NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0]; NSString *writablePath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"filename.txt"]; BOOL success = [fileManager copyItemAtPath:defaultDBPath writablePath error:&error]; That's an incomplete fragment but you probably get the idea. The important thing is the NSDocumentDirectory constant.
