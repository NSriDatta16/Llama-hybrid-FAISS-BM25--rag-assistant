Registers are the internal processor storage. They do not have memory addresses, because they do not reside in memory . You identify them by their names: EAX, for example. That said, memory-mapped registers do exist, but in any modern processor they belong to other devices, never the CPU. They are assigned "fake" memory addresses for convenience. See memory-mapped I/O .
