I have one bad and one good news for you : There is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings, which might seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this yearâ€™s Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller. If you are working with stock prices (not returns), then your model doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In order for it make some kind of sense it has to be difference order one on the log prices, even then it would break down quickly. Basically,what you are doing will not predict anything. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it is what it is.
