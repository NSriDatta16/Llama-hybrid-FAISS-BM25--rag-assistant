I don't do Jython, but there's no means of contextInitialized or contextDestroyed methods in the HttpServlet API . You're probably looking for ServletContextListener interface which is normally to be implemented as the following Java-based example: package com.example; import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener; public class MyServletContextListener implements ServletContextListener { public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) { // ... } public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent event) { // ... } } ...which is to be definied as in web.xml as follows: com.example.MyServletContextListener This must give you an idea how to pickup it using Jython. You can optionally also let your servlet both extend HttpServlet and implement ServletContextListener like follows: public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet implements ServletContextListener { // ... } so that you can end up with the code you've posted (don't forget to import the particular interface and define your class as both servlet and listener in web.xml ). But this is not always considered a good practice. That said, you should be placing classes in a package to avoid portability problems. It may work in some environments, but not in other. Sun also discourages using packageless classes in non-prototyping environments. They can normally namely not be imported by other classes which are itself in a package.
