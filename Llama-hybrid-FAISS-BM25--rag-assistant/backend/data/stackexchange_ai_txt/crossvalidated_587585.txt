Let's simplify it. What the model does is it makes a prediction for the labels $\hat y$ by taking a weighted average of the training labels $y_k$ , $$ \hat y = \sum_{k=1}^N w_k y_k $$ with weights such that $w_k \ge 0$ and $\sum_k w_k = 1$ . In the case of this model, the weights are calculated using the kernels $K$ applied to the training features $X_k$ $$ w_k = \frac{K\left(\left\| \tfrac{X-X_k}{h} \right\|\right)}{\sum_k K\left(\left\| \tfrac{X-X_k}{h} \right\|\right)} $$ The kernels here serve as measures of familiarity between the test data $X$ and all the training points $X_k$ . TL;DR the prediction is just a weighted average of the training labels weighted in such way that the more similar data points have more weight than the less similar ones, where similarity is measured using the kernels $K$ .
