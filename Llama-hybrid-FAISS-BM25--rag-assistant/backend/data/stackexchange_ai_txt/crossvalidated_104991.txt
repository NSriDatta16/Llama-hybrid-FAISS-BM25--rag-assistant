Principal component regression analysis using SPSS

I have done multiple regression analysis (MLR) of my data and find out $R^2$ and $r$, and then to remove multicollinearity problem I used PCA. This analysis generated PC equal to my variables, I selected only those factors having eigen value greater than 1 after rotation (varimax rotation). Now I'm confused that if I put factor scores of only selected PC as independent variables in MLR I obtained $r$ and $R^2$ less than those obtained by simple MLR but it should be higher. Where I am wrong?
