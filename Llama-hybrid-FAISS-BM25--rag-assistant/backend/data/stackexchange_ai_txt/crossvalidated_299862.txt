To create a scale from several Likert items, people typically sum or average the items. This introduces a theoretical problem, since it involves assuming that the categories on the Likert items are equally spaced. But that's something most people can live with. Using a mean is useful if there are some respondents with some missing items. Using the median would be theoretically more responsible, but would probably result in less diversity in the scale values. From there, you can use Spearman correlation, unless the data are bivariate normal, in which case Pearson is also appropriate.
