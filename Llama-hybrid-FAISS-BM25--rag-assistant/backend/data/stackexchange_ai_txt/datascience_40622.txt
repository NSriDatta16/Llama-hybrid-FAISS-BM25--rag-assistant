This is directly related to the idea of calibrating probability values produced by a random forest . Aside from the link, there is substantial literature on how to do this . The simplest approach basically amounts to fitting a logistic regression on the outputs of the random forest to change the response surface into a logistic form. Once the predictions have this form, you've demonstrated that you have the knowledge to turn the probability estimate into Vegas odds, so that should be a straightforward process for you.
