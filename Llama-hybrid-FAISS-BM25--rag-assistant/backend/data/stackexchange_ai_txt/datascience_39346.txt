In that case, Multi Class Classification will be the best approach. You can use Neural Network approach or K-Nearest Neighbours for this problem. Your DataFrame is going to be really sparse if you take a numeric approach. From my point of view, the best approach is to build a vector model. After you arrange your data this way, it's easier to build a topic model using NLP techniques. It can also tell you which illnesses are most similar and which codes are similar. This is what I could think of. These sort of questions are very open ended and can often lead to creative approaches. I am sure there'll be something better if you think hard enough.
