your problem is ordinairily faced by P&C actuaries (as me). Setting a rate for any coverages means building models (more or less complicated) for the frequency, E[N], and the severity, E[X] and then combining them. I would suggest you to analyze separately the frequency and the severity of the expenses, then you can combine them by the convolution formula. In order to adapt the framework to your specific problem I would do this: Model the frequency, E[N] by a logistic equation (the event would be filing one or more medical expense claim). Then you could get estimates for E[N] and Var[N] for each subject. Model the cost, fitting a regression model. Since you are assuming also negative value to have positive probability a OLS regression could be meaningful. I would otherwise suggest to to check the GAMLSS package for wider conditional distribution choices. However the regression model you build need to give you estimates of E[X] and Var[X]. The total cost random variable, S, i.e., your original variable, will have following moments according to convolution formula. E[S]=E[N]E[X], Var[S]=E[N]Var[X]+VarN^2
