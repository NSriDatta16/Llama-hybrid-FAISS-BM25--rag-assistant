In ND7 and up if you want to just disable the field for input, write an appropriate formula in the InputEnabled section of the field you want to disable. So I have two fields one called Trigger, a checkbox with the value "On" and another Subject that is a text field. When Trigger is checked I want the value Subject to be enabled. I simply put the following formula in the Input Enabled element of the field Subject: Trigger = "On" I also want this to be recalculated whenever the value of Trigger changes so I select the "Refresh fields on keyword change" option on the Trigger field. If you're stuck in an older version you need to to hide paragraphs appropriately.
