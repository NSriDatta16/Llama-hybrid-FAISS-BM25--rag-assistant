A More Symmetric Distribution?

REVISED QUESTION I am interested in learning more about why certain confidence intervals are better than others in a logistic regression setting. Based on some readings and discussions with more experienced colleges, I understand that the most common method to obtain an approximate confidence interval for $\hat{p}$ estimated from a logistic regression model is to find the endpoints of the 95% confidence interval for $\log({\hat{p}\over{1-\hat{p}}})=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1$ and then take the inverse logit of that. An alternative method that I thought of was to simply write $\hat{p}$ as $\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})\over{1+\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})}$. I could then use the delta method to obtain 95% confidence intervals. From what I understand, in this case, the Delta method would have reduced coverage probability because $\log({\hat{p}\over{1-\hat{p}}})=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1$ has a more nearly symmetric distribution than $\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})\over{1+\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})}$. Can somehow help me understand this? How does one know that $\log({\hat{p}\over{1-\hat{p}}})=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1$ has a more nearly symmetric distribution? Why does it perform better than the Delta Method? OLD QUESTION: If I have two functions, say $f(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1)=\log({\hat{p}\over{1-\hat{p}}})=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1$ and $f(\beta_0, \beta_1)=\hat{p}$=$\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})\over{1+\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})}$, is there a way I can tell which one has a more nearly symmetric distribution than the other? I'm asking this because I was looking into variance estimation (for the purpose of forming large sample, approximate confidence intervals) for $\hat{p}$ from a simple logistic regression model with one binary predictor variable that takes on values 0 and 1. Most textbooks recommend taking the endpoints of the confidence interval for $\log({\hat{p}\over{1-\hat{p}}})=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1$ and then using the inverse logit to "get better coverage probability" because it has more nearly of a symmetric distribution than $f(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1)=\hat{p}$=$\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})\over{1+\exp({\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1})}$ (when considering using the delta method with the later). I don't understand this. How does one know that the first has better coverage probability? How do you know it is more nearly symmetric? I hope this clarifies.
