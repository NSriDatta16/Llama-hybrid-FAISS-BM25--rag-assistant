Which statistical methods should I be using?

The data is about: a binary variable as response; age; some binary categorical variables (0,1); some categorical variables which have more than 2 outcomes The goal is to find which factors affect the response binary variable. I intend to use logistic regression to fit this model, but I think more analyses are supposed to be applied. I'm unfamiliar with handling categorical variables when the response variable is also a 0/1 variable. Could u give me some advice about this? Thanks! :)
