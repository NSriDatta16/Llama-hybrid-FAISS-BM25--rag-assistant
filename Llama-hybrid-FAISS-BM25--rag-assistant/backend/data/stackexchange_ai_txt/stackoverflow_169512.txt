What is the simplest way to set up a BIRT report viewer for a xulrunner application?

I recently began using BIRT and have developed a report to use with my xulrunner application. What I haven't yet figured out is how I should deploy the viewer. It seems like BIRT mostly targets Java applications, so there are instructions for deploying on J2EE, JBoss, and other technologies -- with which I am not familiar (but I'm not developing in Java anyway). Reviewing this article on deploying BIRT and reviewing the deployment details on BIRT's web site, I'm not sure where to go. I wasn't expecting to have to add some large Java dependency for the xulrunner application --is there no way I can drop an executable in with my xulrunner app, call it from my app, and pass it a report document? (Or something else that would be simpler than learning and using J2EE, JBoss, tomcat?)
