What's the 'right' number of parameters for an ARIMA model?

I'm working on an unassessed course problem, The file Pas-mile.txt contains the monthly numbers of passenger miles travelled on US airlines for each month between January 1960 and December 1977. Find an ARIMA model for the series, carrying out appropriate diagnostic checks. I've put the data at the bottom of this post. Here's a plot of the time series. I differenced the data seasonally and non-seasonally. I think I can pose my question using only one of these, say the seasonal one. y I visually inspected the acfs and pacfs as suggested by my course notes, acf(x, lag.max=216) acf(x, type='partial', lag.max=216) and I also did a grid-search: aic.df The lowest AIC (I think) is 324.5148, for $\text{ARIMA}(10,1,8)_{12}$ . I tried searching a larger grid but stopped because the computation was taking too long. I also got quite a lot of messages like Warning: possible convergence problem: optim gave code = 1 and Warning: NaNs produced . This seems like quite a lot of parameters, and the non-seasonal differencing adds more. Writing the model out as $y_t=\dots$ would be quite cumbersome. If I had more computing power, perhaps I could have found a still better model with still more parameters. As I understand it, there's no risk of overfitting since the AIC takes parameter number into account. So what's the 'right' number of parameters?
