Can autocorrelation be observed in a non-ordered data?

Autocorrelation means that the error terms are serially correlated. However, if we have an un-ordered dataset, we can always shuffle the data to change the serial ordering then we can change the covariance matrix of errors. This question has startled me to some extent. If we have a dataset that is not ordered by time (purely non-time series data), we should never theoretically observe a serial correlation.
