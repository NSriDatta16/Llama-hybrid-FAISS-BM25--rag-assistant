You can ping the computers on the network. // addressToPing can be an IPaddress or host name. // returns a boolean indicating successful ping public static bool PingComputer (string[] addressToPing) { Ping pingSender = new Ping (); PingOptions options = new PingOptions (); // Use the default Ttl value which is 128, // but change the fragmentation behavior. options.DontFragment = true; // Create a buffer of 32 bytes of data to be transmitted. string data = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"; byte[] buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes (data); int timeout = 120; PingReply reply = pingSender.Send (args[0], timeout, buffer, options); return reply.Status == IPStatus.Success; } http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.networkinformation.ping.aspx You can use this ping code and iterate through the IP addresses on your LAN ( for(i = 1; i ). You should probably read up on doing IP address calculations though: http://blogs.msdn.com/knom/archive/2008/12/31/ip-address-calculations-with-c-subnetmasks-networks.aspx This is called a 'ping sweep'. It does assume that the computers on the network have not been configured to ignore ICMP requests.
