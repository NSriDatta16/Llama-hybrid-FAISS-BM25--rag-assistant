We can link a static library without the .xcodeproj file. Let's say we have libSDK.a file + public headers in our local "sdk/lib" and "sdk/include" folders (respectively) : 1. Drag the libSDK.a and headers files to our xcode project (preferrably in a dedicated group). 2. Double click on the target, select "Build" tab. --- 2.1. Update the value in "Header Search Paths" setting to the "sdk/include" folder. --- 2.2. Update the value in "Library Search Paths" setting to the "sdk/lib". --- 2.3. Update the value in "Other Linker Flags" setting to "-ObjC -lSDK". 3. Build your project. Now you're set to go.
