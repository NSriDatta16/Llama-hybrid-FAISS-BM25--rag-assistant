In my experience, you absolutely need the following for agile (XP or Scrum at least) to work. Without these prerequisites you are likely to fail. Hard. Team must be stable and 100% dedicated to this. Team must be colocated in one workspace. Customer/product owner must be available on site at all times. Support from management. This means providing funds and courage to ensure the points above. Give these points, you can probably tackle anything as long as you keep to the values .
