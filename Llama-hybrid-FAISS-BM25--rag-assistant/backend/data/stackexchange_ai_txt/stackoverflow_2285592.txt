It seems to me that is perfectly suitable. Be aware that replace() returns a copy of the original string and does not modify it in place. So since this replacement is only for display purposes it should work just fine. Here is a little visual example: >>> s = """This is my paragraph. ... ... I like paragraphs. ... """ >>> print s.replace('\n', ' ') This is my paragraph. I like paragraphs. >>> print s This is my paragraph. I like paragraphs. The original string remains unchanged. So... Is this the best way of doing it? Ask yourself: Does it work? Did it get the job done quickly without resorting to horrible hacks? Then yes, it is the best way.
