How to surround code with try/catch most elegantly

I often have some problems when using try-and-catch: 1) Some variables need to be declared inside the try brackets otherwise they will not be in scope 2) Ultimately even my return statement ends up having to be in the try bracket but then the method doesn't return anything. What is the proper way to get around this sort of problem. An example of a method that is causing this issue is the one below. It neesd a FileNotFoundException to be handled and a IOException to be handled. How do I do this most elegantly? public static String getContents (File file) { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String contents = new String(); while (reader.ready()) contents += reader.readLine(); return contents; }
