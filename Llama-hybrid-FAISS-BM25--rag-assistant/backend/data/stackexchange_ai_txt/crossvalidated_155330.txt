svm functional margin and geometric margin

I know that the functional margin has the following formula and I have read that given a training set we define the function margin of (w.b) with respect to S to be the minimum of this functional margins: but why it says that one should find the maximum geometrical margin? should it not be also to find the maximum of the functional margin from the beginning? For what I know that geometrical margin is only the functional margin normalized by ||w|| to consider the distances between the points to the decision boundary. Another question (because it is greatly related and I consider that is not necessary to open another thread), why is it better to find a wide margin instead that a narrow one?
