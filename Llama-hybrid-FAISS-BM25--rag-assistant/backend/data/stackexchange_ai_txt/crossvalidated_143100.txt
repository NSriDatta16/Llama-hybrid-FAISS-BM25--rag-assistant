How can I see sample autocorrelation from time series plot?

Lets say I am given time series plot. How can I estimate $r_1$ and $r_2$ which are sample correlation? I don't understand how to see correlation from data plot. I know how to get and use ACF and stuff from the data itself but I am having problem with understanding time series plot.
