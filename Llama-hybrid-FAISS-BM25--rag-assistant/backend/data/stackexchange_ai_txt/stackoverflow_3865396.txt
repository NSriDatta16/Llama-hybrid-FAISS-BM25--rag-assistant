jQuery Scroll Plugin

I just included jQuery jScrollPane plugin in to my page and it seems to be working fine except one small issue. I want to decrease the size(height) of scrollBar tab (where we click to drag the scroll bar up and down). I have attached the current snapshot of it as you can see how long it is. On the example site, it shows up fine. Src: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/themes/lozenge/ Note: I am talking about the Dark Colored Area on the snapshot.
