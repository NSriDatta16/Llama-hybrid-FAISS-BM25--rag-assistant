Finding a solution for k-means in 1-dimensions

Given are three points in 1-dimensional space: $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 2$ and $x_3 = 3$. We want to calculate the global minimizer for the objective function of k-means with k=1 (It is also added in the exercise to consider that if at any iteration no point is assigned to some center $Âµ_j$ ,this center is not updated during that iteration). I know that the objective function of k-means is $$\text{argmin}_S \sum_i |S_i|* Var( S_i)$$ with $S_i$ being the clusters. My approach would be: differentiate $||\mu||^2+||\mu-2||^2+||\mu-3||^2$ with respect to $\mu$. This gives me $\mu = 10/6$. This seems to be the average of the three points. Any feedback on my approach being correct? Thanks
