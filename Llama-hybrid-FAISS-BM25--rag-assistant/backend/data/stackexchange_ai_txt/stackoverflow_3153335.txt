Pies, I've been thinking about reputation algorithms (that's how I found this thread). You have to model your reputation algorithm after real world : 1) Older people are not necessarily better or more interesting, or should have more reputation points 2) Very young people can't have much of a reputation as they are new and did not contribute anything to the community that they can get reputation points for 3) Opinion / vote of a truly respectable / reputable person weighs more than that of some Joe Schmo. 4) If a bunch of Joe Schmos gang against a truly reputable individual, their combined mob opinion still should not prevail this individual's opinion 5) Possessing a lot of money (or mojos) does not translate into having a better reputation score (otherwise rich people would ALWAYS ultimately prevail over smart people). 6) Associating with more reputable members of a community passes some of their reputation juice to their friends and family (and it doesn't matter how much these friends and family contribute -- they are cool just because they know or related to someone cool). Thus, my conclusions: 1) You can't increase reputation score based on age 2) You can "penalize" very young accounts (same as Google Sandbox), which will at least solve a problem of creating a number of accounts and immediately voting something up or down. Some time should pass until user account "matures". Maybe even as little as 24 hours. 3) Same actions (that can cause your or other members reputation score to increase or decrease) can't be same for all members. Value of up or down vote of a more reputable member should be more than of a member with low reputation, and opposite for low reputation member. 4) Even an army of members with average reputation score way below targeted member's reputation score, they should not be able to decrease this member's score. Though it would sort of make sense if their average reputation score was closer, in which case the mass effect should trigger something that we can call a revolution. (Though in history revolutions have not always result in a good thing for the communities where they happened). 5) Reputation can't be the "currency" of your site. Something else can, but not reputation. 6) If you have a friendship concept, than being friends with someone with higher reputation should automatically pass some of that reputation to you. And that should be happening if you become friends with someone you know (at least on your web site), not befriending anybody and everybody.
