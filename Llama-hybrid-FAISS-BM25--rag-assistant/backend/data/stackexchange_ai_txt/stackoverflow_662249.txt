Error while refreshing a MS datawarehousing cube

We have a cube that we are populating the data from the source tables. To get the data to reflect we are calling the "Analysis services processing task" component. While the cube is being refreshed we are getting the following error. Description: OLE DB error: OLE DB or ODBC error: Communication link failure; 08S01. End Error Error: 2009-03-13 02:26:11.24 Code: 0xC11F000C Source: Process LedgerTransactions01 cube Analysis Services Execute DDL Task Description: Errors in the OLAP storage engine: An error occurred while the dimension, with the ID of 'Dim Item V', Name of 'dimItem' was being processed. The cube is running in a SQL server environment and this issue is not happening always.
