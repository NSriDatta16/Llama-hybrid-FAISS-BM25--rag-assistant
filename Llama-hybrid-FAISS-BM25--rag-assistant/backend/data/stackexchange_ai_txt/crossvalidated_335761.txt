As a statistics PhD student studying Bayesian deep learning and Gaussian processes, I have found it useful to be familiar with probability. I do not directly use the results for now because I am working on applied problems, but a lot of the theoretical work I look at is based on nonparametric techniques such as Gaussian or Dirichlet processes and those techniques are shown to have some properties using probability and functional analysis. Look for textbooks by Aad van der Vaart if you'd like an (extreme) example. In other words, knowing probability theory opens up a lot of statistical literature for you to peruse. If you care more about classification rates and less about uncertainty quantification, it might not be worth your time to get into the statistics. But then, if you are doing a logistic regression and the prediction of cancer for subject X is "1" (vs "0"), you might want to know how much confidence to place in that classification.
