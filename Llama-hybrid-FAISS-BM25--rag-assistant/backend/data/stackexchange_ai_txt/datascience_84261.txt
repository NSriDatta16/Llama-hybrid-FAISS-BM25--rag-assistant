Time series classification, without the time dimension

Edit Thanks to the answer of @pcko1 , I understand that I should use data augmentation to make my model resilient to order of data points. Clarification after the answer of @Icrmorin : My problem is actually more complex than just finding bullets. I also need to find title, order text appropriately (think 2-columns PDF), find header/footer, etc... I am currently trying a rule-based approach, and it was working well so far. But as the number of PDF format I need to handle grow, the complexity of the code grow as well, and I'm reaching a point where PDF formats have opposite features and can't be handled by the same code. I was hoping the machine learning approach might solve this issue and works well for any format. According to the answer of @mariq vlahova , it seems there is no name for this kind of task ? Just use LSTM ? end of edit I'm looking for the name of a task, in order to search more literature about the subject. The best I can describe this task is given in the title itself... Basically I have data points with several features each, and I need to classify each of these data points, but not independently. However the order does not (or should not) matter. Example For example I have 3 data points [D1, D2, D3] , and I want to classify is as [True, False, False] . These data points are dependent , ie changing 1 data point might alter the result of other as well : [D1, D2', D3] might be classified as [True, True, True] . Also, the order does not matter (that's why I wrote "without the time dimension"): If [D1, D2, D3] is classified as [True, False, False] , then [D2, D3, D1] should be classified as [False, False, True] . Context A bit more context... Basically I want to classify PDF content, as being a bullet point or not. So I want to parse my PDF file, extract chunks of text along with additional information (font size, position, etc...), and classify these chunks as bullet or not bullet . But we can't classify each chunk independently. Consider the following example : ...End of previous paragraph 1. This is a title Beginning of next paragraph... In this case, 1. This is a title should not be classified as bullet . But : 1. This is a title 2. This is a second title 3. This is a third title In that case, 1. This is a title should be classified as bullet . I need to find literature about this problem but I don't even know the name of the task...
