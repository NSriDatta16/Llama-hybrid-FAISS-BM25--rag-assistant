asp.net best practice string concatenation

I am trying to find the best practice for generating and outputting html which would require a database query first to obtain the info. Currently in the aspx page I have a div with runat server: Now just as a start to do a bit of testing I have a method that runs on page_load that basically does: private void BuildLeaflet(string qnid) { //gets leaflet details QueryLeafletDetails(); //return concatenated content string leaflet.InnerHtml " " + dr["LSC Descriptor"] + " "; } In the real solution the return is a concatenation of about 10 fields some very long as they are content. I don't by any means think this is the best solution, but what is? A StringBuilder? Can I Write Each Part in turn to the site avoiding the concatenation in the method? Is the server div even best? Edit: Forgot to put some of my content sections have simple (limited) html in them already such as paragraph, list... This allows me to easily produce documents for web and printing, I just use different stylesheets.
