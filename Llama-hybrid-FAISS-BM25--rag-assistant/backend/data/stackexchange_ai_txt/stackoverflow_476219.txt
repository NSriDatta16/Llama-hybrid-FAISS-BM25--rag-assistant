DataSet intrinsically understands the XML storage, you might think of it (very loosely mind) as its native data store. In fact XML storage is meant for temporary or transistory storage so that a DataSet can be re-constituted between application re-starts or transference between machines. On the other hand, true persistence stores such as MDB, SQL Server, Oracle or whatever are entirely alien to the Dataset, that's why you need provider specific Adapters to transfer data to and from the Dataset. Unless you can find a project out in web-land where someone has done this before you are going to need to create your own code to analyse the dataset schema then send DDL to you MDB connection to create the tables.
