The problem is that when the div is dragged to do the sorting, jQuery effectively set's the draggable (so div.c in your case) to be absolutely positioned (so it can move it around the screen). Not sure about the exact CSS quirks (maybe someone wiser than I can explain more fully), but basically your floating .handle acts a bit strangely in conjunction with the p when inside an absolutely positioned container. The margins on the p now appear to be set from the inside of div rather than merging with them, while the span is still floating to the top left of the div. One solution is to add the same top margin to the span as to the p , but only while its dragging. In other words add the following CSS (I think 1em should be the default margin applied to the top of the p ): .ui-sortable-helper .handle { margin-top: 1em; } If you are interested in delving more into the CSS, add the following to your above code & you'll reproduce the problem without needing the sortables involved: .c { width: 500px; height: 40px; position: absolute; }
