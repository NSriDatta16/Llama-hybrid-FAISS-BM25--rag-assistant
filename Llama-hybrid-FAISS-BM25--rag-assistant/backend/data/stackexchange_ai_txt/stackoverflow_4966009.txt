OS choice You shall first make a kind of choice between 2 worlds (MS or Linux). Provided that the Linux community is somehow significantly less reluctant to share explanations. Also you will loose less time by choosing one or the other one, avoiding to wonder the same questions twice, with different answers depending on which OS you chose. I experienced both, starting to search for solutions in the MS world, that I knew. Big mistake, loss of time. Then I changed, too late, to the Linux world. So I would advice to go straight to the linux OS for learning. Really many distributions for this. I would advice Debian (opened, user friendly, simple, safe, huge community) but you'll get as many proposals as there are admin. OS understanding http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/ http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bash.html http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ Specific Questions about SSH It depends a lot on the system you will choose but you could easily build a small client and a small server, then configure both and use ssh. Your 2 servers could even be hosted on the same machine, locally if you wish. Then you will learn how to set up the ssh-client side (often called ssh_config) and the ssh server side (often named sshd_config, with "d" standing for daemon). Here you can find explanations about ssh for both worlds : http://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Linux Some keywords for your google searches List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers ssh-keygen : encrypted keys (private/public), ssh-add ssh agent Gentoo keychain and later but soon if you administrate your server on your own The two main ones : 1) iptables You may start with this and then go further with that one 2) fail2ban this is a complement tool for which you'll find easily plenty of docs ... Have fun :-) EDIT: you can easily experience a Linux machine hosted in a windows OS, using virtualization (virtualbox, vm-ware..). It's a safe start and offer a good payback for this time investment. It would allow you to host as many machines (for example one linux server and one linux client) as you wish, in the limits of your HD room.
