How to get rest of record from one or two fields?

(Beginners question here...be gentle) My php script is a response to a form. Assuming I have already connected to a database and extracted the post variables (just two - emailAddress and username), like so mysql_connect('localhost', 'dbusername', 'dbpassword'); mysql_select_db('database'); extract($_REQUEST); ..and knowing that within the 'users' table, there are 'emailAddress', 'username' and 'address' fields. (The email addresses will all be unique..) How would I search thru the table to get at the specific 'address' after receiving the emailAddress and username (and output something else if there is no name and address which matches)? seems absurdly difficult to get an answer. this must be a very very very very very very difficult question. Extra-special thanks to users who told me the problem was very easy, and yet couldn't come up with an answer. I salute your indefatigability, your magnificent courage, and your willingness to help. A possible answer to my question is: $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE emailAddress='".$emailAddress."' AND username='".$username."'"); $row = mysql_fetch_array($result); if ($row['username'] == "") { // no results } else if ($row['emailAddress'] == $emailAddress AND $row['username'] == $username) { // found result echo "The address is ".$row['address']; } else { // i guess something else happened } Be sure to tell me how this is wrong, and the real answer is easy, and yet not come up with an answer.
