Starter-Isolated-Storage Pack on Windows Phone 7

I am making a small Windows Phone 7 application and have lots of text files used by the app. They all contains LOTS of lines. Is it possible to make some files be already installed when I launch the application? I know that emulator doesn't save isolated storage when closed but I don't need it. I want to make some data files which would be already in the storage when my app starts for the first time. If it is possible, how do I do that? I am using Visual Studio 2010
