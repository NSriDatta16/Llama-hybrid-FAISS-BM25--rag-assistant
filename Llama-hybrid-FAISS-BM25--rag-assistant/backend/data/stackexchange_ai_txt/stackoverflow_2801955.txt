Divs are simple divisions , they are mean't to be used to group sections of the page that are in a semantic sense linked. They carry no implicit meaning other than that. Tables were originally intended to display scientific data, such as lab results on screen. Dave Raggett certainly didn't intend them to become used to implement layout. I find it keeps it fairly clear in your mind if you remember the above, if its something you would normally expect to read in a table, then that's the appropriate tag, if its pure layout, then use something else to accomplish your needs.
