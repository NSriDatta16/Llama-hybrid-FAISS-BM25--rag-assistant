Confidence intervals for smoothed binary time series data

I am trying to visualise binary time series data. To do so I have a plot (see below) where I show whether a given trial was a success or a failure (red/green vertical lines at the top) and then below I plot a smoothed time series of the success probability (where I've smoothed using a gaussian kernel with some arbitrary standard deviation). The x-axis is time What I was hoping to find is a way to put meaningful confidence intervals on the smoothed curve. I can see complicated ways of doing this using Bayesian smoothing algorithms, but am looking for a simpler alternative. I don't need the confidence intervals to be exact but they also shouldn't be entirely meaningless. Any suggestions, ideally that do not involve fitting an explicit model?
