You address this by using changeVersion . The API supports database versioning so you can apply schema changes during upgrades, or in your case.. installation. There are some examples in the documentation : function prepareDatabase(ready, error) { return openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Offline document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) { db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) { t.executeSql('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)'); }, error); }); } In that example, they call prepareDatabase , which opens a connection to the database, but if the version is CREATE TABLE statement. When the page is revisited, assuming the user didn't clear out the database.. it will be at version 1.0 already, so changeVersion will simply do nothing instead of running the CREATE TABLE again.
