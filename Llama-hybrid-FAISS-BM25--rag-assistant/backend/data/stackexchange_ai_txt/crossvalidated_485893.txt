This isn't really a 'discrete' variable, it's a categorical variable. Only the intercept is the odds of a woman (in the reference level party) being elected. The other coefficients are odds ratios . You multiply those odds ratios times the odds in the intercept to get the odds of a woman in the, say, green party being elected (in that case the odds is .3125, or about 24%).
