Holt-Winters parameters in R

I'm trying to replicate some values from a holt winters calculation made in excel by someone else. I have the time series time_x, and I'm using the forecast package. The problem is when I run the command hw using the same parameters this error occur: >hw(y = time_x,h = 24,seasonal = "additive",alpha = 0.1, beta = 0.6, gamma = 0.05) [1] "Model: ETS(A,A,A)" Error in etsmodel(y, errortype[i], trendtype[j], seasontype[k], damped[l], : Parameters out of range Aren't all parameters between 0 and 1?
