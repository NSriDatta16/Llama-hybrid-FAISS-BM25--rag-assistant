Windows Phone 7 IsolatedStorage when sideloading

Is there a way when I am testing my own app (sideloaded to my phone), that I can treat my version as an update to my original application. Lets say I'm going from 1.5 to 1.6 of my app. I want to use the exact same IsololatedStorage data that is in 1.5 with my new version (for testing). Is there a way to do this? In the past it just creates a new instance of my application and I would have 1.5 and 1.6 on my phone. Anyway of doing this?
