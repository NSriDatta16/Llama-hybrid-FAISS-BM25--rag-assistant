You have taken count data ( i.e.the number of failures in the first interval , the second interval , the nth interval ) and added them to create a cumulative series which is autocorrelated as a result of your summation strategy. You then try to use a procedure to test the relationship between cumulative failures and cumulative time . Note the procedure you are using requires independent observations while you have autocorrelated observations. A recent reviewerof AUTOBOX, a program I am involved in, made a similar tactical error in trying to correlate/predict a movies total box-office receipts as a function of time. The movie was "Alice in Wonderland" and he should have known better. He constructed the sum of weekly box-office receipts to create a "total box-office-to-date series". Please Google "alice in wonderland box office jack yurkewicz" for details on this. The correct procedure is to analyze the observed time series data and construct an ARIMA Model taking into account any Interventions (Pulses,Level Shifts,Local Time Trends,Seasonal Pulses) that may have occurred
