For 10 fold cross validation you will: Split the data into 10 subsets of 50 each. For 10 interations choose one subset of 50 to be the validation set and train a model on the remaining 450 instances and record performance on the validation set. Take results of the 10 performance metrics you used for each iteration (AUC, RMSE, etc.) and average them. This averaged performance metric is your estimate of how the final model will perform on out of sample data. The final model you deploy will be built on all 500 instances.
