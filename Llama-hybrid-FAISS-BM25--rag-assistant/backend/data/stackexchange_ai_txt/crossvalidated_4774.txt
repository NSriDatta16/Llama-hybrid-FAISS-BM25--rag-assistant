First of all, a question if interest: If you want the measurements not to differ significantly, why change the tool at all? Simply to get more frequent measurements, or for economical reasons? Now for the reply. I do not entirely understand how you gathered the data. You say both instruments were colocated, and that instrument B gathered data more frequently. For comparison purposes, you would want those measurements of B that were made at the same place as A. As you cannot match them exactly, you need to interpolate. For this, I would use timestamps, but assume you don't have them, as you went with the GPS coordinates (although you did say "4-minute interval"). I'll assume it's reasonable to assume the GPS coordinates are accurate for both instruments, and that the effect measured doesn't noticeably vary over very small distances, such as the location the instruments are in on the vehicle. For interpolation, you need a model of the variability of the measured effect between datapoints. You say you used the nearest neighbour. That's perfectly acceptable, but I would probably go with a linear interpolant myself. Using all datapoints would require a very good model, which you may not yet have. As for the comparisons: You found that the instruments do differ, depending on the true value. This means at least one of the instruments is biased, but you will not be able to tell from the measurements alone which one. You may be able to fit a generalized linear model The correlation you measured is actually not all that good for what is supposed to be 1. The Pearson correlation does not require normality, but it does assume the variables are stationary and independent - which yours aren't. Large N isn't a problem, it's a good thing. Your large t-value also tells you that if your variable is normally distributed, the instruments are not equivalent. In testing the reported categories, start with a simple crosstabulation to see if any particular mismatch is more likely than others. That the time series is autocorrelated doesn't matter when looking just at the differences. To test for independence of the categories, you first need to determine whether categories depend on the discretized variable, and if not, whether they nevertheless are ordered or merely unordered labels. The choice of test comes after you characterize how you think the data should behave.
