Statistical Significance on Marketing Experiment

Last week our marketing team did an experiment on discount voucher for a specific product. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental group and control group. There are 4 types of voucher amounts tested (5% discount, 10% discount, 15% discount, and 20% discount). One group received one email for 3 days, the other group received one email for 5 days. Each user can only use the voucher once. This is the result of the experiment : The problem is, I don't know much about statistics. It seems that the 20% discount draws high attention. But how do I know if it's statistically significant? And which voucher and email scheme that I should suggest to our marketing manager? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.
