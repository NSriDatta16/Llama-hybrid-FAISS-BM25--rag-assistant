Both are multitouch devices. The number of simultaneous touches supported on both is different though. About gestures: Apple only supplies you with callback methods such as touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded. Look these methods up in the docs. They provide you with ways to count number of touches, taps, and also track finger movements. There are no "standard" gestures. Only what you code in. Some standard library objects support multitouch gestures such as pinch and zoom (the UIScrollView for example) but the reason is that they are standard objects created by Apple. If you want to make gestures, you have to code them in. For example, to do pinch and zoom, you need to use touchesMoved with two finger touches and calculate the distance between the two coordinates. To get into the detail of these algorithms for gestures would be overkill so would you like me to outline a few?
