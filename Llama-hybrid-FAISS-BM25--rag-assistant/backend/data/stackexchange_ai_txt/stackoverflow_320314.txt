The thing about polling is that it works! Its reliable and simple to implement. The costs of pooling can be high -- if you are scanning a database for changes every minute when there are only two changes a day you are consuming a lot of resources for a very small result. However the problem with any notification technoligy is that they are much more complex to implement and not only can they be unreliable but (and this is a big BUT) you cannot easily tell when they are not working. So if you do drop polling for some other technoligy make sure it is usable by average programmers and is ultra reliable.
