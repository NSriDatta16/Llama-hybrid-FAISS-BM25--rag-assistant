Interpret multiple logistic regression

I have two groups of patients who were part of an intervention many years ago, and some covariates about their characteristics e.g., age, BMI, and years since the intervention. I have conducted a logistic regression in order to see the association of the intervention (yes/no) with a clinical outcome (yes/no), controlling for these known individual factors such that $Outcome = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Intervention + \beta_2 Age + \beta_3 BMI + \beta_3 YearsSinceInt$ I have obtained some coefficients from my logistic regression but now when it comes to interpret the results I am being asked by a physician to interpret each coefficient in order to see the effect of each variable on having the binary outcome. I am a bit afraid of running into the Table 2 Fallacy so I argue that we should only interpret the Intervention variable. Nonetheless, it is a cross-sectional study so I am a bit torn whether we can actually give interpretation to each coefficient and only talk about association and never about causal effects. What do you suggest? Can I give interpretation to each coefficient or I should only interpret the Intervention coefficient? Is there a way to see the effect of each variable on the outcome without running the risk of falling into Table 2 Fallacy and over-interpretating control variables?
