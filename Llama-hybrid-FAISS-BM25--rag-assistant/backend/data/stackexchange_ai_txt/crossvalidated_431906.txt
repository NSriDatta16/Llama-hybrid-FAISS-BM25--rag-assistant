Estimating/translating odds ratio for different percentile intervals

I have a question regarding a translation in odds ratio curve OR(x). More specifically, let's say we have an OR(x) which we get using logistic regression. We look at the interval bounded with 25% and 75% percentiles of the variable X and denote the value of interval with X 25-75 . For further interpretation of the odds ratio we want to have OR(X 25-75 ) = 1, however in our case we get X 50 = 1.02. So my question is: how do we translate the odds ratio curve to get the OR(X 25-75 ) = 1? In other words: How do we get the OR estimates for different percentile intervals? See for example table 4 from this paper or table 2 from this paper .
