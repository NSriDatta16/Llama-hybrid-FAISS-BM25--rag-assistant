Python Cross platform GUI : more than one option , I'd use WxPython , but Qt bindings are also available ( comparison between wxWidgets and Qt ). File System API : this gets into the os package, but there are also convenience methods for just dealing with I/O . USB I/O : I confess to not having any knowledge here, but suspect if you're talking storage that Python will be able to read and write using its IO package. Libraries, Ease of Use, etc.. : there's a lot built in, but also a huge number of add-ons (called "packages"). Some of the most notable are SciPy and NumPy , used for scientific and numerical analysis. Tooling : there are a number of IDEs out there , I use PyDev (but it's Eclipse based so you probably won't like it if you don't like Java). Finally, Python is supported on Android via its scripting environment .
