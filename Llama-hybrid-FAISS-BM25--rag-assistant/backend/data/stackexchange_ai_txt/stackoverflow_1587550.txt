Consistency is the best approach. Adding a _TABLE or _VIEW at the end of an object name is overkill in my book, but if the database is designed that way, I wouldn't break from convention. For your colleague to bring his naming convention from a previous organization into a new one without checking 'local' standards is bad practice.
