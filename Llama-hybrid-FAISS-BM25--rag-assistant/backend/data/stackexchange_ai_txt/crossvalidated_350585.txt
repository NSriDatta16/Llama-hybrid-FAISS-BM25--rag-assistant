Yes, at least for linear regression, so I will answer for that case. The model is then $$ Y=X\beta+\epsilon $$ in matrix form, where $Y$ is $n\times 1$ , $X$ is $n\times p$ , $\beta$ is $p\times 1$ and the error term $\epsilon$ is $n\times 1$ . We assume the errors $\epsilon_i$ are iid with variance $\sigma^2$ (and expectation zero). Then the least squares estimator is $\hat{\beta}=(X^T X)^{-1}X^T Y$ and the predicted values is $\hat{Y}= X\hat{\beta}=X (X^TX)^{-1} X^T Y= H Y$ where $H= X (X^TX)^{-1} X^T$ is the hat matrix. The residual vector $r= Y-\hat{Y}=(I-H)Y$ has expectation zero and variance matrix $\text{Var}(r)= (I-H) \sigma^2 I (I-H) = \sigma^2 (I-H)$ so the standard error of residual component $i$ is $$ \text{se}(r_i) = \sigma \sqrt{1-h_i} $$ and we can show that $ 0\le h_i \le 1$ . $h_i$ is often seen as a measure of the influence or leverage of observation $i$ , so we can see that the most influential observations have residuals with lesser standard error.
