If you have statistics for your website (or feel like coding up such), .NET versions will be sent as part of the User-Agent for IE and Firefox (atleast, I don't use any other browsers, so can't speak for them) by default. You can then get statistics for the people that actually matter: your users. That aside (or if you don't have a public website at all yet), then you can always do detection code and tell people to go download it if they need it. If you have a site/application that people want to use, most if not all won't begrudge downloading a browser plugin or two.
