The algorithm is designed as a wrapper around a Random Forest classification algorithm. It iteratively removes the features which are proved by a statistical test to be less relevant than random probes. The Boruta algorithm can also be applied to regressions. The Boruta package provides a convenient interface to the algorithm. Kursa, Miron B., Jankowski, Aleksander, and Rudnicki, Witold R.
