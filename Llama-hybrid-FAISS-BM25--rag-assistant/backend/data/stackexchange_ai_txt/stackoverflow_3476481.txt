Web gateway interfaces in Python 3

I've finally concluded that I can no longer afford to just hope the ongoing Py3k/WSGI disaster issues will be resolved anytime soon, so I need to get ready to move on. Unfortunately, my available options don't seem a whole lot better: While I find a few different Python modules for FastCGI scattered around the web, none of them seem to be getting much (if any) attention and/or maintenance, particularly with regard to Python 3.x, and it's difficult to distinguish which, if any, are really viable. Falling all the way back to the built-in CGI module is hardly better than building something myself from scratch (worse, there's an important bug or two in there that may not get attention until Python 3.3). There is no higher sin than handling HTTP directly in a production webapp. And anyway, that's still reinventing the wheel. Surely somebody out there is deploying webapps on 3.x in production. What gateway interface are you using, with which module/libraries, and why?
