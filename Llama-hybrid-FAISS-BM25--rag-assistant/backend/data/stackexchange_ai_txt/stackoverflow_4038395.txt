If you don't want to wait, INSERT DELAYED and cousins, with still seperate queries, are the way to go. If you cannot use them (for instance, you are using the InnoDB storage engine), you'll have to feed them to another process which can / is allowed to wait them out. For the latter option I especially like the job/worker/client concept of gearman , although it takes a little bit of work to get a pool of non-webserver related workers running it's a godsend when you just want to inform a user you will do the requested alterations, possibly with a callback when it's finished, but essentially letting the user go on his/her merry way.
