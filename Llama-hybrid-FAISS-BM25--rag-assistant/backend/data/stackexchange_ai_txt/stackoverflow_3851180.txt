When developing applications, to know the memory size allocated to a pointer, we actually pay attention at the moment we allocate memory for it, which in your case is: int *p = (int *) malloc(10); and then we store this information somewhere if we need to use it in the future. Something like this: void func(int *p, size_t size) { printf("Memory address 0x%x has %d bytes allocated for it!\n", p, size); } int main() { int my_bytes = 10; int *p = malloc(my_bytes); func(p, my_bytes); return 0; }
