There's a technique that was used by the Microsoft research team called a generic worker. In a nutshell, this approach required that the core application was stored elsewhere (like blob storage), then would be pulled down at run time for execution. In theory, this same approach could be used for creating a package that your web app could pull down and load as updates are applied. Thus preventing you from having to redeploy each time an update occurs. The challenge I see here is the same one that causes issues creating reusable aspx files across web sites. At least last I tried that (several years/versions ago), it wasn't doable. So you may have that same challenge this go-round.
