Hannan–Quinn information criterion and Kashyap information criterion (KIC)

As we may know, the capacity of a model to overfit could easily increase by an increase in the complexity of that model (take complexity roughly as a number of parameters). To handle this problem, there are some model selection criteria that are suggested by statisticians. As described in Wikipedia , The AIC and BIC are both methods of assessing model fit penalized for the number of estimated parameters. Hannan–Quinn information criterion , an alternative to the Akaike and Bayesian criteria Kashyap information criterion (KIC) is a powerful alternative to AIC and BIC because KIC uses the Fisher information matrix I am wondering if anyone used methods like Hannan–Quinn information criterion and Kashyap information criterion (KIC). I am really having trouble understanding the intuition behind KIC. I mean how KIC is using Fisher information matrix and how these methods are used for Model Selection
