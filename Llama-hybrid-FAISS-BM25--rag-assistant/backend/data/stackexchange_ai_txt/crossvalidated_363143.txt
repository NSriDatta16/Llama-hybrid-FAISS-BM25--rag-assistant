Well one really helpful answer has been already given here . However I am not sure that you have gaussian modeling in your time series. A known test you can use is the Granger Causality test , however it seems that you do not want to predict Lab2 from Lab1, so I just state it to be safe. Otherwise, study these two posts: 1 , 2 . I would standardize the time series (by scale ) and then use interpolation in order to split each series in the same time-points in order to use an ARIMA model. ARIMA models can describe each series separately as stated here .
