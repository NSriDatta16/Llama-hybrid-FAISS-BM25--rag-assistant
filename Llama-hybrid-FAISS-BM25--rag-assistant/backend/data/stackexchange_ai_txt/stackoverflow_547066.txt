We do it with a Sequence column in the database. We use sparse numbering (e.g. 10, 20, 30, ...), so we can "insert" one between existing values. If the adjacent rows have consecutive numbers we renumber the minimum number of rows we can. You could probably use Decimal numbers - take the average of the Sequence numbers for rows adjacent to where you are inserting, then you only have to update the row being "moved"
