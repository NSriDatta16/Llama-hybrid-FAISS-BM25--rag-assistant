How do I determine how well a person does on average compared to previous work done in their same position?

I'm currently leading a group of missionaries and I want to find out how well each missionary is doing compared to the average in their area. Each area has a historical data of how well it's performed. Let's say one of the recorded statistics is new people met. I've calculated: The Average number of new people met in the specific area Standard deviation of new people met in the specific area The Z-Score of each week for new people met of the current missionary in the specific area, assuming a normal distribution I now want to calculate on average how well the current missionary performs above or below the mean in their specific area. I've tried averaging the missionary's Z-scores, but I don't think it's giving me any useful information so far. What would be a better method of calculating a missionary's impact on their area? Maybe a t-test?
