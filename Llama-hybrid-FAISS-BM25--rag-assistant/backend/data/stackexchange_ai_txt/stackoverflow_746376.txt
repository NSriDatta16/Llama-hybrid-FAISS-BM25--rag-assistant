safari highlighting artifacts when ajax resizes objects above it

On Safari 3.2.1, I observe that if a textarea is highlighted as the active control, and an object above it resizes (e.g., an img loads) there are fragments of highlighting left behind after the textarea moves to accommodate the new layout. How to fix this?
