Writing an app to interact with SQL 2008 without managed code

I want to write a winPE(vista) application that connects to a DB and just writes a row in a table saying it booted winPE. Here is my problem. I only ever do .NET. I'm pretty familiar with OO concepts so I'm finally taking the plunge to unmanaged code. I assume I have to use visual studio's unmanaged c++ project type, but I don't know where to go from there; what header files do I need? Are there any I can leverage? Are there any good tutorials for this type of thing?
