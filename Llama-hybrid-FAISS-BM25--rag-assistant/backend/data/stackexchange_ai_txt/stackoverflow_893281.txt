I'll disagree with some of the previous comments and say that there are a lot of advantages to using the built-in Oracle account security. If you have to augment this with some sort of shadow table of users with additional information, how about wrapping the Oracle account creation in a separate package that is declared PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION and returns a sucess/failure status to the package that is doing the insert into the shadow table? I believe this would isolate the Oracle account creation from the transaction.
