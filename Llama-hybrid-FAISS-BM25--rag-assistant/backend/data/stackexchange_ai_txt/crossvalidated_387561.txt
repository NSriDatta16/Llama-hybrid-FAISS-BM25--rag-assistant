Validating a model built on multiple regressions

I have a program that models suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) using turbidity as a predictor and lab derived sediment concentrations as the response. The relationship between the two can change for a number of reasons but the most significant being large storms vs small storms. So I use the program to create regressions for each storm then it outputs a continuous time series data set of predicted suspended sediment concentrations. I generally have 5 separate models for a given water year. The output looks good if I plot the known lab SSC with the predicted SSC. But unlike doing a single linear regression for the whole water year and getting the usual model statistics, I have 5 models and the program does not like to output stats of any use. What would be the best recourse for validating this model? Calculate everything by hand? I'm considering using a single model for a given water year just to show the relationship is strong. Most people use a single model to predict SSC but it is well known separating the storms is considered more accurate which is why I'm using multiple models.
