If you want to maintain the standard configuration interface, take a look at the ProtectedConfigurationProvider . This provider lets you store your configuration data outside of a standard configuration file, encrypt it however you like, or redirect requests for configuration in any way you see fit: Redirecting Configuration with a Custom Provider - Wrox Implementing a Protected Configuration Provider - MSDN Protected Configuration - Blayd Software The beauty of this approach is that nothing changes in your existing applications. They don't need to know where their configuration is stored. The retrieval of configuration data is isolated in the provider. You can store it in a central file, store it in a database, or access it via a web service. If you change your mind, you only have to update your provider. Everything else stays the same.
