Organizing using directives

I've been using ReSharper for the past months and, advertising aside, I can't see myself coding without it. Since I love living on the bleeding "What the hell just went wrong" edge, I decided to try my luck w/ the latest ReSharper 4.5 nightly builds. It's all nice. However, I've noticed that the using directives grouping format has changed, and I wanted to know which is closer to the general standards: [OLD] #region Using directives using System.X; using System.Y; using System.Z; using System.A; #region namespace X { ... } [NEW] namespace X { #region Using directives using System.X; using System.Y; using System.Z; using System.A; #region ... } Other than just lazy loading references, does it serve any special purpose? (Been reading Scott Hanselman's take on this @ http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsDoNamespaceUsingDirectivesAffectAssemblyLoading.aspx ) Thanks;
