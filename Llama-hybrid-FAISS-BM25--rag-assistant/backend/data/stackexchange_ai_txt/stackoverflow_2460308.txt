How to fix the column width of a listview in c# Windows Form?

I have a listview, and I need to fix the column width of the listview so that at runtime user cannot drag the column headers and resize it... What is the procedure?? I have searched all the properties but none of them help me out to solve this pbm... This is possible in gridview but how will it be possible in listview?
