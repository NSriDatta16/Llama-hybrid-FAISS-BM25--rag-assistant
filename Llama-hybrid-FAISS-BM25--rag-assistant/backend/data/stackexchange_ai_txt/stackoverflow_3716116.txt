What is a good way to get a list of files from (a directory on) the sd card?

I'm happy reading and writing to a pre-set file, and could manually populate a listview, but I'm hoping there is an official(or not) filebrowser I missed, or other more elegant solution to present the user with a directory listing, and let them select a file.
