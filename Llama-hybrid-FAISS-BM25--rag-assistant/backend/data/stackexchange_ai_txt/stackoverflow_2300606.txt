There is a default password extension to automatically provide credentials. There's not much advantage to this beyond embedding the creds right in the url as Sejanus suggests. It's still plaintext, but does put your password into a separate file, the location of which you can control. Without this, the password is stored in the .hg folder in your workspace, so this might be preferable if the filesystem your workspace is on is shared.
