How does the Blue Brain Project (and NEURON software) work?

This question is related to 873448 . From Wikipedia : The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. [...] Using a Blue Gene supercomputer running Michael Hines's NEURON software, the simulation does not consist simply of an artificial neural network, but involves a biologically realistic model of neurons. "If we build it correctly it should speak and have an intelligence and behave very much as a human does." My question is how the software works internally. If it "involves a biologically realistic model of neurons", how is that different from a neural network, and why can't neural networks simulate a biological brain well while this project would be able to? And, how is NEURON software used in the simulation? Lastly, I apologize if this question doesn't belong here (maybe the BioStar StackExchance would be a better place to ask).
