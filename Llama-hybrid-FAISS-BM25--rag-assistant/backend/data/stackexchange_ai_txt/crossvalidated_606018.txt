how to perform multiple comparisons on a linear mixed model with unbalanched set of groups

I have built a linear mixed model (rt.m6) with 2 fixed factors, namely condition and suffix, which also interact with each other. However, my experimental design isn't fully crossed, meaning that not all suffixes are included in all the experimental conditions. When running the model (rt.m6), R is dropping 1 column/coefficient because of that. rt.m6 condition * suffix + (1 | num_item) + (1 | subject), data= data_trimmed_RT, REML = F) The problem occurs when I'm trying to perform multiple comparisons via emmeans including only one of the fixed factors, the one of the condition . For the condition that doesn't include all the suffixes, comparisons cannot be made, and the output in noted as NA . pairs(emmeans(rt.m6, " condition ", simple = "each", lmer.df = "asymp")) > > pairs(emmeans(rt.m6, "condition", simple = "each", lmer.df = "asymp")) NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value > ArgStrViol - AspViol nonEst NA NA NA NA > ArgStrViol - CatViol 499.9 164 Inf 3.053 0.0192 > ArgStrViol - GramW 458.2 158 Inf 2.903 0.0304 > ArgStrViol - Novel -138.5 171 Inf -0.808 0.9284 > AspViol - CatViol nonEst NA NA NA NA > AspViol - GramW nonEst NA NA NA NA > AspViol - Novel nonEst NA NA NA NA > CatViol - GramW -41.7 150 Inf -0.278 0.9987 > CatViol - Novel -638.4 166 Inf -3.839 0.0012 > GramW - Novel -596.7 159 Inf -3.752 0.0016 > > Results are averaged over the levels of: suffix Degrees-of-freedom > method: asymptotic P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a > family of 5 estimates Do you know how to solve this?
