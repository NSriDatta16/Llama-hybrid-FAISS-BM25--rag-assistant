IIS is doing its own compile when you first visit the website, and that's what's causing this delay. I think IIS compiles on-demand, though, so I'm surprised to hear that it's taking a full minute to view the first page. How's the disk performance on the web server - is it generally slow, or full/fragmented? Is there memory contention? The first step would be to see if there's some way you can augment the resources available in that server - either by adding more or by stopping/moving any unnecessary services - to see if that helps. If that doesn't have an impact on the compile time when you first visit, you can try adding a step to your build process that visits the website in the background, which would cause it to pre-compile. It wouldn't do away with your wait time, but it would start the compile immediately, so the site is available as soon as possible. You can read about custom build steps at MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms366724(VS.80).aspx I'm interested to know what solves this problem.
