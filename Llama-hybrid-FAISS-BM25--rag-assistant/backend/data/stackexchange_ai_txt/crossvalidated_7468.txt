Constrained clustering maintains data order. There is a package in R called 'rioja' that implements this in the function 'chclust'. The procedure isn't too complex though: Calculate inter-point distance Find the smallest distance between adjacent points Average the value of the two points to generate a single value Spit the list out again and start from one until you have a single point. You need to maintain some sort of tree structure, but with some elementary programming experience you should be able to do it.
