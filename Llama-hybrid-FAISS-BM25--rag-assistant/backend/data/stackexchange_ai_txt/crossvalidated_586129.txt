Of course, you won't know the temperature of the air in the next three months, either. So you basically have two possibilities: Predict product temperatures based on historical product temperatures alone Predict product temperatures based on historical product temperatures and forecasts of air temperatures as a driver Unless you have knowledge of external drivers (maybe a cooling unit reliably reduces the air temperature in the first 15 out of every 60 minutes? If so, use seasonal methods with season length 60), both forecasts involved (air and product) will likely converge to a long-term average. Which is pretty much what you should expect for a long-term forecast, and probably the best you can do. Assuming you have enough data, it would make sense to try the two approaches described above with a holdout sample of the same length as you plan on using in your production forecast. For the second approach above, note that prediction intervals for product temperatures will be too narrow if you use air temperature as a fixed forecast. Consider simulating multiple trajectories of future air temperatures and feeding each one into the product temperature forecast, then simulating product temperature trajectories and finally taking pointwise quantiles to get prediction intervals. If the accuracy is not good enough (which you should assess based on the costs of forecast error - what will the forecast be used for?), it may make sense to invest in making the series more forecastable, instead of chasing accuracy that may be hard to impossible to achieve . For instance, you could work on how the cooling unit operates.
