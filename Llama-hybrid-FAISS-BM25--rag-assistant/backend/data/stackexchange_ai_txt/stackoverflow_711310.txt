The problem in a D VCS (as in "Decentralized") is the notion of " convention " which can be more important than for a classical VCS. Since every user will clone the repository, they might have some script already in place which will parse for a "master" branch (like this build.pl perl script ) Even though you can name or organize your branches with whatever name you want in Subversion ( you are not required to have a "trunk" for instance ), it might be wise, if you publish your repository , to respect at least this convention. If this is purely internal development (with internal replication for backup purposes for instance), you can name it whatever you want.
