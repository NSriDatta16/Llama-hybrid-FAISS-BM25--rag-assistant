Whether to Split Data in to Separate PostgreSQL Table

I am creating an app with a WPF frontend and a PostgreSQL database. The data includes patient addresses and supplier addresses. There is an average of about 3 contacts per mailing address listed. I'm estimating 10,000 - 15,000 contact records per database. When designing the database structure, it occurred to me that rather than storing mailing addresses in a single "contacts" table, I could have one table storing names and other individual data, with a second table holding addresses. I could then create a relationship between the tables, to match addresses with contacts. I have a pretty good idea how I can neatly organise situations such as changing the address of a single contact, where the other contacts are staying at the same address. The question is: is it worth it? Can I expect to save much in the way of storage size? Will this impact the speed of queries adversley? How about if I was using something other than PostgreSQL?
