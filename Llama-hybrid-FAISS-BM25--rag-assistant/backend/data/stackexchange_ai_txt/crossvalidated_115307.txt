I am not an expert specifially on locally linear embedding, but I am sure that preprocessing with PCA would typically not affect the results of LLE (assuming that you keep enough components). Indeed, if the data are lying on a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold of dimensionality $d_1$, then this manifold can be itself contained in a linear manifold of dimensionality $d_2>d_1$ that is still smaller than the full dimensionality of that data $d_3>d_2>d_1$. According to the book "Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction" by Lee and Verleysen , this is a useful approach, see sections 7.2.3-7.2.4: When data dimensionality is very high, linear dimensionality reduction by PCA may be very useful to suppress a large number of useless dimensions. [...] This also eases the work to be achieved by subsequent nonlinear methods. [...] Nonlinear methods of dimensionality reduction may take over from PCA once the dimensionality is no longer too high, between a few tens and a few hundreds, depending on the chosen method. Your second question I don't quite understand, but there is no way to compute geodesic distances by PCA. This can be done by or after the LLE step. Preprocessing with PCA just makes sure that your linear distances do not change much after the first (linear) dimensionality reduction step. If the whole nonlinear manifold is preserved, then the geodesic distances will not change either.
