How badly does it affect if we compare two machine learning algorithms one using Cosine Sim and other using Cosine Distance?

I am working on a research project such that I need to compare several distance based classifiers - say TF-IDF based KNN and Kmeans for clustering. Suppose I use Cosine Similarity for one and Cosine Distance for the other -- how will it affect the evaluations?
