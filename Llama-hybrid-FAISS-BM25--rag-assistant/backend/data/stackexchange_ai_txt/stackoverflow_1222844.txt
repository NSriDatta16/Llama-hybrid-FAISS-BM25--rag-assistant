Try putting them in to a DateTime objects. int day, month, year; if (Int32.TryParse(dayInput.Value, out day)) { if (Int32.TryParse(monthInput.Value, out month)) { if (Int32.TryParse(yearInput.Value, out year)) { DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(year, month, day); if ([birthDate is in valid range]) // it passes } } } I know this isn't very elegant, but you can also test it the same way using the following RegEx [0-9]+ However I like my way because I can enter it in to a DateTime field and then test the range to make sure it doesn't exceed the current date and is not below a 100 years before the current date.
