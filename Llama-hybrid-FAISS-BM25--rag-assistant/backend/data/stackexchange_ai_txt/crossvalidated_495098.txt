As a relief of my reply-as-a-comment, here's a more qualified answer. This kind of graphical output is usually called a dot plot or a dot chart, after Cleveland. 1 One dimensional scatter plots are also called dotplots in some statistical packages. As @mdewey mentioned, this can also be used to show the mean effect of a variable (with its standard error or confidence intervals) on a given outcome, but in this case each "point" are a different kind of aggregated statistic (i.e., the average of numerical values, rather than a frequency of count data). It is a nice alternative to more classical bar charts, because of its inherent low data-ink ratio , valued by Edward Tufte. 2 Moreover, this kind of graphical representation fits nicely into the design of trellis displays, by Becker and coll., 3 which among other things allow for facetting (i.e., conditioning in statistical language) and more (e.g., "shingle") --- Ross Ihaka has a nice presentation on this aspect in his Topic in Computational Data Analysis and Graphics course. You will probably find many such illustrations on this site, but the main R packages that are generally used are the builtin dotchart function, its lattice counterpart, dotplot , or the ggplot2 package, where geom_point can safely replace geom_bar or geom_hbar (note that geom_dotplot is the equivalent of R's builtin stripchart , for one dimensional scatter plots). The UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide provides some nice illustrations using the latter approach as well. References 1 Cleveland, W.S. and McGill, R. (1984).
