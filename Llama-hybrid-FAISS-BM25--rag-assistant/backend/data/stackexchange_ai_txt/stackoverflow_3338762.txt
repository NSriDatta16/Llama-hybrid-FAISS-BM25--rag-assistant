For now and probably for quite some time you won't be able to edit your app directly on an app engine account (as @Wobble notes: the file system on the instances are indeed read-only, for good reasons that hardly will change). Things like Py I/O or similar are also to limited, as you note yourself. To get forward you minimally want a file system that you can write to, preferably a machine that also will run the development server for you. Rent space on some VPS provider (e.g. gandi.net, http://www.gandi.net/hosting/ ), then you can mount your VPS home directory onto an office machine and create your app at the VPS, then deploy from it. It certainly won't be an IDE, you need to use (/learn) how to handle the system mainly through the command line, but it will be something. And as an added bonus, you could try non GAE python stuff on it (Turbo Gears, twisted stuff, your choice of fancy database etc)
