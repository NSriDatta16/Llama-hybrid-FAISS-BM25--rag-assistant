I just want to add more information about these more "intelligent" ways to pick hyperparameters. One in particular that's becoming more and more popular. BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle and Ryan P. Adam. Which has proven effective in algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks. Algorithm on Github https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint This method is particularly useful when the algorithm is complicated (leaning towards a black box model) and/or the data is massive and it's computationally expensive to train several times a model.
