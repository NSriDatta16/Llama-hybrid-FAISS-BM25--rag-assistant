May I replace Fisher's exact test or Chi-squared test with logistic regression and vice versa?

Let's assume we have two groups of patients, a control group and a treatment group. They were asked a question and the answer can be yes or no. Since I come from biological science where I used mainly regression methods I would use logistic regression. A friend of mine from the sociological sciences would analyze this data using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Now, I'm wondering if there are reason to use the one or the other method. To clarify my question, I created a dataset which I analyzed with several methods. The R-code is also mentioned below. Here are the results (odds ratio and p-values) of the analyses: odds ratio p-value comment manually (formula) 0.474 0.324 see details below chi-square - 0.524 warnings: approx. incorrect chi-square (simulated) - 0.460 fisher's exact test 0.477 0.465 logistic regression 0.474 0.324 exact what I get manually Bayes logistic regression 0.526 0.356 shrinking effect of Bayes As you can see the results are mostly similar. But imagine the situation if I want to publish the results performed with logistic regression and a reviewer asks me why I don't use the "classical" Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and vice versa? Here is how I created the data set and the analysis: library(arm) set.seed(12345) # size of groups n $p.value # 0.5242444 chisq.test(mx0, simulate.p.value=TRUE)$ p.value # 0.4602699 # Fisher's exact test fisher.test(mx0) $p.value # 0.4646205 fisher.test(mx0)$ estimate # 0.4769107 fisher.test(mx0)$conf.int[1:2] # 0.0703001 2.6013230 # manually (OR and CI): (or |z|) # (Intercept) -2.1972246 0.4714045 -4.6610172 3.146504e-06 # grouptreat -0.7472144 0.7570094 -0.9870609 3.236128e-01 exp(fit1[2,"Estimate"]) # 0.4736842 (fit2 |z|) # (Intercept) -2.2326782 0.4645022 -4.8066039 1.535157e-06 # grouptreat -0.6415988 0.6947115 -0.9235471 3.557222e-01 exp(fit2[2,"Estimate"]) # 0.5264501
