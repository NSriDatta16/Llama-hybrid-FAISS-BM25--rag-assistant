I do not fully understand your reviewer's point, but here are some thoughts... If the effect of $x$ on $y$ is heterogeneous, then the two instruments identify different effects. Specifically, each instrument serves to identify a local average treatment effect for compliers (i.e. those induced to change $x$ by the instrument). In your case, the instrument identifies the local average treatment effect (LATE) for people induced to retire by the age change. The subpopulation that changes $x$ at 62 is different from the population that changes at 65. Have you considered a regression discontinuity approach that focuses more narrowly on people around the key retirement ages? Changes in $y$ close to the retirement ages would be further support for your story if omitted variables $z$ that also cause $y$ don't change around the time of retirement. Another question is what does the reduced form regression say? Does the instrument that is suppose to affect transitioning from part-time to retirement appear to affect $y$ less than the instrument supposedly affecting the transition from full-time to retirement? Perhaps you need to restructure your argument to focus on (1) what you are trying to identify and (2) why your approach identifies it. This stuff about big versus small instruments seems tangential to me.
