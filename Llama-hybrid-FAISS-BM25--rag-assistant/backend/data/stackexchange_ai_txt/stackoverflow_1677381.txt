Take a look at the -scrollView:didEndDragging:willDecelerate: method on UIScrollViewDelegate . Something like: - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { int x = scrollView.contentOffset.x; int xOff = x % 50; if(xOff halfW) x = halfW; [scrollView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(x,scrollView.contentOffset.y)]; } It isn't perfectâ€”last I tried this code I got some ugly behavior (jumping, as I recall) when returning from a rubber-banded scroll. You might be able to avoid that by simply setting the scroll view's bounces property to NO .
