ADF Test and KPSS Test contradicting, differencing wont make the time series stationary

My time series is on Life expectancy at birth from 1960 to 2018. Obviously, it has an increasing trend and ACF also supports this because the ACF values dampen so slowly. However, ADF test p-value is less than 0.01 (stationary) and kpss test p-value is also less than 0.01(non-stationary). This is contradicting. Even after applying several differencing, ADF p-values get larger(>0.01) which makes them non-stationary while KPSS p-values still are less than 0.01 which means the differenced data still is non-stationary. How do I go about it?
