Steps followed when Binary logistic regression when both dependent and independent variables are binary

I had set of binary variables. To apply logistic regression, I have checked association between dependent and independent variables and considered only those independent variables in the model which came to be associated with dependent variable. My query is whether it is an appropriate way of fitting logistic regression model.
