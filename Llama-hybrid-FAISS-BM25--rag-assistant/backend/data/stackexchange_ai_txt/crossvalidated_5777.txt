Although a PCA applied on binary data would yield results comparable to those obtained from a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (factor scores and eigenvalues are linearly related), there are more appropriate techniques to deal with mixed data types, namely Multiple Factor Analysis for mixed data available in the FactoMineR R package ( FAMD() ). If your variables can be considered as structured subsets of descriptive attributes, then Multiple Factor Analysis ( MFA() ) is also an option. The challenge with categorical variables is to find a suitable way to represent distances between variable categories and individuals in the factorial space. To overcome this problem, you can look for a non-linear transformation of each variable--whether it be nominal, ordinal, polynomial, or numerical--with optimal scaling. This is well explained in Gifi Methods for Optimal Scaling in R: The Package homals , and an implementation is available in the corresponding R package homals .
