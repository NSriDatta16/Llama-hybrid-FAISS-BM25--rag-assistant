How do I launch files in C#

-Edit- I feel like an idiot. I had a feeling something like the answer below would work but didn't see any google results similar to the answers below. So when I saw this complex code I thought it had to be this way. I searched and found this Windows: List and Launch applications associated with an extension however it didn't answer my question. With tweaks below, I came up with the below. However, it gets stuck on image files. Txt files run fine I will update this code soon to account for app paths with spaces however I don't understand why image files don't launch. static void launchFile(string fn) { //majority was taken from //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24954/windows-list-and-launch-applications-associated-with-an-extension const string extPathTemplate = @"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\{0}"; const string cmdPathTemplate = @"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\{0}\shell\open\command"; string ext = Path.GetExtension(fn); var extPath = string.Format(extPathTemplate, ext); var docName = Registry.GetValue(extPath, string.Empty, string.Empty) as string; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(docName)) { // 2. Find out which command is associated with our extension var associatedCmdPath = string.Format(cmdPathTemplate, docName); var associatedCmd = Registry.GetValue(associatedCmdPath, string.Empty, string.Empty) as string; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(associatedCmd)) { //Console.WriteLine("\"{0}\" command is associated with {1} extension", associatedCmd, ext); var p = new Process(); p.StartInfo.FileName = associatedCmd.Split(' ')[0]; string s2 = associatedCmd.Substring(p.StartInfo.FileName.Length + 1); s2 = s2.Replace("%1", string.Format("\"{0}\"", fn)); p.StartInfo.Arguments = s2;//string.Format("\"{0}\"", fn); p.Start(); } } }
