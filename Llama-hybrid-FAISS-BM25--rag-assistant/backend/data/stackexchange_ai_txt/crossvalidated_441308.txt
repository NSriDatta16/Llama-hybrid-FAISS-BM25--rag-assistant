You are very close on the interpretations for the model without interactions. Starting with those, the only one you are a bit off on is the coefficient for weeksFromStart. You said: Respondents in the no use group reduced their opioids an average of -0.11 days for each extra week they were being treated. The weeks coefficient is telling you about the average opiod use decrease for each additional unit of weeks. It is not specifically for any group, it is a weighted average (more or less) across all three groups. This is because you are not interacting weeks with group in the first model. In a regression model without interactions, only the intercept is conditional on the other predictors being at a value of 0. On the other hand, in your second model you add these interactions, and the results you presented are: # Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value # (Intercept) 3.384412 0.3060578 1491 11.058080 0.000 # weeksFromStart -0.091329 0.0139118 1491 -6.564843 0.000 # atsFactorlow 4.672925 0.5950429 1491 7.853090 0.000 # atsFactorhigh 9.582114 1.3787037 1491 6.950089 0.000 # weeksFromStart:atsFactorlow -0.100171 0.0322840 1491 -3.102806 0.002 # weeksFromStart:atsFactorhigh -0.322239 0.0770086 1491 -4.184448 0.000 You are correct that asFactorlow is the mean difference between this category and the referent at weeks==0, and similarly for the asFactorhigh coefficient, which is the difference between this group and the referent at weeks==0. The interaction tells you how much opiod use decreases for asFactorlow (vs the referent) for each additional unit of weeks. Whereas the interaction for atsFactorhigh tells you how much opiod use decreases for each additional week for this group relative to the referent. I would suggest that you plot these results using the ggeffects() package and its ggpredict()%>%plot() function. These will allow you to see how the three groups are changing across weeks.
