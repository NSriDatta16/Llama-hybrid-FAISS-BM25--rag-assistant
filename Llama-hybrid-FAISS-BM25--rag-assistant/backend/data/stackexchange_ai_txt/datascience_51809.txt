How to create embeddedings for a column that is a list of categorical values

I am having some trouble deciding how to create embeddings for a categorical feature for my DNN model. The feature consists of a non fixed set of tags. The feature is like: column = [['Adventure','Animation','Comedy'], ['Adventure','Comedy'], ['Adventure','Children','Comedy'] I would like to do this with tensorflow so I know the tf.feature_column module should work, I just don't know which version to use. Thanks!
