How to escape , and & characters to html entities in Oracle PL/SQL

I need to send HTML emails directly from oracle PL/SQL package. This works almost fine. I have problem with the fact that some of the data fetched from a table contain things like , , and similar fragments, which sometimes ar treated as HTML tags, and even if not, they are always ignored and never displayed. So, I need to escape this column before inserting into email body. Is there a function to escape html special chars into entities automaticly? Or do I need to replace(' manually all the special characters?
