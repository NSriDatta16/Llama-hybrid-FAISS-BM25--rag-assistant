Your "decode HTML entities on INSERT and encode them on output" is your best bet, that'll take care of things like &quot; as well. You'd probably want to strip out HTML tags too along the way to keep MySQL from finding things in attribute values. If speed and formatting is an issue then you could stuff the text/plain version in a separate column and put your full text index on that and let everything else use the text/html version. Of course, you'd have to maintain both columns at the same time and your storage requirement would go up; OTOH, this approach would let you add tags, author names, and other extra bits of interesting data to the index without messing up your displayed text. In the mean time, did you rebuild your full text index after you added the ft_stopword_file to your config file? AFAIK, the stopwords are applied on the way into the index rather than while the index is consulted.
