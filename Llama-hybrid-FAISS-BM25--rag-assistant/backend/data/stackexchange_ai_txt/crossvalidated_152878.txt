is it by any chance a common practice, in some particular situations (when you are deseasonalizing a set of series), still deseasonalize a given series even if that series does not show significant seasonality? I don't see any reason to apply a seasonal adjustment procedure to a time series where seasonality cannot be identified. The common practice is to check for the presence of seasonality (by means of statistical tests, graphics) and then estimate and remove a seasonal component only for those series where seasonality is identifiable. Forcing to remove a seasonal component that is not present may distort the autocorrelation structure of the original series. why I can reject the null hypothesis for the whole set of seasonal dummies being zero. As mentioned in my comment above, it seems that you are testing for the significance of 17 variables (11 seasonal dummies plus other dummy variables, yearly dummies). It may be the latter set of variables what may lead to reject the null of zero coefficients for the whole set of 17 dummies.
