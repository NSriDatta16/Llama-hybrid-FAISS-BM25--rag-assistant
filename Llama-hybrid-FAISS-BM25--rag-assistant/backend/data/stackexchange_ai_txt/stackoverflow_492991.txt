Back to those days where RAM was not free, most computers were very limited and "NOT ENOUGH MEMORY !" was a pretty common error message... Well, most application were then able to crash with 'elegance' : users (almost) never lost their works. (Almost, I said ! ^^). How was it done ? Very simple : when you app starts, allocate a balloon of RAM (say, a whopping 20 KB!). Then, when a call to malloc() fails : Say kindly that there is "NOT ENOUGH MEMORY" (this message was mandatory). Add "And you better save all your work. Now!" Release the whopping 20 KB balloon of RAM. Resume. Et voil√†. Your app is crashing slowly at the user, most of the time, can save it's work.
