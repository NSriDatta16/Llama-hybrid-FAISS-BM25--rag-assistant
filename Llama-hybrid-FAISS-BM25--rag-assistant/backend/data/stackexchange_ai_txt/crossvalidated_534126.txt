I am wondering whether I can conclude that: anti-collusion laws, in general, have a weak but consistent negative impact on $Y$ ceteris paribus, on average in this situation? The conclusion more or less aligns with your results. In all but one specification (i.e., unadjusted DiD estimate) the coefficient on the main policy variable $pt_{kt}$ is negative—and consistently so. Columns (2) – (4) suggest, to some degree, a weak, negative influence of anti-collusion laws on $y_{it}$ . The policy influence is stronger once you adjust for the region-by-year effects in column (5). Results from column (6) also suggest a significant, negative policy effect, though this is at the expense of discarding all the U.S. firms. Synthesizing the policy influence as weak yet consistently negative may veil the effects under alternative specifications. I would argue that your point estimates are more consistent across specifications than they are weak . Again, the term "weak impact" may only suffice for columns (2) – (4), though less so for column (2). In short, a more elaborate explanation may be required if you want to summarize your findings across the six specifications. And, as always, if the $t$ values are in parentheses, then say so.
