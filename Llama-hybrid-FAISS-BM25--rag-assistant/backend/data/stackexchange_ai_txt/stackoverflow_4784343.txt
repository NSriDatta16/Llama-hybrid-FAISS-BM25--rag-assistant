You mean an additional view, not the main controller view? In that case you can declare a property for the view and load the NIB by hand: @interface Controller {} @property(retain) IBOutlet UIView *extraView; @end â€¦ - (void) viewDidLoad // or anywhere else { [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"extras" owner:self options:nil]; NSAssert(extraView != nil, @"The extra view failed to load."); [[self view] addSubview:extraView]; } This assumes that you set the Controller as the file owner in the Interface Builder and you link the view to the extraView outlet. Also note that there might be more elegant solutions, like inserting the extra view into the main NIB for your controller; depends on the situation.
