Assuming that there is a very good reason to have one controller accept this action (if there is shared code... move it to a helper method or model, and use the user agent info or named routes to your advantage), check the parameter and redirect to the appropriate controller and action: def some_action # some shared code here if params[:platform] == 'iphone' redirect_to :controller => 'foo', :action => 'bar' elsif params[:platform] == 'web' redirect_to :controller => 'baz', :action => 'baq' else # default controller and action here end end If you really really want the named route to map to different controllers, you'll need to hardcode the platform string: map.connect '/foo/bars/:id/iphone', :controller => 'iphone',:action=>'some_action' map.connect '/foo/bars/:id/web', :controller => 'web',:action=>'some_action' UPDATE0 From here , you might want to try map.with_options(:conditions => ... )
