What is behind this question is my need to associate a unique address with each UITouch instance for each tap. I've been NSLog-ing in touchesBegan:withEvent: for a while now and I've come to the suprising realization that UITouch instances appear to be recycled over and over again (ie, the same pointer address appears in distinct touch sequences!) rather then create anew each time a touch sequence is initiated. My goal is a single unique UITouch instance address with a tapCount = 1.
