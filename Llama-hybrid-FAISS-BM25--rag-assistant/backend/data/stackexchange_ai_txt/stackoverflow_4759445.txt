In my experience, almost never. (For a "speed matters, I'm just inserting and don't really care about retrieval at this point" style of application, perhaps.) Whilst you might conceivably never use the ID field, it's nearly always wise to have one happily AUTO_INCREMENTing away, because one day you might need one. (You could of course simply do an 'ALTER..' to add one, but that's besides the point.)
