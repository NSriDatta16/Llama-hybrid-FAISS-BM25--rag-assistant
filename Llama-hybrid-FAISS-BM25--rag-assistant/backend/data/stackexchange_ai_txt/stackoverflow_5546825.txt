searching with a name in database for a person - MySQL

In my table I store first name in the fName column and last name in the lName column, now I need to search them with a query, but I don't know the SQL! example lName | fName ----------------- Tendulkar| Sachin Ganguly | Sourav Khan | Zaheer Dhoni | Mahendra Singh The user should get MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI if he searches for Mahendra Dhoni!
