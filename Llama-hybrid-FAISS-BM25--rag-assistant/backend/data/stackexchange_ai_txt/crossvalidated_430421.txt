The excellent answer by knrumsey gives some history on the progression of important academic work in MCMC. One other aspect worth examining is the development of software to facilitate MCMC by the ordinary user. Statistical methods are often used mostly by specialists until they are implemented in software that allows the ordinary user to implement them without programming. For example, the software BUGS had its first release in 1997. That does not appear to have changed the growth trajectory in the N-Grams plot, but it may have been an influence in bringing the method into common usage among those users who found it intimidating to program their own routines.
