It's much easier to extract the information from the XML version of the website. If you make a request to a URL like this (Only with a valid character name) then you get back an XML document that you can use an XML parser to easily extract the data. http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Nordrassil&cn=Someone The URLs are the same as the ones you see in your web browser. Please note though that you MUST set the User Agent field of the request to be that of a supported browser that supports the XML version of the file or you get back HTML instead. I use "Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/2.0.0.1" as the user agent in my program and it works fine. Oh, also don't make more than a few requests in second, or an average of more than one request every 3 or 4 seconds or the site blocks your IP for a few hours ...
