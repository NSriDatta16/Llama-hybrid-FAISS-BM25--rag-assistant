In your dataset, the input is a sequence(time series), and Recurrent Neural Networks are the best choice for these kinds of the classification problem. Here is a good blog post on implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks using keras library(high level API for tensorflow and theano): http://machinelearningmastery.com/understanding-stateful-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/
