Found the answer to this issue. It wasn't an issue with NHibernateUtil.Initialize as I originally thought. It was related to our HasMany mapping in FluentNHibernate requiring a "Where" condition, exactly like we have for each table. After adding the "Where" condition, any call to load proxies resulting in the correct data retrieval.
