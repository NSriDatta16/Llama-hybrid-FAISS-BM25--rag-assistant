Poster with the 8 phases of translation in the C language

Does anyone have a reference to a poster/one-page pdf or something similar with a list of the eight phases of translation for the C language (the first one being trigraph translation)? I want to have one printed hanging on my wall next to my pc. Update: Sorry for forgetting to specify. I am interested in C90 (although C99 probably is pretty close, _Pragma as mentioned in pmg's answer is C99 specific and I would like to avoid that).
