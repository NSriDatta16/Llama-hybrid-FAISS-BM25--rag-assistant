Consider the number of things that could affect data transfer speed: The speed of the bus used to connect the device to the system. This is unlikely to be your bounding factor unless it's connected via USB1. For hard drives, rotational speed and seek time matter. 7200 RPM drives will read and write blocks of data faster than 5400 RPM drives. Optical and magnetic drives usually spin down when not in use, so the first access will take orders of magnitude more than the second access. The filesystem used on the particular device. Caching of data and filesystem metadata. The less metadata is cached, the more a magnetic or optical drive has to seek to figure out where the data is. Data access pattern. Accessing a small number of large, contiguous files is almost always faster than accessing a large number of small files scattered around the disk. File system fragmentation You might be able to work up some heuristics based on the various characteristics of the devices you expect to see, but in general there's no good way to figure out transfer speed for a particular combination of bus, media, filesystem, and data access pattern without actually measuring it. If you decide to measure, try to simulate your final access pattern as closely as possible.
