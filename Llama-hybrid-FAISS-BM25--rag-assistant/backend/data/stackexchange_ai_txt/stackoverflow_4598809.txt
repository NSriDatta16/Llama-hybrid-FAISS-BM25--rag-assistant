I think the best approach is to take a look at the physical differences when your user agent is a mobile device such as the iPhone. Typically an iPhone would be operating on a mobile network which would be considerably slower than the average internet connection your average computer would be connected to. This is the only real difference, there may be some subtle difference in the way the different networks operate meaning that separate requests could take longer on a mobile network, but that would be just speculation. Any processing on the device itself would surely be trival, so in my opinion I recommend what I recommend for websites designed for regular user agents. Develop with multiple style sheets and then use a tool to minify everything into a single compressed file (separate when necessary, conditional IE etc.).
