Thank you to the two people who answered, gave me things to think about when doing additional research. Since there was no definite answer on this question, perhaps I was not clear, and after looking into the subject from other sources. I decided to post what I had discovered. Looking at the most basic WCF service, one that has one method, returns a string. No other methods in place. Got the errors while adding the reference. JSR-172 does not understand guids (the idea of the message not the actual message). Same thing for char and duration. I read about it further and found references on microsoft non standard wsdl files, and that by implementing some interfaces you could remove all non standard schema references from the generated wsdl file. This helped for a simple service not a complex one. I tried an existing service, I decided to use the amazon.com affiliate services to test things. Similar error as with my wcf service, it gave a whole list of types it did not like. In the end I learned. Visual studio spoils you and makes you lazy(not always a bad thing). I wanted a way to use some sort of wizard type tool, input a reference and get lots of generated code that calls my service, gives my objects to deal with and methods to call. Netbeans did this for me for J2SE not for j2me. If you want to use WCF directly for a j2me project, be ready to write all the plumbing code for it. Alternatively you can use the suggested method of using j2ee proxy. As explained in http://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/mobility/mobile-dilbert.html With this method you still need to be careful what data types you use. As some cause the service to fail or be unusable. Example, i had a method return a datetime, netbeans would not even let me select that method for stub generation. and calling methods in the service with that one present caused exceptions to be thrown. (method removed and calls succeeded)
