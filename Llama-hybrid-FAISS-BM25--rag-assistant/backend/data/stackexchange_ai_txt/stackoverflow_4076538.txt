original derived from Oracle's specs: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.2.1/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html getServletPath public java.lang.String getServletPath() Returns the part of this request's URL that calls the servlet. This includes either the servlet name or a path to the servlet, but does not include any extra path information or a query string. Same as the value of the CGI variable SCRIPT_NAME. getContextPath public java.lang.String getContextPath() Returns the portion of the request URI that indicates the context of the request. The context path always comes first in a request URI. The path starts with a "/" character but does not end with a "/" character. For servlets in the default (root) context, this method returns "". Returns: a String specifying the portion of the request URI that indicates the context of the request I think that the spec is descriptive enough. Regards.
