A single human may never see this, but I'd still like to give my input as someone who has found themselves engrossed in both finance and computer science. I will never say a neural network won't be successful in equity trading, but you need to think at the differences between how a human trades stocks and how a neural network will trade stocks. The average trader subconsciously takes into account hundreds of factors when making a simple buy, hold, sell decision. Recent news Recent earning/financials Economic indicators (interest rates, loan delinquencies, politics) Industry competitors So on and so on, and I'm sure over half of people trading stocks don't beat the benchmarks. A neural network will really struggle to make a better decision than a human due to lack of inputs. Looking at someones face and saying "Oh that's Bobby John" is a lot easier than making and investment decision, and some networks struggle to pick out faces. Possibly 40+ 150 IQ nerds from Cal Tech at Renaissance Technology or DE Shaw & Co have figured out how to make neural networks trade stocks, but I wouldn't waste my time. Stick to getting programs to pick out basic trends or scrap financial data of of EDGAR.
