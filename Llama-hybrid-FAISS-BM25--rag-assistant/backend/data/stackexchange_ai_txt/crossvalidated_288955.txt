Validation set and test set size. Significant change in samples

There's a deep learning course on Udacity made by Google Brain. One of the course's videos talks about validation and test sets size. That video explains that a change in 30 samples is usually significant, but no demonstration is provided. I want to know why they say that a change in 30 samples is significant and where this statement comes from.
