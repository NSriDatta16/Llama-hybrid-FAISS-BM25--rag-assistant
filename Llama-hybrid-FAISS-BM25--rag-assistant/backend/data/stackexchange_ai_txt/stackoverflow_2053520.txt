Well, there's nothing as elegant as "find" but you can use a list comprehension: matches = [x for x in thelist if x["color"] == "red" and x["time"] != 2] if len(matches): m = matches[0] # do something with m However, I find the [0] and len() tedious. I often use a for loop with an array slice, such as: matches = [x for x in thelist if x["color"] == "red" and x["time"] != 2] for m in matches[:1]: # do something with m
