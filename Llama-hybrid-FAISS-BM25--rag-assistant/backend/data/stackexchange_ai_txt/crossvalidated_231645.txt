Confidence interval is an estimate of an interval in which mean of observations will fall when x=xi In its formula $$ 1/n + \frac{(x-\bar x)^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2} $$ Tends to 0. Prediction interval is an estimate of an interval in which future individual observations will fall when x=xi In its formula $$ 1 + 1/n + \frac{(x-\bar x)^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2} $$ tends to 1 That means that the confidence interval for the mean of the outcomes at xi gets smaller as sample size grows. (as Central limit Theorem would suggest) which means that by increase of the sample size our estimate for the average (mean) outcome for xi gets better. $$ \lim_{n->infinity}{CI = \hat y}$$ But the dispersion of the distribution of y|xi "the probability of an individual outcome" at xi, Doesn't change very much because central limit theorem is related to central tendencies not to individual behavior or outcomes. Therefore the prediction interval doesn't change very much. $$ \lim_{n->infinity}{PI = \hat y \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \sqrt{MSE}}$$ Individual behavior remains uncertain no matter how much you increase your sample size ;)
