How to enumerate the hypothesis search space in case of discrete valued input vector and binary label?

Some definitions used by the author in the example below: X - It is a set of training examples, where each example is a feature vector with 6 features/attributes(Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water and Forecast) H - set of all possible hypotheses that estimate the target function f:X->y. EnjoySport is the output label which is either Yes or No. Consider, for example, the instances X and hypotheses H in the EnjoySport learning task. Given that the attribute Sky has three possible values, and that AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast each have two possible values, the instance space X contains exactly 3.2.2.2.2.2 = 96 distinct instances. A similar calculation shows that there are 5.4.4.4.4.4 = 5120 syntactically distinct hypotheses within H. Notice, however, that every hypothesis containing one or more " $\phi$ " symbols represents the empty set of instances; that is, it classifies every instance as negative. Therefore, the number of semantically distinct hypotheses is only 1 + (4.3.3.3.3.3) = 973. This excerpt is taken from Machine learning by Tom M. Mitchell. Ch-2, pg-23,24 I was unable to understand why 5 is there instead of 6 and also I am unable to follow semantically distinct hypotheses.
