SQL Server - Give a Login Permission for Read Access to All Existing and Future Databases

I have a stored procedure that finds all the existing databases and reads from a table in each one. Is there a way I can give a login read access to all databases, and to all future databases i.e., I won't have to do anything when a new database is added? Is there a server role that would work? Is there a way to make a SQL agent job add the permissions on any new databases? Or is there some other method?
