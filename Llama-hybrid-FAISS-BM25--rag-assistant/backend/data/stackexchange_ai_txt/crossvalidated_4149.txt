If the software computes the sum of squared errors in optimization (and most will), then you can run into trouble with very large numbers or very small numbers because of how floating point numbers are stored. The same applies to any statistical modelling, not just time series analysis. One way to avoid the problem is to scale the data before running the model, and then re-scale the results. For most time series models, including all linear models, that will work. Some nonlinear models won't scale however. When I'm analysing data I will often scale the data myself, not just to prevent possible optimization problems but also to make graphs and tables easier to read.
