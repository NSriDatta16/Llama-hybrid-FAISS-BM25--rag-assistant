When does a library deserve the be called "Linq-something" or "something-Linq"?

I just looked at one of those libraries that is of the naming schema "something-Linq" expecting to gain some more knowledge on how to construct expression trees in an elegant way - and was disappointed. Because all I could find were methods that extended IEnumerable - of course with "normal" C# code. Now I have this question: Do non-expression extensions for IEnumerable really justify the name of the library to have "Linq" in it? Or is the author just jumping on a hype trying to get more downloads for his IEnumerable extension library and I was right in expecting IQueryable and expressions when seeing "Linq" in the name of the library? Edit: I would argue that there is a difference between Linq-to-... and something-Linq libraries. IMHO Linq-to-... are linq provider libraries, something-Linq are linq extensions. I think Linq provider libraries may choose if they expose IQueryable or IEnumerable in their results - linq extensions do not have that choice. As far as I am concerned they must be able to work with both kinds of provider libraries. That means for me that all linq extensions must provide both Queryable and Enumerable extensions. Edit 2: A very lively discussion took place between Jon and me in the comments of his answer. I volunteered to create a blogpost to hopefully clarify things: Mapping the uncharted waters of LINQ Edit 3: For anybody who is interested in the discussion - I really encourage you to go to my blog post. Skip the post itself because it is horrible - and go straight to the discussion and explanations by Jon.
