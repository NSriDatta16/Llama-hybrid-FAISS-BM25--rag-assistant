Why am I not getting the exception I expect in Zend Feed when a feed is misentered?

Basically, we have this here module that we offer to our users that want to include a feed from elsewhere on their pages. I works great, no sweat. The problem is that whenever users mishandle the feed link on their hands we have to manually remove the module from existence because Zend Feed crashes and burns the entire page just like any fatal error. Normally, one would expect that a code block such as.. try { // Test piece straight off the Zend tutorial $slashdotRss = Zend_Feed::import('http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot'); } catch (Zend_Feed_Exception $e) { // feed import failed echo "Exception caught importing feed: {$e->getMessage()}\n"; exit; } .. would BEHAVE if I were to enter 'httn://rss.grrllarrrlll.aarrg/Slashdot/slashdot' and say something along the lines of "404" or "What the shit". No. It dies. It crashes and dies. It crashes and burns and dies, completely ignoring all that happy trycatch methology right there. So basically, do we have to write our on feedfetch or is there any simple remedy to Zend's slip? Added log: exception 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Exception' with message 'Unable to Connect to tcp://www.barglllrragglll:80. Error #10946: ' in /library/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php:148 #0 /library/Zend/Http/Client.php(827): Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Socket->connect('www.barglllrragglll...', 80, false) #1 /library/Zend/Feed.php(284): Zend_Http_Client->request() ...... Trace etc ....
