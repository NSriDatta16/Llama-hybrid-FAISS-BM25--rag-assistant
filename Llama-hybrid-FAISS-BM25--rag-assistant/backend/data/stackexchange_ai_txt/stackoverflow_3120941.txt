How do I send an email from a non-gmail account using the appengine

I have successfully sent an email using the Google App Engine. However the only email address I can get to work is the gmail address I have listed as the admin of the site. I'm running the app on my own domain (bought and maintained using Google Apps). I would like to send the email from my own domain. Here's the code (or something similar to it): from google.appengine.api import mail sender = "myaddress@google.com" sender_i_want = "myaddress@mygoogleapp.com" mail.send_mail(sender=sender, to="Albert Johnson ", subject="Your account has been approved", body=some_string_variable) And the error I get when I try to send it from my own domain is "InvalidSenderError: Unauthorized sender". I own the domain, I do in fact authorize using my domain to send the mail, I just need to know how to convince the App Engine that this is true.
