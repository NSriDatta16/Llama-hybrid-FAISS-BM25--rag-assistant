How do I weigh values by their relative frequency and then get an average?

Suppose I have three values that were measured repeatedly in a study. The conditions imply that the values should be close to each other, i.e. ideally three times the same value. The measured values are: 20, 21 and 1. One can assume that 0.5 is not representative of the real value, but one doesn't know for sure. So one would like to have some statistical foundation to choose a likely value, i.e. representative of the real world. What I have in mind is to give 20 and 21 more weight, since the distance to each other is smaller than between 21 and 1 or 20 and 1. Why? Because it is not so likely to measure two values that close if they weren't representative. Some VAGUE idea is to do (20 + 20 + 21 + 21 + 1)/5. But I'm looking, if there is, for something more sophisticated. Is there such a thing and if yes, what do I have to compute?'
