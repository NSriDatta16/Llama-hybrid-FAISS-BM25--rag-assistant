Probability that any element of a random unit-length vector is large

Given a vector $X \in R^n = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ drawn uniformly such that: $x_i \in [0, 1]$ for all $i$ ; and $\sum x_i = 1$ , how would you find the probability that any of the $x_i > y$ , for some $y \in [0, 1]$ ? Where I've gotten: The problem should be symmetric w.r.t. the $x$ s, so the result should be equivalent to $n $ x $P(x_0 > y)$ . We can consider a process of dividing up the total interval [0, 1] into chunks. First, you choose an order to assign values to the $x$ s. For example, we could say $x_4 = 0.3, x_9 = 0.1...$ In this view, $P(x_0 > y)$ = $P(x_0 > y| x_0 \text{ is chosen first})P(x_0 \text{ is chosen first}) + P(x_0 > y| x_0 \text{ is chosen second})P(x_0 \text{ is chosen second})$ ... This quickly becomes a nasty recursive problem, and I'm curious if there is already an elegant solution for it, or at least a well-documented one.
