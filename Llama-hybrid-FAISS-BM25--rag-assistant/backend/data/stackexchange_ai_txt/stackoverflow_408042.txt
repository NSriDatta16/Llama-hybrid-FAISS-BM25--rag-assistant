Vector graphics in iText PDF

We use iText to generate PDFs from Java (based partly on recommendations on this site). However, embedding a copy of our logo in an image format like GIF results in it looking a bit strange as people zoom in and out. Ideally we'd like to embed the image in a vector format, such as EPS, SVG or just a PDF template. The website claims that EPS support has been dropped, that embedding a PDF or PS within a PDF can result in errors, and it doesn't even mention SVG. Our code uses the Graphics2D API rather than iText directly, but we'd be willing to break out of AWT mode and use iText itself if it achieved the result. How can this be done?
