regarding your method: It may work, but it feels that just averaging the 3 values for the 108 days, can mess up the knowledge you have in your data. Say you have some clear trend for 108 days with full data, using average you will lose the knowledge about these trend. Maybe extract the ratio for every day of the 108 days, and then treat it as time series data. try predicting the ratio, which is reasonable in such cases, because the number of positives may depend on the number of total tests, where the last my depend on the day of the week. so try to predict the ration and then calculating the absolute numbers.
