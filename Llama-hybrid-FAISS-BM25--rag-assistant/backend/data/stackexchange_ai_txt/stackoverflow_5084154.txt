If you multiply 2 short integers, the result requires a long integer or the result can overflow. e.g. 1000 * 1000 = 1000000 , which is too big for a 16-bit short integer. So you need to perform a scaling operation (divide or right shift) before you convert the multiplication result to a short value for storage. Something like: result_short = (short)( ( short_op_1 * short_op_2 ) >> 16 );
