Second touch after UILongPressGestureRecognizer has began

I'm using UILongPressGestureRecognizer and when I use one finger it works properly. When I lay down a second finger this is not captured by the recognizer, the delegate keeps being called but only with the first touch, [recognizer numberOfTouches] is always 1. If I set [recognizer setNumberOfTouchesRequired:2] it also works properly, I get [recognizer numberOfTouches] = 2 when I lay 2 fingers down simultaneouly. My conclusion is: after a UILongPressGesture is recognized and began, a second touch won't change it. Is this the expected behaviour?
