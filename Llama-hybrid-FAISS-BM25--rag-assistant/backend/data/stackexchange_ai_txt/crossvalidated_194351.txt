How to consistently distribute numbers on polyhedral dice to ensure maximal fairness?

There are several regular solids made into dice (d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d30). You have to number each face starting at 1. Given the imperfect nature of dice manufacture, you want to distribute the low numbers and high numbers on opposing faces to ensure that rolls will converge to the perfect average over time in case that the weight is not uniform throughout the solid. Is there a consistent ordering that will ensure the fairest dice? Looking at the icosahedron (d20), I'm wondering if each quintent of adjacent faces (there are 12 of them--one for each vertex) could be made to add up to the same number as a good heuristic to solve this problem. Any thoughts? [Edit: whuber pointed out that the above suggestion isn't possible. Perhaps there is another method of numbering?]
