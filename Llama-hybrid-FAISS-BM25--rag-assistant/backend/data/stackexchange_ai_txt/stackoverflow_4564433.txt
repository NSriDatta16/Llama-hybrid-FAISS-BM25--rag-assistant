In C++0x, the Align template parameter of std::aligned_storage has a default argument of "default-alignment," which is defined as (N3225 ยง20.7.6.6 Table 56): The value of default-alignment shall be the most stringent alignment requirement for any C++ object type whose size is no greater than Len . It isn't clear whether SSE types would be considered "C++ object types." The default argument wasn't part of the TR1 aligned_storage ; it was added for C++0x.
