This is kind of an open-ended question, but the short answer is that Delphi 2009 is stable, fast, and a leap forward from older versions (especially 2005). The IDE has evolved a bit since Delphi 7 and has more Visual Studio and Eclipse-like features. It also has some updated controls that make building the more 'modern' Windows applications easier, like the Ribbon you see in Office. I find the response time in drag and drop operations to be a lot quicker than previous versions, and overall the reaction time in IDE operations just seem a lot snappier. So far the IDE hasn't crashed on me at all, but I'm admittedly not a heavy day-to-day user. I mainly use Delphi 2009 for a side project I work on in my own time.
