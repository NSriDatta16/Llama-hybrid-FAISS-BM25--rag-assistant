In systematic reviews and meta-analysis, standard routines summarize results in terms of sample mean and standard deviation. Several trials report the median with minimum/maximum or the inter quartile range. A practical and sound approach is to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials. In this paper of Wang and colleagues are reported formulas to implement such approach. The paper has been cited about 500 times according to Google Scholar and I have applied such approach. Furthermore it would be interesting to see the cost benefit ratio of having more imprecisioni with more power. The median is very similar to the mean when the distribution of the data is symmetrical, and so occasionally can be used directly in meta-analyses. However, means and medians can be very different from each other if the data are skewed, and medians are often reported because the data are skewed (see Chapter 9, Section 9.4.5.3). The Cochrane handbook does not encourage the meta_analysis of medians and interquartile ranges, except when sample sizes are large and the distribution of the outcome is similar to the normal distribution, which can be roughly tested by checking if the width of the interquartile range is approximately 1.35 standard deviations. The Cochrane handbook pointed out that the "use of interquartile ranges rather than standard deviations can often be taken as an indicator that the outcomes distribution is skewed".
