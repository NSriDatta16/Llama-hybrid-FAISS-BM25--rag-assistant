Decision boundary of logistic Regression and Hypothesis space in R

I am trying to generate a decision boundary of logistic regression . My Training set is 2/3 and the test set is 1/3, I have however tried producing the decision boundary but not sure whether is it the desired behavior or not. I am using the caret library for the logistic model and the lattice library for the plot. here is my approach: #Data creation library(mvtnorm) a1 My decision boundary As you can observe it has not got any clear separation of two classes which I'm highly uncertain of. Also, I have learned that the hypothesis space is represented as a set of the conjunction of constraints but I cannot visualize this in R. Is it the decision boundary per se or there are different plots/visualizations to represent it?
