This was simply a choice the VB team made when adding the regions feature into version 7 of the Visual Basic language. It was seen as a feature which was useful for organizing at a declaration level and not inside a method and hence was allowed only at that level. The C# team felt differently about this feature and allow it in many other places. I've always found it surprising that C# #region directives can occur in different declaration contexts. #region Foo class Bar { #endregion } The equivalent code is not allowed in VB.
