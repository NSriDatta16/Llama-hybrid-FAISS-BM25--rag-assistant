Find collection containing the average of several collections with LINQ

Simple (not for me yet I guess) LINQ: I have a List of arrays, and I want to get a collection containing the average of each column. Something like: var myCollection = new List (); myCollection.Add(new []{1,2,3,4,5}); myCollection.Add(new []{3,4,5,6,7}); // Your answer --> {2,3,4,5,6}
