Help with converting Hex to booleans?

I am new at Java. I am learning. I am trying to do the following: convert a hexadecimal string into a binary, then process the binary into a series of booleans. public static void getStatus() { /* * CHECKTOKEN is a 4 bit hexadecimal * String Value in FF format. * It needs to go into binary format */ //LINETOKEN.nextToken = 55 so CHECKTOKEN = 55 CHECKTOKEN = LINETOKEN.nextToken(); //convert to Integer (lose any leading 0s) int binaryToken = Integer.parseInt(CHECKTOKEN,16); //convert to binary string so 55 becomes 85 becomes 1010101 //should be 01010101 String binaryValue = Integer.toBinaryString(binaryToken); //Calculate the number of required leading 0's int leading0s = 8 - binaryValue.length(); //add leading 0s as needed while (leading0s != 0) { binaryValue = "0" + binaryValue; leading0s = leading0s - 1; } //so now I have a properly formatted hex to binary //binaryValue = 01010101 System.out.println("Indicator" + binaryValue); /* * how to get the value of the least * signigicant digit into a boolean * variable... and the next? */ } I think there must be a better way to perform the action. This is not elegant. Also, I'm stuck with a binary string value which needs to be processed somehow.
