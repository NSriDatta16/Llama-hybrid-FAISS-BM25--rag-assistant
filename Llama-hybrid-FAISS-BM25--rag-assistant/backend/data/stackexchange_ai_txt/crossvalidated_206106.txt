To visualize the model , rather than the data, JMP uses an interactive "profiler" plot. Here's a static view. And here's a link to a dynamic view . It's similar to your scatter plot idea and can be combined with it. The idea is that each frame shows a slice of the model for the corresponding X and Y variables with the other X variables held constant at their indicated values. In the interactive version, the X values can be changed by dragging the red vertical lines. Disclosure: I'm a JMP developer, so don't take this as an unbiased endorsement.
