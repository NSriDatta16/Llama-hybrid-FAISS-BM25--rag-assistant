You can look at the Wikipedia article on confidence intervals for binomial proportions. About half a dozen methods are in common use. In elementary US statistics books the 95% Wald interval (based on a limiting argument) was used for some years before it was shown to have poor coverage probability for small $n$ (and also to give interval endpoints outside $(0,1)$ for very small or very large observed proportions $\hat p = x/n).$ For 1 success in 10 trials the 95% Wald interval is $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}},$ which computes to $(-0.086, 0.286)$ and would usually get truncated to $(0, 0.286),$ perhaps with a footnote. [Computation in R.] n = 10; x = 1; hat.p = x/n hat.p + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(hat.p*(1-hat.p)/n) [1] -0.08593851 0.28593851 One kind of interval is easy compute if you have access to computation of quantiles of beta distributions. For this interval, one uses quantiles 0.025 and 0.975 of $\mathsf{Beta}(x+.5, n-x+.5).$ This is called a 95% Jeffreys CI because it is derived by a Bayesian argument from a noninformative Jeffreys prior distribution. Because beta distributions have support $(0,1),$ endpoints of these intervals are always between $0$ and $1.$ For my example above, the 95% Jeffreys confidence interval is $(0.011, 0.381).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 1.5, 9.5) [1] 0.01101167 0.38131477 Notes: (1) Some of the types of CIs mentioned in the Wikipedia article are tedious to compute or not widely implemented in statistical software. One easily computed improvement on the Wald interval, mentioned there is due to Agresti and Coull, although it can also occasionally give endpoints outside of $(0,1),$ as below: n = 10; x = 1; hat.p = (x+2)/(n+4) hat.p + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(hat.p*(1-hat.p)/(n+4)) [1] -0.0006521887 0.4292236173 (2) Reference 4 (by Brown et al.) in the Wikipedia article has an accessible discussion of coverage probabilities of various styles of binomial confidence intervals.
