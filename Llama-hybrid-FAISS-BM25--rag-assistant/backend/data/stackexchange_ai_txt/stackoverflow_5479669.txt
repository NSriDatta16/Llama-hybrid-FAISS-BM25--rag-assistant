Local storage of REST/JSON web service results in Android SQLite DB

I'm developing my first android application which is basically a task manager in a professional context. My data comes from a central server and the user can only modify the progression rate and the number of hours he worked on a particular task. He can also search by task name/date/project/client... I'm wondering if i need to store the tasks that i get from the server in a local database ? Would the application be too slow if i get the tasks at each session,put them all in a list then preform my operations on that list ? Thanks in advance.
