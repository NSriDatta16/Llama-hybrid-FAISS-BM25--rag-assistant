For most algorithms there is an "average case" and a "worst case". If your data routinely falls into the "worst case" scenario, it is possible that another algorithm, while theoretically less efficient in the average case, might prove more efficient for your data. Some algorithms also have best cases that your data can take advantage of. For example, some sorting algorithms have a terrible theoretical efficiency, but are actually very fast if the data is already sorted (or nearly so). Another algorithm, while theoretically faster in the general case, may not take advantage of the fact that the data is already sorted and in practice perform worse. For very small data sets sometimes an algorithm that has a better theoretical efficiency may actually be less efficient because of a large "k" value.
