How to use svm for a large dataset to predict

I am using svm method for prediction of wind power using windspeed. I have a large historical dataset containing timestamp, wind speed and wind power of size 6.74MB. it is a one year data at each 5 min interval . I am able to build one svm model in R Studio using 6 months data but it takes time to execute and if I try to use whole year data then program gets hanged. . Is large size of data is the reason for delay in execution? I am thinking now to make 3 or 4 svm model to cover whole year data so that all trends in windspeed get capture in resulting model . But the question is can we add performance of two or more svm models to get resulting one model. Please guide me , how can I get the resulting model with less execution time? The Feature is wind speed and the there are 105121 data points. The code is given below and i have ran it once only. sampledata index After running this code i am not getting any error . only the thing is if i take whole year data(6.74mb) in testdata file program gets hanged
