What is the minimum/suggested sequence length for training an LSTM?

I want to train an LSTM but my sequences' length are on average around 4/5 time steps. What are the suggested sequence length? May 4/5 time steps be enough? P.S. could you please post some link to scientific articles to endorse your claims?
