Why don't we increase the parameter from 64 to 128 in this CNN model?

I'm looking at an example lab from a coursera course titled Intro to Tensorflow. In this CNN model, they're gradually increasing the no. of filters from 16 to 32 and then 64. Why don't we increase it to 128 and more? I'm curious why the last three conv2D layers are all 64 and if these are redundant in terms of the model's performance. Thanks!
