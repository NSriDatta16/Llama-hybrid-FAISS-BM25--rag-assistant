regex for php to find all self-closing tags

I've got a system that uses a DomDocumentFragment which is created based on markup from a database or another area of the system (i.e. other XHTML code). One such tag that may be included is: Before the string is added to the DomDocumentFragment, the content is correct - the class is closing correctly. However, the DomDocumentFragment transforms this into: This does not display correctly in browsers due to the incorrect closing of the tag. So my thought is to post-process the XML string that the DomDocument returns me (that includes the incorrect div structure, as shown above), and transform self-closing tags back to their correct structure... i.e. turn back to . But I'm having trouble with the pattern for preg_match to find these tags - I've seen some patterns that return all tags (i.e. find all tags), but not just those that are self closing. I've tried something along the lines of this, but my head gets a little confused with regex (and I start over-complicating things) / / The aim is for a pattern to match , where the "...." could be any valid XHTML attributes. Any suggestions or pointers to put me back on track?
