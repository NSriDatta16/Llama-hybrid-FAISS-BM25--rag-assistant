What is the best way to organise e-mails in MS Outlook?

Every software development professional (and especially project managers) has to deal with a never ending stream of e-mails. What is the best way of organising them in MS Outlook? Obviously some fancy issue tracking tools give more flexibility but I am interested in plain vanilla approach that can be deployed within most organisations. P.S. Finding e-mails is generally the least of the problems that needs to be addressed. Search nowdays is pretty good.
