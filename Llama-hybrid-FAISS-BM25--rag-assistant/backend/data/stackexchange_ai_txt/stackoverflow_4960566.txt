Flex Application running - The requested resource (/{Main mxml file name}.html) is not available

I have a problem with running flex application and I'm not sure what the source of problem is. Here is the case: Everytime that I clean eclipse project and restart Apcahe Tomcat server and run the application main MXML I got the following error "The requested resource (/{Main mxml file name}.html) is not available." To solve this everytime I should create a new MXML application,restart the server and then everything is fine.Does anyone have a suggestion how to solve this annoying issue??? :-(
