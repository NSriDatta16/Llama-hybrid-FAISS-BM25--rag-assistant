Get index of Enumerator.Current in C#

Possible Duplicate: (C#) Get index of current foreach iteration Good morning, Is there any way I can get the index of an Enumerator 's current element (in the case, a character in a string) without using an ancillary variable? I know this would perhaps be easier if I used a while or for cicle, but looping through a string using an enumerator is more elegant... The only drawback for the case is that I really need to get each character's current index. Thank you very much.
