[Extent3] is a realization of Include(Category) and Include should not impact on result of selection from "main" table Product, so LEFT JOIN (all records from Product and some records from the right table Category). [Extent2] is really to filter all records by related table Category with name "Beverages", so in this case it is the strong restriction ( INNER JOIN ) Why two? :) Because of parsing expression-by-expression and auto generation for every statement (Include, Where)
