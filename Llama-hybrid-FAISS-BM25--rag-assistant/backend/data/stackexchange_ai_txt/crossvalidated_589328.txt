HMaximus brilliant mention of the Simpson's paradox helped me figure out what term I need to use to search for an answer to my own question. So, for those who might stumble upon this question, you might want to have a look at this very well written paper by Pol & Wright 2009: A simple method for distinguishing within- versus between-subject effects using mixed models Basically, using linear mixed models with randome intercept, the within- and between-species effect have to be seperated by performing 'within group centering' (substracting the average x of each group from each observation of x in that group), and by subsequently including these, as well as the group mean, as new predictor variables. The paper does explain it a lot better, so have a look there for details.
