Is there a formula or rule for determining the correct sampSize for a randomForest?

I'm playing with a randomForest and have found that generally increasing the sampSize leads to better performance. Is there a rule / formula / etc that suggests what the optimal sampSize should be or is it a trial and error thing? I guess another way of phrasing it; what are my risks of too small of a sampSize or too large (overfitting?)? This question is referring to the R implementation of random forest in the randomForest package. The function randomForest has a parameter sampSize which is described in the documentation as Size(s) of sample to draw. For classification, if sampsize is a vector of the length the number of strata, then sampling is stratified by strata, and the elements of sampsize indicate the numbers to be drawn from the strata.
