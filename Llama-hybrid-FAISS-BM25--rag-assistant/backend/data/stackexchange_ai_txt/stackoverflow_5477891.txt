TBB already includes a sort method (parallel quicksort), which is -however- implemented quite poorly (runtime is at least linear independent of the number of processors). My proposal would be you port parallel merge sort from an existing implementation. For example gnu parallel mode sort (included in any recent gcc with source files) wich uses OpenMP. Just replace all #pragma omp by some tbb parallel code.
