the best way to do CNN+LSTM is using Time distributed layer. following code show's how we can add Time Distributed layer model = Sequential() model.add(TimeDistributed(Conv2D(24, 5, 5,activation='relu',subsample=(5, 4), border_mode='valid'), input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(TimeDistributed(Flatten())) model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)) model.add(Dense(output_dim=1)) So, here input_shape should be 4 dimensional as shown below input_shape=(TimeSteps,height,width,color_channels) You have to prepare data for this such that, each data point have n points where n is the number of time steps. So, if you are using 5 time steps, your data point should have a list of 5 elements which are past 4 time steps data along with current step.
