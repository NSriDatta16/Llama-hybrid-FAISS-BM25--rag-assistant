Its refreshing to hear someone considering BizTalk over C#! I would recommend the BizTalk approach, leveraging the functionality of the ESB Toolkit 2.0 and UDDI Services v3 (found in BizTalk Server 2009), for several reasons: The 50 web-service endpoints can be maintained in the UDDI registry - a common management portal where future endpoints can be added and maintained; Each web-service call be polled and the resultant message brought onto the bus, mapped into one of three messages and delivered to a specific endpoint; With regards to mapping, schemas will need to be defined for each of the three common message types and each web-service response; maps will then need to be created to map the response message to the appropriate common schema. The beauty of using the ESB capabilities in this scenario is that no aspect of the solution will be tightly-coupled: as the web-service response is received, the correct map is resolved (at runtime ) from properties on the response message. Once the message is mapped to its common schema format, it can be routed accordingly.
