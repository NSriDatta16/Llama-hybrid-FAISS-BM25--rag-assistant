Independent variable as a percent in a binary logistic regression

I understand the basics of binary logistic regression when the independent variable is a dichotomous variable. However, I am working with a dataset that has the dependent as a dichotomous variable and my independent variable is a percentage. So for example I am looking at how the percent change in revenue from the previous year impacts the probability of a particular policy being implemented. The independent variable is in the .10 (10%) form. My question is how do I interpret the odds ratio? Thank you!
