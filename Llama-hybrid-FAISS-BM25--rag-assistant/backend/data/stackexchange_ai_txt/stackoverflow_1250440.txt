In the past, I have leveraged a hashmap or index to store data structures that are per-thread inside of a single global thread-safe data structure. For instance, if you provide the id for each thread as an incrementing integer, you can store your data structure in a pre-allocated array at the index of the thread it. If you are leveraging thread IDs that are provided by the operating system or need to be more flexible, then a thread safe HashMap or HashTable will come in quite handy. Jacob
