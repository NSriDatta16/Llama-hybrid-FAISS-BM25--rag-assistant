If the number of counts where Count $\neq$0 is small then you can just handle this as a classification problem. Otherwise you can firstly separate the data based on the target variable into two groups: 1- Count ==0 2-Count $\neq$0 You can use a classification method (for example a logistic regression) to model each of the above outcomes. Then in the group where Count $\neq$0 you can fit a regression model. why this would help: Balancing the data: If you fit a regression model with least square it would be heavily biased towards 0, as most of your data is located at count==0. When you separate your data into two groups then all the data with Count $\neq$0 are put into one bin and they will have more weight against Count $\neq$0. Based on distribution count==0 seems to be a case completely distinct from other counts. Hence it can help if you treat is differently by first separating the data where count==0.
