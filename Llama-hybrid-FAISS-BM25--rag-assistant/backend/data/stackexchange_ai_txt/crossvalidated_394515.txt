Why ARIMA is prefered over any other time series analysis method

I am new to time series analysis, and I am self learner. I am using R language to learn how to do time series analysis. I started by studying the concepts and the theory behind such analysis, however I see a great concentration on the ARIMA method, whereas there is a very small attention for other methods. Could somebody one tell me why ARIMA is preferred over the other methods.
