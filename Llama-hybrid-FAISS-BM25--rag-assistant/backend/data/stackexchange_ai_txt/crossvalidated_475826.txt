Approximate data from an agricultural experiment investigating the effect on crop yields of levels of irrigation and of applied fertilizer. Average yields are shown. Main effects are not significant, but interaction is. Irrigation Fertilizer Lo Med Hi AVG -----------------------------------=-------- Lo 4 5 0 3 Med 5 5 5 5 Hi 0 5 5 3.3 -------------------------------------------- AVG 3 5 3.3 3.4 Rationale: Lo fertilizer gets washed away with Hi irrigation. Hi fertilizer with Lo irrigation burns plants. Both main effects obscured by variation--neither is significant. But interaction effect is strong enough to be significant. Considering costs of fertilizer and irrigation, medium levels of both may be best.
