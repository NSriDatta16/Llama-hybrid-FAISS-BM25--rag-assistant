These features can be included in simulations from a symmetric distribution using transformations that control skewness and kurtosis such as the Johnson-SU transformation, the g-and-h, the g-and-k, the sinh-arcsinh, and the LambertW tranformations (Tukey-type transformations). A quick google search gives you relevant references for these transformations. See also Transformation to increase kurtosis and skewness of normal r.v
