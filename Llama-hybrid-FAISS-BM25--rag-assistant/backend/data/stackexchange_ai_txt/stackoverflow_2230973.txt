There's a very good plugin for Eclipse that I use. It's called ObjectAid. Just add this URL: http://www.objectaid.com to your Available Software page in Help -> Software updates and install the plugin. It's a very simple drag and drop utility, that enables you the automatically add childern/parents to your class diagram. Hope this helps!
