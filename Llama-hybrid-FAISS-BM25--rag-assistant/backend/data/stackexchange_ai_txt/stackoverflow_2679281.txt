I had to reformat your HTML a little bit and change the group ID to classes, try the updated demo . HTML Groups Administrators Web Users Eric Richard Evan Script $('.groups').sortable({ revert: 'invalid', placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight' }); $('#users li').draggable({ connectToSortable: '.groups', helper: 'clone' }); I hope that is what you were trying to achieve. Edit: Oh I forgot to add, I had to do this because it appears that sortable/draggable/droppable doesn't work on lists deeper than one level.
