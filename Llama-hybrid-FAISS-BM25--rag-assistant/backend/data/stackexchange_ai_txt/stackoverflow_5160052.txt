Is Windows Azure Storage (Blob, Table, Queue) optimized for access from Windows Azure Roles?

I'm currently looking at Windows Azure to host an ElasticSearch implementation. Loading the application and running it under Java is not that difficult. Currently, ElasticSearch only supports Amazon's S3 when it comes to cloud storage. As a result, I've made a request to add support for Azure Blob Storage in ElasticSearch . Right after I made the request, it occured to me that while I can host ElasticSearch in Azure, I can create an Amazon S3 account and then have the instance running in Azure connect to the S3 account for storage. However, I do have concerns about the speed between the two. While I am sure both Azure Storage and Amazon's S3 are both optimized for really fast speeds, I have a nagging feeling that storage systems are really optimized when accessed from their respective computing clusters. That said, is there any definitive information on this? It makes sense, but I'm looking for specific confirmation or denial.
