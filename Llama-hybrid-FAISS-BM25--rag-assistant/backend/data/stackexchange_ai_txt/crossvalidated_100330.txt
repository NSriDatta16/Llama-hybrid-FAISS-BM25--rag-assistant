There are many similarities between PCA and Factor Analysis, and often insights from one can inform the other. Here though, the difference in their objectives is leading to the discrepancy you observe. Quoting this comparison of PCA and FA PCA results in principal components that account for a maximal amount of variance for observed variables; FA account for common variance in the data The point I want to make is that PCA maximizes the amount of variance explained in its loadings, but FA does not exactly do that. This paper makes a case for why, with this in mind, it is more realistic to select the number of factors for FA based not on the percentage of explained variance, but rather the explained common variance, which is more in line with the spirit of FA. Speaking to your second question: If you truly want to explain 90% of the variation in your data, try to run the analysis again with more factors and see how many you need to get the cumulative variation up to 90%. This however, may not work for the reason given by @ttnphns. Maybe you can also make a scree plot and see if you find an elbow. That could also give you a good idea of the number of components to take. Based on the table you show, it may be that adding more factors will not help much (since the change between the variation explained by the last few factors is small). In the end though, perhaps explained common variance will be more appropriate for the FA you are doing.
