You can use any random values for testing_label_vector (or y in your example). Just make sure that testing_label_vector is a vector of the same length as the number of rows in testing_instance_matrix (or X in your example). Also make sure that testing_label_vector is type double. Here is the MATLAB-specific README: matlab> [predicted_label, accuracy, decision_values/prob_estimates] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [,'libsvm_options']); matlab> [predicted_label] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [,'libsvm_options']); testing_label_vector: An m by 1 vector of prediction labels. If labels of test data are unknown, simply use any random values. (type must be double) testing_instance_matrix: An m by n matrix of m testing instances with n features. It can be dense or sparse. (type must be double) model : The output of svmtrain. libsvm_options : A string of testing options in the same format as that of LIBSVM.
