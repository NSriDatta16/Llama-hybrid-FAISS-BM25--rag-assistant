The first interpretation is incorrect, but the second one is correct. What will happen in multiple studies is dependent on the power and the true difference, not the confidence interval, so saying that something will happen 95% of the time based on this interval is incorrect. The second paragraph is a correct interpretation, further you can conclude that the 2nd group has a higher mean than the first group (the entire interval is negative).
