i'm not sure about drag and drop but you could easily link the two using local connection. a nice helper class can be found here http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2007/07/swfbridge_easie.html you could have a link appear on rollover in your first movie which 'sends' the image across to your second. hope that helps, Josh
