Have you considered collecting test coverage ? This determines what part of your code has run, often as exercised by your unit tests. To do this, you need a test coverage data collection tool, as well as your tests. EDIT: The only VB6 test coverage tool I know is http://www.aivosto.com/vbwatch.html Aivisto seems to have a generally good reputation for thier VB tools.
