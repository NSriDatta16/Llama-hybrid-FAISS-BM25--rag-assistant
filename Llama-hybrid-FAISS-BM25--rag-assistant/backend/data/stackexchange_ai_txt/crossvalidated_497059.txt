Then model comes with a gigantic AIC and also deviance. Is that because my confimred cases are culmulatives which wont follow poisson distribution? instead, should I use new cases each day? Or this is entirely not suitable to use poison. The AIC and deviance are not judged based on their absolute size, but instead, we look at differences in AIC and deviance. The AIC can differ in sample size (flipping 1 heads in 2 coin tosses is more likely than flipping 20 heads in 20 coin tosses) and also because the likelihood function (on which AIC is based) can be scaled by a random number.
