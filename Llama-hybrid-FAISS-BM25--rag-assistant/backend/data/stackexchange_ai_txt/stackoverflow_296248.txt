Multi-lingual Flex app - preferred fonts for embedding specific languages

I work on a collaboration web app, built with Flex 3, that needs to support multiple languages. Does anyone know which fonts are best for creating embedded font libraries for Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Russian languages? I know Arial Unicode MS will do the job, but I don't know if it will do the job best. Localization alone won't solve the entire problem: chat input and display, for example, need to support multiple languages in the same textfield - anything typed in Chinese needs to display in Chinese; anything typed in English needs to display in English. Using _sans is an option, but is far from preferred. Thanks.
