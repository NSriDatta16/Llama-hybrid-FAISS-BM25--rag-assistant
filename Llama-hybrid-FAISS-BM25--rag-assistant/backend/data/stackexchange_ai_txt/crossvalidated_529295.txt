The problem does not seem to stand with MCMC but with the prior modelling. If the data comes from a Multinomial distribution $$\mathcal D_k(n,p_1,\ldots,p_k)$$ where the probability vector $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ belongs to the $k$ -dimensional simplex, the prior on $\mathbf{p}$ must put some mass on the simplex (and should logically be allocating all its mass to the simplex. Using truncated Normals is thus inadequate as the prior puts zero mass on the simplex. As suggested by microhaus , a natural family of distributions in this setting is the family of Dirichlet priors. An alternative (or a generalisation) is to over-parametrise the model and set the constraint later. For instance, take $$p_1=\dfrac{\rho_1}{\sum_{i=1}^k \rho_i},\ldots,p_k=\dfrac{\rho_k}{\sum_{i=1}^k \rho_i}$$ with $$\rho_i\sim\mathcal N^+(a_i,b_i^2)$$ (when using a Gamma prior with a constant scale instead of a truncated Normal, this returns a Dirichlet).
