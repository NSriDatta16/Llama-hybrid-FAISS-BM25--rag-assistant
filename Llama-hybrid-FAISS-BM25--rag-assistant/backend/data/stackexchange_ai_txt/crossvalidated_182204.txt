My approach to a problem like this would be to express my mixed-effects model in the form of a hierarchical Bayesian model [1], and then exploit the flexibility of Bayesian models to introduce a latent 'outlier' variable that could be used to discount (or eliminate) the contribution of 'outlier' data to the model likelihood. It appears from your OP that you have some substantive prior knowledge of what causes outliers in your data. Such knowledge could be expressed objectively in a Bayesian model of the kind I'm hinting at, thereby dealing nicely with the 'cherry picking' problem Greg Snow described in his answer to the post you linked above. Also, if any of your priors include knowledge of directionality , then you might have a problem of censoring . But taking advantage of the residual information in a tiny handful of 'outliers' (you haven't indicated how common your outliers seem to be) would probably be more trouble than it was worth.
