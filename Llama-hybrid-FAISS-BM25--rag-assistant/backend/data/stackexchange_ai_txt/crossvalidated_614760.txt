How to apply the Box-Cox transformation to a univariate time series in R?

I have tried to follow the steps indicated on this page and it doesn't work as it doesn't identify the function "recipe" (which I fail to understand anyways...). I am trying to find the best Box-Cox transformation to stationaries in variance my time series. https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/step_BoxCox.html Here is my code : rec And here is the structure of my dataset for reproducibility : structure(list(date = c("2022-11", "2022-10", "2022-09", "2022-08", "2022-07", "2022-06"), production_brute_nucleaire = c(22951.429, 21465.026, 19334.531, 19319.365, 19923.664, 21275.248)), row.names = c(NA, 6L), class = "data.frame")
