I had never heard of it until you mentioned it - thanks for bringing it to my attention. I do think it's useful. If I want to see how "stuff" works I usually drop my code into LINQPad and see what sort of results I get by doing a Dump() on the resulting object. Only problem is that you have to copy your whole class and supporting classes in there to get anything more than trivial stuff to work. Also, there's no intellisense in LINQPad. This looks like it can replace what I use LINQPad for. Quick and dirty playing with the objects.
