Create a REST-style web service. That is, set up an HTTP server that responds to data requests by using some server code to load up your templates, alter the URLs and other things (relative to absolute), and sends it to the client as fragments of HTML (or even CSS). Your user, running on another web server, can use an HTTP client package to consume your web service, incorporate the resulting code fragments into her page, and send it out. Alternatively you could build your code fragments so they function in iframe objects. In that case your user would build her code to deliver iframe objects to her end-users with references to your server in them. Finally, your web service could deliver XML or JSON, and be consumed by AJAX-style javacscript in the end-user's browsers. You are absolutely right to prevent direct access to your mySQL table server from random clients.
