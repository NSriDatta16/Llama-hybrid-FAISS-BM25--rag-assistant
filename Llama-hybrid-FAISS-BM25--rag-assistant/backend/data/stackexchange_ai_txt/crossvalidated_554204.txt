Manually calculations of MA(3) model differs from the results of Arima values using the forecast Package

I have a time series that was fitted to a MA(3) using the forecast package in R. Datos I used the definition of an MA(3) model to manually forecast the next value using the last 3 residuals of the fitted data and the estimated mean. sum(MoMA3 $coef[1:4]*c(MoMA3$ residuals[15:13],1)) 109.78 Nonetheless, my manually predicted value differs from the forecast function. forecast(MoMA3, h=1) 106.86 Any ideas of what is possibly happening here? thanks
