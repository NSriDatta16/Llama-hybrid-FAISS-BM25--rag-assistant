The others answers here have missed some important distinctions between EBS and S3. S3 is completely pay-as-you-use . ie you only pay for the storage and bandwidth that you are using. Whereas with EBS you need to decide up front how big you want your EBS volume to be and you pay for the entire amount regardless of how much data you are actually using . A single EBS volume can only be connected to one EC2 instance - you cannot share them simultaneously between multiple instances . Of course this may not be an issue for you, but its something to be aware of. Its not a shared storage space. On the other hand, resource on S3 are accessible from anywhere using a simple url. S3 buckets can be used with Cloudfront(cdn) to speed up delivery around the world. You cannot do this with EBS volumes.
