Heap is a synonym for what the standard calls the free-store. In contrast to stacks, which is used for function calls, and function-local object storage, heaps grow in the opposite direction (top to bottom) on many implementations (as opposed to stacks -- which grow from bottom to top). Of course, none of these are required by the standard. The heap data structure, on the other hand is completely different -- it is a specialized tree structure with certain properties. It is possible some implementations use the heap data structure for free-store management, whence the name may have been derived. (See buddy memory allocation .)
