EJB3 - handling non-standard link tables

I have a situation where I am working with EJB3 and a legacy database. I have a situation where there is a many-to-many relationship between two tables A and B, defined through a third (link) table L. The complication is that the link table has other fields in it other than the PK's of tables A and B. The columns are standard timestamp and user columns to record who generated the link. These two additional columns are preventing me from defining the many-many relationship using a join table annotation, as they are not nillable and so must be populated. Does anyone know of a way around this limitation? I could define One-to-many relationships from the link table to each of the other tables in the relationship, but this is not very elegant. Thanks,
