The state $j$ is said to be accessible from a state $i$ (usually denoted by $i \to j$) if there exists some $n\geq 0$ such that: $$p^n_{ij}=\mathbb P(X_n=j\mid X_0=i) > 0$$ That is, one can get from the state $i$ to the state $j$ in $n$ steps with probability $p^n_{ij}$. If both $i\to j$ and $j\to i$ hold true then the states $i$ and $j$ communicate (usually denoted by $i\leftrightarrow j$). Therefore, the Markov chain is irreducible if each two states communicate.
