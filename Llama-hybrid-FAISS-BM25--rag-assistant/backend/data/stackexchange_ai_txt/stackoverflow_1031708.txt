These are the points where YSlow says you should improve: YSlow: Grade E, Overall performance score 55/100 Divided into grades: F: Make fewer HTTP requests Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) Add Expires headers Compress components with gzip Put JavaScript at bottom Configure entity tags (ETags) E: Avoid AlphaImageLoader filter C: Reduce DNS lookups Minify JavaScript and CSS You can read about how to rectify these problems here . I'd pay special attention to the AlphaImageLoader-warning, since that is specific to IE. It also causes several requests and is slow, especially when there are multiple images that needs to be filtered. You could try to use .gif-images instead since IE can handle them natively. Google's Page Speed gives you the following: Total score: [Score: 17.9%] Leverage browser caching [Score: 0%] Combine external JavaScript [Score: 47%] Minimize DNS lookups [Score: 57.1%] Enable gzip compression [Score: 78.2%] Leverage proxy caching [Score: 71.6%] Minify JavaScript [Score: 68.5%] Optimize images [Score: 65%] Specify image dimensions [Score: 45.8%] Remove unused CSS [Score: 33%] Use efficient CSS selectors [Score: 89%] You can read about Google's best practices here and learn how to improve load times and site efficiency. Note that Google has some practices that are not considered good practices in every day web development, such as not linking in an external stylesheet (it's an extra request), but most sites will NOT suffer from linking in an external stylesheet. So you'll have to consider every "rule" and ask yourself if that is something you like and would benefit from.
