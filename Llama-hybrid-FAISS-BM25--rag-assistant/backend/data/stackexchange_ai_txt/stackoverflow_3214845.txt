Hiding it, then changing the text, then showing it again seems to get it to work. You have to animate both the hide and the show to get it to work tho: $('#mydialog').hide("slow",function(){ $('#mydialog').html(data); $('#mydialog').show("slow"); }); It doesn't look very elegant tho. I would prefer a better fix if someone has one. edit: A better looking work around I came up with is using 2 dialogs and toggling them as I change the text.
