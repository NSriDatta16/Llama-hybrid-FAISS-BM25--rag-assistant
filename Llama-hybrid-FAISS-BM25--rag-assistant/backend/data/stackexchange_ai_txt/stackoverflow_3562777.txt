Codaddict is correct. You are looking to output the last element that was added to the array. echo end($final_array); That will move the array's pointer to the last element added to it and then output it. Since you're adding the elements to the array in this manner... $finalarray[] = $results_array["name"]; The key for each of your elements will be sequential, 0,1,2,3...so on and so forth. Another less elegant solution to get the last element would be... echo $final_array[count($final_array) - 1];
