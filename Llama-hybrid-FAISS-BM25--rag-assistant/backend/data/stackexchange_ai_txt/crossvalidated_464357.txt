How to perform statistical test of significance in deep learning?

I was reading the paper "Practical Recommendations for Gradient-Based Training of Deep Architectures" by Bengio , and at page 10 there is this footnote: we should use a statistical test of significance and accept a new minimum (over a longer training period) only if the improvement is statistically significant, based on the size and variance estimates one can compute for the validation set The paper is about how to properly train a neural network. But, how can I perform this type of statistical test of significance? In particular, suppose that I have split my dataset into training set, validation set and test set. For each epoch, I calculate the accuracy on the validation set, then, what should I do next?
