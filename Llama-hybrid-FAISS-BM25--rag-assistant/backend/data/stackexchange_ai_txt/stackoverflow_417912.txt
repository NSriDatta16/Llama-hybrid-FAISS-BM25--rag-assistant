I agree with most of the people here: Learn ASP.NET and C# at the same time. You'll have to - your code-behinds will be either VB.NET or C# anyway. Also check out MVC, and LINQ. But, and here's the big thing, learn standards compliant HTML too ! Most of the drag and drop controls in visual studio do horrible horrible things to HTML (gridview, I'm looking at you). If you follow proper HTML standards you'll also use learn what controls are more useful (repeater) than others when developing clean websites.
