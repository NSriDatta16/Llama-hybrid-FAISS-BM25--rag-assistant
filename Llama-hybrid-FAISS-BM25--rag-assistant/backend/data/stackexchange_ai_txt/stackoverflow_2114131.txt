You need to edit the Template for Button and add an animation for the MouseOver state. 1) In Expression Blend 2/3/4, drag and drop a button on the design surface. 2) Right Click the Button "Edit Template" --> "Edit Copy" --> OK. You are now editing the Button Template. 3) Go the the States Window and Select the "MouseOver" state from the states list. You are now in a storyboard. 4) Change whatever properties you'd like for the MouseOver state. 5) to achieve the nice transition, add a VisualStateTransition. In the states window, add a new Visual Transition (next to "Common States") from "* -> MouseOver". Give that visual transition the duration in seconds you'd like the transition to take. If you'd like to learn more on Visual States, consider spending 30 minutes watching these "How Do I" videos by Steve White @ http://expression.microsoft.com/en-us/cc643423.aspx
