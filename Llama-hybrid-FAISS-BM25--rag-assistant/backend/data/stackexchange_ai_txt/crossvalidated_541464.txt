I answer this fairly thoroughly in What test/model would I use for A/B testing given 3 groups . I'll add some comments here for completeness. In my opinion, you frame the problem correctly as a decision . Launching the change is a decision , and doing nothing is a decision . We should understand what we stand to lose under each decision. A frequentist approach does not evaluate a decision per se . The p value from a frequentist analysis only tells us the probability of observing such a difference under the null hypothesis (assuming all the assumptions about the data are valid). The difference between control/exposure might be very small and yet the p value may indicate significance. Choosing to implement this change may fail to account for costs incurred in implementation. And for what? A small change in the metric? This seems short sighted to me. In the link I provide, we get to specify what our loss function is. I use a very simple loss function (essentially, how much incremental we stand to lose were we to choose the wrong variant), but that is only for convenience. Bayesian decision making is superior (again, in my opinion) because we get to specify whatever loss applies to us.
