generalised ML solutions to problems like summarisation just do not work very well outside of very sophisticated supporting machinery. Consider "crawling" a two part operation of collecting pages and then turning them into plain text and meta-data. Boilerpipe is very decent. It has many templates for content extraction. Consider using a different template for each page type. How are you determining if you are indeed on the about us page? The company page? The product page? Can you translate your criteria directly to google or bing queries restricted to a URL? If so, you could save yourself oodles of time working with your own crawlers. Regarding summarisation, I'd advise abandoning a one-for-all solution. A summarisation is supposed to provide enough information to understand what may be on the page, under some length constraint (say 100 words). For many company pages that's exactly what the first paragraph does. When the first paragraph is not enough, consider the structure of the information on the page and think about what may make a good solution, then look for the technical tooling to solve it. In summary, I'd suggest first exhausting the low hanging fruit and then dealing with the remainder which will probably be smaller than you expect. Hope that helps. PM me if you'd like to have a more informed discussion.
