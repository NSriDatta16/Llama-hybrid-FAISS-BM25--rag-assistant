If you want to remove a view from a region, that means you don't want to erase it completely, as it still has to work in other regions. In that case, the right command is: cleartool rmtag -view -tag dynamic-view-tag -region theRightRegion See rmtag command: The rmtag command removes one or more entries from the network's view tag registry or VOB tag registry A rmview would both math a rmtag , and un-register the view id (and remove any local trace of the view, like removing the view storage).
