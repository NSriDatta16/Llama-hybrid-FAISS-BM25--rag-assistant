Technically, it's not a limit that's stopping you, it's their anti-spam filters; if their servers receive many identical e-mails differing only be recipient within a short space of time from a single sender, they'll often or not block them, obviously there are some algorithms going on behind the scenes to establish if it is actually spam (i.e. is the sender server part of a known spam network, is the sender on the trusted senders list of the recipients etc.) although we'll know exactly what goes in to deciding if the e-mail should be considered spam or not. ;) You'll find most of the popular e-mail providers (Yahoo, Gmail etc.) do this. Most mailing list providers get around this by automatically fragmenting how many e-mails are sent to a single provider in an hour - not to mention the bigger mailing providers are often or not more trusted by the e-mail providers that their content is legitimate. While I think you're in the sending limit, do be aware Google will disable your account for 24 hours if they believe you are spamming. More information here .
