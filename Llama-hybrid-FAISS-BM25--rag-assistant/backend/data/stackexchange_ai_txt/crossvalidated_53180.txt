R^2 is a scaled measure of the error in the fit. Here is some more information on it. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CorrelationCoefficient.html Although R^2 is useful, there is no perfect measure. They each have strengths and weaknesses. I find that I use measures like the Akaike Information Criterion much more because I have a number of candidate analytic functions that fit with somewhat consistent R^2 and I need to find a mixture of them, with weights, that more likely indicates the underlying nature of the system. Relevant Links Include: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dschmidt/ModelSectionTutorial1_SchmidtMakalic_2008.pdf The slope can go from -infinitity to +infinity, though in practice it is limited by the economics of the business. If you are selling butter, and you have a finite production capacity then the largest number of sales you can have is constrained by that capacity, or by the sum of the historic under-sold capacity plus storage. A business can't lose infinite money, only its entire net worth, plus all the debt its credit rating can rack up. Your negative slope will be constrained by business realities of that sort - but they will be particular to your business. In theory it could be anything between plus and minus infinity. In practice, if you pick the right sorts of values - the right sorts of domain and range then your slopes will be in a useful range. You might consider two different EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) functions, one with a different period than the other. When the short period is above the long, there is some sort of increase (positive), and when the long is on top then there is decrease. It is a very simplistic indicator, but it can be responsive to the data. A single linear fit doesn't respond quickly to changing business realities, especially if it is operating over a large span of time or sample values.
