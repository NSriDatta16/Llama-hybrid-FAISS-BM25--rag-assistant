Dialog causes the an event loop to be executed whilst it is blocking. There is a filter that allows certain events through such as repaint requests, invocation events and events to the dialog window. The API for this is not exposed. There was a library ( Foxtrot , IIRC), that used a hack on Dialog to expose this behaviour. I would strongly suggest structuring your program in such a way that this is not required. It's a very procedural rather than event-driven organisation. So queue your task on another thread (possible a thread pool/executor service or GUI-like event-loop), and then update the GUI with java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater .
