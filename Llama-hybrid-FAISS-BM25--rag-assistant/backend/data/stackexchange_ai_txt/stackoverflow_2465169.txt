I am cross posting the solution I received on MSDN. I hope it helps someone else. Hi mamorgan1, From your description, I notice you are using Report Viewer with version 9.0.30729.4402, and SQL Server Reporting Serivces 2005 with SP3. RS Client Print control is an ActiveX control which uses a ClassID to check if the ActiveX is installed on the client. By default, the ClassID for SQL Server Reporting Services SP3 is 41861299-EAB2-4DCC-986C-802AE12AC499. However, Report Viewer 9.0.30729.4402 would like the ClassID 0D221D00-A6ED-477C-8A91-41F3B660A832. RSClientPrint control has been updated after applying Cumulative Update #8 for SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 3. So, please apply Cumulative Update #8 for SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 3 to solve the issue. For more information about Cumulative Update #8 for SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 3, please see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978915/en-us If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.
