Unless you have identified your autoloader (and the underlying filesystem poking and prodding) as a performance bottleneck, you really shouldn't worry about it. Profile, profile, profile! Autoloaders can be a real drag, but you are likely to find a larger performance boost elsewhere by actually benchmarking your code. To be honest, I'd go for a PSR-0 compliant autoloader for a new project.
