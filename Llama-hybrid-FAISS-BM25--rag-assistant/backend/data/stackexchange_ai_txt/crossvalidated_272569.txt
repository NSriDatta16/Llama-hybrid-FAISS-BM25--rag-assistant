Can I make arbitrary fake training data for NLP deep learning model?

The size of training data is critical for deep learning. For image classification, I saw people making arbitrary training images to improve the accuracy. Is it possible to generate arbitrary training data for document classification problems? For images, people can rotate, shift the images. So how can I manipulate the existing labeled training data, to get more data?
