How can I put the markup for a Wicket FormComponentPanel inside of a wicket:fragment?

I am putting a TextField and a DropDownChoice inside a FormComponentPanel which is supposed to use setConvertedInput to TextField's value concatenated with DropDownChoice's value. However, I would like to put the markup for the FormComponentPanel inside a wicket:fragment in the markup file that contains the containing form. Here's an abrreviated version of what I tried so far: OptionsPanel.java ... some stuff not shown here ... DurationFormComponentPanel durationFormComponentPanel = new DurationFormComponentPanel("estimated_duration"); add(new Fragment("estimatedDuration", "duration_fragment", OptionsPanel.this)); OptionsPanel.html weeks days The end result of this atm is that the markup for the FormComponentPanel is empty.
