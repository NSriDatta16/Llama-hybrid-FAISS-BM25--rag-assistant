Serializing Entities with RIA Services

I've got a Silverlight application that requires quite a bit of data to operate and it requires it all up-front. It's using RIA Services (and the Entity Framework) to get all that information. It takes 10-15 seconds to get all the data, but the data only changes about once a month. What I'd like to do is toss that data into Isolated Storage so that the next time they load up the app, I can just grab it, see if its updated, and if not use that data they've already got and save a ton of time sending things over the wire. The structure of the graph I need to store is (more-or-less) a typical tree structure. A model has components, a component has features, a feature has options. The issue that I'm coming up against is that when I ask to have this root entity (the model) serialized, it's only serializing the top-level object and ignoring all of the "child" objects. Does anyone know of a convenient way to get it to serialize/deserialize the whole graph?
