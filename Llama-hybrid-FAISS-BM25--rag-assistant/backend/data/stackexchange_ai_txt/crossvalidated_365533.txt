Like @match-maker-ee said, Linear classifiers can over-fit depending on the input features. The following model f is linear in its parameters a , b and c , but can be fitted to a quadratic curve in the feature space of x : $$ f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$$ SVM's can also over-fit, for example when they use the kernel trick, despite being basically a linear model in an augmented feature space.
