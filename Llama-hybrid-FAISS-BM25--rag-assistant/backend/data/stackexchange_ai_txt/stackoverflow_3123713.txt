You don't need to use database in Django projects. Basically django comes with some standardized architecture that follows MVC pattern (or MVT as sometimes described). This includes models, views, url dispatching, templates, etc. Probably you need to do following things to accomplish your task: create url definition in urls.py to some django view write django view that call somehow your api and displays result as a web page you don't need models and database at all but you need to get familliar with views, urls, templates. It might look like a big machinery for your simple case but if you have some time I encourage you to these django basics. If you are looking for somethin much simpler I heard about webpy project . This might be better option if you need something really simple.
