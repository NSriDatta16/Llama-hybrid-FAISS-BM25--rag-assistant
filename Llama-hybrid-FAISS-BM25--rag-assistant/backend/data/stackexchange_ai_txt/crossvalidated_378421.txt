If one considers the loss function $$L(\delta , \theta) = \mathbb{1}_{|\theta-\delta|>\epsilon}$$ the Bayes estimator $\delta^*(\cdot)$ is obtained as solving $$\arg\min_\delta\mathbb{E}[L(\delta , \theta) | x]$$ for every $x$ . Now \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}[L(\delta , \theta) | x] &= \int L(\delta , \theta)\pi(\theta | x)\,\text{d}x\\ &= \int \mathbb{1}_{|\theta-\delta|>\epsilon}\,\text{d}x\\ &= \mathbb{P}(|\theta-\delta|>\epsilon)\\ &= 1-\pi([\delta-\epsilon,\delta+\epsilon] | x) \end{align*} One thus wants to maximise the coverage of $[\delta-\epsilon,\delta+\epsilon]$ under the posterior distribution. This amounts to finding the location $\delta$ of the center of an interval of length $2\epsilon$ with the largest coverage. A graphic illustration is to imagine a stick of length $2\epsilon$ that is moved up under the graph of $\pi(\cdot|x)$ until it cannot move higher. It obviously depends on $\pi(\cdot)$ and on $f(x|\theta)$ . Note that differentiating $\pi([\delta-\epsilon,\delta+\epsilon] | x)$ in $\delta$ leads to $$\pi(\delta-\epsilon)=\pi(\delta+\epsilon)$$ meaning that the resulting interval is an HPD region if the posterior is unimodal and monotone on each side of the posterior mode (MAP). It is only when the posterior is symmetric that $\delta^*$ is the MAP. Note also that when the posterior support is truncated, as in the truncated Normal example, the solution is an HPD but does not necessarily satisfy the equation $$\pi(\delta-\epsilon)=\pi(\delta+\epsilon)$$ . For instance, if the posterior is the Normal distribution $\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ truncated below $\max x_i>\mu$ , $\delta^*$ will be equal to $\max x_i+\epsilon$ .
