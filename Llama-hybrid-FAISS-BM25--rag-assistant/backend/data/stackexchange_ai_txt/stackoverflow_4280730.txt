One per line (Not sure if that is ok): @echo off for %%A in (foo,bar,baz) do ( for %%B in (agent,event,plan) do echo %%A/*.%%B ) For all in one line, you probably need a hack: @echo off SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS for %%A in (foo,bar,baz) do ( for %%B in (agent,event,plan) do (SET /P "dummy=%%A/*.%%B ") Treat as a list of files and folders (will only print existing files): @echo off SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS for %%A in (foo,bar,baz) do ( for %%B in (agent,event,plan) do ( for %%C in (%%A/*.%%B) do (SET /P "dummy=%%A/%%~nxC ")
