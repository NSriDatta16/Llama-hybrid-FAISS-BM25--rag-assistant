For your specific question of plotting , and your specific scenario of an average of 1-2 errors per day out of 150, the simplest thing might be to plot trimmed means , or the range of the middle 95% of values, or something like that. It really depends on what value you want out of the plot. If you are really concerned with the true max and true of a day's prices, then you have to deal with the outliers as outliers, and properly exclude them, probably using one of the outlier tests previously proposed ( data point is x% more than next point, or the last n points, or more than 5 standard deviations away from the daily mean). Another approach is to view what happens after the outlier. If it is an outlier, then it will have a sharp upturn followed by a sharp downturn. If however you care about overall trend, plotting daily trimmed mean, median, 5% and 95% percentiles will portray history well. Choose your display methods and how much outlier detection you need to do based on the analysis question . If you care about medians or percentiles, they're probably irrelevant.
