PCA captures full dataset info with half of the features

I have a dataset with 13 features and run PCA on it. I can see PCA with 7 principal components can explain variance 100% and reconstruction error is 0. When may this happen? I was thinking maybe these 6 useless features are just scaled version of other 7 features thus giving no information, but correlation matrix shows at most .3 score. Any idea why this may happen?
