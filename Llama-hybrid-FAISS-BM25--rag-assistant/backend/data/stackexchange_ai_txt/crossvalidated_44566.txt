Functional Data Analysis probably provides the framework you are looking for. Your wording " quite long series data ", " continuous variables " echoes the basic intuitions behind this approach. It actually seems you are describing a problem closely related to multivariate functional regression. Yao 's Functional Linear Regression Analysis for Longitudinal Data (preprint) describes in detail the theory behind this and MÃ¼ller's et al. Inferring gene expression dynamics via functional regression analysis paper provides a nice test case (and presents some of the theory again). There is work on functional mixed effects regression also in case you are interested in "clustering" your data somehow (gender-wise, sibling associations etc.). Assuming that your "weapon of choice" is MATLAB, the package PACE provides a lot of readily available routines for regression, smoothing, warping (time-registration) and component analysis (on a regular or irregular grid) for your data. (For the ME models you will probably need to use Functional PCA and then model the projections with R's lmer() ).
