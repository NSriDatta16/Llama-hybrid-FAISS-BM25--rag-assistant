MCMC Gamma Distribution

I am applyig a MCMC simulation with a Gamma distribution. I am trying to simulate the rainfall in a city using data collected during 1000 days. First step is to simulate the "data colleceted during 1000 days" that follows a Gamma distribution with $mean = shape * scale = 2 * 2 = 4$ . data Second step is to prepare the prior and likelihood of gamma distrubiton. I created two functions to give support to my MCMC code: # Log Gamma - Prioris prioriGamma Then I code the MCMC simulation: mcmc 0) { # evaluate the loglikelihood at the current values of alpha. loglik.cur Where I input gamma data simulated, lambda and nu of my alpha gamma prior distribution, lambda and nu of my beta gamma distribution, and two initials values for my Markov Chain. Apparently the code is working well. Nevertheless, I am facing challenge in the theorical sense to understand exactly what is happening in the simulation. Due to that I have couple questions that I need some help. Why is the Gamma Distribution appropriate to the problem? I understand that Gamma has a relationship with Poisson and Exponential distribution, making sense to use it to simulate couting process. Nevertheless I would like to understand better why is this usefull for the rainfall simulation. What values should I pick up to use in the MCMC simulation? res When I choose the values of the gamma distribution I did know that my mean should be around 4. But I don't which values should I use for the prioris lambda.alpha, lambda.beta, nu.alpha, and nu.beta in order to simulate correctly my belives about the data. I realised that indeppendly of the init values I used, the MCMC converges to the true parameters. The code I used from this source https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/plp/pmztk/files/MCMC2-Seattle/Lab-Sessions/2/tutorial_gamma.html I did some small changes to adapt for myself and I applied into a practial problem to work my theorical understanding of the problem. Thank you for your support!
