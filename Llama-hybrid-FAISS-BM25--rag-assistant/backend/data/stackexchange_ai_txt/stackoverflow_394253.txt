Since you're learning C, independent of your missing-return bug, here are some observations and advice: Pointers are the most difficult feature of the language to learn , especially when you get into malloc() and free() . Don't get discouraged . Throw away Deitel and Deitel and get yourself a copy of Kernighan and Ritchie . It's one of the best language books ever written. Turn on all warnings, all the time. If you can use MacOS or Linux, gcc -Wall -Werror -O is pretty good. Run every C program under valgrind . Valgrind is a wonderful tool that is designed to catch errors in the way you use pointers . It will save your bacon! Good luck!
