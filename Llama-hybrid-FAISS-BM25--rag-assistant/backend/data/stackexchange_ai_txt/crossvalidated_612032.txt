I think I figure out the solution. Please, someone, confirm if I am right. First, we need to know the distribution of penis length from the population we take this sample from. It's common to assume that measures of body parts are normally distributed, so we can use the normal dist. We will not use the sample mean, but the individual measures of the sample. Let us start with a sample of 3 people with these values (16,17,19) to demonstrate how would be the algorithm for 30 values. Lets see all possible cases. For 0 liars we have: S S S (see the explanation in the next value) For 1 liar we have: L S S (this means first is Liar, second and third are sincere). S L S S S L For 2: L L S L S L S L L for 3: L L L Lets take the first elements that said 16. The probably of he is sincere is: $P(15 - Thoses are all values that has less than 1cm of error with 16. the probability of he is lying is $1 - P(15 then. Lets calculate all probabilities for our table: For 0: S S S = $(P(15 For 1: L S S = $(1 - P(15 S L S = $(P(15 S S L = $(P(15 For 2: L L S = $(1 - P(15 L S L = $(1 - P(15 S L L = $(P(15 for 3: L L L = $(1 - P(15 lets calculate all values for the table using (using the normal distribution CDF, remember we are supposing the real mean is 13.24 and std is 1.89): For 0: S S S = $(0.1525)*(0.0662)*(0.0057) = 0.000057544349999999994$ For 1: L S S = $(1 - 0.1525)*(0.0662)*(0.0057) = 0.00031979565$ S L S = $(0.1525)*(1 - 0.0662)*(0.0057) = 0.0008117056499999999$ S S L = $(0.1525)*(0.0662)*(1 - 0.0057) = 0.010037955649999998$ For 2: L L S = $(1 - 0.1525)*(1 - 0.0662)*(0.0057) = 0.0045109543500000005$ L S L = $(1 - 0.1525)*(0.0662)*(1 - 0.0057) = 0.05578470434999999$ S L L = $(0.1525)*(1 - 0.0662)*(1 - 0.0057) = 0.14159279435$ for 3: L L L = $(1 - 0.1525)*(1 - 0.0662)*(1 - 0.0057) = 0.78688454565$ Lets sum up all the probabilities, Lets use N as a random variable to represent the number of liars: $P(N = 0) = 0.000057544349999999994$ $P(N = 1) = 0.00031979565 + 0.0008117056499999999 + 0.010037955649999998 = 0.011169456949999998$ $P(N = 2) = 0.0045109543500000005 + 0.05578470434999999 + 0.14159279435 = 0.20188845304999997$ $P(N = 3) = 0.78688454565$ Lets calculate the expected value of N: $E(N) = 0.000057544349999999994*0 + 0.011169456949999998*1 + 0.20188845304999997*2 + 0.78688454565*3$ $E(N) = 2.7756$ So, on average, samples with the measures [16,17,19] will have 2.78 liars, witch means that probably all of them are lying. Now we do this algorithm to the sample of size 30.
