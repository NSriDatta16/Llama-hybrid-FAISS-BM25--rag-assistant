Hyperparameters in Gaussian Process

My academical background is in physics and analysis (PDE's), but now I'am reading about data science. I'm reading about Gaussian Process implementation in Sci-Kit Learn I could not find a simple explanation about those hyper-parameters theta0, thetaL and thetaU. Can someone explain to me what those parameters are, and how to choose then?
