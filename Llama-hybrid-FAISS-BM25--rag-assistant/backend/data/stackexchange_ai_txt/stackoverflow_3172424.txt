How to maintain selected rows in DataGridView when mouse is held down on a cell?

I am trying to implement row moving in a DataGridView. I want to be able to select multiple rows and click on any of the selected row's cells to begin the drag operation. The problem is that the rows become deselected when I hold the mouse down on a cell. How can I prevent this from happening?
