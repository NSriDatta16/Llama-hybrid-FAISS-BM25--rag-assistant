If it takes (and these figures are examples) 20 seconds for a file to arrive and 5 seconds for you to process it, what is the harm in your process waiting for, on average, another 7.5 seconds before it even detects that the file is there? A sleeping process should have as close to zero impact on the CPU as it is possible to get. So no, I would not be concerned about this aspect at all. The one thing you should be concerned about is how to restart the process automatically if it fails. I would run a cron job every 5 minutes (your choice of actual frequency) to kill off the old copy (politely, and only if it's running) and then start a new one. That way, there'll only be a 5-minute downtime at most if something goes wrong. I say politely because the old one may be in the middle of processing files and you should not interrupt that unless it's recoverable.
