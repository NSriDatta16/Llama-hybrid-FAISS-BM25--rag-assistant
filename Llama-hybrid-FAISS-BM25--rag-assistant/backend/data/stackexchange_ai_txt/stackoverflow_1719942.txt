Quoting from here : InFlightCount : The number of messages that have been dispatched and are currently awaiting acknowledgment from the consumer. So as this number decreases, the DequeueCount increases. AverageEnqueueTime : On average, the amount of time (ms) that messages remained enqueued. Or average time it is taking the consumers to successfully process messages. EnqueueCount : The number of messages that have been written to the queue over the lifetime of the queue. DequeueCount : The number of messages that have been successfully (i.e., theyâ€™ve been acknowledged from the consumer) read off the queue over the lifetime of the queue. DispatchCount : The number of messages that have been dispatched (sent) to the consumer over the lifetime of the queue. Note that dispatched messages may not have all been acknowledged.
