Quick answer which I will expand in few days is PLS-DA is a supervised method where you supply the information about each sample's group. PCA, on the other hand, is an unsupervised method which means that you are just projecting the data to, lets say, 2D space in a good way to observe how the samples are clustering by theirselves. PCA, after coloring of samples on the graph and if a good class seperation is achieved, may look like a somewhat supervised method though... Which one is better depends, if you know each sample's group and want to predict a new sample's group PLS-DA is a "go to" for me, for instance.
