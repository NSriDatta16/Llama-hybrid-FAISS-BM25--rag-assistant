Design pattern for WCF client switching and failover capabilities?

I'm looking to identify a best practice or often used design pattern for WCF communication allow communication to occur and fail over to another service or local service of information if the WCF (or initial service exists) I'm not sure this makes much sense so let me give an example. I'd like this agent to be able to connect to a wcf service and (hopefully) expose the contract methods to the caller (UI/BO, etc) so that this object can call these methods, the agent attempts to contact a primary service (likely WCF), if it fails connect to a secondary service. Ideally all the failover and reconnection logic would be contained in the agent. Is there a design pattern that encapsulates a "switching wcf client with failover"? Maybe not a design pattern, anyone recommend a decent approach?
