There's a partial solution for this that involves converting the various documents into HTML for display (or any other web-capable format) in a web browser. It doesn't satisfy all your requirements but may lead to something useful eventually. JODConverter offers a server-side java-based solution that leverages OpenOffice.org's powerful converter to convert from any supported format to any other supported format. From the website: JODConverter, the Java OpenDocument Converter, converts documents between different office formats. It leverages OpenOffice.org, which provides arguably the best import/export filters for OpenDocument and Microsoft Office formats available today I've used it successfully to convert documents from MSWord to HTML for display in the browser. Any format that OpenOffice supports is supported by JODConverter. So PDF, MS formats, TIFF and others are supported. It's java so it's platform independent - I've used it on a Windows, Mac and Linux server.
