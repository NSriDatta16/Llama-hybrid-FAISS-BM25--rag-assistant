jScrollPane scrolling down when dragging down a listitem

when using the current version of jScrollPane. The scrollpane will not scroll down when someone drags down an item in the sortable list located in the scrollpane. When i use an older version of jScrollpane ( jSrollPane.js 93 2010-06-01 08:17:28Z kelvin.luck ) scrolling when dragging works perfectly, but the old version does not support a lot of options i essentially need! How do i get the newer version of jScrollPane to scroll down on dragging down? I've searched through nearly everything ... thanks for any help, haemse
