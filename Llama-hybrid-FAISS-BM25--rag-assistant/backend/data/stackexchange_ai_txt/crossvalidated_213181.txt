If you are feeding your data in batches, for example in NN, then it is a big problem, and gradients used for SGD are not good estimates for the gradient of the full batch. Thus in that case you should randomize your data. For RF and SVM etc the ordering does not matter, since the calculations are always performed on the full data.
