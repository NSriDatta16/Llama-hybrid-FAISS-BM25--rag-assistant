Can you just reference the bind variables in the "test report script.sql" script? In other words, in "test report script.sql", you have a direct reference to v_s_time and v_e_time, skipping the SQL Plus define variable. There doesn't appear to be any really elegant way to convert from bind variables to SQL Plus DEFINE'd variables.
