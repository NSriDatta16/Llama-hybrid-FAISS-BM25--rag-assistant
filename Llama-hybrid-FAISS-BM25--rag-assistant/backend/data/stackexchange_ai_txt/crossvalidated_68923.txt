Fit VAR model with unknown order in Matlab

I have a multivariate observed time series $Y_t$ and I want to find the best fitting VAR process for it. I have the econometric toolbox in Matlab and can use 'vgxvarx' if I pre-specify an order for the VAR process. However I want the order of the process to be estimated as well. Is there a function to do this in Matlab?
