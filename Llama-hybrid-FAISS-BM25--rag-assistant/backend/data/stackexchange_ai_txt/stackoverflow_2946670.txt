User bobince puts a number of cons very, very well in his critique of jQuery . ... Plus, you can make a div by saying $(''+message+'') instead of having to muck around with document.createElement('div') and text nodes. Hooray! Only... hang on. You've not escaped that HTML, and have probably just created a cross-site-scripting security hole, only on the client side this time. And after you'd spent so long cleaning up your PHP to use htmlspecialchars on the server-side, too. What a shame. Ah well, no-one really cares about correctness or security, do they? jQuery's not wholly to blame for this. After all, the innerHTML property has been about for years, and already proved more popular than DOM. But the library certainly does encourage that style of coding. As for performance: InnerHTML is most definitely going to be slower, because it needs to be parsed and internally converted into DOM elements (maybe using the createElement method). InnerHTML is faster in all browsers according to the quirksmode benchmark provided by @Pointy. As for readability and ease of use, you will find me choosing innerHTML over createElement any day of the week in most projects. But as you can see, there are many points speaking for createElement .
