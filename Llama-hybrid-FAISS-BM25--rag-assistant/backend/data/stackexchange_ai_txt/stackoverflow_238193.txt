Rather than customizing the IDE, I customized my error messages. I have a macro that expands to a #pragma warning statement that generates a compile-time message in the same format as MSVC++. Visual Studio can parse the resulting warning, so a double-click on the message opens the offending file in the IDE and takes me right to the line in question. I've used the macro: To "bookmark" a section of code, so developers will be nagged to fix it each time they build. Within #if blocks to test for various compile-time conditions. In headers, to see who #include s them, and where.
