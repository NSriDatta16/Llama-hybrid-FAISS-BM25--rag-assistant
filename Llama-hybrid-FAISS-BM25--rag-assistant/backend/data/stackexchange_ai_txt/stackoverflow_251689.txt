Since map is more of a utility than anything, I don't see why there would be any special way of plugging it into the Ext namespace; the way you propose would work well enough, though you might want to do it thusly: if(Ext && typeof(Ext.map) == "undefined") { // only if Ext exists & map isn't already defined Ext.map = function(arr, f) { ... }; } Seems like that would be fine...but then, I don't use ExtJS, so I don't know. I did take a gander at their docs and it doesn't seem like there is anything special to do in this case.
