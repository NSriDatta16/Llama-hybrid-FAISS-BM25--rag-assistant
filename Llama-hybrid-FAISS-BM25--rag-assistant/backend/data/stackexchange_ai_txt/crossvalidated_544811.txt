Stuck on Penney's game question

Suppose we have a game that assumes we have a fair coin. Two people who are playing can pick two patterns of coin flips. The players then flip a large coin a number of times and record each of the individual flips. After the flips, they pay attention to the record of flips and decide which pattern came first in the sequence. Using simulations, we can find: HHT comes before THH about 1/4th of the time THH comes before TTH about 1/3rd of the time TTH comes before HTT about 1/4th of the time HTT comes before HHT about 1/3rd of the time Can someone explain to me why this is and what the intuition behind this game is?
