How do I iterate a .Net IList collection in the reverse order?

I have an IList that contains items ( parent first ), they need to be added to a Diagram Document in the reverse order so that the parent is added last, drawn on top so that it is the first thing to be selected by the user. What's the best way to do it? Something better/more elegant than what I am doing currently which I post below..
