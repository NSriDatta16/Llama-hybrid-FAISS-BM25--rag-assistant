Attitudes measures are infamous for displaying that negative skew that you are noticing. Generally this is because people: A) Feel like the socially desirable thing to do is say you're happy. B) Are generally happy, because if they weren't they would have left the organization and wouldn't be in your dataset Generally it is not advisable to divide a continuum (or even a pseudo-continuum) into a dichotomous variable of satisfied or not satisfied. Its removing potentially important variance, and if you want to make any predictive model off of it, you will be shooting yourself in the foot. Because of this I dont think attitudinal research will have an answer to your problem, most researchers wouldn't see the point of removing variance. If your client is pressuring you to do this though, you can divide it into "satisfied" (4 and 5) and "not satisfied" (1-3). Technically a neutral stance does mean that they are not "not satisfied" it also means that they are "not dissatisfied" though. Hope that helps, good luck appeasing the customer!
