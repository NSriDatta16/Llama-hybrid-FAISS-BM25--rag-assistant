No elbow in the scree plot means that the data are not far from spherical - think round football (soccer ball) - and no dominating directions exist. An elbow means the data are elongated - think rugby ball (american football) - and a few directions dominate. To get useful PCA/FA results, you'll need some nonlinear transformations. PCA/FA/scree are just tools and it is the science behind the data that matters. That's why some papers say yes and others no. Also, don't assume that the authors necessarily really understand PCA/FA etc.
