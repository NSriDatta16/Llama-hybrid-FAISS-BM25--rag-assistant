performSelector unable to run while UITableView is dragged?

I have a UITableViewController with its default UITableView . I begin slowly dragging the table with my finger to scroll, i.e. not flicking it with my finger. Every time the table moves on-screen the scrollViewDidScroll method of the controller is called; when some conditions I've specified are met, one of these calls to scrollViewDidScroll uses performSelector:withObject:afterDelay to schedule some action at a later time. However, I'm finding that the action will not execute until I release my finger. For example, if I set the afterDelay parameter to 2 seconds, but hold my finger for 5 seconds, when I release my finger and the action executes it's 3 seconds too late. Is there any way to allow the action (which is to update the UI and so must run in the main thread) to execute while the finger is still against the screen? Thanks!
