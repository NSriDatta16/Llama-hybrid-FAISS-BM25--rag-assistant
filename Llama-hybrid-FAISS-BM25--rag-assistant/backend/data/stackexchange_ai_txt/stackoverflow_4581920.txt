To understand what this means you first need to remember that the Gang of Four wrote this book back in 1994, when the vast majority of programmers in the world were not using (and had never heard of) object-oriented programming. Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides are basically introducing the concept of interfaces here. The idea is that a piece of code that interacts with an object doesn't really need to understand how the underlying implementation happens, and that two different objects can have the same interface but have different implementations. We do that all the time today with interfaces in Java and Objective-C. But they go further, and imply that an object may have several interfaces, one from one type (or interface), and one from another. You can do this explicitly with multiple inheritance in C++, or with multiple interfaces in Java, or just by using the same naming convention.
