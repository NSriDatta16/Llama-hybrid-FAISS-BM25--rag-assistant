Standardizing data

I have a non-normal data set. We need to calculate the average of the numbers in this data set for planning purposes. I used “standardize” to normalize my data in Excel. Can I map the average obtained from the standardized data set back to the original so I have an a new average? Let me try to clarify some of the questions posed here. The data set has supplies ordered/week. The average of this is going to be used for future planning purposes. Someone suggested that we normalize this data set and then find what the average would be and used the average obtained from normalizing. So my question is if I used the standardize function in Excel and get the new average from the the "standardized" data set can I map it back to my original data set? See example below "X1" Mean Std Dev Standardized value 282 252 55 0.52 Can I find out what 0.52 corresponds to in my original data set? as in would I get something that says 0.52 corresponds to a normalized value of 265 ? If possible i would like to do this for every reading and then find a new average Thank you!
