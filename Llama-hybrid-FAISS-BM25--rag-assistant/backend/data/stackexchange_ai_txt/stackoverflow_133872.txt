Coding only you can only keep your own source files tidy, well commented, keep the bug count low with tests. But you are going to need external tools for tracking progress and bugs (bugzilla, yoxel, trac, gantt diagram tools, Mylyn for Eclipse, a blog, whatever). In these cases the people and the discipline and the good habits and the leadership are the overwhelming force, no software tools and no offert from the individual can win alone.
