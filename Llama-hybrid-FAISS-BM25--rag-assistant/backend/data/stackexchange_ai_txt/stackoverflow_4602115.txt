drag and drop with raphael

hello I am new to using the raphael javascript library I am trying to create a simple drag and drop; to be able to drag a clone shape from outside the canvas into the canvas R and I want to be able to delete the selected clone if the user clicks on it (user press delete on selected clone and clone gets removed) I also want to copy the clone and paste it. Here is my code: Raphael Play #canvas_container { width: 500px; border: 1px solid #aaa; } window.onload = function() { var nowX, nowY, w = 500, h=400, r=30, R = Raphael("canvas_container", w, h), c = R.circle(100, 100, r).attr({ fill: "hsb(.8, 1, 1)", stroke: "none", opacity: .5, cursor: "move" }); var clone=c.clone(); var start = function () { // storing original coordinates this.ox = this.attr("cx"); this.oy = this.attr("cy"); this.attr({opacity: 1}); }, move = function (dx, dy) { // move will be called with dx and dy // restrict movement of circle to within boundaries if (this.ox + dx = 0 + r && this.oy + dy >= 0 + r) { this.attr({cx: this.ox + dx, cy: this.oy + dy}); } // else nothing }, up = function () { // restoring state this.attr({opacity: .5}); }; clone.drag(move, start, up); }; // Create Context Menu
