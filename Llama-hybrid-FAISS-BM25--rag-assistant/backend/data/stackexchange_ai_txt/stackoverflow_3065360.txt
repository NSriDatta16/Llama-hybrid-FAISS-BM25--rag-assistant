How to enable a two-finger drag on a mac in Silverlight?

In a Silverlight 4 application I have a ScrollViewer which I enable the user to scroll with the mouse wheel by using SetIsMouseWheelScrollingEnabled(): CodeBoxScrollViewerModelSingular.SetIsMouseWheelScrollingEnabled(true); However, someone tested it on a Mac and said: The only problem I noticed on a quick test was that I couldn't scroll down by using a two-finger drag , which has been standard UI behavior on the Mac for several years now. Is there any way to enable a "two-finger drag" on the Mac as you can enable mouse wheel scrolling?
