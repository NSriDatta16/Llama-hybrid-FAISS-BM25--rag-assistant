What can be causing the problem that I can't make a screenshot from my iPhone app in the Organizer window?

For some reason, when I press "Capture" while my device is connected and running the app (launched via Build & Run in Xcode), nothing happens. Never get a screenshot. iPhone OS 3.0. What can be the problem.
