For understanding the foundational debate between frequentists and Bayesians, it would be hard to find a more authoritative voice than Bradley Efron. This topic has been a theme he has touched on numerous times in his career, but personally I found one of his older papers helpful: Controversies in the Foundations of Statistics (this one won an award for expository excellence).
