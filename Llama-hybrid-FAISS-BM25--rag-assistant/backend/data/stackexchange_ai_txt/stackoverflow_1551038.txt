You should most definitely adapt your output for mobile devices when the content is accessed via a mobile device. Whether you will do it by separating the mobile presentation on a subdomain or a special folder or not is totally irrelevant. / 3. Mobile is way more than just Opera Mini. Various mobile device browsers support various degrees of rich content (JavaScript, CSS etc.) You should look into detecting what features are supported by the visitors browser/device and serve the appropriately rich/"poor" content. You should take a look at WURFL and Device Atlas which are two main databases of mobile device useragents which allow you to serve only the content that the useragent can consume. There are many emulators out there, some better and some worse, that emulate various mobile device browsers. Off the top of my head, the two I've used are Yo Space SmartPhone Emulator ( website broken atm ) and Mobi TLD's emulator . There are also vendor specific (Nokia, SE) developer tools you should be able to find that emulate the vendor's devices.
