Alternative to Apache Spark?

I have been looking for a comprehensive alternative to Apache Spark for Big Data analytics/machine learning and couldn't find one. The ones which I have come across are: Apache Flink Google DataFlow Apache Storm SAS Can any of these can be considered as a complete alternative/better than Spark? Or Spark is the only comprehensive Big Data analytics/machine learning engine there is these days?
