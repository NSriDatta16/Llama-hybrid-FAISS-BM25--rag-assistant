Help understanding how the cointegration equation for VECM models are derived

I am learning about Vector Error Correction Models from Sean Becketti's "Introduction to Time Series using Stata". While I know how to run the Stata commands to estimate the VECM, I have no idea why the author is interpreting certain components of the VECM the way he is. There are no derivations of the model, and thus, it is very hard for me to accept his interpretation of the model. The author starts by assuming that two cointegrated series obey the following relationship. $$ y_{t} = \alpha_{1}y_{t-1}+\gamma_{0}z_{t}+\gamma_1z_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t} $$ He then goes on to subtract $y_{t-1}$ from both sides and adds and subtracts $z_{t-1}$ from the RHS. Rearrangement yields the following. $$ \Delta y_{t}=(\alpha_{1}-1)y_{t-1}+\gamma_{0}\Delta z_{t}+(\gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1})z_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t} $$ Rearranging again gives, $$ \Delta y_{t} = \gamma_{0}\Delta z_{t}-\underbrace{\lambda(y_{t-1}-\theta z_{t-1})}_{Cointegrating Equation}+\epsilon_{t} $$ Where $\lambda=(1-\alpha_{1})$ and $\theta = \frac{\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}}{\alpha_{1}-1}$ Here are my questions for you guys. 1) Why is $(y_{t-1}-\theta z_{t-1})$ the long run relationship? The author never explains this in the book. 2) The author says that non-zero values of the cointegrating eq should be interpreted as errors. Why is this? 3) Lastly, can you direct me to a book or paper that derives this model? I am looking for something that explains it at the level of detail that introductory Econometrics texts explain OLS models. So for instance, if I was learning the OLS, I would like a book to derive the SSE, take the derivative of the SSE, set it equal to 0 and solve for the betas, and then explain the intuition behind why those steps had been taken. Thanks a ton. Look forward to hearing back from you.
