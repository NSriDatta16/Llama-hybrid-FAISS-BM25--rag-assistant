The general principle about finding text based on meaning similarity is called distributional semantics . The main idea is that words with a similar meaning statistically tend to co-occur with the same context words. This is the basis for many standard tasks like topic modeling , word sense disambiguation/induction , and generally for everything related to semantics. The problem you're describing is essentially information retrieval : given a query expressed as one or several words, find the "documents" in a corpus which are semantically similar to this query. [edit] Depending what the data looks like, you might be interested in the more specific task of semantic textual similarity .
