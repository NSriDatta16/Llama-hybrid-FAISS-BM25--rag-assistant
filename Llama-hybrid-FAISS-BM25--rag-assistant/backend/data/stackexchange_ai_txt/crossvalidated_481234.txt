What is the best method to predict the water consumption of EACH customer for the next month?

Say we have a dataset that has the following attributes: customer_id: There are a total of 1000 customers, each of them with a unique customer_id observation_date: The date on which we last observed the amount of water a certain customer has consumed (yyyy/mm/dd) amount_consumed: The amount of water a customer had consumed on the observation date (since the last observation date) Now, as I said, there are a total of 1000 customers, all with observations taken at different intervals. The intervals are between 30~45 days and mostly unequal for each customer. The data spans over 2 years , and we have about 19~24 observation for each customer (19~24 observations per customer_id). Here's a sample data for one customer: The customers live in a residential area of a large city, with particularly hot summers and normal temperature conditions in the other seasons. From what I understand, we need to use Time Series Forecasting methods on this data. If I want to forecast the amount of water consumed by every customer in the next month, do I have to train a different Time Series model for every single user? (e.g. train 1000 different Time Series models, each belonging to a certain customer_id) Also what algorithm would you recommend for this type of thing (ML, etc.)? Thanks in advance!
