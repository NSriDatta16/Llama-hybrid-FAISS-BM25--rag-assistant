You have a binary classifier and the performance of your deep neural network classifier can be measured/expressed using the ROC curve. You want your classifier to be performing such as the ROC curve is following as much as possible to the left and above the diagonal. If the curve is very close to the diagonal, the classifier is random. If the curve is below the diagonal, your classifier is worse than random; (probably the training labels and test labels are inverted).
