You would be looking for BOOST_FOREACH - they have done all the work for you already! If you do want to roll your own, you can declare a block anywhere in C++, which resolves your scope issue with your intermediate storage of itr->second ... // Valid C++ code (which does nothing useful) { int a = 21; // Which could be storage of your value type } // a out of scope here { int a = 32; // Does not conflict with a above }
