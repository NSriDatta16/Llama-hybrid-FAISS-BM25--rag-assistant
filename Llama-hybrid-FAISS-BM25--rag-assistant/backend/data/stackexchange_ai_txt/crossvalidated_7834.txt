I recommend using ARIMA with checks for level shift, trends, and interventions. You can't just try and model the data with the only intent of identifying a trend. It is more complex than just a single focus. Let me explain.... In order to determine if there is a trend, you need to be careful as the trend may be just a change in the intercept or also known as a "level shift". You also need to be aware that you can't assume the trend started at the beginning of the time series as we are taught in Economics classes so this is an iterative process to determine the beginning and end of the trend. You will also need to determine your threshold of how many periods before you can "call" a trend. You will also need to be adjusting for interventions as they can skew the t-test when trying to identify a trend.
