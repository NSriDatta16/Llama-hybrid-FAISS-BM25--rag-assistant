create a list of some sort on the server side to keep track of control id's when you render the page for whatever reason, write those id's out in a script block (put them in an array or whatever) when you need to submit your values, you can use the javascript array contents to reference the controls. you might have to do a little more work to find your actual values. for ingragistics' fancy-pants controls they provide a special method to get information about the "control" as a whole. rad controls might have something similar.
