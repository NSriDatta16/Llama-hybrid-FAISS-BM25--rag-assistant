Heavy use of templates for mobile platforms

I've been flicking through the book Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu and it seems interesting stuff. However it makes very extensive use of templates and I would like to find out if this should be avoided if using C++ for mobile platform development (Brew MP, WebOS, iOS etc.) due to size considerations. In Symbian OS C++ the standard use of templates is discouraged, the Symbian OS itself uses them but using an idiom known as thin templates where the underlying implementation is done in a C style using void* pointers with a thin template layered on top of this to achieve type safety. The reason they use this idiom as opposed to regular use of templates is specifically to avoid code bloating. So what are opinions (or facts) on the use of templates when developing applications for mobile platforms.
