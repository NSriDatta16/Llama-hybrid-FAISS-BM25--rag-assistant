The proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$ you use in the variance should be the true proportions under the null hypothesis, where $p_1=p_2+c$. Obviously you don't know what these are (other than $c$) so you have to estimate them from your data. Either of the formulae you have reasonable estimates, but it is possible to combine them. Consider we start with the obvious estimates $\hat{p_1}=\frac{X_1}{n_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}=\frac{X_2}{n_2}$. This won't do because they are unlikely to be exactly $c$ different. Consider an alternative estimate of $\hat{p_1}=\frac{X_2}{n_2}+c=\hat{p_2}+c$. Then you might construct a weighted average of your two estimates of $p_1$: $\hat{p_{1b}}=\frac{n_2(\hat{p_2}+c)+n_1\hat{p_1}}{n_1+n_2}$ which reduces to: $\hat{p_{1b}}=\frac{X_2+n_{2}c+X_1}{n_1+n_2}$ So then I'd use that in the formula to estimate the standard error of the distribution $\sigma_{\hat{p}_{1b} - \hat{p}_2}=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{1b}(1-\hat{p}_{1b})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$ In practice, my experience is that this sort of thing doesn't make much difference... With regard to your post script, the reason the difference is asymptotically normal is, as you guess, because the linear combination of two normal distributed random variables is also normally distributed (and the same goes when the normality is only asymptotic).
