The null should be easy as it is almost always the same form, $H_0 = \mu =\mu_0$. However, the alternative can be one of the three: $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$ $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$ $H_a: \mu To know what form of the alternative to use we must look at the research question. Here the research question asks "Can we conclude the group of 50 is fitter than the national average. Let Î¼ be the national average score." which does indicate a direction. This is a single mean test as we have the true average national, so for the null we would have: $H_0: \mu = 72$ The question is, does this group of 50 have a higher average than the national average? In other words, is the true average score of the group of 50 higher than the national average?
