Document Database Design: Multi-level categories (MongoDB specifically)

I'm trying to figure out the proper way to think about this problem for a document based data storage system. I've got the simple case of a two-tier category system, where there are Industries and Industry Groups (think Plumbing and Home Services). My first thought was the document would be Industry Group and it would have Industries inside it, but the issue is that most of the related data will be to an Industry. I'm not sure if it's 'kosher' to have data relating to sub-items within a document. For instance, an article might be assigned to an industry, not to a group - so how does that reference look (assuming the link was from a non-nested document)? Anyway, some general insight into the right way of thinking about this would be great.
