In Gtk, when using Drag and Drop in a TreeView, how do I keep from dropping between rows?

I'm testing a window that looks something like this: Dragging a Tag to a Card links the Tag to the Card. So does dragging a Card to a Tag. It's meaningless to drop a tag between two cards, or a card between two tags. I can ignore these outcomes in the Handle...DataReceived function like this: if (dropPos != TreeViewDropPosition.IntoOrAfter && dropPos != TreeViewDropPosition.IntoOrBefore) return; However, when dragging, the user still sees the option to insert: How do I prevent this from happening?
