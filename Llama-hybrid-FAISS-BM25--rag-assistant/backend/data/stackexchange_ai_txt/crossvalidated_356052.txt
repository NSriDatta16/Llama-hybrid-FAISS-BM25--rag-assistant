Build Time Series Regression Model with categorical and numerical variables using R

Could anyone explain to me how to build a time series model with regression components and categorical variables? For example, an AR(1) model with x1,x2,x3 as the regression variables where s=sector, r=rating,t=time So far I tried ARIMA, sector = as.factor(tbSector) rating = as.factor(tbRating) fit=arima(y,order=c(1,0,0),xreg=as.matrix(sector,rating,x1,x2,x3)) but output an error at xreg saying Error in solve.default(res$hessian * n.used, A). Can this problem be resolved via panel regression?
