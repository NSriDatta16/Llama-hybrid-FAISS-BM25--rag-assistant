Optimize memory usage of a collection of Strings in Java

I have a large number of name - value pairs (approx 100k) that I need to store in some sort of cache (say a hash map) where the value is a string with an average of about 30k bytes in size. Now I know for a fact that a large number of the values have exactly the same string data. In order to avoid having to allocate the identical string data several times, I would like to somehow reuse a previously allocated string thus consuming less memory. In addition this needs to be reasonably fast. i.e. scanning through all the previously allocated values one-by-one is not an option. Any recommendations on how I could solve this problem?
