There are two main kind of uses: providing compiler and linking flags for compiling the mono runtime inside your own application (embedding): mono-2.pc is an example. These are generally used as follows: gcc myprogram.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs mono-2` providing default lists of managed assemblies for particular subsystems: dotnet.pc provides the assemblies that are normally loaded by default by csc on Windows, gtk-sharp-2.0.pc lists the assemblies of the Gtk+ binding, etc. These are generally used as follows: gmcs -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0 myprogram.cs If you look inside the files, they have a Description field that should explain what each file is used for.
