Yes, branching is the right way to go. You usually branch when you want to move away from the main "branch" of your software and develop something new on a different "branch" - like branches on a tree. Branching might include a lot of thought of which branching strategy to use, so maybe this video with Brian Keller (Branching 101) can help you explain the different strategies, even though it is rather long with 42 Minutes. Personally scenarios always help me, so you should most definitely check out the codeplex Project on TFS 2010 Branching stragies .
