I'd get rid of wizard in whole. They are the most unpleasant things I've ever used. The problem that requires a wizard-application where you click 'next' is perhaps a problem where you could apply a better user interface in a bit different manner. Instead of bringing up a dialog with annoying 'next' -button. Do this: Bring up a page. When the user inserts the information to the page, extend or shorten it according to the input. If your application needs to do some processing to continue, and it's impossible to revert after that, write a new page or disable the earlier section of the current page. When you don't need any input from the user anymore or the app is finished, you can show a button or enable an existing such. I don't mean you should implement it all in browser. Make simply a scrolling container that can contain buttons and labels in a flat list. Benefit: The user can just click a tab, and you are encouraged to put all the processing into the end of filling the page.
