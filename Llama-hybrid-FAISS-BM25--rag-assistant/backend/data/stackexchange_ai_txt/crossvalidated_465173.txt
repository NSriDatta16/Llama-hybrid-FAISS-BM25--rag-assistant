PC1 values very high still there is no clear separation between groups

I have created a PCA plot for a dataset which has 6 groups. Post PCA I find very high values of PC1, but the groups are not clearly separated in the image. What could be the reason? Is there some other metric than PC1 values to check for group separation using PCA
