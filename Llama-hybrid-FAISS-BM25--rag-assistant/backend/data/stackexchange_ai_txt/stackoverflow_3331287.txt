Is there any algebraic structures used in functional programming other then monoid?

I recently getting to know about functional programming (in Haskell and Scala). It's capabilities and elegance is quite charming. But when I met Monads, which makes use of an algebraic structure named Monoid, I was surprised and glad to see the theoretic knowledge I have been learning from Mathematics is made use of in programming. This observation brought a question into my mind: Can Groups, Fields or Rings (see Algebraic Structures for others) be used in programming for more abstraction and code reuse purposes and achieving mathematic-alike programming? As I know, the language named Fortress (which I would surely prefer over any language once when its compiler is completed) defines these structure in its library code. But only uses I saw so far was for numeric types, which we already familiar with. Could there be any other uses of them? Best regards, ciun
