It sounds like you want to be more careful about your memory management in general; ie: either run the processing engine in a separate address space which carefully manages memory, or pre-allocate a sufficiently large chunk before memory gets too fragmented and manage images in that area only. If you're sharing address space with the .NET runtime in a long-running process, and you need large contiguous areas, it's always going to potentially fail at some point. Just my 2c.
