Is there any HTML CSS or JavaScript click through property?

For example on a drag and drop scenario.. I would love to be able to use the onmouseover of the thing we are dragging to, but unfortunately, the design calls for a ghost (copy of what is being dragged) which will surround the area of the mouse pointer. So the cursor is moused over the ghost the whole time.
