Which neural network package should i use?

I'm looking at running a neural network to predict the probability of a turtle becoming entangled in a fishing net. My input variables are fishing net characteristics that include continuos and categorical values (that i have scaled between 0 and 1) and my output is either 1(present) or 0 (absent). My question is: Am i correct in saying this is a classification problem and i should be using the 'nnet' package, since 'neuralnet' only deals with regression? Thanks for your time UPDATE: Here is some code i used for cross validating `ControlParameters parameterGrid Model1
