What names for standard website user roles?

What are the standard user role names that a majority of sites could all use? Below is a list of the best roles that I could think of (in order of importance), but I am hoping to find at least ten role names for a user system I am working on. admin: Manage everything manager: Manage most aspects of the site editor: Scheduling and managing content author: Write important content contributors: Authors with limited rights moderator: Moderate user content member: Special user access subscriber: Paying Average Joe user: Average Joe Another thing that I'm interested in, is whether or not these names translate over correctly into other languages.
