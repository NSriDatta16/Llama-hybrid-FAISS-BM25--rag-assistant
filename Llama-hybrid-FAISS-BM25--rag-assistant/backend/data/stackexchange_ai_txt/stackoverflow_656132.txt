My immediate suggestion is to turn plugin B into a fragment for plugin A rather than a separate plugin, which would eliminate the issues. That said, I think you have your manifests switched; plugin B which is attempting to perform the JNI calls should have Eclipse-BuddyPolicy:registered , and plugin A should be depending on and registering with plugin B. That said, after reading the buddyloading docs , I'm not certain that the buddyloading policy works for non-Java class files.
