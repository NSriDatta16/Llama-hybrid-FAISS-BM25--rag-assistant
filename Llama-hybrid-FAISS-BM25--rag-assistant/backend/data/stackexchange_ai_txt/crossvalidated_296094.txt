I'm not sure how meaningful it is to put a 'confidence interval' on an $x$ value. In regression models (including logistic regression, as here), we consider the $x$ values to be fixed and known a-priori . Instead, I think I would fit your model and then compute the $90\%$ confidence band (or $95%$ one-sided confidence band) around the predicted probabilities. I would then find the point where the lower limit of the band equaled whatever probability you were interested in. If the function were monotonically increasing, your 'pseudo-confidence interval' would be all $x$ values greater than or equal to that point. (If the fitted function were monotonically decreasing—i.e., a single variable with no additional functions of it, such as a squared term, and a negative coefficient—then the 'pseudo-confidence interval' would be all $x$ values less than or equal to that point.) If you are married to the idea of a confidence interval on $x$ itself, I suppose I would bootstrap. (I have an outline of a basic bootstrapping algorithm here: How do I compare bootstrapped regression slopes? ) For this approach, I would find the $x$ value that corresponded to the predicted probability you were interested in on each iteration. Then you could determine the confidence interval from the bootstrapped sampling distribution.
