In industry, what type of new data science algorithms does one develop?

I've seen several job descriptions for data science which include developing a novel algorithm to be a part of production environments. Can you give some input of what could be meant here exactly? Would they mean an algorithm that behaves somewhat of an ETL: getting the data, cleaning it, storing it, and running a known model on it? Or something more complex like building variations of known prediction algorithms? Some examples will really be nice, as I'm studying to go into this field.
