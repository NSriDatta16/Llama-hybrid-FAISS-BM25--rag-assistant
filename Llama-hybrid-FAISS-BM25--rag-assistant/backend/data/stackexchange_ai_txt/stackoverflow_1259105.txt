iphone UITextView manually registerring touches

I'm currently working on an app with this structure: I have a view controller which we will call MainViewController, that handles all touch events for the application. MainViewController has as an instance variable, a view called canvasView. canvasView has as a UITextView called hiddenTextView. Theres other invisible views and such so UITextView is not the first to register touches. How do I get the UITextView to register touches in this configuration? Specifically to make selections from the autoCorection box (Actually its for Japanese Kanji selection, but I assume its a similar mechanism). I've tried: [canvasView.hiddenTextView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event] from the MainViewController's touchesbegan method. I've done this for touchesBegan, moved, and Ended. I think it actually worked for one out of the 50 or so runs I've tried, but I don't know what changed. Any ideas on how I can get this to work?
