One option would be to label all the start times as +1 and the end times as -1 then create a three column table of times (both start and ends), label (+1 or -1), and number of staff at that time (starts with zero and adds or subtracts staff using the label) and sort the whole thing in time order. This time series now is a summary descriptor of your staff levels and the labels are also a series as well. Now you can apply time series statistics to both to look for daily, weekly or monthly patterns.
