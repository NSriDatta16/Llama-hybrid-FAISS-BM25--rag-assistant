Determining if a prefix exists in a set

Given a set of strings, say: "Alice" "Bob" "C" "Ca" "Car" "Carol" "Caroling" "Carousel" and given a single string, say: "Carolers" I would like a function that returns the smallest prefix not already inside the array. For the above example, the function should return: "Caro". (A subsequent call would return "Carole") I am very new to Ruby, and although I could probably hack out something ugly (using my C/C++/Objective-C brain), I would like to learn how to properly (elegantly?) code this up.
