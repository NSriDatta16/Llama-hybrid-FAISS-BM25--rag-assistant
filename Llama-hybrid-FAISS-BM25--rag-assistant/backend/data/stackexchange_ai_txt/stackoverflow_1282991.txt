Is it possible to stop touches from getting added to the queue?

I have disabled interactions in my primary view (which contains some subviews I use as buttons). I keep this disabled while I have a secondary view up indicating network activity (loading data). When it is finished, I re-enable interactions in the primary view. This is so the user isn't tapping those buttons while the network operation takes place. Anyway, all seems well, but the if the user starts tapping buttons in the primary view, once the re-enable occurs those touch events (from the past few seconds) actually trigger. Not the touches-began, which highlights the buttons, but the functions called on the touches-ended. Its like its queued the whole time it was disabled and "races to catch up". It is very bizarre, why would touch events be queued while the view has its user interaction disabled?
