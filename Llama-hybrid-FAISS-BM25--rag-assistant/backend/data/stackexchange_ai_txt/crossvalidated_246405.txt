Form hypothesis and test it using given data

In country A, during the ten-year period $2002 - 2012$ judges sentenced convicts to the death penalty 45 times. In contrast, the number of such penalties in 2013 was $19$ and in $2014$ it was $4$. An analyst claimed that the evident change in the rate of conviction is not statistically significant because of the sample. I am trying to formulate a possible hypothesis that the analyst might have had in mind, given ONLY these data, and carry out a test to check whether or not the result is statistically significant. My idea for the hypothesis was the following: \begin{align*} H_0&: \mu_{x \le 2012} = \mu_{x > 2012} \\ H_1&: \mu_{x \le 2012} 2012} \end{align*} where $\mu_{x \le 2012}$ denotes the average annual number of convictions up to $2012$ and $\mu_{x > 2012}$ denotes the average annual number of prosecutions from $2012$ onwards. Assuming that this is a reasonable hypothesis, I am thinking of computing the likelihood ratio statistic and then proceeding from there. However, that statistic requires me to compute the likelihood function under the null and divide it by the maximum of the likelihood function under the full model. How is am I to approach this since I am not given anything about the distribution of the observations? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, especially ones regarding the correctness of the stated hypothesis.
