By convention, classes start with capitals, and variables don't. There's nothing that stops the behavior of having a class with the same name as a variable. The only time you can't do that is for reserved words. For example you couldn't do int int = 3; // not allowed Integer Integer = 3; // allowed, but discouraged If your code were to be more conventional, it would be this: class Cricket{ void bat(){ System.out.println("sachin"); } public static void main(String ar[]){ Cricket cricket=new Cricket(); cricket.bat(); } } Having the variable the exact same as the class can cause some confusion with static methods as well. Consider this: void foo(Runnable r) throws Exception { Thread Thread = new Thread(r); Thread.start(); Thread.sleep(100); // Okay, now WTF does this do? }
