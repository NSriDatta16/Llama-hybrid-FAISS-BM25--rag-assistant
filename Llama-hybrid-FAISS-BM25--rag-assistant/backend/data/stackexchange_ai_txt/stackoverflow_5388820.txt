Aiii, behaviour that could have been expected. Draggable sets the Helper x and y axis to the cursor x and y positions on mousechange. But, your mouse x and y axis are calculated differently without taking into account that you're in a rotated div. The calculated x and y values are given to the div, which is placed with in mind that the div is rotated. That's why when you move your mouse up while dragging, the block position changes 45deg relative to your mousemovement. You could try editing draggable itself (or overwriting some functions) by using Guffa's explanation on how to get the x and y position in a rotated div using sin() and cos() but I think it's going to be hard if not impossible to fix yourself. There's no reason for draggable to act this way when the draggable div is inside the rotated div, so it's probably a bug. Good luck mate!
