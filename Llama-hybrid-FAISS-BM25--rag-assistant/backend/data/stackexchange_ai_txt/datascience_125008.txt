The answer is in your screenshot: For each of these (special tokens and sentences), we also specify the corresponding token type ID after a colon Therefore, the :0 marks the associated tokens to have token ID 0, while :1 marks the associated tokens to have token ID 1. Token IDs are a generic concept to mark "something else" apart from the tokens themselves. They are usually used to mark the tokens belonging to the first and second segments when the input is comprised of both of them. In the original BERT article , these are referred to as "segment embeddings": (where Eᴀ equates to ":0" in huggingface output, and Eʙ equatest to ":1")
