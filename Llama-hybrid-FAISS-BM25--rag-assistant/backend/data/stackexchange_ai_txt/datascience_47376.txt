Please avoid using piecewise linear activations for second or higher-order ODEs, as the second and higher-order derivatives of these functions are zero. Alternatively, Tanh activations might be a good option. I recommend using deeper networks. Based on my experience, depth can significantly improve the results when solving differential equations with neural networks.
