How to model Beta distribution with Uniform prior in RJAGS?

I'm having trouble modeling a Bayesian problem in RJAGS. I'm analyzing depth damage curves. In 1988, the US Army Corps of Engineers estimated that 1 foot of flooding would result in 32% mean damage with standard deviation 0.96. The sample size of this estimate is unknown. Therefore I would like to use a Uniform prior of dunif(0.217, 0.249) . For a likelihood function, a 2020 paper found that 1-foot of flooding can be better approximated by the beta distribution with alpha=0.48 and beta=0.80 , based on sample size ~ 2M. Thus, I would like my likelihood function to be dbeta(alpha, beta) . What would be a good way to factor in the observed alpha and beta within the likelihood in a JAGS model while still sampling from a distribution? I have my most recent attempt (with no inclusion of observed values in the JAGS model) pasted below: library(rjags) alpha
