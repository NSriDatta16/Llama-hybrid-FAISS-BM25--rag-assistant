C# wpf: Need to add mouseclick event to certain text within a textbox

I have a textbox with a paragraph of information. There are certain words in the paragraph that i want the user to be able to click on, and when clicked, a different textbox is populated with more information. I know that you can have the event for the whole textbox, but that isn't want i want. I only want to call that event when certain words within the box are clicked.
