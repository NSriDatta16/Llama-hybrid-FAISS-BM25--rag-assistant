Keeping a web app project organized?

I'm writing a web app, using jsp to create the page content. I need a pretty good amount of javascript to make the app work. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to structure my project, such that it doesn't become a mess? This is a broad question, but the basic problem is that I'm insert javascript code directly into my jsp content. Then I might have some external js files. Ids and such are strewn between multiple files. I'm not really sure what a best practice is for keeping this type of project organized. Do you always keep your javascript in separate files? There has to be a few hooks in the jsp pages though for them, right? I tried using GWT because I'm really a c/java developer, and I was hoping it would help keep my project more organized (definitely helps) - but GWT is a pain to use with jsp, it really wants you to do all UI generation client side after the page is done loading, doesn't work for what I need to do. Again, broad question, any tips would be great, Thanks
