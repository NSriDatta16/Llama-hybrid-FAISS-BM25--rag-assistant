Test for significance of peaks (maximum) in time series

I have a time series of values, something like this: value 2015-12-01 577 2015-12-02 672 2015-12-03 793 2015-12-04 1733 2015-12-05 3441 2015-12-06 2765 2015-12-07 3084 2015-12-08 2624 2015-12-09 1896 2015-12-10 1617 If I plot it, it looks like this: It is obvious, that we have a peak around the end of January. I now need to show that this is a significant difference cause by a predefined event. So far I used a simple 'abnormal value' method, basically subtracting the mean (except event window) from every value. A t-test on the abnormal values of the event compared to expected 0 (because we subtract the mean so population mean of difference should be 0, right?). In this case i get the following mean difference or abnormal values for the days around the event: 2016-01-22 151.368194 2016-01-23 5965.368194 2016-01-24 1922.368194 2016-01-25 -102.631806 2016-01-26 -188.631806 The t-test says its not significantly different from 0. So I need to conclude that there is no effect of the event, even though its obviously a peak. I thought about regression as well, difference to mean as dependent variable, but what do I use as independent variables? Just dummy for event window? How do I test for significance of that peak?
