Why is Matlab's cluster method able to accept only two inputs? What does it mean when it does? Ex: clusterX = cluster(gmfit,X);

Matlab's cluster method documentation says cluster takes in 3 arguments: T = cluster(Z,'Cutoff',C) https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/cluster.html But line 56 inside the cluster function seems to prohibit having only two variables for varagin: '''matlab if nargin error(message('stats:cluster:TooFewInputs')); end ''' Why is this code fence formatting failing? Anyway, I interpret the above test with nargin However, in the Gaussian Mixture Model tutorial, cluster() seems to take in only two arguments and it runs fine. Why is cluster() able to take only two arguments, and what is it doing in the below case? Example: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/clustering-using-gaussian-mixture-models.html I assumed that the cluster method for this
