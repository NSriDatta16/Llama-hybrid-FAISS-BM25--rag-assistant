Does your app require the C interface? OpenCV actually considers it deprecated / done with, the new API is C++. A port of this interface and sample calibration app are here: http://code.google.com/p/android-opencv/ It took me a while to get sold on the new C++, but I had to admit it was nice to not have to do cvReleaseMat() and go back and forth between IplImage and CvMat all the time.
