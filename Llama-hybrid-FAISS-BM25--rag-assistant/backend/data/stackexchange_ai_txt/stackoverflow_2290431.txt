if the two ResultSet s are from the same database then why not combine them during the retrieval by using union ; e.g. select A, B from C union select A, B from D However, if this is not an option then I suggest defining a Row class to represent a Row extracted from your ResultSet and implementing equals / hashCode to allow the Row to be compared for equality. Then simply add each Row to a Set (e.g. HashSet ) in order to remove duplicates.
