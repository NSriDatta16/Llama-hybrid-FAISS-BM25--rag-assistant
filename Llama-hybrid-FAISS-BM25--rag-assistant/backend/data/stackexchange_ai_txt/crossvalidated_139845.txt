My personal favourite for beginners is Muirhead (1982). It is much more intuitive and clearer than any other book I have encountered. It covers all bases of MANOVA, ANOVA etc. and the first three chapters will give you the toolkit to understand incredibly deep concepts. Also there is Anderson's textbook but that is very dense and less useful. Johnson and Kotz is mainly a reference to look things up. Muirhead is here . Also Clive Granger has a very good reputation for writing textbooks if you're into time series. Conclusion: go with Muirhead's book. It will make you understand things and is much better suited to beginners.
