This topic was discussed previously on QuantStatExchange here . Some of my take-ways together with my knowledge include: Start by assuming the data follows a Log-normal distribution, so that it makes sense to apply the suggested de-trending formula: $${Log(CurrentPrice/LastPrice) - Average(Log(CurrentPrice/LastPrice)}$$ De-trend for the frequency scale of interest. Finally, note a possible purpose for detrending so as to satisfy the null hypothesis for an application of a bootstrap test, wherein the historical mean should be zero. This is accomplished by detrending the entire data series removing any long term trend, followed by subtracting the average return. This creates the so-called zero centered adjustment as cited in the EBTA book.
