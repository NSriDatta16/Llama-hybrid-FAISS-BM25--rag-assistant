Okay so, if you followed the steps to reproduce I will now add the steps to solve this: Steps to fix this problem Subclass a UIViewController . I called mine CombinationsViewController . In this controller add a property as an IBOutlet for the combinations Table ViewController from step 6 below. Don't forget to import the right stuff, and synthesize the table view controller, also release it in the dealloc method. In FirstView.xib change the File's Owner class to this latest subclass. Link it's combinationsViewController outlet to the Combinations Table View Controller in the FirstView.xib made in step 7 below. Open the TabBarController in your MainWindow.xib select the first tab, and in the Identity Inspector change the class to the latest subclass ( CombinationsViewController ). That makes the table populate normally and scroll stuff. Now I'm going to move on finally and get some custom table view cell stuff happening and actually make my app do stuff. Enumerated Steps to reproduce as a reference to the fix: Made a new "Tab Bar Application" in Xcode. Opened the Tab View Controller , dragged the prefab view for the first tab out into the MainWindow.xib Made a new view based xib called FirstView.xib as an analogue to the given SecondView.xib , and put that prefab view into this xib. Linked the view to the File's Owner 's view outlet. I modified the view to contain two UITextField s for inputs, and a UITableView for output. I subclassed the UITableViewController as CombinationsTableView wherein I populated an NSArray property named combinations with 11 strings, and then added the cell.text = [combinations objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; code where there had only been the comment about setting up the cell. In FirstView.xib I added a Table View Controller and set it's class name to match the name of this new subclass, and control-dragged the Table View in my view onto this Combinations Table View Controller twice. Once linking the dataSource and once the delegate . At this point the table does render with data, but the scrolling breaks. This is because the CombinationsTableView isn't retained anywhere. And that's very unclear to a first time IB user. So you need to apply the fix listed above. The first person to summarize this in their answer get the correct answer check mark. E.G. Make a viewController subclass that is the file owner of FirstView.xib and contains an retained IBOutlet you can link to your table view controller in the same xib file.
