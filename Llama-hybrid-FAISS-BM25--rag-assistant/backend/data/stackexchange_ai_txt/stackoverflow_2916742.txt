If I use Server Authentication, I'm concerned that the username and password for the account will be stored in plain text in the app.config file, and therefore leave the database vulnerable. You could always create a connection string in your app.config and encrypt that connection string section . This works for ASP.NET as well as for console apps, Winforms apps, WPF apps - it's a .NET base technology, really. See Jon Galloway's Encryping Passwords in a .NET app.config for a non-ASP.NET sample of how to do this. Using Windows Authenticaiton will avoid this issue, however it would mean giving every member of staff within our organisation read/write access to the database in order to run the app correctly. Yes - but you can ease the burden: you can authenticate a Windows / AD group - everyone who's a member of that group has access - no need to individually permissions each user if you use views for data retrieval and stored procs for insert / update / delete, you won't even need to give those users direct table access and you can shield your database from inappropriate manipuluation
