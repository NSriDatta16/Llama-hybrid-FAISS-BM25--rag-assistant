Choosing proper Frequency argument for time series object

I have a year-long data of an anemometric tower. The variable that I'm interested in is wind speed at 50m . My idea is to train with this data using some models (Arima, Sarima, Holt-Winters, NNETAR, and HybridModel) then predict. But I'm having some doubts about creating the time series object. I have 52704 observations starting from 2008-01-01 00:00:00 to 2008-12-31 23:50:00 . Every 10 seconds a measurement is made, so in 1 minute I have 6 observations along 11 variables. I'm don't know if the right value for the frequency argument is 6. Because since the measurement is so short I think the "cycle" is a minute. So the frequency maybe 6, since 60/10 = 6. In such a case how to choose the proper frequency value and how to validate it? p.s: I stumble in this question and this post , but I'm still not understanding how to choose the proper "cycle" for my case.
