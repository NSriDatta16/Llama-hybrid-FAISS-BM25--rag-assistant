You may have already answered you own question here. Move your data contracts to a shared "Contracts" project, which will allow you to use the built in Refactor -> Rename option in Visual Studio to change the name, with the change being reflected in all of the projects in the solution. Update To clarify, the Contracts project is an internal "organisation" of your contracts. It allows many of your projects to reference one set of contracts. For example... WCF service exposes "List GetCustomerById(int id)". WCF service may call down to a processing layer, which might need to calculate something using another project etc. All of thes projects can use the single "Customer" definition from your Contracts project. Any consumer of the WCF service would get the definition of the Customer via the service reference. You wouldn't share your Contracts project or send the dll for their use.
