Convert the following expression w.r.t to the whole dataset instead of element of the dataset?

I am in the process of expressing the w in LSSVM with data points and constants. After I resolve the KKT conditions for the LSSVM I got $$w = \sum ^N _{i=1} \alpha_i x_i$$ Is it possible to convert the x_i in this expression to big X (X is the whole dataset, a matrix)? The "alpha" in this expression is the Lagrange multiplier and the "xi" is the element of the dataset(a datapoint, it can be a vector or a single element). I tried using trace of matrices but it didn't take me very far.
