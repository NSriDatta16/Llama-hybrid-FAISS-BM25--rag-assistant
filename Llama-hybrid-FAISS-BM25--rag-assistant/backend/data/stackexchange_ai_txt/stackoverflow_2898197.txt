The original etherpad.com has now gone away but at that link there is a list of clones. The instructions for embedding etherpads seems to have gone away with the rest of etherpad.com but I believe it's as simple as this: Replace "etherpad.com" with whatever clone you're using, "foo" with the name of your pad, and you may or may not want to change that fullScreen=1 to fullScreen=0 (or leave it off altogether).
