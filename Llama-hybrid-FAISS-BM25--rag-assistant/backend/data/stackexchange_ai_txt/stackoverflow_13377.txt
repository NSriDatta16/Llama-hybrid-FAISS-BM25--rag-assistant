Realistically, it probably averages out to 4 or 5 hours a day. Although its "lumpy" - there may be days where there could be 8 or 9 hours of it. Of all the software developers I know, the ones that write production code (as opposed to research) 4 to 5 seems to be the max of actual coding. There is a lot of other stuff that goes on. And to be honest there is a lot of procrastination. I find its a bit like writers block. sometimes its just hard to get started, but then a good 2 hour session is a LOT of work done. Its just all the preparation you have to go through, the experimentation to make sure you are taking the right approach. The endless amount of staring out the window and checking email etc...
