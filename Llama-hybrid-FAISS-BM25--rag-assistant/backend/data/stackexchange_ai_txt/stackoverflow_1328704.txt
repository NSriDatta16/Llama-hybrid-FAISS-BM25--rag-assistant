Can you insert blank lines in an already transformed PDF?

I have a situation where I need to increase the space between a table and the header on a PDF that has already been transformed from an XSL template. I need to insert an address in the newly created space. This part is easy enough and I can do that using a stamper and a new table. However, I am struggling to find a solution to move the grid down to make the space. Basically I am using FOP to create the PDF from an XSL template using code similar to the following: OutputStream out = new java.io.FileOutputStream(pdf); Driver driver = new Driver(); driver.setRenderer(Driver.RENDER_PDF); driver.setOutputStream(out); TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsl)); StringReader xmlStream = new StringReader(xmlData); Source xmlSource = new StreamSource(xmlStream); Result res = new SAXResult(driver.getContentHandler()); transformer.transform(xmlSource, res); Is it even possible to access the PDF in a way to add the new space? If so, what are my options? I should mention that I donâ€™t know at the time the transformation is happening that I will need the extra space. I only know I need it once I get a page count of the PDF. Any help is greatly appreciated!
