nltk custom tokenizer and tagger

Here is my requirement. I want to tokenize and tag a paragraph in such a way that it allows me to achieve following stuffs. Should identify date and time in the paragraph and Tag them as DATE and TIME Should identify known phrases in the paragraph and Tag them as CUSTOM And rest content should be tokenized should be tokenized by the default nltk's word_tokenize and pos_tag functions? For example , following sentense "They all like to go there on 5th November 2010, but I am not interested." should be tagged and tokenized as follows in case of that custom phrase is "I am not interested" . [('They', 'PRP'), ('all', 'VBP'), ('like', 'IN'), ('to', 'TO'), ('go', 'VB'), ('there', 'RB'), ('on', 'IN'), ('5th November 2010', 'DATE'), (',', ','), ('but', 'CC'), ('I am not interested', 'CUSTOM'), ('.', '.')] Any suggestions would be useful.
