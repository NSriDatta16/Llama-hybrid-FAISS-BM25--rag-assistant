If $response is a multi-dimensional array, you may fare best by serialize() ing it and urlencode() ing the result. It adds some overhead but not too much. However, transporting data through GET is seriously limited. The amount of data should not exceed 1-2 kilobytes. Source: For example here If your data is likely to exceed that limit, you should think about either transporting the data through POST or, if that's not possible, in a session or other kind of persistent storage.
