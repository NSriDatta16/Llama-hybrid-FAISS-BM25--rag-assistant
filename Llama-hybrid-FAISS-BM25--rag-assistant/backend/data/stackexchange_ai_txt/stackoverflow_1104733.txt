How can I get an ASP.NET Session variable into a javascript file?

I am refactoring a legacy web app. This app has a is using the onload event inside the body tag (On the Master page) to run this javascript script. Note this script tag is after the form element in the doc. I know the syntax looks hideous (or Visual Studio at least tells it is by the squiggles), but I'll be darned, the thing DOES indeed work. function DisplayPDF() { var strPDF strPDF = " "; if (strPDF.length != 0) { window.open(strPDF); } } My question is I'm trying to develop a more elegant solution. I have ASP.NET ajax and jQuery both available to me. I wrote a tiny asp.net ajax component that I want to use to handle this. Type.registerNamespace("ck"); ck.pdfOpener = function() { ck.pdfOpener.initializeBase(this); } ck.pdfOpener.prototype = { initialize: function() { ck.pdfOpener.callBaseMethod(this, 'initialize'); }, dispose: function() { ck.pdfOpener.callBaseMethod(this, 'dispose'); }, openPDF: function(){ //HOW CAN I RETRIEVE A SESSION VARIABLE HERE??? } } ck.ClientControl.registerClass('ck.pdfOpener', Sys.Component); if (typeof(Sys) !== 'undefined') Sys.Application.notifyScriptLoaded(); Can/Should I be doing it this way? Or should I create a WebService that returns said variable. Thanks for any advice. Cheers, ~ck in San Diego
