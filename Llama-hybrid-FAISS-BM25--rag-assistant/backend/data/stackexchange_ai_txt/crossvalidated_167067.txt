Often procedures will have some kind of tuning parameter or cutoff value that you can vary. At different values of this parameter the procedure will produce different sensitivity/specificity. It is this that is plotted by ROC curve For example in logistic regression where you are trying to do binary classification, the final outcome is a value between 0 and 1. What cutoff should you use to put a value into one category or another? 0.5 seems like a natural choice, but is this the best?
