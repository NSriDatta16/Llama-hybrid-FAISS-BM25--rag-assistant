Where are Magento's Admin Controllers?

I am trying to determine how a product is loaded from the admin panel and loaded into the edit panel in the admin panel. I am assuming that there is an admin controller somewhere, but for the life of me I cannot seem to locate it. Is there a logically way that admin controllers are stored?
