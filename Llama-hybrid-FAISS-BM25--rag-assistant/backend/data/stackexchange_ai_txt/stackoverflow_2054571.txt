Here's a solution that only starts the animation when the incoming property update is a certain value. Useful if you want to draw the user's attention to something with the animation, but afterwards the UI should return to it's default state. Assuming IsCritical is bound to a control (or even an invisible control) you add NotifyOnTargetUpdated to the binding and tie an EventTrigger to the Binding.TargetUpdated event. Then you extend the control to only fire the TargetUpdated event when the incoming value is the one you are interested in. So... public class CustomTextBlock : TextBlock { public CustomTextBlock() { base.TargetUpdated += new EventHandler (CustomTextBlock_TargetUpdated); } private void CustomTextBlock_TargetUpdated(object sender, DataTransferEventArgs e) { // don't fire the TargetUpdated event if the incoming value is false if (this.Text == "False") e.Handled = true; } } and in the XAML file .. .. .. ..
