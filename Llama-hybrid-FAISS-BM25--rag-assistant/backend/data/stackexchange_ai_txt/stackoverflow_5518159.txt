The pragmatic regex ( ]+) style=".*?" will solve this problem in all reasonable cases. The part of the match that is not the first captured group should be removed, like this: $output = preg_replace('/( ]+) style=".*?"/i', '$1', $input); Match a followed by one or more "not > " until we come to space and the style="..." part. The /i makes it work even with STYLE="..." . Replace this match with $1 , which is the captured group. It will leave the tag as is, if the tag doesn't include style="..." .
