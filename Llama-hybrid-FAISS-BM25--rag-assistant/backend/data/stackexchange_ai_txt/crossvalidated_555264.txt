Spline-transform regression - concept clarification

I am learning spline transformation and am confused about several concepts. Any guidance is all appreciated! Am I understanding this correctly: I should only spline-transform my continuous predictors if my logistic regression model does not have a good model fit? It appears that we cannot obtain the odds ratio from the spline-transformed logistic regression, is this correct? If so, how should I report the finding (as I always think odds ratio is the must-report outcomes in logistic regression)? Is it allowed to log transform some predictors and spline transform the others in my regression model or I 'MUST' keep their methods of transformation consistent?
