This literature extends back well into the 20th c with the work of people like Ludwig von Bertalanffny, Gregory Bateson's Steps to an Ecology of Mind , Kenneth Boulding's Ecodynamics , Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Discipline as well as systems thinkers such as Jay Forrestal. In terms of more purely theoretic and biologic thinking, the work of Robert Ulanowicz as articulated in his recent book A Third Window may be the closest to what you're looking for in integrating perspectives from thermodynamics and ecosystems with the history of science. But there are boatloads of other contributors to consider as well, e.g., H. Haken's Synergetics , Steven Strogatz book Sync , and so on. Let me know if you're interested in more of a reading list but this should definitely get you going.
