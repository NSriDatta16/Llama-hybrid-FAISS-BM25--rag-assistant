In order to embed a TrueType font in a Postscript document, you will first need to convert it to a Type 42 font. This conversion turns the font into postscript code. There are several small utilities for doing this conversion, or you can read the Type 42 specification and write your own code for it. Embedding Type 1 fonts is a lot easier. Linux ships with a large set of Type 1 fonts, and so does OS X if you have X11 installed. Generating PDF instead is also an option you may want to look into, since PDF can embed TrueType fonts directly.
