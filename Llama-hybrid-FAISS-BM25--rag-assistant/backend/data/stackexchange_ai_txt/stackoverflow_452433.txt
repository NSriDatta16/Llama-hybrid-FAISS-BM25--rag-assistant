If you can do it on 20 lines and then properly comment those lines I would say go for it. Not only are you making it easier to maintain by having less code to maintain, but you are also contributing to making your fellow programmers smarter. Pre-optimizations and clever hacks is one thing but smart algorithms is and have always been fair game. But keep those algorithms isolated in their own functions and remember to explain the input and output variables! Obligatory quote: “Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.” (Brian Kernigan)
