Methods for teasing apart the influence of different time series features on a target feature?

Are there any established methods for teasing apart the influence of different time series features on a target feature? To illustrate: The target: Sales volume of kittens. Features: Time of year, Average fluffiness, Average age, Discount factors etc... What would be the best method of finding out how influential each feature is over the sale of kittens? My first idea is to apply a regression model and then look at the weightings assigned to each feature. I am not sure how informative this will be though. Is there a better way? Perhaps some established statistical method? Something Python based would be fantastic. Thanks.
