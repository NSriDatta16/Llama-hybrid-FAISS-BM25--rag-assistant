I think the other answers so far have missed the point of your question, which is how to provoke the exception. Using a static technique like this, you really can't easily do it - you'd have to have a way of injecting the particular configuration into your test. I seem to remember that the .NET configuration management isn't particularly amenable to this, but I think it can be done. I don't have easy MSDN access right now, but try to find some way of loading an instance of a configuration instead of accessing it just with static methods. I may be wrong - there may be no way of doing it. Don't worry too much about 100% coverage - sometimes there are just conditions which are infeasible to test, unfortunately :(
