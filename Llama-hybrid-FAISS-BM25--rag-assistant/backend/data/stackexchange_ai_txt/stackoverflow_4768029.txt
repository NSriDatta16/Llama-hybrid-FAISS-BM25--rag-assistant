Coach a newbie through basic WPF? (I Do Not Grok It.)

Question is as it sounds. No matter how hard and how often I try to understand WPF, I feel like I'm hitting my head against a wall. I like Winforms, where everything makes sense. As an example, I'm trying to write a simple app that will allow me to lay out a bunch of 2-D paths (represented by polylines) and drag their vertices around, and have the vertex information synchronised with a presenter (that is, I suppose, a ViewModel) So the problem is thus: Make the window recognise an instance of IExtendedObjectPresenter as a data source; From a collection of IExtendedObject , draw one polyline for each IExtendedObject ; For each vertex in the extended object, represented by the collection IExtendedObject.Points , place a polyline vertex at the specified co-ordinates. The IDE is giving me no help at all here. None of the many properties available in XAML sound meaningful to me. Because so much seems to be done implicitly, there is no obvious place to just tell the window what to do. Before I get slated and told to RTFM, I would like to re-emphasise that I have researched the basic concepts of WPF a great many times. I know no more about it than I did when it was first released. It seems totally inpenetrable. Examples given for one type of behaviour are not in any way applicable to an even slightly different kind of behaviour, so you're back to square one. I'm hoping that repetition and targeted exampes might switch a light on in my head at some point.
