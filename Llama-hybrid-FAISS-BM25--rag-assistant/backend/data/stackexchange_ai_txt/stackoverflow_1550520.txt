Best Practices when Implementing IModelBinder

I'm looking for a set of best practices to use when implementing IModelBinder . I've read three different MVC books and each one does some slightly different stuff in their implementations without any real explanation. The Hanselman, Haack, Guthrie, Conery book doesn't even mention IModelBinder Palermo recommends extending DefaultModelBinder rather than direct implementation of IModelBinder , but I don't really see how to leverage the benefits Sanderson mentions updating existing Model instances, as well as calling ModelState.SetModelValue() to follow convention. I just want to make sure that my model binders are following conventions, and that I properly understand the entire ModelBindingContext . Any tips, tricks, GOOD tutorials to recommend?
