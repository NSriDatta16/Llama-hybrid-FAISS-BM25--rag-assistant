Is a linear model appropriate for this analysis?

I have one continuous dependent which is measured as a concentration., one categorical IV and one continuous covariate. The min value of dependent variable is 0.05 and the max value is 70. I applied the linear regression. I have a big violation of assumptions. I was wondering if applying the linear regression is appropriate for this model. I tried to remove the outliers in order to improve the model but I could not fix the problem. Also, I took log of the dependent variable and I could make the distribution of the residual skew to the right. But since so many observations are less than 1, I am not sure wether taking the log is a good idea or not. I have a unbalanced design. And I want to compare the average of dependent variable around the level of independent which has four levels by adjusting age.Any advice?
