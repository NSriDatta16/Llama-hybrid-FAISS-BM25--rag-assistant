How to loop through a bunch of sentences

I have a div which contains a bunch of statements. I organized these statements in a list for now but this can change. How can I display these statements one at time in a rotating manner (each maybe every 4 seconds). I'm also looking at having a pause button to hold the current statement in place but I want to get the basic thing first. Statement 1 Statement 2 Statement 3
