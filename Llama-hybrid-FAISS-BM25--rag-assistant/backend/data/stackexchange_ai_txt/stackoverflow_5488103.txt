Probably, you could obtain zipped artifacts manually, in your first build step, by constructing URL to the dependent configuration. In the build, you can get parameters of your dependent builds, which can help you to build the URL. URL looks like: http://your.server/(guestAuth|httpAuth)/repository/downloadAll/bt457/12345:id/artifacts.zip where bt457 - id of your build configuration 12345 - build id of the dependent build, which you should be able to obtain in your build as system property dep.bt457.teamcity.build.id read more here: http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD6/Predefined+Build+Parameters#PredefinedBuildParameters-DependenciesProperties All of this not very elegant, but it should work
