You can and should use these obfuscation tools but .net il is designed in such a way that it is very easy to reverse engineer. You will not be achieving any real security this way. The biggest mistake made here is commonly embedding credentials or encryption keys in the source code which bad guys can then disassemble and read. Be very sure you are not doing this. You can however test how well the obfuscator worked with the .net reflector which will disassemble .net code for you http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/
