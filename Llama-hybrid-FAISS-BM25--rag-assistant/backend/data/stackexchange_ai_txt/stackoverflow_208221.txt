It really depends on what language you're using, but in C# and Java I find IDEs beneficial for: Quickly navigating to a type without needing to worry about namespace, project etc Navigating to members by treating them as hyperlinks Autocompletion when you can't remember the names of all members by heart Automatic code generation Refactoring (massive one) Organise imports (automatically adding appropriate imports in Java, using directives in C#) Warning-as-you-type (i.e. some errors don't even require a compile cycle) Hovering over something to see the docs Keeping a view of files, errors/warnings/console/unit tests etc and source code all on the screen at the same time in a useful way Ease of running unit tests from the same window Integrated debugging Integrated source control Navigating to where a compile-time error or run-time exception occurred directly from the error details. Etc! All of these save time. They're things I could do manually, but with more pain: I'd rather be coding.
