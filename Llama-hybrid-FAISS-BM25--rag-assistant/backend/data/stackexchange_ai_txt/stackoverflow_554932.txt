If you are planning to use Sql Server 3.5 Compact read this blog . There are serious performance issues at SQL Server Compact and some code may be 100 times slower on the device compared to the desktop so always test your database code on the device. Setup unit and performance / integration testing on the device. Also very few people actually do this, it's not that complicated and far overweights the costs. If you deploy your code all the time use the network instead of ActiveSync. The easiest way is setting up a simple FTP server or TCP agent on the device.
