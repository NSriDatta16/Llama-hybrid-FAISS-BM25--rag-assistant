Yes. You need to: download and install a C/C++ compiler (I recommend TDragon's distribution of MinGW ), add the compiler to your PATH (the installer can do it for you most of the cases); verify it's done by opening cmd.exe and typing gcc -v and mingw32-make -v , both should give you half a screenful of version information if your path is set correctly, via cmd.exe , navigate to the folder in which the Makefile resides and call mingw32-make . From now on everything should compile automatically. If it doesn't, post the errors. Update: First of all, it'd be useful for you to get the MSys package. Install it and you'll have a more recent version of make (use it instead of mingw32-make from now on). About the CreateProcess bug, it has to do with the system PATH variable being too long. You'd need to do something like this: open cmd execute set PATH=c:/mingw32/bin;c:/msys/1.0/bin (change the paths here to reflect your own installation if it's different) then as before: navigate to your project's directory, run make . Everything should be smooth now if you're not missing any external libraries. BTW- remember not to install MinGW or MSys in directories with spaces.
