Prove data points not enough? Estimate required number of data points?

I am working on a problem with only ~ 30 data points, I need to use these 30 points to build a machine learning model (ridge regression, random forest ... etc.), then use it to predict on another thousands of data points. After some experiments, I believe the data set is too small. However, I am wondering is there a standard approach to prove that whether we have enough data points? And how to determine how many data points are needed? Thanks!
