Mysql order by rating - but capture all

I have this PHP/MYSQL code which returns records from a table ordered by their ratings, from highest rated to lowest rated: "; $cell = 1; } $joke_id = $row['joke_id']; $joke_title = $row['joke_title']; $joke_average = round($row['average'], 2); echo " $joke_title -average rating $joke_average. "; $cell++; } ?> It works perfectly but there is one problem - if an item does not have at least one rating, it will not be selected by the query at all! How can I remedy this? Thanks.
