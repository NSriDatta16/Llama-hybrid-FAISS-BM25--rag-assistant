You can do it, but it's not great practice. The more spread out your queries are, and the more SQL you mix in with your presentation and business-logic code, the more difficult it is to maintain. Your question makes it sound like you're working with some type of layered/tiered architecture, and those exist for some very good reasons. I would try to avoid peppering your code with SQL without any organization; it might be quick and easy in the short run, but could lead to problems later.
