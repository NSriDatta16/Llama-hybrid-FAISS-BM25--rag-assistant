How would I code when a item has been selected in a JList?

I have a JList with 5 options in it and when one of the items becomes selected or clicked i want the text area next to it to show a paragraph of text relative to the item clicked. It should do this for each item in the list but I cant seem to find how to do it in the API How would my program know if an item in the JList was selected so I can work with the data?
