You need 2 thinks, first the browser plugin installed on the browser and second to set the content disposition header as inline in the respose, otherwise the browser will try to download it. response.setHeader("Content-Disposition","inline; filename=\"file.pdf\""); I assume that you've already set the Content Type to application/pdf and know how to convert an iText document to a bytearray and transmit it to the user. A word of caution: if people outside your organization will use this app, the might not have the pdf plugin installed, in which case, the browse will download the pdf instead of displaying the pdf.
