listView.setSelection(n); m=listView.getSelectedItemPosition(); //m != n. why?

calling ListView's setSelection() seems to have a problem. a lot of people ask about it. there are answers but none is working. ignoring issues of visual affects. here's a basic scenario that results in unexpected results: listView.setSelection(5); //listView is a ListView. there are >= 6 items in the list int sel=listView.getSelectedItemPosition(); you would expect sel==5 but actually it's -1 (which method didn't work?) so is this a bug and if not, what are the rules that govern the setting and retrieval of the selected item?
