Logistic Regression Vs Neural Networks

This is what I have understood about neural networks. There are $L$ layers from input to output (including both) and the equations as follows. $a(2) = \theta(1) x$ $a(3) = \theta(2)a(2)$ . . . $y = a(L) = \theta(n-1) a(n-1)$ So, we can write $a(L)$ as below $y = a(L) = \theta(1)\theta(2)\cdots\theta(n-1)x$ Let's suppose $\theta(1)\theta(2)\cdots\theta(n-1) = \Omega(L)$ Now we have $y = \Omega(L)x$ To solve the above equation, we can even have logistic regression techniques, which will be much easier. So, what is the point in doing it so complicated, when we are not including any higher order terms? Someone please explain
