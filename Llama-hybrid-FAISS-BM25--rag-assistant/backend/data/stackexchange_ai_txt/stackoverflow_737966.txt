Until you ACTUALLY run out of memory, thinking about this is a waste of time. When you finally do run out of memory, you'll need to use a temporary file to store objects that your process needs, but can't fit into memory. Use pickle or shelve (see Data Persistence ) your objects in a file. If that file happens to be on a disk named "scratch", well that's nice. Sometimes you want your temporary files to be on a separate disk from your other working files for performance reasons. In some environments (SAN, NAS, storage arrays) your disks are virtual and looking for a "scratch" disk doesn't have any performance benefit. In other environments (i.e., you own all the hardware) you can put temporary files on some other drive, making that drive a "scratch" disk.
