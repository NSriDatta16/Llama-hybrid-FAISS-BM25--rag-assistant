From http://help.eclipse.org/help21/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm : Use the following command-line argument: -data your_workspace_location For example, -data c:\users\robert\myworkspace you can also use UNIX-style relative path names such as -data ../workspace even under Windows, in case something doesnt like colons or backslashes in parameters, like Jumplist Launcher
