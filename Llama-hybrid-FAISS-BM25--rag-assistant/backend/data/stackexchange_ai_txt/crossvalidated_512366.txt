Creating a question-answer chatbot

I was thinking of creating a chatbot for providing info about my college as a side-project, which aims to answer questions like "How many swimming pools are there?" to "How many lecture halls are there in Building X?". Upon discussion with seniors, they advised me to create graphs and then use something called NER to traverse it. This my first entry into the domain of NLP, ML, Neural Networks, etc. Can someone advise me if this is achievable, and if yes, what technologies should I study to achieve this?
