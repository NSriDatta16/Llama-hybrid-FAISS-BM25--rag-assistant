How do I parse only foreign characters from the text in an HTML file with regular expressions

I'm trying to parse HTML and automatically change the font of any foreign characters, and I'm having some issues. There are a few different hackish ways I'm trying to accomplish this, but none work really well, and I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. Is there any easy way with python to match all the foreign characters (specifically, Japanese Kanji/Hirigana/Katakana) with regular expressions? What I've been using is the complement of a set of non-foreign characters ([^A-Za-z0-9 <>'"=]), but this isn't working well, and I'm worried it will match things enclosed in , which I don't want to do.
