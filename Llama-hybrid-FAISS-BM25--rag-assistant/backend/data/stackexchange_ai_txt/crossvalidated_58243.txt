A footnote in Pankratz (1983) , on page 48, says: The label "moving average" is technically incorrect since the MA coefficients may be negative and may not sum to unity. This label is used by convention. Box and Jenkins (1976) also says something similar. On page 10: The name "moving average" is somewhat misleading because the weights $1, -\theta_{1}, -\theta_{2}, \ldots, -\theta_{q}$, which multiply the $a$'s, need not total unity nor need that be positive. However, this nomenclature is in common use, and therefore we employ it. I hope this helps.
