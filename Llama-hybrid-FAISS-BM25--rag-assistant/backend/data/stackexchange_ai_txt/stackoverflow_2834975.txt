Missing or invalid primary key

I create my trac enviromnets using a sqlite database, it works very well. Now i want to get some information directly from the database and i'm using C# to do it using System.Data.SQLite . The problem i have is an error in the designer cause the tables don't have primary keys. After get this error i went and noticed that all tables that have more than one primary key defined in the schema were not 'converted' to sqlite, that information is lost. I believe the problem is in sqlite_backend.py but python isn't my speciality and i'm in a hurry so if you can guide me to a quick fix. UPDATE (litle more detail): System.Data.SQLite "Support for the ADO.NET 3.5 Entity Framework Supports nearly all the entity framework functionality that Sql Server supports, and passes 99% of the tests in MS's EFQuerySamples demo application." Visual Studio 2005/2008 Design-Time Support You can add a SQLite connection to the Server Explorer, create queries with the query designer, drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet and more! When i drag the tables to the designer, some tables don't make it to the designer. The reasos is, "The table/view 'main.attachment' does not have a primary key defined and no valid primary key could be inferred. This table/view has been excluded. To use the entity, you will need to review your schema, add the correct keys, and uncomment it." The problem is this, no entitys = no data. UPDATE (more info): My objective isn't change datamodel. In trac schema the tables attachment , auth_cookie , enum , node_change , permission , session , session_attribute , ticket_change , ticket_custom are defined with primary keys. When i browse the file trac.db (default) the tables aren't defined with the primary_keys specified in the schema. I want a solution to solve this litle feature of trac sqlite db. I don't think it's the best solution edit the table after creation to add pk that aren't created. UPDATE Any ideia?!
