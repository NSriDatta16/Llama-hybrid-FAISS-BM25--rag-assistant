I don't know much about time series, but VIF is only about the independent variables. I also wonder about what it means to "cross" VIF with PCA. PCA can be one way to deal with collinearity; VIF is a method of diagnosing it. Mathworks Time Series Regression II is all about dealing with collinearity in time series. They recommend condition indexes, rather than VIF, and say a $\kappa$ of 100 or so "eads to absolute estimation errors ‖δβ‖ that are approximated by the relative errors in the data." (In my dissertation, I found that condition indexes were better than VIF for regular regression, echoing Belsley in his book on this). MathWorks does discuss VIF and points out some difficulties, although they don't seem insurmountable.
