Feature scaling for MLP neural network sklearn

I am working with a dataset where the features have multiple scales. Before running scikit-learns's MLP neural network I was reading around and found a variety of different opinions for feature scaling. Some say you need to normalize, some say only standardize, others say, in theory, nothing is needed for MLP, some say only to scale training data and not testing data, the scikit-learn documentation says MLP is sensitive to feature scaling? This has left me very confused on which route I should take for my dataset before running the MLP model. Any clarification on these and how I should proceed would be much appreciated.
