Estimating adjusted risk ratios in binary data using Poisson regression

I am interested in estimating an adjusted risk ratio, analogous to how one estimates an adjusted odds ratio using logistic regression. Some literature (e.g., this ) indicates that using Poisson regression with Huber-White standard errors is a model-based way to do this I have not found literature on how adjusting for continuous covariates affects this. The following simple simulation demonstrates that this issue is not so straightforward: arr In this case, the true risk ratio is 2, which is recovered reliably when the covariate effect is small. But, when the covariate effect is large, this gets distorted. I assume this arises because the covariate effect can push up against the upper bound (1) and this contaminates the estimation. I have looked but have not found any literature on adjusting for continuous covariates in adjusted risk ratio estimation. I am aware of the following posts on this site: Poisson regression to estimate relative risk for binary outcomes Poisson regression for binary data but they do not answer my question. Are there any papers on this? Are there any known cautions that should be exercised?
