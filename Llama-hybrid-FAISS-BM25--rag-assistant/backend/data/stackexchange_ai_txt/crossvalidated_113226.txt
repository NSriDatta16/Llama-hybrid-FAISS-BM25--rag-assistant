Yes you need to turn your 5 rows into 1 row, by changing the csv file. I don't know how you are calling libsvm, but scikitlearn/Matlab/... etc have APIs so you can pass the regenerated matrices in (rather than creating separate csv files for varying number of lags). The lag generation might be done in pandas? Alternatively you might want to look at Rapidminer or other gui tool for doing the whole transformation and looping through different lags.
