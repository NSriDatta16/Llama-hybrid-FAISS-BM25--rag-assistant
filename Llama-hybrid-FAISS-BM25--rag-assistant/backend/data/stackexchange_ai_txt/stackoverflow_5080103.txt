Migrating data from SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2005

I have to migrate existing data which is in SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2005 . The schema of two databases is different. For Example Locations table in SS2000 is split into two tables and has different columns. This is one time activity. After successful migration I don't need old db anymore. What is the best way to transfer data from one SQL Server to another having different schemas? I can write stored procedures to fetch data from SQL Server 2000 and insert/update tables in SQL Server 2005 . What about SSIS ? I don't have any experience with this and is this better to create package of SSIS because I don't need this again and need to learn it first. EDIT:This edit is after answer from @AgentDBA: One example of data in Old db and how I need this in new db is: Customers table in Old DB has column FullName like 'James White' but in new db there are two columns FirstName and LastName so data in this should be 'James' in FirstName and 'White' in LastName . Thanks.
