Same result for Binary logistic regression and LASSO Logistic regression models

I use the same seed for binary logistic and LASSO logistic regression models to predict the same data. Finally I got the same results for both, which means same specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. Is it normal and what could be the reason of getting a same result? Thanks
