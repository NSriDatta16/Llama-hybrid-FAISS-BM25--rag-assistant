Improving exponential decay fit

I'm fitting an exponential function to a time series in R using the formula lm(log(rate) ~ month) . When I graph predicted values (in red) vs my data (in black points), I can see that the curve isn't fitting very well in the earlier months. Is there a better approach for this?
