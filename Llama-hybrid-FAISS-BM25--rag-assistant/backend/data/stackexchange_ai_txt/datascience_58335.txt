I think this paper ( Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values ) tries to solve a similar problem of yours. Their idea is to train a neural network to capture the missing patterns and then combine that information to the main network to improve the performance. There's a reimplementation here but I don't know about the quality of the source code.
