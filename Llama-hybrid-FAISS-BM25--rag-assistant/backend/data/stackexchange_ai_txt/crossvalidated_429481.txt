In your link, you have the cumulative distribution function for the logistic distribution as $$\frac{1}{1+e^{-\frac{x-\mu}{s}}}$$ while in your question you have $$\dfrac{\exp(w^TX)}{(1+\exp(w^TX))} \text{ which is } \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-w^TX}}$$ and these are essentially the same so long as $w^TX$ has mean $0$ and variance $1$ . You can see that the first expression is a cumulative distribution function and this expression approaches $0$ when $x$ is very negative but approaches $1$ when $x$ is large and positive. This is what want from your logistic regression: the predicted conditional probability of a positive result $(Y=1)$ increases towards $1$ as $w^TX$ increases
