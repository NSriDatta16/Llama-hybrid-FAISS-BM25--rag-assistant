Flex Tree leaf-element highlighting while drag&drop

i have TileList from which i'm dragging some stuff(image) to Tree (something like dragging sounds into playlist in iTunes), but when i can drop this stuff, i see only underline, this mean i can drop it only under or above some leaf-element in that Tree. How can i force it to hide this black underline and highlight leaf-element to which i wanna drop my stuff. Thanks
