You can use a mixed effects model, a logistic regression with random intercepts for question and for participant. If you have data in long format, something like participant question answer 1 1 A 1 2 B . . . n 1 A n 2 A the logistic regression will have a linear predictor $$ \eta_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j $$ where $\alpha_i$ is a random intercept for participant $i$ and $\beta_j$ a random intercept for question $j$ . Then the model is completed by stipulating that $$ \alpha_i \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\alpha) \\ \beta_j \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\beta) $$ If you have some other covariates you can build from here. In R something like df library(lme4) mod0 This is similar to the setting in item response theory, so look through item-response-theory . See also the tag elo , since such rating systems are based on similar models. An interesting applications is the chess puzzles on lichess where both solver and quizz will get its own random parameter (but they will be updated according to how the puzzle is solved).
