In multinomial logistic regression, why do the decision boundaries tend to be parallel to each other?

I understand in multinomial logistic regression, the log odds probabilities are calculated with respect to a reference group. I am wondering why this often results in linear decision boundaries that are parallel to each other. Is there a connection between the reference group and parallelness? Thanks!
