What happened to statistical significance in regression when data size is gigantic?

I was reading this question regarding large scale regression ( link ) where whuber pointed out an interesting point as follows: "Almost any statistical test you run will be so powerful that it's almost sure to identify a "significant" effect. You have to focus much more on statistical importance, such as effect size, rather than significance." --- whuber I was wondering if this is something that can be proved or simply some common phenomena in practice? Any pointer to a proof/discussion/simulation would be really helpful.
