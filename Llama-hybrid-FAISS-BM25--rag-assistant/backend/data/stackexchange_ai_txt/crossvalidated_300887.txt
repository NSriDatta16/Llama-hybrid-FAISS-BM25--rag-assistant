Bayes classifier problem in ยง3.1.2 of "Temporal Data Mining" by T.Mitsa

In book "Temporal Data Mining" by T.Mitsa, the problem given to illustrate Bayesian classification consists in the following training set of medical records: age hypertension diabete class 80 (cat.C) yes yes C2 80 no yes C1 70-80 no yes C2 70-80 no no C3 >80 no yes C1 >80 no no C3 70-80 yes no C3 The question is: "What is the likelihood that the following patient do not have a TIA attack (i.e: belongs to class C3)? S = ( age=72, no hyp., no diab.) = (B,D,F) " We have: $p(BDF/C3).p(C3) = p(B/C3).p(D/C3).p(F/C3).p(C3) = 4/7 * 4/7 * 5/7 * 7/12 = .136$ and since: $p(F/C2) = p(B/C1) = 0$ then: $p(BDF/C2) = p(BDF/C1) = 0$ So from the training set we can classify S in C3 because: $p(BDF/C3).p(C3)>p(BDF/C1).p(C1)$ and: $p(BDF/C3).p(C3)>p(BDF/C2).p(C2)$. Fine. The problem stops here in the book. But what is the answer to the original question, which I believe is the value of the posterior probability $p(C3/BDF)$? $p(C3/BDF) = p(BDF/C3).p(C3)/p(BDF)$ We need the value of the marginal probability $p(BDF)$: a premise is that features are independent, so I would (naively) write: $p(BDF) = p(B).p(D).p(F) = 5/12 * 7/12 * 5/12 = .101$ $p(C3/BDF) = .136/.101 = 1.35$ Ooops! What's wrong? Optional question: what would be a good indicator for the certainty of the classification?
