Distribution of time intervals in Poisson process

I am studying computational neuroscience, particularly the modeling of neuronal spikes. Abstractly, we may think of a spike plainly as some event that either occurs or fails to occur in time. It has been established that the probability that $n$ events (spikes) occur in a trial of time $T$ follows a Poisson distribution with $$ P_{T}(N = n) = \frac{(rT)^{n}}{n!}\exp(-rT) $$ Here, $r$ is the firing rate of the neuron (or the constant rate at which events occur in time). It was also established early in the book that $r\Delta t$ is the probability that any spike occurs at some time interval $[t, t + \Delta t]$ . As a note, the equation above in the book is numbered $1.29$ - I clarify this for it is referenced in the fragment I need help with. This is all the context required to understand the following fragment of the book, with which I need some help. I can fully comprehend the paragraph above up to equation $1.31$ . What I don't understand is what immediately follows it. Namely, that the PDF of interspike intervals is equation $1.31$ without the factor $\Delta t$ , or in other words, that the probability that an interval $[t + \tau, t + \tau + \Delta t]$ is an interspike interval is $$ r\exp(-r\tau) $$ I did observe that such expression is the derivative with respect to $\Delta t$ of equation $1.31$ . However, equation $1.31$ is not a CDF, and hence its derivative is not the PDF we are interested in. What am I missing?
