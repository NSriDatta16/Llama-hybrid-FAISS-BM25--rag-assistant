average velocity, as3

I need something accurate I can plug equations in to if you can help. How would you apply the equation bellow? Thanks guys. AVERAGE VELOCITY AND DISPLACEMENT average velocity V=X/T displacement x=v*T more info example I have 30 seconds and a field that is 170 yards. What average velocity would I need my horse to travel at to reach the end of the field in 30 seconds. I moved the decimal places around and got this. alt text http://www.ashcraftband.com/myspace/videodnd/VQ.jpg Here's what I tried 'the return value is close, but not close enough' FLA here var TIMER:int = 10; var T:int = 0; var V:int = 5.6; var X:int = 0; var Xf:int = 17000/10*2; var timer:Timer = new Timer(TIMER,Xf); timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, incrementCounter); timer.start(); function formatCount(i:int):String { var fraction:int = Math.abs(i % 100); var whole:int = Math.abs(i / 100); return ("0000000" + whole).substr(-7, 7) + "." + (fraction tests TARGET 5.6yards * 30seconds = 168yards INTEGERS 135.00 in 30 seconds MATH.ROUND 135.00 in 30 seconds NUMBERS 140.00 in 30 seconds control timer 'I tested with this and the clock on my desk' var timetest:Timer = new Timer(1000,30); var Dplus:int = 17000; timetest.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, cow); timetest.start(); function cow(evt:TimerEvent):void { tx.text = String("30 SECONDS: " + timetest.currentCount); if(timetest.currentCount> Dplus){ timetest.stop(); } } //far as I got...couldn't get delta to work... T = (V*timer.currentCount); X += Math.round(T);
