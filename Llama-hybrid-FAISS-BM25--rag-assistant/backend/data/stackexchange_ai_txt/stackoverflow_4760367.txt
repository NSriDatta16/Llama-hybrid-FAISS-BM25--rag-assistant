As far as I know, almost all mobile browsers have basic cookie support. PHP setcookie ( documentation here ) will allow you to do something like this: setcookie('default_view', MOBILE); Where MOBILE is defined ahead of time. You're also free to use a string here. The upside is you won't have to worry about the query string once this cookie is set. SLaks ' solution will work, but you would have to pay attention to append redirect=false to every URL that has a redirect-checker.
