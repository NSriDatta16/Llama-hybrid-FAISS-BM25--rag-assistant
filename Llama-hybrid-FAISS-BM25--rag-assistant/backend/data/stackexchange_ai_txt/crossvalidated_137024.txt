Does the recurrent neural network require the length of input samples all the same

Theoretically, the training of RNN doesn't require that the samples must have the same time length, but it seems to me that some software or open-source requires that the input data has the same time length, for example, some packages in R. Can anyone give me an affirmative answer about this and some tools can treat inputs of different length? Thanks a lot!
