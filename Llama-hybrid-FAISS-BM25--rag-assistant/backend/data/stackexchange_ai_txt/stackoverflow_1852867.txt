Twitter's problems were not with Ruby or with Rails, and they have explained this at length. This is becoming one of those various urban legends that everyone "knows" to be true, but isn't. It's quite hard to google for the story here, probably because of all the "follow me on twitter" buttons. Fortunately, a Stack Overflow answer referenced a detailed discussion on this that included Twitter developers. I will give one other urban legend example that is (via RSI) somewhat programming-related: the Dvorak keyboard . Everyone knows that QWERTY is designed to be inefficient, to slow down the operator, and that it is an example of market failure, right? Another urban legend: Dvorak vs QWERTY Turns out this legend is not just completely false, but it has been deliberately, deceitfully falsified. Yes, the US Navy did test the patented Dvorak keyboard in 1944. But according to this report on the Dvorak keyboard : How can we take seriously a study which so blatantly seems to be stacking the deck in favor of Dvorak? And, indeed, there appears to have been good reason for that deck stacking. We discovered that the Navy's top expert in the analysis of time and motion studies during World War II was none other than...drum roll please... Lieut. Com. August Dvorak. Earle Strong, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a one-time chairman of the Office Machine Section of the American Standards Association, reports that the 1944 Navy experiment was conducted by Dvorak himself. Later tests by other organizations showed no advantage for Dvorak. It is also worth noting that slowing down typists was not a goal even in the early days of the typewriter. Actually, typing speed contests were conducted regularly with great publicity and the fact that typists were fast on QWERTY was a factor in the adoption of QWERTY. Dvorak and Twitter and RoR The false version of this story has been repeated for literally 65 years now, partly because almost no one cares about original sources, they just repeat the version they heard. Another parallel with RoR and Twitter is the religious/political angle. People have language and framework loyalties, and they have economic system loyalties, and the enduring legends play into existing bias. The Twitter story connects with some people's emotional perspective on the expertise they do and do not yet have; the QWERTY story connects with some people's personal dislike of free market economics.
