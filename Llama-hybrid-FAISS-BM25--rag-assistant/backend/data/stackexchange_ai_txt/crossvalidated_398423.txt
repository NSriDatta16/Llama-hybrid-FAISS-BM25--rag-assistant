differencing is selected for each series based upon univariate analysis. A Prewhitening filter is the added in order to IDENTIFY . See file:///C:/Users/dave/Downloads/Ruey%20S.%20Tsay-Lec1%20(2).pdf for the motivation to convert potential predictor time series which CAN NOT be initially used to identify transfer structure into pseudo series which can be used because they are each white noise variables. Differencing and arma structures are used to identify the ARMAX model (TF MODEL) See https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75 for another presentation. Yes differencing may apply to all series.
