Adding a new row (with a templated column) to an Infragistics UltraWebGrid

I am using the Infragistics UltraWebGrid to capture some data. I don't have this grid bound to a datasource, I simply access the values I need when the user clicks a save button. I need to add autocomplete functionality to one of the columns in this grid, easily achieved with an asp.net textbox and ajaxtoolkit autocomplete extender. Problem is, I must do everything I can to avoid postbacks, and if I add rows client side, the templated column does not work. Any idea how can I achieve this? And if I must do a trip back to the server, how to minimize them? Thanks.
