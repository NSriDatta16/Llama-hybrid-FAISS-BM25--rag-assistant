This really depends on the contents of works.xml and works.xsl. Suggestion: to spit out the resultDocument into a textarea and see if the html looks ok. At that point you could also save=>load the html resultDocument in Chrome/IE and make sure it looks good. Once you know what in the html is causing trouble, then it's easier to find the cause and fix it. You can see the output html by adding: Below your example div tag. and: document.getElementById("textarea1").value = document.getElementById("example").innerHTML; at the end of displayResult(). to see the output. Notice that your xslt is a fragment and not a whole html document , it should not contain html/head/body tags, and look more or less like the following: --> --> Choosy Child Guaranteed BuyBack System Buy Price: $ 1-4 Day BuyBack: $ x= *.15; document.write(Math.round(x*100)/100); 5-7 Day BuyBack: $ x= *.25; document.write(Math.round(x*100)/100); 8-14 Day BuyBack: $ x= *.40; document.write(Math.round(x*100)/100); 15-30 Day BuyBack: $ x= *.60; document.write(Math.round(x*100)/100); 30+ Day Buyback: $ x= *.75; document.write(Math.round(x*100)/100); --> There are other ways to shorten and streamline the code and not repeat the script tag, but that's outside of the scope of this question.
