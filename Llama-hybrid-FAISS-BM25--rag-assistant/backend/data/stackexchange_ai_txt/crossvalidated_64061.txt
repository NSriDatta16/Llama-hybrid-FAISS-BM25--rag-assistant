From Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning by Rasmussen: In a feature space of dimension $N$, if $N > n$ then there will always be a separating hyperplane. However this hyperplane may not give rise to good generalization performance, especially if some of the labels are incorrect. That is, if you have more dimensions than data points the data will be linearly separable, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the data can be classified perfectly.
