Problems with sampling with replacement for generating train, test, and validation data sets

When creating train, test, and validation data sets for machine learning, random sampling without replacement is done to create disjoint data set partitions. Is there anything wrong with using random sampling with replacement to generate train, test, and validation data sets. Are there any advantages?
