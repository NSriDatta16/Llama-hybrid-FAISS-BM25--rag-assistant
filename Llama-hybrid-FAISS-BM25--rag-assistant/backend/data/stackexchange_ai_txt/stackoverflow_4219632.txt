Installing a web application with Wix gives me a 1603 error

After doing some research, I learned that a 1603 error means that the site cannot be found. In my case, I'm looking for the DefaultWebSite. Now I've probably deleted and recreated a site called "Default" on my IIS7 installation since the last time I've messed with this installer. How do I get the default website back or get something in there that Wix understands to be the default Website so that I can install virtual directories to it? Here is a copy of the fragment in question: I'm very lost as to how to fix this.
