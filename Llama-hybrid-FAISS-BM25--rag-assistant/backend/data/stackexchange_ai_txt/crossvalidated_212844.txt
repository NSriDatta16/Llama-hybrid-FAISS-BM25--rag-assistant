A phylogeny is a birfucating tree representing the evolutionary relationships among taxa. Phylogenies are estimated using phylogenetic inference methods, which estimate evolutionary relationships based on genetic or phenotypic similarity. Once a phylogeny is estimated, its structure can be analyzed to study macroevolutionary patterns such as shifts in diversification rates. When combined with continuous or discrete trait data for the organisms at the tips of the phylogeny, phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to model trait evolution.
