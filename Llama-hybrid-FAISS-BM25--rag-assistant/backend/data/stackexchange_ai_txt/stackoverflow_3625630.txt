How to maintain session attributes in a multitenant architecture?

In case of SaaS applications, where the same server plays host to multiple applications. How are session attributes maintained? To elaborate the question: AppA, and AppB are hosted on the same machine, I now create UserA for AppA and UserB for AppB. AppA and AppB belong to different organizations so they are not linked. Some details about the user are stored at http session level (until the session times out). So now if I log in to both AppA and AppB from the same browser using different tabs, I may end up seeing some of UserA/AppA details on the UserB/AppB screen or vice-versa. How can such a problem be solved? One solution I can think is to create subdomains like appa.example.org and appb.example.org. Is there any other/better way?
