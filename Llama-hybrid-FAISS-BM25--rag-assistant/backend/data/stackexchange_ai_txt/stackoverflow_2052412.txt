Change Coldfusion tags to leverage CDN hosted javascript libraries

I've been handed a Coldfusion application to support and I noticed that CF is adding script tags to certain pages. It appears these js files are supporting certain CF tags because I can't find any reference to the .js file(s) in .cfm file (or in any subsequent include files). The .js files are popular libraries which can be accessed via a CDN versus serving them from our web server. So my question is: Can the CF tag or a Coldfusion setting be changed to update the .js url?
