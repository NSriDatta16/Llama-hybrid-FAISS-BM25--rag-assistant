Modeling repeated measures in a lme model (R)

Given one between-subjects (group: 2 groups), one within-subjects (time: 2 timepoints), and one continuous covariate, how would the syntax look for repeated measures data using lme in R? At the moment, the dataset is organized in a long fashion, so that all participants are repeated in the dataframe with a score from timepoint 1 and timepoint 2. Example as below: ID group score(dv) time 01 A 5 1 02 A 2 1 03 B 4 1 04 B 6 1 01 A 3 2 02 A 4 2 03 B 6 2 04 B 7 2 I originally had: lme(score ~ group + time + group*time, random=list(~1|ID), data) However, that did not seem correct, given that time might cause additional variance (?)... I was then looking into something like this but it was unclear what the syntax actually adds to the model... lme(score ~ group + time + group*time, random=list(~1|ID:time), data=d) Could anyone provide guidance on the organization of the model? Thanks!
