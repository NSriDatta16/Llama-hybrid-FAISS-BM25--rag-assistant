Which would be the best Neural Network Model to use for time series forecasting for this specific dataset?

I have a set of time series data (60 monthly observations) of Room Nights sold for a particular hotel. I will be using R for my time series forecasting. The data does have seasonality and trends. I would like to have a go at Neural Network for doing the forecast. I will of course compare the results with the more traditional time series forecasting methods used in R . Which Neural Network do you think would mostly fit my data?
