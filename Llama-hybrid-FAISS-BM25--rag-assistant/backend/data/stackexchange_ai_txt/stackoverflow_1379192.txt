Brian, you may not have seen my n-th comment (sic) to my initial answer (since Stack Overflow hides them in a collapsable section when there are too many of them). But my last comment answered your latest question (i.e. the one re your inability to build an NSToolbarItemGroup from within Interface Builder). Now that Snow Leopard is released, I can tell you you're still not able to graphically solve your issue by dragging some control from this newer IB's palette. Nope, your only solution is IMHO, as quoted from my Aug. 27 comment, "to programmatically allocate, initialize, and configure your group before adding it to your toolbar instance." I hope you'll see this new answer ('cause I do think you simply didn't notice my hidden commentâ€¦). Wishing you best of luck, hoping you'll be able to solve your problem with those hints, the needed code still being in the Overview section of the NSToolbarItemGroup class reference.
