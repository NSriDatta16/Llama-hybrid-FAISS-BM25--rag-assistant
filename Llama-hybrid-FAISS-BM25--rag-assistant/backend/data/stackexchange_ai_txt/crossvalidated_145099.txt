An example of autocorrelation in residuals causing misinterpretation

I'm looking for an example of time series data where a regression of y~x has autocorrelation in the residuals that leads to misinterpreting the model. This is for a class demonstration where I would ideally show them the results of an OLS model and the results of a GLS model with an appropriate correlation structure and explain the differences in the coefficients and their standard errors. Any examples out there that folks have used?
