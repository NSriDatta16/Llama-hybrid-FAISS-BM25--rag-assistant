I think your main problem is with the loop: for(int xy=0;xy Every time you read in a line. You are replacing the entire contents of the *player_name* array with the splayer_name, and the the entire contents of the *player_score* with the int value of s_player_score. I am guessing that what you are trying to do is add a single new entry to player_name and player-score. The size of the two arrays have to be equal to the number of rows in the text file, so you might want to use some form of List rather than an array. For both the storage arrays (or Lists) add the name once and the score once and I think that will get you well on the way to what you are trying to do.
