Computing average time given set of start and end dates

I have a table with a field called date_start and a field called date_end The values of the field are like this year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds I need to find out: How much time it to for the person to complete the task. The average time it took of all of them. I'm still a bit new and honestly have no idea where to even start with this. Thanks for all the help.
