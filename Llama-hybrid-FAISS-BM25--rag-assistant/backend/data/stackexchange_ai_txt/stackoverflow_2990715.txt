From a MEF perspective I think you're approaching this problem from the wrong angle. MEF encourages a separation between interface and implementation. To have the consumer dictate the order of the implementations, it forces it to understand the implementation. The approach taken by Visual Studio is a bit different. It uses the OrderAttribute , usually in combination with the NameAttribute to let the implementors specify an order. The consumer can then sort the implementors of an ImportMany using a combination of names and order without understanding the underlying implementation.
