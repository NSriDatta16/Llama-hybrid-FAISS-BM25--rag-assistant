Updating of characer's embedding inside an RNN during character generation task

In one of the tutorials of tensorflow, there is a "text generation with an RNN" tutorial. When creating the model, they create a mapping of characters to IDs and vice versa. Then in the model, they consider an embedding for each ID (each character). Shouldn't that embedding also get updated during training? So it somehow can capture the relationships among characters? As far as I understood from the code, no updated embedding is returned and they always use the initial embedding. Is my understanding right? Thanks in advance.
