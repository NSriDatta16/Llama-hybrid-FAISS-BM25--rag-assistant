You want an advanced utility that I've always wanted to write but never had the time to. If you don't find such a tool, you may want to fallback on my CMsg() and CFMsg() wrapper classes that allow to very easily pull strings from the resource table. (CFMsg even provide a FormatMessage one-liner wrapper. And yes, in the absence of that tool you're looking for, keeping a copy of the string in comment is a good solution. Regarding desynchronisation of the comment, remember that string literals are very rarely changed. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/string/stringtable.aspx BTW, native Win32 programs and .NET programs have a totally different resource storage management. You'll have a hard time finding a common solution for both.
