The frequentist definition of a probability is based on a long run frequency, the Bayesian definition is based on plausibility or state of knowledge (whether subjective or objective). The Bayesian approach is going to be better, in the sense of being able to give a direct answer, if the question is not asking for a long run frequency (such as the probability that some proposition is true, which doesn't have a long run frequency, it is either true or it isn't). Now frequentists can give indirect answers to questions about things like the truth of a proposition, usually by inventing some fictitious population which may have long run frequencies. However it is an indirect answer that will often be treated as a direct answer leading to misunderstandings such as the p-value fallacy (the p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, and indeed a frequentist fundamentally cannot attach a numeric probability to that anyway!). However, Baysian analysis often requires the ability to perform numerical integration, which most of us find tricky, whereas the frequentist framework has proven well suited to a "statistics cookbook" approach and is often used by practitioners who don't really understand the underlying principles, but can use it because it is comparatively easy to implement. Hopefully packages such as Stan will make it easier to apply the Bayesian approach with time? This makes it difficult to say whether a Bayesian approach is unambiguously better than a frequentist approach, because there are multiple criteria that govern which framework to use. Horses for courses, ideally choose the framework that answers your question directly... unless it is too tricky in which case reach for the cookbook ;o) With regards to "informative" priors, in some cases we have knowledge from e.g. physics that mean that uninformative priors are objectively (in the everyday sense of the word) implausible. Our statistical analyses should include domain knowledge where appropriate. The XKCD cartoon about frequentist-v-Bayesian gives a good example of what happens if we try for purely data driven inference in situations where we do have useful domain knowledge!
