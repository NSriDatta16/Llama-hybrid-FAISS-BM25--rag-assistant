A recursive remove directory function for PHP?

I am using PHP to move the contents of a images subfolder GalleryName/images/ into another folder. After the move, I need to delete the GalleryName directory and everything else inside it . I know that rmdir() won't work unless the directory is empty. I've spent a while trying to build a recursive function to scandir() starting from the top and then unlink() if it's a file and scandir() if it's a directory, then rmdir() each empty directory as I go. So far it's not working exactly right, and I began to think -- isn't this a ridiculously simple function that PHP should be able to do? Removing a directory? So is there something I'm missing? Or is there at least a proven function that people use for this action? Any help would be appreciated. PS I trust you all here more than the comments on the php.net site -- there are hundreds of functions there but I am interested to hear if any of you here recommend one over others.
