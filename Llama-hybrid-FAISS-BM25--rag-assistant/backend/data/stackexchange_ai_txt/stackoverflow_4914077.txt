Are you sure your command succeeded? It does not work for me when the path starts with slash. So, first remove leading slash, i.e. command should look like the following: jar -cf Generic.jar java/mypackage/*.class Package name that starts from word java is not for you. It is for JDK classes only. Such classes cannot be loaded by regular class loader, only by bootstrap one. So, rename your package. It should look like com.mycompany.myprogram.foo.bar Now create the jar file using command I wrote and then test the result: run jar vft and see that output looks like 1612 Thu Feb 03 14:44:34 IST 2011 com/mycompany/myprogram/Hello.class Pay attention on the path. It must contain your package. If everything is working copy your jar under WEB-INF/lib and enjoy. Good luck.
