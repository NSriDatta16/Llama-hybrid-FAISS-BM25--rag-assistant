There are GUI testing tools that will click buttons and stuff for you but they're pretty fragile in my experience. The best thing to do is to keep your UI layer as thin as possible. Your event handler classes should optimally be only one or two lines that call out to other more testable classes. That way you can test your business logic in unit tests without having to actually do a button click.
