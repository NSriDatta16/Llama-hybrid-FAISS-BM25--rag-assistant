Yes, but what you are wanting to do is called the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test or the Nonparametric Rank $F$ test. Any elementary statistics textbook with ANOVA coverage should have this described. In this test, all observations are ranked from $1$ to $n$ in ascending order. Then you calculated the typical $F$ test statistic, only you use the mean ranks within each of the races and overall means of ranks to calculate the $F$ statistic.
