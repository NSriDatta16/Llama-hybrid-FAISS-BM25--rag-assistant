If one draws up a tournament-bracket (assume the number of teams is a power of two) and assumes that a better team will always beat an inferior one, then the best team will play against (and beat) lgN teams; the second-best team will always be one of those. Note that finding the second-place team will always require lgN-1 comparisons, but if one wishes to improve the average performance of finding the third-best team, have the first two teams beaten by the best team play each other, have the winner of that play the third team, etc. The third-best team will be one which was beaten by the second-best team (either before or after the second-best team was beaten by the best). There will either be lgN or lgN-1 of these (most likely the former) so lgN-1 comparisons will suffice to find the third-best team.
