I am a big fan of mongodb as a document database aswell. But are you sure you are using mongodb for the right reason? What is mongodb powerful at? Its a subjective question but for me in-place (atomic) updates over documents is what makes mongodb powerful. And I can't really see you using it that much. And on top of that you are hitting the document size limit problem aswell.(With experience I can tell you that embedding files to mongodb is not a good idea). You want to have a live chat application on top of database too. Your document schema's seems logical. But I wouldn't go with mongodb for this kind of project where your application heavily depends on inserts. I would go for CouchDB. With CouchDB you wouldn't have to worry about attachments problem, you can embed them easily. "_changes" would make your life much much easier to eighter build a live chat application / long pooling / feeding search engine (if you want to implement one). And I saw an open source showcase project in couchone. It has some similarities with your goals: Anologue . You should check it out. PS : Sorry it was a little off topic but I couldn't hold myself.
