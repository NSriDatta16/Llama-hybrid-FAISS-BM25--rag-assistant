In Design and Evolution of C++ (section 10.3), Stroustrup mentions that if the new operator for object X was itself used for allocating an array of object X, then the writer of X::operator new() would have to deal with array allocation too, which is not the common usage for new() and add complexity. So, it was not considered to use new() for array allocation. Then, there was no easy way to allocate different storage areas for dynamic arrays. The solution was to provide separate allocator and deallocator methods for arrays: new[] and delete[].
