Welcome to Data Science! Here I create your data frame and show one way to create the column you need. I use numpy in addition to pandas: import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Create df ID = ['bike', 'bike', 'car', 'car', 'car'] Color = ['red', 'black', 'green', 'orange', 'blue'] df = pd.DataFrame(data={'ID': ID, 'Color': Color}) Add a new column called 'Order', with counts based on each group - these are mini dataframes that contain only one of the ID values only. This makes use of the groupby method on a Pandas dataframe . df['Order'] = df.groupby('ID').transform(lambda x: 1 + np.arange(len(x))) The transform method takes a function and applies it to each group. I use an anonymous function (just a function with no name), also called lambda functions , using the keyword lambda . The result: Color ID Order 0 red bike 1 1 black bike 2 2 green car 1 3 orange car 2 4 blue car 3 As anymous.asker mentioned, it would be helpful in the future if you post the code that creates your dataframe!
