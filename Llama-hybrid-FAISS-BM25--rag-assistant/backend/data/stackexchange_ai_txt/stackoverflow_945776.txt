Regex that matches anything before a certain character?

I have to parse a bunch of stats from text, and they all are formatted as numbers. For example, this paragraph: A total of 81.8 percent of New York City students in grades 3 to 8 are meeting or exceeding grade-level math standards, compared to 88.9 percent of students in the rest of the State. I want to match just the 81 and 88 numbers, not the ".8" and ".9" that follow. How can I do this? I've heard the term back-reference or look-aheads or something. Will any of that help? I am using C#. Edit: It's required that I get the "3" and the "8" in the above example. It's just a simple example, but I need pretty much all numbers.
