Here there is a great tutorial on how to do weather prediction using Neural Networks. To reply to your question: Neural Networks are cool because they don't require what we call feature engineering , i.e decide what factors are important, because during training the algorithm would understand what is crucial for the task. You have to understand the difference between [statistics, probability -> ML] and [physics, science -> meteorology]. In the first set, we use previous data to find the correlation between data, in the second, they use scientific knowledge like equation and theorem to find an answer.
