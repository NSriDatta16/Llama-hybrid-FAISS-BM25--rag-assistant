Where does Foo live? in another dll. Is it reasonable? not really. If you declare a class like this: class __declspec(dllexport) Foo { ... then msvc will export every member function of the class. However the resulting dll is very fragile as any small change to the class definition without a corresponding rebuild of every consuming dll means that the consuming code will allocate the incorrect number of bytes for any stack and heap allocations not performed by factory functions. Likewise, inline methods will compile into consuming dlls and reference the old layout of the class. If all the dlls are always rebuilt together, then go ahead. If not - don't :P
