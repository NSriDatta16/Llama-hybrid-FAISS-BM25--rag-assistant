Implement your cart on server side. Keep your cart objects (products) in a collection or something. Every time an Ajax request arrives to server side: Get data (product_id,quantity, ...etc) from request. Get operation type (add,remove ..). Check for data validity. Do required server side business (update db, call web-service etc). If everything is fine add/remove specified product to/from your collection. Convert your server side cart to JSON and write to response of Ajax call. Every time an JSON response arrives to client side: Update your cart with new data. For the Ajax part. Use jQuery Ajax() function $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "cart.jsp", data: "p_id=SKU001&quantity=4", success: function(msg){ alert( "FOUR SKU001 ADDED TO CART"); } }); Edit: Ooh i see. product_id is undefined means your obj.attr("pid"); is not working. This plug-in uses hidden HTML inputs for product definitions. (plain stupid if you ask me) This inputs have some pseudo attributes which you can get by obj.attr("pid"); . If there is no input in your form or your input does not have that pseudo attributes your code fails. BE SURE YOUR HIDDEN HTML INPUTS HAS THIS PSEUDO ATTRIBUTES. For example: From the authors documentation: Description:Text marked bold are the pseudo attributes that describes about the product. Like product name, price, description etc. pid : Product ID pname : Name of the product pdesc : Description of the product pprice : Price of the product pimage : Product image source pcategory : Category of the product You can add more product details by adding new attributes to the input element, and so you can show them on product list or cart by editing the template. You can customize the pseudo attribute names, and configure it on the plug-in file on the Attribute Settings section. Edit2: I think you have difficulties in this section of my recommendations. Every time an JSON response arrives to client side: Update your cart with new data. Hidden inputs below are your data. Open another question on stackoverflow and ask how can i modify (Create, Update, Delete) this inputs in jQuery because after solving your first question asking another in the same post is bad practice .
