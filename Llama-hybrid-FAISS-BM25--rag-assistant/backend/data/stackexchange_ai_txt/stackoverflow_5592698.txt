List-style and float not working on grid boxes with CSS

Might be a bit too early in the morning for me but I struggling to figure out what I've done wrong here. I have a page with 9 boxes and I would like them to be positioned with 3 on one line, 3 on another and 3 on the other. Have a look here: http://dev.tim-morgan.co.uk/other/Untitled-1.html Right now you can see, the list bullets are showing and each box looks like it's going down like a staircase since I put in float: left; Any ideas of what I'm doing wrong? Thanks
