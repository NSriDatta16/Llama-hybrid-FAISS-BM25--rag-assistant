I think design by contract is a great idea and I've glanced at frameworks that provide that functionality in Java. I think what has held me back is that getting buy-in from a team for these sorts of frameworks can be difficult. I think it's perceived as being only of academic interest which is strange because really it's just like embedding unit tests within the code. Java's main nod in this direction, the assert statement, has been around for several years but I rarely see it used - often only in the code I write myself! There's a lot of mileage in using asserts (especially combined with unit tests) and I've found a few bugs using them, it's just a pity people don't use them. Cheers, Ian.
