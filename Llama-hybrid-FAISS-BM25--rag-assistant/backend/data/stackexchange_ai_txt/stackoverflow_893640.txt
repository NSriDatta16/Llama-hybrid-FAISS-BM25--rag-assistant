FxCop is attempting to test code at the ROOT of the BuildAgent's drive... the switch /f:\Sacog\bin\Debug\Sacog.dll Is trying to get Sacog.dll from the root of that drive. This is probably from the list of files that you have configured in TeamCity for FxCop to analyze. Remove the \ at the beginning of the file name in the "Assemblies" section on the "Build Configuration / Step 3: Runner" configuration screen.
