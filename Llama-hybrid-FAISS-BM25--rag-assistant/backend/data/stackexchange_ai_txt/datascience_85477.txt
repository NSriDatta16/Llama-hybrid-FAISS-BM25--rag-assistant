What is the best way to treat datetime in the preprocessing step of machine learning

I have two datetime columns in my dataset. What I have done so far I have extracted year , month , dayofweek and hourofday from these columns. So as you expect they will be something like this: 2015-5-5 08:21:20 ----> 2015 5 5 8 So my question is that what is the best way to normalize these numbers. Because I think that year or other numbers will dominate my machine learning model. I have not found any article regarding this, all explaining till this point that we convert them to year month ... Thanks.
