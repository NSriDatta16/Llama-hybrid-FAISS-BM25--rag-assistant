I'd suggest putting your form in some surrounding markup. I commonly use definition lists, so the markup would be something like Primary Email: Accepted Domains exchange.samcogan.com domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com Then you can float/position the dt and dd elements to appear in a single horizontal row. This approach, whether you use a dl, ul or other, gives better positioning in general.
