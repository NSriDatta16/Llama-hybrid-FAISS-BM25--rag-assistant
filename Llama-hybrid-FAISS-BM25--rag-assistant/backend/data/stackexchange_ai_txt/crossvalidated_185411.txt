For predicting the next 5 years, if you use ARIMA models you can only predict crude estimates since it's intrinsically a linear model. I can see two problems: 1 Choosing a prediction model. For the first case you could use a simple neural network or a recurrent network (RNN), a boosted tree or whatever you will. The RNN case is generative and depending where you left it in the last state will generate a periodic signal (prediction) infinitely. Depending on the state it was last in and how many states there are in your system. I would just start with a simple linear model to evaluate on the existing data (split it 70/30) randomly if you can. 2 Generating more data for making future predictions Better yet, you could use an auto-encoder (AE) to generate more data for predicting the next 5 years. The input to hidden layer is an encoder and the hidden to output is the decoder. After training the AE (this is unsupervised you don't need the targets) on the existing data you could observe the distribution of the outputs of the encoder - this is your latent space. Now, you have a distribution for each latent feature, you have a very large combinatorial space of possible input variables to the decoder, to generate new data. You have various choices of denoising AE's for lower dimensional latent spaces or sparse AE for higher dimensional latent spaces, depending on how many input features you have. After you generate your artificial data, you use the generated data to make predictions.
