Too many False Positives with Unbalanced Data

I am trying to predict customer churn in a telco company, using R.The dataset is very unbalanced, the target is around 0.6% of the base. 8,746 Customers will Churn 1,396,664 Customers do not churn I have trained a Random Forest in R.Prior to training, I SMOTE the training data: train.smote This gives me a 1:1 Balance. I then train the forest using: fit When I run, pred=predict(fit,newdata=test,type="class") on my validation Data, I get the following Confusion Matrix: Positive Negative Positive 1,136,610 234,625 Negative 3,762 5,911 The F Score is 0.83, the Specificity is 0.61. However, the number of False Positives is too high (234,625). Please suggest a method to curb these False Positives without compromising on the True Positives.
