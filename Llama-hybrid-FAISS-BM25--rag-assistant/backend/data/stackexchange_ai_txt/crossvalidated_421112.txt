You didn't run k-means on the output of PCA. PCA substantially changes the weights of features. It distorts the data heavily. Also, $ind$contrib sounds wrong to me. You don't want to project to contributions. Hence, a result computed on the original data, but evaluated after PCA is expected to score quite badly.
