Unless there is a common interface or link between what you want to pass as T, and the DataContext which has the stored procedures, this may be hard to do. However, you might be able to utilize the DynamicObject capability in .NET 4.0 to do this. If your MyDataContext object was a DynamicObject, you could use the convention that your data retrieval method is always up_GetFoo where Foo is also your return Type in concert with TryGetMember to do this.
