OLS regression does not assume that the dependent variable is normally distributed, nor even unimodal. It makes assumptions about the error term, as estimated by the residuals. Many variables exhibit "clumping" at certain round numbers and this is not necessarily problematic for regular regression. Categorizing, or binning, continuous data is very rarely a good idea. However, if there are very few prices between the round numbers, this may be a case where it does make sense. If you do this, then the OLS model should no longer be used, but ordinal logistic regression (or some other ordinal model) instead.
