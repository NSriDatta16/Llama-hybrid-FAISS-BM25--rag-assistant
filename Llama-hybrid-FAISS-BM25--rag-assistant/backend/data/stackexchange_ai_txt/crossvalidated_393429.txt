The concept of a baseline model is that it is the simplest way to solve a problem. In some cases we may use 0 rules(0R, Random Guessing) model as a base line. So we can judge and evaluate the next trials that uses more complex models(Like neural networks) as an improvement in accuracy, precision,..etc than the base line model. from this concept you should start building a base line model with the minimal fine-tuning that will help you evaluate you trials with respect to Interpretation Complexity. Predictive power.(you can map it to accuracy in the most cases) Time to build. Memory consumption.
