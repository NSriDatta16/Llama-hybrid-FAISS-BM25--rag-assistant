slow down code until ajax function is over?

I want to call fillContent then later called beginEditingQuestion fillContent(cid, "questions"); beginEditingQuestion(qid); The problem is that I can't rung beginEfitingQuestion until all the ajax in fillContent is done. Is there an elegant way to delay the code? The only idea I can think of is to make a totally new function fillContentAndBeginEditingQuestion where I copy and paste fillContent into the new function and in the final ajax call add in beginEditingQuestion. This doesn't seem very elegant to me, I want to reuse fillContent in other contexts. What should I do?
