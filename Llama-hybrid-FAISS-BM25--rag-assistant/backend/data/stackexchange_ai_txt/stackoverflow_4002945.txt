'Use a static array'... what does that even mean?

I know what a static array is and how to use it in Java, but my Prof assigned us a program and for one of the many classes we had to create, he asked us to 'use a static array' in such a way that multiple objects will store their data there. For instance, if the objects were car garages, then each garage instance would store in a 100x3 static array their data: 1, honda, four-door 3, toyota, two-door 1, bicycle, -1 1, ford, pickup 2, ford, fiesta 3, chevy, two-door 3, bicycle, -1 The -1 indicates the end of each garage. That's a lousy example, but you get the idea. So, I am thinking that what he wants is kind of like this: In the demo class (which is the main), I will declare an instance of a class I made with the static array in it: PublicAccessArray p1 = new PublicAccessArray(); Then that class starts off like: public class PublicAccessArray { public static int[][] accessArray; public static void PublicAccessArray() { accessArray = new int[100][3]; ... And then my class that will create the objects to use the static array will look like: public class ClassThatUsesTheStaticArray { public void ClassThatUsesTheStaticArray (PublicAccessArray array1) {... So then back in the demo/main class I would instantiate those objects with: ClassThatUsesTheStaticArray c1= new ClassThatUsesTheStaticArray (p1); I think that's what he means, and I know that the static array should look like the example I gave (though it uses numbers as data/elements). I know he wants us to instantiate the ClassThatUsesTheStaticArray objects from the demo/main class and the only way I can see to do that would be to pass the p1 array to it. Does what I am doing seem to be the right way? I often an easier time doing the actual coding than figure out what my Prof. is actually asking us to do so I was wondering if that sounds like a way to 'use a static array'.
