Avoiding p-values and reporting t-values instead. References?

I was wondering if I could get some opinions on an issue. I'm analyzing my data using mixed-effects modeling in R (lme4 package). My model has by-subject and by-item intercepts and slopes, and random correlation parameters between them. Since the current version of lmer() does not have MCMC sampling implemented, I cannot get a pvalue for the coefficients in the model. Therefore, I would like to report the t-value instead. I have often seen papers in my field (psycholinguistics) just say something like "In all models presented, |t| > 2 and |z| > 2 correspond to a significant effect at a significance level of .05". I was wondering whether there is some reference I can provide from this type of sentences? I understand that this tends to be the case, but I wonder whether this is something that has been shown (and I should give references) or whether it is ok to just state it and assume everyone will be ok with it. Suggestions welcome!
