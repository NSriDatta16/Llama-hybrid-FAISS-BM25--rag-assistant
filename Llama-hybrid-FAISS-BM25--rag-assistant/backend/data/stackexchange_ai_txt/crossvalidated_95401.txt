No, in the sense that other priors do logically relate to other penalties. In general you do want more mass near zero effect ($\beta=0$) to reduce overfitting/over-interpretation. Ridge is a quadratic (L2, Gaussian) penalty, lasso is an $|\beta|$ (L1, Laplace or double exponential distribution) penalty. Many other penalties (priors) are available. The Bayesian approach has the advantage of yielding a solid interpretation (and solid credible intervals) whereas penalized maximum likelihood estimation (ridge, lasso, etc.) yields $P$-values and confidence intervals that are hard to interpret, because the frequentist approach is somewhat confused by biased (shrunk towards zero) estimators.
