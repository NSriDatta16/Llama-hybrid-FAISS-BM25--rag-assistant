Online feature preprocessing

Say we have a batch of data we use to learn an SVM, a Regressor, etc. And we use the learned model to do online classification, the learning is not done online, the online part is only the processing. How do we go about Normalization, Whitening, Rescaling, etc Since most of these techniques require a batch of data to work, and even then, if the features do not have the same normalization, it may not work as advertised. Thanks
