Okay I did some digging around. Here's the thing, you need to authenticate for every call you want to make to the API. I noticed that in the URL that you used ( http://fishbowl.wufoo.com/api/v3/users.xml ) , you used http but the API requires you to use https . You will only get that You must authenticate to get at the goodies. message if you attempt to access through the normal HTTP protocol. So for your second call, you need to re-authenticate again. Your code should then look like: '; } else { echo 'Call Failed '.print_r($resultStatus); } $curl2 = curl_init("https://fishbowl.wufoo.com/api/v3/forms/w7x1p5/entries.json"); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_USERPWD, 'AOI6-LFKL-VM1Q-IEX9:footastic'); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_ANY); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, false); curl_setopt($curl2, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Wufoo Sample Code'); $response = curl_exec($curl2); curl_close ($curl2); echo $response; curl_close($curl2); ?> Regarding your question about all these being done in AJAX, it's not possible at the moment because Wufoo does not support JSONP callbacks (which allow for cross domain AJAX requests). (If you don't know what I'm talking about read this other SO question ) However, if you want to plug this functionality into AJAX, you can do an AJAX call to your PHP script on the local server. The PHP script will do something like the above, authenticating with Wufoo.
