Conditional Statements Inside A Where Clause

I have a sproc that runs on many different servers. In the sproc I have a select statement that looks like the following. select * from my_table where id = @my_id and status in (1,3) However, for one of the databases I need the second part of that where clause to only be for statuses equal to 1. So essentially... select * from my_table where id = @my_id and status in (1) I really don't want to us an if db_name() = 'mydb' statement because the actual select statements are much longer and the code starts to look really inelegant at that point. Is there some way to make the second part of the where clause conditional on the db_name? Thanks for your help.
