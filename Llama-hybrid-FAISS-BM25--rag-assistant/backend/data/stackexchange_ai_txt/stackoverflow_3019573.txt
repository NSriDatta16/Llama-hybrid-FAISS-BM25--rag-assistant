CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() (about 6 microseconds) or mach_absolute_time() from mach/mach_time.h (somewhat faster, but you need to call mach_timebase_info() and do some conversions). You can then print to stdout or use NSLog; note that NSLog takes ages (50 ms?) so you want to do it after taking the measurements. stdout is a bit faster, I think, but doesn't go to syslog (i.e. the Xcode Organizer/iPhone Configuration Utility console).
