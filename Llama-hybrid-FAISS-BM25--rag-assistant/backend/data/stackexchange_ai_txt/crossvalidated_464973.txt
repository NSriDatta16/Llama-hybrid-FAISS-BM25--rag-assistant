This sounds more like an estimation problem rather than a hypothesis testing problem. As Dave notes, a single selection of the item in the variant group will contradict the hypothesis that the probability of selection is 0 (which is equivalent to saying it is impossible that anyone would select the item when it is recommended, which while physically possible is statistically unlikely). Let me demonstrate. The binom library implements several different confidence intervals. Assuming 1 person in 10,000 buys or selects your product, here would be the confidence intervals: method x n mean lower upper 1 agresti-coull 1 10000 0.000100000 -4.282233e-05 0.0006267439 2 asymptotic 1 10000 0.000100000 -9.598660e-05 0.0002959866 3 bayes 1 10000 0.000149985 1.553338e-07 0.0003907725 4 cloglog 1 10000 0.000100000 1.125906e-05 0.0005843805 5 exact 1 10000 0.000100000 2.531778e-06 0.0005570370 6 logit 1 10000 0.000100000 1.408618e-05 0.0007095439 7 probit 1 10000 0.000100000 1.253757e-05 0.0006322640 8 profile 1 10000 0.000100000 7.735773e-06 0.0004402345 9 lrt 1 10000 0.000100000 1.000000e-04 0.0004388696 10 prop.test 1 10000 0.000100000 5.220037e-06 0.0006492406 11 wilson 1 10000 0.000100000 1.765267e-05 0.0005662689 Note all 11 have a lower bound greater than 0, so you would reject in every case. All it takes is 1 person, which could even be an accident for all you know, to reject your null. If a test is that fragile, then it isn't worth performing. I'm not sure what you're interested in, but you could instead just observe how many conversions are made when recommended. In order to get a confidence interval of radius $r$ , you need approximately $$ n = \left(\dfrac{1}{r}\right)^2 $$ observations. Frankly, probably fewer than this because conversion is likely very small and so the estimated standard deviation is smaller than 0.5 (an approximation to the true standard deviation which I have made here). All in all, don't test. Instead, estimate.
