LSTM input vector

Trying to understand how LSTM works, i have found this article: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ Consider we have a matrix with $N$ rows that contains time series (input vector) with $k$ values/measurements per series $x = [x(1), x(2), ..., x(k)]$ . So, the matrix has shape $N.k$ . In this figure: What does $X_{t-1}$ , $X_t$ , $X_{t+1}$ , ..., means? They are each a whole timeseries with $k$ values (for example, $X_{t-1}$ would be my first time series, $X_{t}$ would be my second, and so on)? Or $X_{t-1}$ always represent the first measurement of a timeseries, $x(1)$ , $X_{t}$ is the second measurement $x(2)$ , and so on?
