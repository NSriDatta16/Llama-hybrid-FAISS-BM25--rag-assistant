Automatic "force repel" layout in Cocoa

You know that in a lot of Mac/iPhone applications (such as your Finder), when you are dragging a icon around, all other icons will be "repelled away" from your mouse and leave space for the icon you are dragging. I am wondering if that's a built-in Cocoa function (in layout constraints etc?). If not, is there any library, or documents on how to implement it?
