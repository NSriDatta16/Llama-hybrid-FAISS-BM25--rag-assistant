It's not that you don't have events, it's just that you don't have exact times for the events. You do, however, have a lower and an upper limit to the time to each event. That's what's called "interval censored" data in general. In your situation, there's only 1 observation time per individual, so you have "current status" data as @Ben said in a comment. As you note, you have left-censored event times for cases with events (lower limit of 0) and right-censored event times for cases without events (upper limit of +Infinity). Some types of survival analysis with such data are relatively straightforward. Let's take the reproducible data set provided in the answer from @AdamO (+1) and reformat it. Specify "L" and "R" as the left and right limits of the interval. It turns out that setting the lower (left) limit for left-censored event times to -Inf instead of 0 helps with some functions. set.seed(123) n $event==FALSE,"L"] event==FALSE,"dissectTime"] dissectData[dissectData $event==TRUE,"R"] event==TRUE,"dissectTime"] That puts data into a form used by the "interval2" type of Surv object in the R survival package . That allows for simple descriptive survfit() processing (for 1 or more groups) and for parametric survival modeling. For example: library(survival) plot(survfit(Surv(L, R, type="interval2") ~ 1, data = dissectData), bty="n",xlab="Time",ylab="Fraction Surviving") curve(exp(-x/50),from=0,to=100,add=TRUE,col="red") shows the estimated survival curve and its 95% confidence intervals (in black) along with the original continuous function used to generate the data sample (in red). You can fit a parametric survival model this way, also. For example: survreg(Surv(L, R, type="interval2") ~ 1, data = dissectData) fits the default Weibull model to the data. With a more complicated data set including treatment groups and other outcome-associated covariates, you can specify (functions of) those as predictors instead of the simple ~1 intercept-only predictor used here for a single group. There are several other choices for survival distributions available, too. You can't, however, fit a semi-parametric model like a Cox survival model via the survival package. For that you need specialized tools like those in the R icenReg package . That package works directly with "interval2" data. It also provides for Bayesian models like those recommended by @Bj√∂rn in another answer (+1). Your small set of known, fixed time points does recommend a binomial regression approach, but you didn't provide enough details to know if your model correctly takes the left censoring into account. A simple binomial model of fractions of animals with tumors over time is a model of tumor prevalence . That's OK for some purposes, and it can form the basis for tests of treatment effects with covariate adjustment . Prevalence data, however, leads to problems in interpretation in terms of tumor onset if the observed prevalence decreases at a later time period. The answer from @AdamO provides a good way to deal with that problem, in a way that forces the cumulative hazard to be non-decreasing. Tutz and Schmid discuss ways to handle interval censoring in a binomial regression context in Section 3.7, "Subject-Specific Interval Censoring," of their Modeling Discrete Time-to-Event Data book.
