You're right, having ChocolateBarResult extend JellyBeanResult would be bad, because JellyBeanResult likely has methods and fields (such as "color" for a jelly bean) that don't make sense for a chocolate bar. So, don't do this. :-) What about creating new methods to return the correct result type ( GenericResult ) and then marking the narrow getJellyBeanReport() method as @Deprecated to discourage anyone new from using it?
