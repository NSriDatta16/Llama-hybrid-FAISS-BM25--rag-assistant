uncompress gzipped HTTP message

I am analyzing Pcap captures with C and I need to uncompress the Gzipped body of the HTTP replies. I know that I can do that using Wireshark manually, but I would need to do it on the fly, inside my program. My understanding is that I should look into zlib and the RFC. But since it's a little analysis program, do you know where I could find a quick solution? Thanks
