jQuery, draggable, container id

I have the following code in jQuery... $("#sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable', dropOnEmpty: true, receive: function (event, ui) { var colNum = $(ui.item).attr("id").replace(/col_/, ""); $.post("/Category/Insert", { title: colNum }); }, the var colNum = $(ui.... ) this gets the id from the item being dragged. I was wondering, is it possible for me to get the id of the container it is being dropped in?
