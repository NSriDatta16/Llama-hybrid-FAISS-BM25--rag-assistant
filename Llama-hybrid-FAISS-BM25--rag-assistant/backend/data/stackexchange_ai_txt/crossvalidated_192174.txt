Another way to explore possible seasonality is a cycle plot. Here is one: This rearranges your series in blocks, in each this case blocks of months. So all Januaries are plotted together, etc. The month labelled 1 is the month that comes first in your data. I am guessing it is January. The horizontal lines are the means for each month. As with your plot of the raw series it shows that trend is dominant, but there is some seasonal structure. February is low (shorter month is part of the answer); August is low (people on holidays, feeling better in the summer sun if this is Northern Hemisphere)? I have bundled together some references for this plot, including other names used in the literature: Becker, R. A., J. M. Chambers, and A. R. Wilks. 1988.
