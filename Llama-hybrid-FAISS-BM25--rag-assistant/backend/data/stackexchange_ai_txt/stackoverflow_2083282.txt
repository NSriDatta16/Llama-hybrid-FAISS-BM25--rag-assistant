Databases aren't the only means of persistent data storage, they're simply the most common. There are document/blogging engines that don't use databases at all. When a page is created, changed or commented on a static html file is created or modified. For example, Movable Type . Likewise you can have purely in-memory storage systems where if the system is turned off the in-memory data is simply reconstructed. Or memory contents are dumped then restored and no database is involved. This is typically done in systems with an extremely high throughput or that requires extremely low (microsecond level) latency. Your question can't really be answered because the answer to everything you've asked is "it depends" and you can probably make it work however you do it. I will say this: don't be too concerned about performance until you actually have a problem. Most performance problems you'll encounter will probably come down to indexes and primary keys in the database. PHP and MySQL is a fine choice.
