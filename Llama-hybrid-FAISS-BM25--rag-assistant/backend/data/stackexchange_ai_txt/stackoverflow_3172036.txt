This can be a difficult problem, but not for the reason that @JWWalker states. If you can easily convert keycodes to characters, then it is trivial to convert from a character to a keycode. It's a 1-to-1 mapping between the two (a character has a single keycode, and a keycode has a single [sometimes non-printable] character), so you can easily build the transformation yourself. The ShortcutRecorder project has an NSValueTransformer subclass that does this. The difficulty is that posting keystrokes does not always result in a synchronous action. Since you're (essentially) communicating to another process, you have no idea how long that process will take to handle your event posts and perform the appropriate action. The time between "posting" and "handling" is indeterminate based on the current load and activity on the system. Usually it happens fairly quickly (and in such a way as to appear mostly synchronous), but it doesn't have to be. My particular example comes from dealing with the pasteboard server, which sometimes takes its very sweet time to respond to a cmd - v keystroke. If all you're doing is mimicking typing, then that shouldn't be too bad. You can get the char* of your string using -[NSString UTF8String] (or similar), then simply loop through the characters, convert them to keycodes, and post the appropriate events.
