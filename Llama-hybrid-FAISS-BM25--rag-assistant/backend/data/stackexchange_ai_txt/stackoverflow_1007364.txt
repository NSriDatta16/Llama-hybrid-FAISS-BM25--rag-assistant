I would recommend HL7 however you should be strategic about its use. I'm assuming you have a whole suite of software systems at your organization already. If that is the case, it's probably a good idea to have "HL7 interfaces" exposed on key services, but have the internal dialog in some canonical form specific to your organization. The great thing about HL7 is it's inherently message based, so you can do all sort of cool things with Business Proccessor Manager (BPM) software where you are just letting your business people draw nice charts of how the flow of an HL7 message is governed. One thing I might suggest is doing an investigation of the various "adapters" out there, for instance "iWay Intelligent Adapter for HL7", or IBM's WTX. These let you concentrate on the business code you'll need to write, instead of having to worry about HL7 messaging at the transport layer, etc... Hope that helps.
