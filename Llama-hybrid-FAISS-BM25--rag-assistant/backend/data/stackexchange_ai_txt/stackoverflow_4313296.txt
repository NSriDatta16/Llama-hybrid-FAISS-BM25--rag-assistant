What's the max amount of files per directory? (Linux)

I have to store a lot of image files, but I'm not sure about how to organize my directory structure. Is there a limit of files per directory, or directories per directory? Also, should I create the filenames randomly so they are not guessable? (so I don't get my bandwith hammered by someone trying to download all the files)
