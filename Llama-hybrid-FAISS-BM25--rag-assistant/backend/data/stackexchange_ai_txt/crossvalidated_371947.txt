First of all, let me be clear on that there is no 'right approach' for time series modelling or forecasting in general. Since you have a large amount of different time series, it is imporatant to decide if you want to model them all seperately or that you assume some sort of dependence. From your question it seems to me that you assume they are independent. An often used approach in time series is the Box-Jenkins methodology, which works based on identifying aspects such as periodic effects (e.g. monthly/yearly cycles) or non-periodicity. For more information about their approach on ARIMA modelling check the Wikipedia or the book they've written on this. If you are into a differenct class of models, such as machine-learning you could look at LSTM. Without more information it will be hard/impossible to fully answer your question.
