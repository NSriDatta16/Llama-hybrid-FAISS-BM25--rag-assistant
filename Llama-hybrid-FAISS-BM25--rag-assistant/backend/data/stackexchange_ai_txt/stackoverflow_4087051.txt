Setup Project does not replace assembly files

I have a Windows Application project (A.exe) that calls another project Class Library (B.dll). A.exe has a button (myButton) that calls the method Method1 from B.dll. To install the application I created a Setup project ASetup.vdproj, whose Primary Output is project A. After compiling the setup, the installation runs without any problems, when A.exe starts and I click myButton, the aplication gives no error. Then I changed B.dll and added a new method Method2. myButton is now calling Method2 from B.dll instead of Method1. I increased the version of A.exe and increment the version of ASetup.vdproj, but do not increase the version of B.dll. After installing the application I noticed I had two installations of A.exe in Control Panel -> Add / Remove Programmes. When running A.exe and click myButton I obtain an error, "The method Method2 was not found in B.dll", it means that the setup does not replace B.dll during installation. I ran the uninstall and I noticed that the files were not removed from disk. My question is: Why doesnâ€™t the second installation update B.dll? If the version of B.dll is incremented, B.dll will be replaced during the installation, but the problem is that my current project has many external assemblies, which is difficult to control if they have been modified or not. Basically, what I want is that all assembly files are replaced in each installation. I await feedback from all of you. Thank you for all the attention.
