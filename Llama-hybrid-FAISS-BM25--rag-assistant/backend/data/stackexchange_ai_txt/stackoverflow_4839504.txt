Using Numeric Keys with CakePhp FormHelper Select

I'm using the FormHelper (cake 1.3) to create a select box from an array. The array uses numbers as keys but the select box ignores those numbers and uses a zero-based index for the select box option values. I've tried typing the array key to a string using both (string)$key and strval($key) with no luck. The select options work when I prepend a letter before the numeric key (i.e. 'c'.$key ) but I'd like to avoid this hack. Is there a way to force FormHelper to use the actual numeric keys without prepending a letter? Any help would be appreciated. See the following code for illustration: // $category_list looks like this Array ( [164] => Antiques & Art [83] => Baby/Children Needs [176] => Boats/Marine/Fishing [222] => Books & Magazines [287] => Building Materials [215] => Business [175] => Caravans & Motor Homes [169] => Cars & Other Vehicles [127] => Clothing & Accessories [92] => Computers & Electronics [358] => Farm & Agriculture [235] => Garage Sales/Yard Sales [309] => Garden & Yard [178] => General Merchandise [138] => Health & Beauty [186] => Hobbies & Collectables [63] => Household [234] => Information [388] => Motorbikes & Scooters [206] => Musical Instruments [449] => Notices [305] => Pets and Accessories [242] => Positions Vacant [236] => Real Estate & Rentals [243] => Services [143] => Sports Equipment [308] => Tools & Equipment [300] => Travel & Holiday ) // Output category select box echo $form->select( 'category', $category_list, $category, array('id'=>'SearchCategories') ); // Outputs like this Antiques &amp; Art Baby/Children Needs Boats/Marine/Fishing Books &amp; Magazines ... // I'd like it to output like this Antiques &amp; Art Baby/Children Needs Boats/Marine/Fishing Books &amp; Magazines ...
