I'd like to refer to how you should choose a performance measure. Before that I'll refer to the specific question of accuracy and AUC. As answered before, on imbalanced dataset using the majority run as a classifier will lead to high accuracy what will make it a misleading measure. AUC aggregate over confidence threshold, for good and bad. For good, you get a weight result for all confidence level. The bad is that you are usually care only about the confidence level you will actually use and the rest are irrelevant. However, I want to remark about choosing a proper performance measure for a model. You should compare a model by its goal. The goal of a model is not a question of machine learning or statistic, it is a question of the business domain and its needs. If you are digging for gold (a scenario in which you have huge benefit from a true positive, not too high cost of a false positive) then recall is a good measure. If you are trying to decide whether to perform a complex medical procedure on people (high cost of false positive, hopefully a low cost of false negative), precision is the measure you should use. There are plenty of measures you can use. You can also combine them in various ways. However, there is no universal "best" measure. There is the best measure for your needs, the one that you should maximize to maximize your benefit.
