Remove features with high correlation

In a classification problem using Linear SVM, I am trying to remove variables which have a strong correlation (Pearson) between them from a dataset. What is the usual threshold recommended? I currently delete variables when they have a correlation >= 1.0 or Should I create my correlation matrix after or before scaling the data ?
