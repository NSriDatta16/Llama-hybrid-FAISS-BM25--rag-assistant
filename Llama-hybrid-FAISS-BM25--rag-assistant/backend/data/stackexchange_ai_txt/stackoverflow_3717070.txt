Assuming a high selectivity with agentid and propertyid (agent_property, agent_profile) and low selectivities for status, property_types, country_id etc) [meaning that there are many different agentids and propertyids but few different states, property type etc] IMHO the indexes with the most impact would be: agent_property(agentid) or agent_property(agentid, property_type, status) - used in your where clause agent_profile(agentid) - used in joins owner_profile(propertyid) However, you will also need to consider the impact of getCompanyId You haven't given the SQL but it will probably need at least an index of property(property_id) or whatever the property table is.
