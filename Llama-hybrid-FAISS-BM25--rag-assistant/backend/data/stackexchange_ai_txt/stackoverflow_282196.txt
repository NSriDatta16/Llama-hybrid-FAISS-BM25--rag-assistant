I'm very interested in this myself, but haven't had the chance to run any tests. One question about your tests, did you use the standard storage that comes with an EC2 instance, or do the Server Server EC2 instances automatically use Amazon's Elastic Block Storage ? I know very little about ABS, but they do say that "The latency and throughput of Amazon EBS volumes is designed to be significantly better than the Amazon EC2 instance stores in nearly all cases. You can also attach multiple volumes to an instance and stripe across the volumes."
