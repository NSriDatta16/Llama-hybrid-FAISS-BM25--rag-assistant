Magento simple product link to open grouped products page

Is there any way I can edit the catalogue page to make link of a simple product (which is part of a grouped product) to open the grouped products page? To be more clear: there are three products a, b and c which are in the product group 'abc'. So, in the product list, when a customer clicks on product 'a', it will be forwarded to (or open), the 'abc' group page.
