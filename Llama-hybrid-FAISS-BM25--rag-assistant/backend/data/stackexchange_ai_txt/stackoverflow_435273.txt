Nothing noticeable. The call to Google (including DNS lookup, loading the Javascript if not already cached and the actual tracer calls themselves) should be done by the client's browser in a separate thread to actually loading your page. Certainly the DNS lookup will be done by the underlying system and will not, to my knowledge, count as a lookup within the browser (browsers have a limit on the number of request threads they will use per site). Beyond that, the browser will load the Google script in parallel along with all other embedded resources, so you will potentially get an extremely slight increase in the time it takes to download everything, in the worst case (we're talking in the order of milliseconds, unnoticable. If the Google script is loaded last by the browser, or you don't have many external resources on your page, or if your page's external resources are cached by the browser, or if Google's script is cached by the browser (extremely likely) then you won't see any difference. It's just absolutely trivial overall, the same effect as sticking an extra tiny picture on your page, roughly speaking. About the only time it might make a concrete difference is if you have some behaviour that fire on the onLoad event (which waits for external resources to load), and the Google servers are down/slow. The latter is unlikely to happen often, but if this were the case then the onLoad even won't fire until the script is downloaded. You can work around this anyway by using various "when DOM loaded" events, which are generally more responsive as you don't have to wait for your own scripts/images to load this way either. If you're really that worried about the effects on page load time, then have a look a the "Net speed" section of Firebug , which will quantify this and draw you a pretty graph. I would encourage you to do this for yourself anyway as even if other people give you the figures and benchmarks you request, it will be completely different for your own site.
