When to do studentization?

I see texts on using studentized residuals when discussing problems in regression. Are there rules of thumb for when to apply studentized residuals? I mean, when can we tell normal residue plot is insufficient to tell if there are outliers and high leverage points? So far I see, normal residual plots seem sufficient.
