How to compare sub-sample mean with the sample mean?

I have a dataset with 983 rows and two columns: Rent and Postcode. The mean Rent for the entire sample (983 rows) is 817.49. The mean Rent for the N1 postcode (23 rows) is 887.02. The N1 data is a subset of my entire sample ; is it still possible to compare the means? How would I test whether Rent in N1 is significantly higher than average? The statistical tests I have come across so far either rely on independent samples (I assume these are not independent as one is a subset of another), or dependent samples measured across time (which these are not).
