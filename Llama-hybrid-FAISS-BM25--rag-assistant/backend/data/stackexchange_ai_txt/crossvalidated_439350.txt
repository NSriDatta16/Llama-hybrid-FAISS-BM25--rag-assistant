What statistical model is this study using?

I am new to statistics and I need to know how to describe the statistical model of this study in my abstract. A retrospective medical study assessing the risk factors predisposing someone to a an infection by a certain microorganism. Patients who were proven to have been infected by this pathogen were compared based on their age, gender, co-morbidities. The results were entered into an excel spreadsheet. The following results are just examples: - 60% of those infected were men and 40% women - 55% of those infected were 60 and above years of age - 70% of those infected had cardiovascular disease Using this data we can conclude that gender, age and co-morbidities do play a role in this infection. Men are at a higher risk, the older the patient the higher risk and CVD patients have the highest risk. Is the statistical method being used here regression analysis? If not what is it?
