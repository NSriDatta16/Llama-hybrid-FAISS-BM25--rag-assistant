You don't really need pragmas to disable them. For win32/msvc, in ProjectProperties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, add following macros: _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE Or you can pass thos in command line parameters (-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE). You can probably #define them at the beginning of certain *.cpp files. Also, there are probably more of them (see crtdefs.h - looks like there are a lot of them...). Those kind of warnings normally tell you with which macros you can disable them - just read compiler output.
