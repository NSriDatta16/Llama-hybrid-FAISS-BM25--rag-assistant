Keynote KITE and ASP.NET Viewstate

Just had the classic ViewState exception on a live site - "Validation of viewstate MAC failed. If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster, ensure that configuration specifies the same validationKey and validation algorithm. AutoGenerate cannot be used in a cluster. ---> System.Web.UI.ViewStateException: Invalid viewstate." This is a two server, load balanced environment and we'd set the in web.config on both machines??? The exception we get details the user agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; KTXN) - which I believe is the Keynote KITE agent . The problems specifically seems to be that the ViewState is being truncated in requests form this client - anyone seen this before? Cheers
