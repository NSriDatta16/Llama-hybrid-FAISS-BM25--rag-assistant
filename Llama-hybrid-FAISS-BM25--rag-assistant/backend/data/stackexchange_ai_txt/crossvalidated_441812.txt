SARIMAX: transforming the exogenous variables

I am trying to build a (S)ARIMAX model where the endogenous variable (daily stock log-returns) has already been transformed: the log returns are the first difference of the logs of the daily stock price. This should make the time series of the endogenous variable roughly stationary. Does it mean that I need to similarly transform the exogenous variable (daily trade volume)? The exogenous variable is on a different scale - it denotes counts of shares (i.e. integer-valued and well above 10^8) rather than price (a float smaller than 200) and exhibits a different pattern - for the observed period the trade volume drops while the stock price increases.
