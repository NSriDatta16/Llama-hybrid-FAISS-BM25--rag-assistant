Providing alternative images if Adobe Flash isn't available

Are there any ways providing an alternate GIF/PNG image, in case the user has no Adobe Flash installed and/or deactivated. I’ve found recommendations, like the following from W3C, which determine via JavaScript the existence of Adobe Flash on the client: W3C Providing alternative images Honestly, I would prefer a non JS technique. I’m thinking of some XHTML tag, equivalent to . (like if the object (in our case Flash) can’t be displayed/loaded). The reason for needing this separation is the following: The bank I’m working for will preferably display their banners in Flash format. In case it isn’t possible a simple image should be shown. In the past it was solved very likely in the way mentioned before. We’re currently working on a design refresh and that’s where I stumbled upon this piece of code which makes me wonder if it’s really the most elegant and compatible way of doing so. Another idea that strikes me: Is it actually possible to load Flash-objects in a JavaScript disabled environment?
