pop-up box using jquery doesn't work in IE

To be short, the problem manifests here: http://mybgagent.com/offer_detailss.php?offers_id=4810 Clicking "Total Cost of Ownership" in Opera or Firefox brings out the pop-up window on top of the page as expected. However, in IE (tested in versions 6 and 8), it appears on the bottom of the page. Here's the CSS and JS that I use. http://mybgagent.com/tcocalc.css http://mybgagent.com/tcocalc.js I think the problem's in the CSS, but I can't really tell where - I've never cared much for IE compatibility.
