Facebook Connect requires you to have a Facebook application to connect with, that's how the validation occurs. The Facebook application doesn't have to do anything or have any content, it doesn't even have to be submitted for approval. But it does have to be setup and configured. For security reasons, it also has to be hosted on the same primary domain as the website using it. It can be a subdomain, but the primary domain has to be the same. So keeping it hidden may be a problem. After that, you need to integrate it with your backend. You're basically allowing an outside service to log the user into your site. Most sites are not configured to support something like that. That's the hard part, even if there is buy in. I've created and manage over 20 Facebook applications for my current company, which has multiple web sites. I've created a working demo with Connect functionality, wall posting, friend inviting, and friend information querying. It's not a matter of convincing someone to do it, it's convincing someone to allocate to the resources to do it. So far it's been implemented for 2 promotions and 0 web sites. That said, when Facebook users send out invites, we've seen on average 10-15 friends invited (default max is 20). Far more than if you asked them to enter email addresses. That's beside all the other cool stuff you can do when you can connect with someone's social network.
