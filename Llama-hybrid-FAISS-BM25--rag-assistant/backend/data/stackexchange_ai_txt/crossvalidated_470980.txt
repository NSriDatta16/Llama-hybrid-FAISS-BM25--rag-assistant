Continuously test where two Generalized Additive Models differ

x-axis : time variable y-axis : variable of interest factor : two conditions, for example A and B ( other variables : to include in the model for controlling potential other influences) In case that both conditions (A & B) have two different (non-linear) relationships, is there a way to test where on average in x the condition A and B likely differ in y? Can one do this continuously/adaptively and without creating time-bins and conducting multiple tests where one runs into the multiple testing problem? I have created some sample code and plotted an example: set.seed(358) x
