If you want to predict a single class, or if you are working under the assumption that each sample, $x$ should have one class then, yes Multinomial logistic regression is the right choice. If on the other hand, you want to allow the model to assign more than one class for an example maybe $x$ could be assigned both $A$ and $B$ then you may want to use multiple (3 in your case) independent binary logistic regression classifiers.
