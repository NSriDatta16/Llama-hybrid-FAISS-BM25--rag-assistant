This is a very common problem. Here is an article with a good explanation. People have been trying to do this for a very long time, and it is safe to say there is no such thing as model that can tell you what the price of a financial instrument will be in the future with good accuracy. Some people believe that there isn't any way to predict the future prices of the market any better than flipping a coin (Random walk theory, Here is a good explanation of it). This is totally not true though. The movement of markets is almost a random walk, but not 100% random. This does not mean that machine learning has no use for trading however. I won't give away too much, and anyone who has figured out how to use it to their advantage won't mention their details either, but you have to get outside the box a bit. Putting in price history and getting a future price is way too good to ever be true. A better approach is using multiple different networks for several different easier problems, and using what they come up with and your own knowledge to screen for a good stock to buy. If you really want to use machine learning for trading, you are going to have to be very dedicated to it and invest a huge amount of time. You not only need to master the machine learning side of it, but you will also have to master the market.
