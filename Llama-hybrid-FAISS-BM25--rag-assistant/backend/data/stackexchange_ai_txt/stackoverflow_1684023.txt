How do I install a development iPhone app on my phone for testing?

I have an iPhone application built as an .ipa file. I also have my device registered on my Apple Developer Connection account. I downloaded the .mobileprovision and dragged both it and the .ipa into iTunes. The app shows up fine in iTunes. When I try to sync, though, I get The application "FUBAR" was not installed on the iPhone "My Phone" because the application signature is not valid. What am I missing?
