The posterior distribution has simple, trackable form only if you are using conjugate priors. Gaussian is not a conjugate prior for Bernoulli, or binomial, hence there is no named distribution that posterior follows. To get it, you need to apply Bayes theorem directly, or approximate it, e.g. by MCMC sampling. On another hand, if you knew what the posterior distribution is, there would be no need for approximating it. Why computing mean or variance of non-Gaussian would not make sense? Sure, there are pathological cases like Cauchy distribution, where those are undefined, but they are exceptions rather than rule. It is common to calculate basic statistics like mean, median, variance etc. form Monte Carlo samples.
