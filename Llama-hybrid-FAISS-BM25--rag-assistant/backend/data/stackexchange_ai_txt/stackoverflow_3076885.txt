It seems that what you are requesting already exists in Magento. Once the user has posted a review about a product, the "Your review has been accepted for moderation" message appears by default as stated in app/code/core/Mage/Review/controllers/ProductController.php at line 188 (Magento 1.4.0.1) Anyway, if you want to display messages (notice, success, error, warning) just use, for instance in case of a success message: __('Your success message here'); Mage::getSingleton('core/session')->addSuccess($message); ?> The message will be store in the session and automatically appear on the frontend as long as the template file of the page has the $this->getMessagesBlock()->getGroupedHtml() code which is the case in all default phtml pages shipped with Magento. So you don't really have to bother. Of course, in the above example, you can change addSuccess($message) by addError($message) or addWarning($message) or addNotice($message) depending of the kind of info your want to display.
