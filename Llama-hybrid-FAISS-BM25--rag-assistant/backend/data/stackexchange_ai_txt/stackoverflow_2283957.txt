It depends what this is intended to refer to. In an event handler this refers to the element on which the event is being handled. If that's what you want then your code looks good as written; this will point to ip . If you intend this to refer to the this from outside the event handler and not ip then try this: var self = this; ip.onblur = function(event) { stopCalcUpInt(self, self.value); };
