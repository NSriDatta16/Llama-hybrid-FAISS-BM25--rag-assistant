Alternatives to WebBrowser control in WPF?

We are working on a WPF app with the web browser control. When the user drags the window, the web browser lags behind the window as it drags. Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Failing that, does anyone know an alternative to the web browser control itself? Thanks!
