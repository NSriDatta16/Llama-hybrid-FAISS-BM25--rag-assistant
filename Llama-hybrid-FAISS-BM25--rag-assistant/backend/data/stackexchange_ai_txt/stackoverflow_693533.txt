If you want the data to be user-editable, it may not be suitable to use an enum. Enums are compile-time units, so will require a developer (or some hacky code generation). Instead, consider using a database table for this data, pre-populated with your items (and perhaps with a "System" column to control which ones are user-defined vs required by the system). Then changes are just inserts (etc) to the table. You can, of course, use any other storage mechanism - for example, a delimited string in a config file - but I'm guessing you'll want a database somewhere in the system?
