ASP.NET has a built-in browser detection mechanism. It's driven by a fully extensible collection of XML files (*.browser) that contain regular expressions for matching the incoming User-Agent string and associated properties for the matched agents. You can access the properties from the Request.Browser object; you can also tag control properties based on browser specifics. There's a bunch of info on the Web about this -- I also cover it in detail in my book: Ultra-Fast ASP.NET .
