Another paper that I hadn't thought about in this context until @Andy's comment is Cameron, Gelbach, Miller's "Robust Inference with Multi-Way Clustering" . Upon re-reading, it looks like they explicitly replicate the Bertrand (2004) strategy and handle it via their multi-way clustering (which is a generalization of their one-way clustering strategy from the much-more-famous previous CGM paper).
