I'd use prototype and body. Body is use widely for that purpose, prototype has formally a slightly different meaning. Edit: The standard use function declarator (sometimes abbreviated to declarator ) and body . For instance in 6.9.1/13 which is an example stating In the following: extern int max(int a, int b) { return a > b ? a : b; } extern is the storage-class specifier and int is the type specifier; max(int a, int b) is the function declarator; and { return a > b ? a : b; } is the function body.
