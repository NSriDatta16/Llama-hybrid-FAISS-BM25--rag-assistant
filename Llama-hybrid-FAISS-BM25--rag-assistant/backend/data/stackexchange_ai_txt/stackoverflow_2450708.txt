How do I update MySQL table, using subselect

how can i write the query, to update the table videos , and set the value of field name to 'something' where the average is max(), or UPDATE the table, where average has the second value by size!!! i think the query must look like this!!! UPDATE videos SET name = 'something' WHERE average IN (SELECT `average` FROM `videos` ORDER BY `average` DESC LIMIT 1) but it doesn't work!!!
