Yes, averaging the per-face normals of the faces adjacent to a vertex gives good results. To keep very hard edges 'hard', you'd typically introduce an angle limit into the calculation to keep >90 (or even lower angles) degree edges from receiving averaged normals. A OSS project I'm involved with has a freely available implementation of this algorithm. It is O(nlogn) and operates on totally unique vertices (each face references 3 vertices, but each vertex is referenced by only one face - joining equal vertices together is done at a later stage). If you have totally distinct vertices (i.e. each vertex position exists only once), it can be done in O(n) time, but limiting the edge angle for smoothing is more difficult to implement then.
