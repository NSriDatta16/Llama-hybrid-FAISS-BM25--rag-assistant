I've used PEAR's Mail_Queue to queue up 200,000+ mails at a time. Populating a database is easy and quick, even with customised content, and then a fairly simple script sends around 250 a time - if the load average isn't too high. Then it loops around and sends the next batch. You won't send them any faster than is usually possible, but it will do it without any problems. The tutorial gives you almost everything you need - just loop around th 'send_messages.php' script (from the command line is better) until the database queue is empty.
