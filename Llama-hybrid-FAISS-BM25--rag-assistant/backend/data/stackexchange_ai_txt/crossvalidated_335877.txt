Treatment of outliers in financial data

I have a data set with financial panel data from 150 companies. I want to analyse the data using linear repeated measures ANOVA and OLS Regression (so far). For this, I want to use the absolute values (e.g. Revenue 2012-2016) as well as calculated averages (e.g. Avg. Revenue Growth) as dependent variable. I have identified quite some (extreme) outliers in the data, for example companies that have a revenue growth of 10000%, but I am unsure how to treat these outliers, due to the financial nature of the data. If a company for example invests 1 Mio. in 2012 and then earns 500k in 2013, the revenue growth may be shown as an outlier, although this is a legitimate business practice (I therefore assume the outliers to be representative). However, these business practices are (in theory) not related to/ result of the independent variable. I don't feel like trimming or winsorizing the data is the correct way to go, as I would reduce my already small sample. However, if I keep the outliers, they will influence my analysis. Any suggestions on how to proceed? I have read about Quantile regression, but am not familiar with it and don't know if it is applicable if the outliers are very few (per variable) and very extreme. Asking more specifically: Should I trim / winsorize financial data? Why, why not? What alternatives are there?
