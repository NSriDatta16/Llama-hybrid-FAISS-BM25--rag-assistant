How to securely upload and store user documents?

HOw can I allow users to upload to our servers files which then can be stored securely and that can be accessed by the users who uploaded them? Where do i store them, in databases? or in folders on the website? And if i do use folders? how can i let people who own them to see it rather than anybody else? I am new to the storage area, so please bare for any stupid questions. Thanks.
