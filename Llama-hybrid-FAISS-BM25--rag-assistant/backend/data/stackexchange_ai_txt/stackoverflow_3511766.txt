ASP.NET/jQuery Post-Back, but not when using browser's "Back" button

I'm working on an ASP.NET Web Project with some AJAX magic. As my GridView 's data needs up to 15 seconds to be gathered, I send the page to the client and fire an asynchronous update of an UpdatePanel via jQuery/JScript (see below). This works well, so far. Now I'd like to skip this step when the user navigates to the next page (e.g. record detail view) and comes back via the "Back" button. Is there a way to get his, and what's the most elegant one? This one does not work ( hasDonePostBack 's value isn't kept by the browser): var hasDonePostBack = false; function fRefreshAsyncOnce(id, param) { $(document).ready(function() { if (!hasDonePostBack) { __doPostBack(id, param); hasDonePostBack = true; } }); } Any help would be great! The reason why this is important: Regetting the data takes another 15 seconds. Moreover, the grid is working with controls and more client script (e.g. checkboxes that can be checked, CSS classes that are toggled, etc.), and all this should be the same after returning. Cheers, Matthias
