error measure predictions hmm

I would like to compare the performance of an hmm with other different models (Artificial Neural Networks or Random Forests) in which I used mean squared error. As with HMMs it is normally given the log probability, Would it be correct to generate samples (with a fixed init seed) from the HMM model obtained and then calculate the MSE in respect to the true values?
