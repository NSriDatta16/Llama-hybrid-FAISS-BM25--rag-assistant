You're supposed to do the analysis that answers the questions that you have. If you want to know if there's rater agreement for each question, analyze each question. (You could also do something like take the average, but that could disguise some very bad questions. Another issue is that with 50 questions, you'd expect a lot of variation by chance. I would treat each one as a separate question. For Q1: Did raters agree about time in nature? Did raters agree about hobbies. Etc. (The lesson to be learned here is to think about how you'll analyze the data before you collect it.)
