XSLT is a lot of work for very little gain, in my experience. It's fantastic if you absolutely MUST use XML, and must provide the transform with the data, but it's otherwise slower and less useful than parsing the XML in a more general language. Your idea isn't outrageously bad though, particularly if you implement some third-party commenting system. You've only got to parse the title, post content, dates, and so on. If you wanted to keep the existing commenting system, you might simply replicate the existing comment box and direct it to the backend wordpress install. An alternative if you really don't want to deal with all the cruft associated with wordpress is to use something simpler - I've used dokuwiki in the past, or a quick roll-your-own database tool might be good enough.
