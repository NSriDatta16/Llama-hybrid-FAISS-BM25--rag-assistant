Standardized coefficient for a categorical variable in logistic regression

I would like to rank independent variables in a logistic regression model based on relative importance. I've read about standardizing the variables prior to entering them in the model. So in this context, how can I standardize a categorical variable with 5 levels. My final model has mix of continuous and categorical variables. If standardization is not the right approach for this problem please suggest me alternate approach.
