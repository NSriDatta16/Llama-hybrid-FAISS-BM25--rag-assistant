1) Generally, yes, you can add the train and validation sets for final training because you'd be throwing out the validation set otherwise (actually not entirely since you'd used information from it to select a model, but pretty much). 2) From the model trained on the entire dataset, expect performance equal to the average performance over the folds of CV. It feels like kind of a leap of faith because you don't actually see the full model performance on specific cases, I know, but it's accepted in practice.
