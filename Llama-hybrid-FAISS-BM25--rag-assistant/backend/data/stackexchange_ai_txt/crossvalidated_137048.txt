Should I find this big parameter suspicious?

I have some kind of disagreement with a groupmate. We have some data, and we have to fit a loglogistic distribution. Our highest data point is less than 14,000,000. The average of our data is 231,316.865 and standard deviation is 1,118,713.553. E used Excel to estimate parameters of a loglogistic distribution (via MLE) and came up with shape=0.560983285656052, scale=4010.69503243576. I did it in R and came up with shape=1.667393, scale=8.294636. I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and R didn't give a reason to say mine wasn't a good fit. ks.test(b, "pllog", shape=1.667393, scale=8.294636) One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test data: b D = 0.0377, **p-value = 0.8836** alternative hypothesis: two-sided Warning message: In ks.test(b, "pllog", shape = 1.667393, scale = 8.294636) : ties should not be present for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test As for h parameters... ks.test(b, "pllog", shape=0.560983285656052, scale=4010.69503243576) One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test data: b D = 1, **p-value I tried simulating values and this what I got with mine. rllog(20, shape=1.667393, scale=8.294636) [1] 1.164583e+05 5.387827e+04 2.440876e+01 5.083744e+03 1.669974e+00 [6] 1.125328e+05 3.781694e+02 5.572336e+04 2.352123e+03 4.060668e+03 [11] 2.597518e+02 1.068868e+02 4.695207e+03 7.780321e+03 5.787856e+03 [16] 2.196655e+04 2.933098e+04 1.253264e+06 1.196900e+03 5.399473e+02 This is what I got using h parameters.
