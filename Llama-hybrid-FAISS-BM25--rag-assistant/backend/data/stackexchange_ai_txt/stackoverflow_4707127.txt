it's the property of a shape. I did not find such property for b2CircleShape, but for b2PolygonShape has m_centroid paramter - it's the shape center coordinates relative to the body. Specify it to have a valid position of a shape. For b2PolyganShape there is a method setAsBox(w, h) but alos there is more complex one: setAsBox(float32 width, float32 height, const b2Vec2 &center, float32 rotation) Use this method or specify the centroid manualy. Here is the code for the U shape b2BodyDef bDef; bDef.type = b2_dynamicBody; bDef.position = b2Vec2(0, 0); b2Body *body = world_->CreateBody(&bDef); b2PolygonShape shape; const float32 density = 10; shape.SetAsBox(1, 0.1); body->CreateFixture(&shape, density); shape.SetAsBox(0.1, 1, b2Vec2(-1 + 0.1, 1), 0); body->CreateFixture(&shape, density); shape.SetAsBox(0.1, 1, b2Vec2(1 - 0.1, 1), 0); body->CreateFixture(&shape, density);
