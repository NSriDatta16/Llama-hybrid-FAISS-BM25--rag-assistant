Your question is not very clear. But mostly, PCA is used to do denoise a dataset or reduce its dimensionality. What are you using PCA for? Secondly, although there are rules of thumb people use to derive how many principal components to take, there is no right or wrong here. People tend to look at a so-called elbow-plot which looks at the cumulative variance explained for every number of principal components and then look for that number of principal components before a large drop, i.e. the elbow.
