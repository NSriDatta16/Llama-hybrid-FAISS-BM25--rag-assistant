I have posted my directory structure and comments in another thread, but it is applicable here too! I have been using the following setup for a while now with great results: /site: This is where my actual working website will live. I'll install my CMS or platform in this directory after the templates are created. .htaccess (basic tweaks I usually find myself enabling anyway) robots.txt (so I don't forget to disallow items like /admin later) /source: Contains any comps, notes, documents, specifications, etc. /templates: Start here! Create all static templates that will eventually need to be ported into the CMS or framework of /site. /_behavior global.js (site-specific code; may be broken out into multiple files as needed) /_media: Images, downloadable files, etc. Organized as necessary /_style: I prefer modular CSS development so I normally end up with many stylesheet for each unique section of the website. This is cleaned up greatly with Blender - I highly recommend this tool! print.css (this eventually gets blended, so use @media print) reset.css ( Eric Meyer's ) screen.css (for @media screen, handheld) additional modules as necessary /_vendor: all 3rd party code (jQuery, shadowbox, etc.) Blendfile.yaml (for Blender; see above) template.html (basic starting template; can be copied and renamed for each unique template) /tests: Selenium unit tests
