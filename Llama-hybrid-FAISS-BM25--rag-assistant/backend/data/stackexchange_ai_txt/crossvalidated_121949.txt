Imputation of a binary variable by Bayesian logistic regression

In the book "Flexible Imputation of Missing Data" by Van Buuren, the following algorithm is presented I think I understand the algorithm as given, but I would like to know what is the "more elaborate modeling" needed to "define an explicit Bayesian method for drawing $\beta$ and $V$ from their exact posteriors". How could the algorithm be extended to achieve this ?
