Best practice is to add to the resize event, rather than replace it: window.addEventListener('resize', function(event) { ... }, true); An alternative is to make a single handler for the DOM event (but can only have one), eg. window.onresize = function(event) { ... }; jQuery may do some work to ensure that the resize event gets fired consistently in all browsers, but I'm not sure if any of the browsers differ, but I'd encourage you to test in Firefox, Safari, and IE.
