Note that actions we take are determined by weights of a CNN. If we win, then it means that actions we took are correct, which means that we want our actor to behave similarly in the future. What it means formally, though, is that probability of sampling such actions should be high. We make it happen by moving our weights in that directions. If we lose, then it means that in this situation actions we took were bad. Hence we prefer to avoid sampling actions like this - formally it means that we ascribe low probability to them.
