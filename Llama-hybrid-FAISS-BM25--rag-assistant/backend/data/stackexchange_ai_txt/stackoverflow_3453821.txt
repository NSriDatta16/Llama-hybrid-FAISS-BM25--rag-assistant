One simple and fundamental difference is Acyclic Graph != Tree For example, a->b I am not well versed in decision trees, but I am well versed in Bayesian Networks. Here are some things that you can do with Bayesian Networks that I am not sure if you can do with a decision tree. Researching how to do these things with a decision tree may reveal interesting differences. Compute the joint probability table between the variables Determine if two variables are conditionally independent Given some evidence, determine the distribution of the non-evidence variables given the evidence
