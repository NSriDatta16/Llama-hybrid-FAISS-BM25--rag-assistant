The true answer is vague: it depends on your prior model of the data. If you assumed the data to be normally distributed with a known mean, you could use the gamma distribution as the conjugate prior for Bayesian inference. Maybe use moment-matching estimates rather than using optimizing procedures for simplicity. The Bayesian approach might sound like overkill in such a simple context, but frequentist statistics depend a lot more on best-practices-like procedures that don't extend in a simple fashion to nonstandard problems like the one you're posing.
