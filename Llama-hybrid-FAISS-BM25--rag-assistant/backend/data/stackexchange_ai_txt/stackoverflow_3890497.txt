CouchDB replicate without deleting documents

Hi: I want to use a mobile CouchDB and a remote CouchDB. To transfer from mobile to remote DB I want to replicate the data. But for storage reasons I want to regularly delete old data from the mobile CouchDB and keep it on the remote CouchDB. As what I have seen local deletion will also be replicated. Is there any knowledge about how to handle this?
