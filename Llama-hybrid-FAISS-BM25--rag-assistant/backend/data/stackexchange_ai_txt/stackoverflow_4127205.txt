How do I override a Magento Core module?

I want to modify the code for the Order/Sales table in the admin interface and the PDF generation code without alterting the files in the core directory. How do I do this? I understand that I have to create a new module that uses the same paths as the files I want to overwrite, but I'm not sure what else I have to do...are there some special steps to go through for the config.xml of the module??
