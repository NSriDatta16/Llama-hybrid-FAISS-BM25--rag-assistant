I have not used it, but this is their preprint 's abstract (emphasis mine): Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations with capacity planning, goal setting, and anomaly detection. Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts — especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare . To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis . We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series. In the introduction: We have observed two main themes in the practice of creating business forecasts. First, completely automatic forecasting techniques can be hard to tune and are often too inflexible to incorporate useful assumptions or heuristics. Second, the analysts responsible for data science tasks throughout an organization typically have deep domain expertise about the specific products or services that they support, but often do not have training in time series forecasting. So it seems to me that they are not claiming to have made a substantial statistical advance here (although it is capable of far more than the simple model you outline). Instead, they claim that their system makes it feasible for large numbers of people without expertise in time series analysis to generate forecasts while applying their own domain expertise and system-specific constraints. If you already have expertise in both time series analysis and in coding complex models, this may not be very helpful to you. But if their claims are true, this could be hugely useful! Science (and commerce) advances not just because of new ideas, but also because of new tools and their spread (see this short Freeman Dyson piece about the topic and this response ). To take an example from statistics itself: R did not represent a statistical advance, but it is has been massively influential because it made it easy for lots more people to do statistical analysis. It has been the scaffolding on which a great deal of statistical understanding has been built. If we are lucky, Prophet may play a similar role. Dyson, Freeman J.
