Getting audio information from PCM data

I've never been able to understand how audio data is stored. However, I'd like to know a way to find the pitch of PCM data. Let's say, for example, that I recorded a single key being striked on a piano, in 16-bit mono PCM format at a given sample rate. How could I find the frequency, in hertz, of the audio? Simple code to get the average frequency works for me, but a more detailed explanation of how to better understand the format would be ideal. Thanks!
