Dragging an NSTextField inside of a window

Im attempting to make a little app that lets you add text boxes to you canvas (window). I have an NSTextField that needs to let you drag it around the window. When you drop it it needs to stay in the spot you mouse left it. Heres my code to make the fist text field: NSTextField *myTextField=[[NSTextField alloc] initWithFrame:NSMakeRect(200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 25.0)]; [myTextField setBordered:NO]; [myTextField setStringValue:@"Double Click to edit"]; [[window contentView] addSubview:myTextField]; //Some sort of dragging code for myTextField If anyone has ever done something like this any help is really appreciated.
