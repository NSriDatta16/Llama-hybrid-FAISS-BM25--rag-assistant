I want a function to be fired whenever one option of a radio element is checked. The radio elements are dynamically created by using jQuery

I want to place a function on input radio elements. These input radio elements are created dynamically by using jQuery . One dynamically-created (by the user's click) input element looks as follows: Information Communication Goods Attention I wrote the function as follows: $('input:radio').click(function () { if (this.checked) { // or $(this).attr('checked') alert(this.value); // or alert($(this).val()); } }); I found that this doesn't work because $('input:radio') can only work on static input radio elements, not dynamically-created input radio elements by using jQuery. Of course, I can embed the callback code in input radio elements, so it looks as follows. Information Communication Goods Attention Is there another elegant way to do it instead?
