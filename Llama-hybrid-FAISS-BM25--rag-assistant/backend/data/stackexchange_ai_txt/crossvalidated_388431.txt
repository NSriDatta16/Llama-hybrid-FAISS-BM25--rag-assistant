Which metric to use in an ordering problem? auPR / ROC / Lift?

I need to order Users from most likely to perform a binary action X in the next n days, to the least likely. To solve the problem I'm training a XGBoost classifier and ordering the Users by the predicted probability. The probablity itself doesn't matter, only that the order is correct. What would be a good method for evaluating this model? I thought about splitting the data to percentiles and checking the lift in each percentile when I expect to see a higher lift so the percentile increases. Problems with this approach - No "one number" metric, can't evaluate across different datasets. Thought about using auPR but I'm not sure what exactly the auPR number means. I read here that its ...The probability that if a “positive” edge is selected from the ranked list of the method, then an edge above it on the list will be “positive” Can someone explain why this actually means what it says? Is this the most fit metric to optimize in my case? Other suggestions?
