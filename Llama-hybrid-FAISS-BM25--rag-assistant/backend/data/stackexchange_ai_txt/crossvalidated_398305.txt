Calculating R-squared using standard errors

I have the following estimated model: $\hat{y} = 0.2857 + 0.8019x_1 - 0.0741x_2$ (the $t$ -statistics are $1.8959$ , $8.4198$ , and $-3.7017$ , respectively). Furthermore, I know the sample size $N = 92$ , the sum of squared residuals (SSR) [sum of squared errors (SSE)] $SSR = \sum_{i=1}^N[\hat{u}_i^2]=39.3601$ , and the (average sample) standard deviation of the dependent variable $\hat{\sigma}_y = 0.8861$ . Lastly, in an earlier question I have (correctly) calculated the standard error of the regression: Mean of Squared Residuals (MSR) [Mean Squared Error (MSE)]: $MSR = \frac{1}{89} \cdot 39.3601 \approx 0.4422$ Standard Error of the Regression (Root MSR [Root MSE]): $SE_R = \sqrt{0.4422} \approx 0.6650$ Central Question: how to calculate $R^2$ ? (The answer should be (approximately) $0.4491$ ) This answer ( https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/834681/when-residual-standard-error-is-equal-to-standard-deviation-of-dependent-variabl ) suggests using the formula $SE_R = (1-R^2)\hat{\sigma}_y$ , but using it yields $R^2 \approx 0.4995$ $(*)$ .
