How to feed tuples of multiple features to the input layer of a Neural Network

I have a dataset for which every object has multiple features, and some of those features exist in tuples, like as in list of $(x, y)$ coordinates for each object. I know I can create an input layer of number of neurons equal to number of features of each object, but how do I pass these 'tuple' sets to the input. Do I break them and append to create a longer list of features, but will that not lead to loss in some correlation between these 2 sets of points from tuples?
