In 6 years of writing HTML and CSS for a living, the vast majority of my CSS issues have come from Internet Explorer. As pointed out in other answers, you can use conditional comments to serve additional stylesheets to IE (or to add a class to the or `` element, if you don’t like multiple stylesheets). Unlike CSS hacks, conditional comments are explicit and supported. Unlike trying to detect IE from the user-agent string`, they’re guaranteed to work. As for non-IE CSS issues, I’ve never found one that was worth browser detection.
