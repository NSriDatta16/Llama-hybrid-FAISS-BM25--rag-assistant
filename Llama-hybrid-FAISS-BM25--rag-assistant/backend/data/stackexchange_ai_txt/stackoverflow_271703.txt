You don't need to decode JPGs if you're scaling down by a factor of 8. JPG images consist of blocks of 8 by 8 pixels, DCT-transformed. The average value of this block is the 0,0 coefficient of the DCT. So, scaling down a factor of 8 is merely a matter of throwing away all other components. Scaling down even further (eg 4000->200) is just a matter of scaling down from 4000 to 500, and then scaling normally from 500 to 200 pixels.
