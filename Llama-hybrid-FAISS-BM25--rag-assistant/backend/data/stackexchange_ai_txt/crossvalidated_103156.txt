What's the proper notation for a formula that includes values sampled from a distribution?

I'm trying to write an equation for a time series $\text{TS}$ containing noisy and unevenly sampled data from a function $m(t)$. Here's what I've come up with: $$\text{TS}(t \in \mathcal{U}(0, 1)) = m(t) + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1) \quad $$ or maybe $$\text{TS}(t) = m(t) + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1) \quad t \in \mathcal{U}(0, 1)$$ but I fear that the $t$ part is incorrect because $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ is a distribution, not a set. It's easy to program such an example, here's the code for example in python: n_samples = 50 t_sample = np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples) TS_sample = m(t_sample) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n_samples) Any advice?
