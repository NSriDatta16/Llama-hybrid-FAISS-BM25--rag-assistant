Any real experiences of sharing a sqlite db on a network drive?

I have a client who is interested in hiring my company to do a small, custom, multi-user contact database/crm. They don't care about the technology I use, as long as the product is hosted inside their organization (no "cloud" hosting). Now the problem is that their IT department refuses to host any application developed by an outside company on their servers, additionally they will not allow any server not serviced by them inside of their network. The only means of sharing data that IT would allow is a windows network share... I was thinking to do the application as a fat client in Adobe Air, and let all users access a shared sqlite database, but then I read a lot of negative things about this approach. So I'm asking you - Are there people out there who have actually tried this ? What are your experiences ?
