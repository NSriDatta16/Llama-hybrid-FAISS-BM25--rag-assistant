I think you are looking for a code coverage tool. A code coverage tool will analyze your code as it is running, and it will let you know which lines of code were executed and how many times, as well as which ones were not. You could try giving this open source code coverage tool a chance: TestCocoon - code coverage tool for C/C++ and C#.
