Between for and while: while does not need initialization nor update statement, so it may look better, more elegant; for can have statements missing, one two or all, so it is the most flexible and obvious if you need initialization, looping condition and "update" before looping. If you need only loop condition (tested at the beginning of the loop) then while is more elegant. Between for/while and do-while : in do-while the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop. More confortable if the loop must be executed at least once.
