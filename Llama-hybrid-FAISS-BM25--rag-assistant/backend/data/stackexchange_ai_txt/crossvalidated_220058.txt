That most imputation packages don't work, has to do with their underlying algorithms. Imputation is done by employing inter-attribute correlations to estimate the missing values. An easy understandable example: You have attributes A,B,C,D. In row 20 attribute D is missing. From the past data the algorithm knows, when A is value x1 and B is value x2 and C is value x3 then the value of D is most likly x4. If now all four attributes are missing, the algorithm can not work. What algorithms being able to deal with this need to do is to consider information of other rows, to solve this problem. The concrete problem could be fixed with one of this approaches: Use Amelia options: lag, leads, polytime (if you do not use these options it is doing nothing time series specific) Impute each column seperatly with imputeTS package (that is a package explicitly for time series imputation - but does not support multivariate datasets) Use imputeTS to impute each column, but then restore all NAs (except the rows where all values are missing), then use an imputation package like Amelia to impute the rest (better than option 2 if you think the inter-attribute correlations are stronger than the inter-time correlation)
