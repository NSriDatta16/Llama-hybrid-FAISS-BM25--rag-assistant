For a score range (i.e. a continuous variable), you can use a paired t -test , which will allow you to compare the mean, or average, score among teachers before and after the training workshop. Using the free statistical program, R, you can use the below code to run a paired t -test: t.test(prescore,postscore,paired=TRUE) # where prescore is before; postscore is after If the resulting test generates a p value less than 0.05 (this seems to be an appropriate p value for this type of situation, correct me if I am wrong), then you can infer that there was a change in average score among teachers before and after the training workshop. Additionally, you can use the confidence intervals to determine the magnitude of this change. Let me know if there is anything that I need to clarify!
