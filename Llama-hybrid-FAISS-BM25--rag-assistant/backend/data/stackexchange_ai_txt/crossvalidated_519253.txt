You mentioned that odd-even pattern, so let's investigate that. Category Observed Expected # Expected odd 92 110 50% even 128 110 50% And test with just these two categories.... Chi squared equals 5.891 with 1 degrees of freedom. The two-tailed P value equals 0.0152 That would generally be considered significant This kind of result only happens fifteen times out of a thousand. Does that mean that we have a publishable result? The binomial test (more exact when there are two categories) gives p = 0.0062, also significant. There are several problems here. Firstly we chose to focus on one aspect of the data after we had collected it . We ignored others. For example, we could have tested for multiples of 3, or primes/non primes or ... many other choices are possible. Nearly all those other choices find "not significant". This is p-hacking the green jellybean fallacy, illustrated by xkcd . By subdividing or grouping data it is often possible to find a result that is significant. The proper response is to investigate further. If this is a real effect, it should become a stronger result with more data. If it just "green jellybeans" then it won't be repeatable. And (although not the same experiment) the German 6-aus-49 lottery has no odd-even pattern. Secondly we have a strong "prior": We inspect the machine and the balls and don't notice anything that seems amiss. We know from our general experience of such machines that they are usually quite fair. What would you estimate the probablity of the machine, or the operator, being substantially unfair, prior to the experiment? Clearly there is some judgement here, but suppose we say 0.001 (one in a thousand chance) Now, given this result, how likely is it that the machine is substantially unfair. Well, this will take you into Bayesian statistics. We would need to quantify "substantially unfair", but if an unfair machine will always give results like this [P(X²>5.891 | unfair)=1] then the probablity that the machine is unfair, given that we observe X²>5.891 is just 0.001/0.0152 =0.06. So we update our estimate of the machine being unfair from 0.001 to 0.06. We still think it rather unlikely that the machine is unfair.
