The common correlation $\rho$ can have value $+1$ but not $-1$. If $\rho_{X,Y}= \rho_{X,Z}=-1$, then $\rho_{Y,Z}$ cannot equal $-1$ but is in fact $+1$. The smallest value of the common correlation of three random variables is $-\frac{1}{2}$. More generally, the minimum common correlation of $n$ random variables is $-\frac{1}{n-1}$ when, regarded as vectors, they are at the vertices of a simplex (of dimension $n-1$) in $n$-dimensional space. Consider the variance of the sum of $n$ unit variance random variables $X_i$. We have that $$\begin{align*} \operatorname{var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{var}(X_i) + \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\neq i}^n \operatorname{cov}(X_i,X_j)\\ &= n + \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j\neq i}^n \rho_{X_i,X_j}\\ &= n + n(n-1)\bar{\rho} \tag{1} \end{align*}$$ where $\bar{\rho}$ is the average value of the $\binom{n}{2}$correlation coefficients. But since $\operatorname{var}\left(\sum_i X_i\right) \geq 0$, we readily get from $(1)$ that $$\bar{\rho} \geq -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$ So, the average value of a correlation coefficient is at least $-\frac{1}{n-1}$. If all the correlation coefficients have the same value $\rho$, then their average also equals $\rho$ and so we have that $$\rho \geq -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$ Is it possible to have random variables for which the common correlation value $\rho$ equals $-\frac{1}{n-1}$? Yes. Suppose that the $X_i$ are uncorrelated unit-variance random variables and set $Y_i = X_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n X_j = X_i -\bar{X}$. Then, $E[Y_i]=0$, while $$\displaystyle \operatorname{var}(Y_i) = \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^2 + (n-1)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 = \frac{n-1}{n}$$ and $$\operatorname{cov}(Y_i,Y_j) = -2\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) + (n-2)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{n}$$ giving $$\rho_{Y_i,Y_j} = \frac{\operatorname{cov}(Y_i,Y_j)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{var}(Y_i)\operatorname{var}(Y_j)}} =\frac{-1/n}{(n-1)/n} = -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$ Thus the $Y_i$ are random variables achieving the minimum common correlation value of $-\frac{1}{n-1}$. Note, incidentally, that $\sum_i Y_i = 0$, and so, regarded as vectors, the random variables lie in a $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane of $n$-dimensional space.
