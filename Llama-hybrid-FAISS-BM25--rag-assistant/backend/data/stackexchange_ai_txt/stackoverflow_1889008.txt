I'd use a FlowLayoutPanel . It will do exactly what you describe. Add 3 panels to it. In the 2nd panel, add another FlowLayoutPanel. Inside that one, add a label and YourCollapsablePanel. When clicking the label, toggle the visibility of the panel below it. If you mean for it to collapse like the Toolbox does in visual studio then the DockPanelSuite will do that for you. You can turn off the ability to drag and dock the windows elsewhere.
