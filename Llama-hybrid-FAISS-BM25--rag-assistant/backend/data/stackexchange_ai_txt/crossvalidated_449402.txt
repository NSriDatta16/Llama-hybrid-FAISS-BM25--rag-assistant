The logistic regression in fact does produce probability output. If your process truly fits the logistic model, then you will get the probability distribution as an output too: $$Pr(y_i=1|X)=\frac{e^{X_i\beta}}{e^{X_i\beta}+1}$$ This does not have to be true with every classifier, of course. In case of logistic regression, we typically calibrate ( fit ) it using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or a similar procedure. There, we use the above probability in one way or another. So, the fitting procedure itself is based on the probabilistic interpretation of the logistic regression. Other classifier don't need to be based on probabilities, and can use any kind of loss function minimization. This probably makes them not necessarily produce the probabilities as outputs. The question is whether we can interpret any bounded output [0,1] as a probability? I'd say NO, not necessarily.
