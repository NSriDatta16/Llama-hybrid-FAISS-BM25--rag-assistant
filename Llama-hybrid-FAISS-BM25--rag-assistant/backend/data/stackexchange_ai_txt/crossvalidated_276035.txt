This is an old question but the answer accepted is incorrect or at least incomplete. The user wants to calculate the standard deviation over 12-month data where the mean and standard deviation are already calculated over each month. Assuming that the number of samples in each month is the same, then it is possible to calculate the sample mean and variance over the year from each month's data. For simplicity assume that we have two sets of data: $X=\{x_1,....x_N\}$ $Y=\{y_1,....,y_N\}$ with known values of sample mean and sample variance, $\mu_x$ , $\mu_y$ , $\sigma^2_x$ , $\sigma^2_y$ . Now we want to calculate the same estimates for $Z=\{x_1,....,x_N, y_1,...,y_N\}$ . Consider that $\mu_x$ , $\sigma^2_x$ are calculated as: $\mu_x = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x_i}{N}$ $\sigma^2_x = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x^2_i}{N}-\mu^2_x$ To estimate mean and variance over the total set we need to calculate: $\mu_z = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x_i +\sum^N_{i=1} y_i }{2N}= (\mu_x+\mu_y)/2$ which is given in the accepted answer. For variance however the story is different: $\sigma^2_z = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x^2_i +\sum^N_{i=1} y^2_i }{2N}-\mu^2_z$ $\sigma^2_z = \frac{1 }{2}(\frac{\sum^N_{i=1} x^2_i}{N}-\mu^2_x + \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} y^2_i}{N}-\mu^2_y )+\frac{1 }{2}(\mu^2_x+\mu^2_y) -(\frac{\mu_x+\mu_y}{2})^2$ $\sigma^2_z = \frac{1 }{2}(\sigma^2_x+\sigma^2_y )+(\frac{\mu_x-\mu_y}{2})^2$ So if you have the variance over each subset and you want the variance over the whole set then you can average the variances of each subset if they all have the same mean. Otherwise, you need to add the variance of the mean of each subset. As an example assume that over the first half of the year we produce exactly 1000 MWh per day and in the second half, we produce 2000 MWh per day. Then the mean and variance of energy production in the first and the second half are 1000 and 2000 for the mean and 0 for the variance of each half year. Now we want to calculate the variance of energy production over the whole year. If we average the two variances we arrive at zero, which is not correct since the energy per day over the whole year is not constant. Hence we need to add the variance of all the means from each subset. This has a close connection to the law of total variance. enter link description here . $$\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \operatorname{E}[\operatorname{Var}(Y \mid X)] + \operatorname{Var}(\operatorname{E}[Y \mid X])$$ To use the above theorem in this case, we can interpret the conditioning variable X as Y belongs to group $X_i$ . In the context of the original question, X is the random variable indicating the month of the year and Y is energy production per day.
