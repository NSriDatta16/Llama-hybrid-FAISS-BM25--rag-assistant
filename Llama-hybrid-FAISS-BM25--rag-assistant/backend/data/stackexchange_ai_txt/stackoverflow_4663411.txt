You can add a group by clause into the inner query, which groups by all three columns, basically returning only unique rows. (I also changed 'premium' to 'cost' to match your example tables, and dropped the agent part) SELECT sq.ID, sq.name, SUM(sq.Cost) AS total_cost FROM ( SELECT m.id, m.name, g.Cost FROM members m INNER JOIN member_selections s USING(ID) INNER JOIN selection_details g USING(planid) GROUP BY m.ID, m.NAME, g.Cost ) sq group by sq.ID, sq.NAME
