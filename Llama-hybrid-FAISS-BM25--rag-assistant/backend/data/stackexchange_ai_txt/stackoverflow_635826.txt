Getting access to touchesBegan/Moved/Ended to a UITableViewCell

I'm curious to understand exactly what kind of hacking would need to take place in order to be able to handle additional gestures on a UITableViewCell using the touches* API. I'd like to add additional functionality to my UITableView by giving the capability to say call upon a selector based on a swipe from left to right. Perhaps a different selector for a swipe from right to left. Straight forward using the touches API, but how does one go ahead and do something similar with a UITableViewCell?
