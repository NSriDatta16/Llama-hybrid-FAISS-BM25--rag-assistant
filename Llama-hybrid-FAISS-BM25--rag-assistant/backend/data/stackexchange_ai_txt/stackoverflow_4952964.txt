Just adding, since no one has said this and it seems like you don't understand this yet: Your client_items view must, somehow, have access to the order_no variable. If for some reason the value is not being passed along via the URL, it must get the value from somehwere. There are only three real locations where it could get this value: Database : this will work if you are, for example, storing something like a cart which is directly linked to a user. So for example, you might be able to do something like order_no = Order.objects.filter(cart__user=request.user).order_no which would get the order associated with the user's current cart, then return the order_no value. Session : you store the order_no in the session. This would assume you had an earlier view where the value for order_no was set, at which point you would save it using request.session['order_no']=order_no . Later, when you wanted to retrieve the value, you would simply use order_no=request.session['order_no'] in the view. Cookie : not really recommended, but an option nonetheless. It's complicated because in the first view you'd have to create the response object (as in resp = render_to_response(template_name, locals(), RequestContext(request)) and then write a cookie to it resp.set_cookie("order_no", order_no) . You retrieve it using request.COOKIES['order_no'] There are other, bizarre, places you could store the value: files, cache, other data storage formats, etc. Not at all recommended.
