The answer to getting this to work was super easy, yet not overly obvious. Instead of: ip.onblur = function onblur(event){stopCalcUpInt(this,this.value);} I did this: ip.setAttribute('onblur','stopCalcUpInt(this,\'' + ip.value + '\');'); Works perfectly... no more banging my head against the wall! Yay!
