Understanding correlation between estimated class probabilities for multinomial distribution

Suppose that I estimate class probabilities for a multinomial distribution with three classes using individual binomial confidence intervals. I'd like to create a confidence interval the error around the value of a linear combination of these estimates. In particular, if the value of an outcome in each class is different (but deterministic), I'd like to understand the average outcome value. So if $X_i \sim Normal(\hat{p}_i, \sigma_{\hat{p}_i}^2)$ , I want to understand the distribution of, $$ Y = aX_1 + bX_2 + cX_3 $$ I know that the distribution of $Y$ will be normal, and the mean of this distribution is straightforward. My issue comes from the fact that I think that I need to understand the covariance structure between the errors on my estimates of the class probabilities in order to calculate the variance of it, and I'm unsure how to do that. Could anyone give me advice on how this should be done?
