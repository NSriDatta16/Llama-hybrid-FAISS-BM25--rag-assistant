Get dropdown value in VBA and get the name of the dropdown...nowhere to be found?

I created a dropdown by dragging the combo box onto my sheet from the UserForm toolbar. I assigned some values to it from some cells in the book. Now I want some VBA code to access the selected dropdown item's value in the form of a string. My dropdown contains only text. Also how do I find the name of this newly created dropdown (it's nowhere in the properties!)?
