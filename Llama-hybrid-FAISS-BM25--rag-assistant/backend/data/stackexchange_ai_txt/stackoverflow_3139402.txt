How to select following sibling/XML tag using XPath

I have an HTML file (from Newegg) and their HTML is organized like below. All of the data in their specifications table is ' desc ' while the titles of each section are in ' name. ' Below are two examples of data from Newegg pages. Brand Intel Series Core i5 Cores 4 Socket LGA 1156 Brand AMD Series Phenom II X4 Cores 4 Socket Socket AM3 In the end I would like to have a class for a CPU (which is already set up) that consists of a Brand, Series, Cores, and Socket type to store each of the data. This is the only way I can think of to go about doing this: if(parsedDocument.xpath(tr/td[@class="name"])=='Brand'): CPU.brand = parsedDocument.xpath(tr/td[@class="name"]/nextsibling?).text And doing this for the rest of the values. How would I accomplish the nextsibling and is there an easier way of doing this?
