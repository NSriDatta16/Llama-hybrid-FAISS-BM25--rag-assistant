Temperatures are continuous. It can be 23 degrees, 23.1 degrees, 23.100004 degrees. Sex is discrete. You can only be male or female (in classical thinking anyways). Something you could represent with a whole number like 1, 2, etc The difference is important as many statistical and data mining algorithms can handle one type but not the other. For example in regular regression, the Y must be continuous. In logistic regression the Y is discrete.
