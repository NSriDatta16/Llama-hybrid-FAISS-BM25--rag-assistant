Depends on the system, but the moment the amount of reusable could reaches a certain threshold I tend to try to convert logical chunks of it into "real" libraries in the same sense like you would use from 3rd parties (with documentation etc.) and put them into the respective library path, so that they become truly reusable. If you don't mind giving them away under some OSS license, you could even go as far as putting them into the CPAN/PyPI/PEAR-equivalent of whatever environment you're working with. This adds even more reuseability. I guess the important part still is that you bundle your code into real libraries. Then the retrieval part should be much easier since mostly automatic.
