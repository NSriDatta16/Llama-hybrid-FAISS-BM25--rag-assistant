If you add a UIImageView to your UIWindow in your app delegate (make sure it's below the root view), then make sure all your VC's are opaque, that should solve your problem. This would be easier to do in IB, especially if you have a MainWindow .xib already created (albeit blank)--you just drag and drop the image into the UIWindow.
