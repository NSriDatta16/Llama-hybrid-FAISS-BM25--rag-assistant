Is downsampling necessary in CNN?

I am still trying to understand the effect of any downsampling (reducing the input height and weight by 2 for example) by pooling or strided convolution? Does downsampling improve accuracy? Because in my experiment with UNet model, 1 original UNet with downsampling and upsampling, and 1 without downsampling (original height and width are maintained throughout the network), the accuracy is a lot better with downsampling. Thanks!
