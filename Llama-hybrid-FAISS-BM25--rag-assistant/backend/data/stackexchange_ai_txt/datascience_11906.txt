Well, there is some serious research going on in this direction under the label of "feature learning" . But as far as I know, it's not mature enough yet to be packaged into a software tool that renders manual software engineering superfluous. But there are important successes being achieved in that direction. Modern image recognition with deep neural networks often relies on features that the deeper layers of the neural network compute themselves instead of hand-crafted features developed by humans. So it's not entirely science-fiction. If you want to learn more about the image recognition part of the topic, you may want to watch this beautiful video lecture by Andrew Ng, one of the leading researchers in this field.
