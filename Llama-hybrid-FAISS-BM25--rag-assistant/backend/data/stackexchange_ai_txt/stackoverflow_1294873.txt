COM Automation / Running Excel Macros

Possibly, my questions do not presume a simple answer as I'm asking to share a specific experience. What kind of issues you experienced trying to execute Excel macros through COM Automation? Are there any specific requirements for creation of macros to be run through Automation? Can you share your experience with data (scalar and vector parameters) pass-in / pass-back for macros run through Automation? I have tried some ideas already and it worked; but I'd like to find out if someone had gone through that way and what issues to expect - before I invest time and resources in building the framework. Finally, I will share here results of my investigation and decision made at the end. Thank you, Albert Gareev
