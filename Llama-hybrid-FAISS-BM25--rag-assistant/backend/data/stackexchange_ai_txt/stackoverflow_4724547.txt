Help me in implementation of 'TableView' ans 'TableView Cell'

Im in aproject with the architecture like this: A table view on a view controller. Table cells are structured using 'uitableview cell' when a cell is selected(DidSelectedRow At IndexPath:), the cell expands. the expanded cell should show two views(a. data in first view & b. controls in the second view). ie I have to create two classes for drawing a cell. The tableView is parent, the two view classes are child. The loading of Table cell is done from both child cells. How to get the architecture. One idea i got is to 'Implement table view inside each tableViewCell' . But its very confusing from parent and this cells. So need an alternative architecture.. Thanks in advance..
