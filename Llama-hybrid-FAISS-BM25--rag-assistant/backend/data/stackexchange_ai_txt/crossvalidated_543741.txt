What is the data type of speed limit of a road network segment?

As you know the data type is one of the most important factors in selecting the Machine Learning algorithm. For example, K-means should not be employed for categorical data. I have a csv file containing road network segment features. One of my feature is speed limit which shows eligible speed in a road link. For example, we see the marks and signs in road which determine the eligible speed for driving. I would be grateful if you let me know the speed limit data is continues or categorical data (nominal data)?
