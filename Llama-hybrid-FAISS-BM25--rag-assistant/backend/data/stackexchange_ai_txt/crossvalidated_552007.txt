Very low score in binary classification score

I was wondering how to interpret and tweak a model with 10% accuracy, in binary classification. With common feature engineering, I get something around 65% accuracy. When I do some transformation on the features( fft) it goes down to around 10%. This tells that if I flip my predictions it would be 90% accuracy. As an example in stock exchange when it says buy I sell and vice versa. very Poor binary classification is very good when I reverse it. My question is that, what can I do to in fact make the model look reasonable. Or what is the next CORRECT step in this situation, toward improving the model? It just don't feel right to flip the predictions.
