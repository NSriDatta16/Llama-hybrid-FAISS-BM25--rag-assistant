jquery ajax and php arrays

I am trying to submit some data to a PHP script, however the PHP scripts expects the data to arrive in a specific format, like this example which is a dump of the post, Array ( [save] => Add to shortlist [cv_file] => Array ( [849709537] => Y [849709616] => Y [849709633] => Y ) ) The process is currently that a user selects the product they want using checkboxes and then clicks a submit button which fires the PHP scripts, The HTML looks like this, div class="row"> 849709537 Huddersfield Not currently working other Temporary Â£100,000 or more &nbsp; Current Role Developer Sectors Energy &amp; Utilities, Healthcare, Hospitality &amp; Travel, Installation &amp; Maintenance, Installation &amp; Maintenance About Me I am needing to use AJAX instead now, but I need to send the data to PHP in the format it expects here is what I have so far, $('#addshortlist').click(function() { var datastring = ui.draggable.children().attr('name')+"="+ui.draggable.children().val()+"&save=Add to shortlist"; alert(datastring); $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: '/search', data:ui.draggable.children().attr('name')+"="+ui.draggable.children().val()+"&save=Add to shortlist", success:function(){ alert("Success"+datastring); }, error:function() { alert("Fail"+datastring); } }); return false; }); I would really appreciate any help
