R - how to train a model to fit probabilities

I would like to train a model that has a probability (a success rate between 0 and 1) as outcome. So the data looks like this: feature1 feature2 success_rate 0.1 0.3 0.55 0.3 0.6 0.45 I started using xgboost (gradient boosting machine) with: "objective" = "reg:logistic" "eval_metric" = "auc" which means I doing a logistic regression using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as evaluation function to measure the improvement of the model. But I understand a logistic regression is usually trained with a categorical target (success or failure), not a probability. Does this matter? and is this the right approach?
