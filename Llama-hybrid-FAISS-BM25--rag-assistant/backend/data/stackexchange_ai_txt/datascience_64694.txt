F1_score(average='micro') is equal to calculating accuracy for multiclasification

Is f1_score(average='micro') always the same as calculating the accuracy. Or it is just in this case? I have tried with different values and they gave the same answer but I don't have the analytical demonstration. from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics import f1_score y_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2] y_pred = [0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1] print(f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro')) print(accuracy_score(y_true,y_pred)) # 0.3333333 # 0.3333333
