Your on the right track! Given your dataset, you can start by grouping the data by date and then calculate the total number of items sold on each date. This will give you a list of (date, total_items_sold) pairs. After that, you can use techniques like linear regression also remember linear regression assumes a linear relationship, so if your data shows more complex patterns, you might need to explore other regression techniques or time series forecasting methods like ARIMA or machine learning algorithms.
