Basic Points Rotation can make interpretation of components clearer Oblique rotation often makes more theoretical sense. I.e., Observed variables can be explained in terms of a smaller number of correlated components. Example 10 tests all measuring ability with some measuring verbal and some measuring spatial ability. All tests are intercorrelated, but intercorrelations within verbal or within spatial tests are greater than across test type. A parsimonious PCA might involve two correlated components, a verbal and a spatial. Theory and research suggests that these two abilities are correlated. Thus, an oblique rotation makes theoretical sense.
