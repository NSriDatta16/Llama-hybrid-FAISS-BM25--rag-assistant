You could use an imagemap ( map ) to contain your list, but that may be abusing the map tag. What I'm saying is something like the following: 1 2 3 EDIT: W3C states that the map attribute is block level: The MAP element content model allows authors to combine the following: One or more AREA elements. These elements have no content but specify the geometric regions of the image map and the link associated with each region. Note that user agents do not generally render AREA elements. Therefore, authors must provide alternate text for each AREA with the alt attribute (see below for information on how to specify alternate text). Block-level content. This content should include A elements that specify the geometric regions of the image map and the link associated with each region. Note that the user agent should render block-level content of a MAP element. Authors should use this method to create more accessible documents.
