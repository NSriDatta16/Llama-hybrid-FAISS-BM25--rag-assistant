I don't think there is anything exactly like what you want out there; probably the closest would be a rich text editor such as FCKEditor or TinyMCE. These libraries are a bit like the UI you used to write your question in StackOverflow, except that they have toolbar buttons for the different FORM elements (or if they don't, you can easily add them yourselves). A user faced with one of these editors (assuming you'd configured it to have buttons for FORM elements) would be able to lay out a form with basically no technical knowledge. However, if a rich text editor doesn't work for you, then you're basically stuck with using something like the jQuery UI library (I'm thinking mainly of the Draggable sub-library) to build your own solution.
