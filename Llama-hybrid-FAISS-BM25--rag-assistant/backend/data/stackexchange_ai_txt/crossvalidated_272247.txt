How to model spatial covariance using Gaussian processes

My data set consists of N noisy time series, each belonging to a point on a surface. The dynamics of each time series are correlated, with correlation decreasing with spatial distance. I hope to model this data set using Gaussian processes, but need some help getting started. I wish to estimate a stationary (in time and space) covariance function for measurements on this surface, to both de-noise the actual measurements / time series, as well as possibly predict optimal locations for future measurements. Is anyone familiar with either a GP library, or at least some other people's work, related to this problem? Work-arounds that I can think of are: trying to solve the problem for each time step (I believe that is called Kriging?) and performing some sort of averaging over multiple such results try to warp my measurement points into some sort of regular grid, simply measure the covariance matrix in this warped space, regularize it (the diagonals should probably be constant), and then do my prediction in that warped space. Either way, the above feels like reinventing the wheel. I have also considered using "multi-tasking", for combining heterogenous data sources, such as what is described in " https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2561-dependent-gaussian-processes.pdf ", but doesn't seem to let me extend to other locations on the surface, since the spatial information is lost.
