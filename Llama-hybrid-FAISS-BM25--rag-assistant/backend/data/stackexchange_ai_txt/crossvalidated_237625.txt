Are there circumstances in which BIC is useful and AIC is not?

In the Wikipedia entry for Akaike information criterion , we read under Comparison with BIC (Bayesian information criterion) that ...AIC/AICc has theoretical advantages over BIC...AIC/AICc is derived from principles of information; BIC is not...BIC has a prior of 1/R (where R is the number of candidate models), which is "not sensible"...AICc tends to have practical/performance advantages over BIC...AIC is asymptotically optimal...BIC is not asymptotically optimal...the rate at which AIC converges to the optimum is...the best possible. In the AIC talk section , there are numerous comments about the biased presentation of the comparison with BIC section. One frustrated contributor protested that the whole article "reads like a commercial for cigarettes." In other sources, for example in this thesis appendix , the tenor of the claims for AIC seem more realistic. Thus, as a service to the community, we ask: Q: Are there circumstances in which BIC is useful and AIC is not?
