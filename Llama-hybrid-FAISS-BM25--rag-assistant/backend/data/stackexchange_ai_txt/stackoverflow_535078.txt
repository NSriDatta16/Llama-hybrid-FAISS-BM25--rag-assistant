If you are using a single GlassFish administration console to manage multiple application servers throughout your environment, those application servers can share a common configuration. If each deployed application server has its own administration console, you can write a script to call the CLI (asadmin) to create and configure the connection pools. Actually, you can use the CLI to configure a distributed deployment in the 1st use case, but you'll have to specify which configuration you are modifying. The CLI is good for automation. Hopefully the following resources help: http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4341/abdjl?a=view http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=GlassFishV2Architecture http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/6nfq988or?a=expand (for asadmin CLI reference) http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/create-jdbc-connection-pool-1?a=view (see --target to specify the target in a multi-host deployment) John Clingan, GlassFish Group Product Manager
