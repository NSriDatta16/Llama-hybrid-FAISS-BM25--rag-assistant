How long should I prepare for SCJP?

Ok I know this might sound a bit silly, as it depends on the person, but on average how much time should I spend on preparing for SCJP? I already have some experience with Java (a few small and medium projects for my university, from implementing a simple "ships" game to some client-server stuff). I was thinking about taking it around jun-july '10 so I'd have around 7-8months, is it enough/too much/not enough? Also I've been looking for a good book, is there anything better than: "Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Study Guide" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates? And what about some practical questions (like "implement this and this" or "write a piece of code which does...")? Ah and is it really worth it (I'd spend my own money). I'm not asking if it will make me a better programmer (as I've seen such a thread on stackoverflow alread) but do the employers even care about it?
