Using a MatchEvaluator delegate to generate a list without using class variables?

Background: I'm trying to generate a list of references from a page that has references throughout, and replace the reference markup with HTML. I'm working in C# Text looks something like: The dog ate 3 cats and felt ill http://cateater.com I'd like to use the Regex.Replace method to replace all the s, pushing them into a Hash that I can later render as a list of references. Problem: it looks like the way to run code during the replace operation is to use a 'MatchEvaluator Delegate' that takes in a Match object, but doesn't seem like it can take other parameters. The example on MSDN uses a class variable to accomplish this, but I'm hoping there is a more elegant solution.
