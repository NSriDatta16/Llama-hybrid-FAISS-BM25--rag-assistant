Imagine that you want to estimate mean age of some population, so you draw some large sample from the population, collect the data about age of the study participants and calculate mean from it. If you conducted simulation you would assume some distribution for age and assume parameters (or hyperparameters ), then you would conduct the simulation and calculate the mean of the values created using the simulation. Mean of the simulation is mean of the simulation, it doesn't have to have anything in common with anything appearing in the real world unless you conduct your simulation in such manner so that the simulation resembles the real world phenomenon. For example, you could conduct the simulation of human age using a uniform distribution bounded in $[0,1]$ and then conclude that the average age is $0.5$, what obviously would have nothing to do with age of humans in the real world.
