I'm not aware of a refined statistical notion of plausibility. Statistics has concepts that are sort of related to plausibility, like significance (when an effect is significant, the null hypothesis is implausible), outliers (an outlier is a point so far from the rest of a sample that it isn't plausible that it came from the same population), and Bayesian probability (a more probable proposition is more plausible). But plausibility itself isn't formalized. In any case, the right way to answer your specific question, which was to assess how similar a statistic of a new sample was to the same statistic computed for previously published samples, is indeed meta-analysis. In particular, a forest plot would probably suffice.
