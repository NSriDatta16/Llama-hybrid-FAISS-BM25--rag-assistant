Several problems with this code; probably the most glaring is: int a = 0, b = 1; float Max, x; /* ... */ do { /* ... */ } while (x == b); You cannot compare an int and a float for equality. It might work once in a great while due to dumb luck :) but you cannot expect this code to function reliably. I strongly recommend changing all your int variables to double , all your float variables to double , and all the scanf(3) and printf(3) calls to match. While you can combine different primitive number types in one program, and even in one expression or statement, subtle differences in execution will take you hours to discover. Furthermore, comparing floating point formats for equality is almost never a good idea. Instead, compare the difference between two numbers to a epsilon value: if (fabs(a-b) You might want to scale your epsilon so that it matches the scale of your problem; since float really only supports about seven digits of precision, this comparison wouldn't work well: if (fabsf(123456789 - 123456789.1) You might want to find a good introduction to numerical analysis . (Incidentally, one of my favorite classes back in school. :) update The core of the problem is your while(x == b) . I fixed that and a few smaller problems, and this code seems to work: #include #include #include #define PI 3.141592653 float funtion_(float a, float x) { float result = 0; result = a * (sin(PI * x)); return result; } int main() { float A = 4.875; //average of the digits of the identification card float a = 0.0, b = 1.0; //maximum and minimum values of the interval [a, b] float h = 0; float N; float Max, x; float sin_; float inf; printf("\ninput the inf value: "); scanf("%f", &inf); printf("\ninput the N value: "); scanf("%f", &N); h = (b - a) / N; x = a - h; Max = -inf; do { x = x + h; sin_ = funtion_(A, x); if (sin_ >= Max) { Max = sin_; printf("\n new Max: %f found at A: %f x: %f\n", Max, A, x); } } while (x Running this program with some small inputs: $ ./localmax input the inf value: 1 input the N value: 10 new Max: 0.000000 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.000000 new Max: 1.506458 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.100000 new Max: 2.865453 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.200000 new Max: 3.943958 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.300000 new Max: 4.636401 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.400000 new Max: 4.875000 found at A: 4.875000 x: 0.500000 Maximum value: 4.87500 $
