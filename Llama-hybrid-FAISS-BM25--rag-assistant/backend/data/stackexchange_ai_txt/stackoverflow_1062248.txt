I have a quick but partial and inelegant solution, if you don't mind having the progressbar yellow instead of green: ProgressBar1.SmoothReverse := True; ProgressBar1.State := pbsPaused; // for yellow or pbsError for red Or if you don't mind loosing the vista/theme look and go back to a flat blue one: UxTheme.SetWindowTheme(ProgressBar1.Handle, ' ', ' '); The real "problem" according to Microsoft is that you try to "pervert" a ProgressBar into a Meter which they claim it is not. You could also try to draw it yourself ;-)
