It looks like the buffer allocated isn't large enough. If you have 8 bits (1 byte) per color component, you are allocating one byte too few. This could explain why the image shows correct for only a part of the image. I would think the following lines: //Create enough storage for a 512x512 power of 2 texture int8_t lBuf[2*512*512]; memcpy (lBuf, frameBuf, 320*480*2); would need to be changed to: //Create enough storage for a 512x512 power of 2 texture int8_t lBuf[3*512*512]; memcpy (lBuf, frameBuf, 320*480*3);
