According to MCOBERTURA-65 , the maven cobertura plugin still doesn't know how to aggregate reports of sub-modules into a consolidated one. Some work has been done to implement a merge target on the maven cobertura plugin (see MCOBERTURA-33 ) but this code hasn't been included in the plugin yet. I didn't test the patch myself and can't say if it's worth a try. In consequence, lots of people indeed suggest to use the maven dashboard plugin but I'd personally stay far away from it as it isn't very satisfying on the long term and I faced lots of issues with it (technical problems, lost of history,...). Instead, I warmly recommend Sonar . Have a look at Nemo , a public instance of the last version of Sonar, for a live demo of this tool. See for example the Commons Digester project and the drill down of code coverage .
