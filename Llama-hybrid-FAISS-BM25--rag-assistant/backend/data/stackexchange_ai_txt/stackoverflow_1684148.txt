"Sensible" is something that has to be defined by your application's business rules and/or your storage medium. In MySQL, the DATETIME column type has a valid range of '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59' while the TIMESTAMP has a valid range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC. If you're asking the user for their birth year, then you need to be able to go back all the way to around 1900. However, if you're having them set a future appointment, then only 2009+ is valid.
