Drag-n-drop emails to a SharePoint library

Problem Statement: There is a Document Library named "Temp". This library is associated with a content type "Cnt_Temp" which contains the DropDownList for the field document type Legal Document, Preview Document, Art Document, Presentation document etc. Now I open a library in Explorer View and drop an Outlook 2007 email (sample email) into this library. When I drop the email it should generate a pop up or something where the user can mention the type of document from the drop down list, which is a field in the content type. WSS limitation: Content type selection box is not invoked when performing drag-n-drop or copy-paste functionality. Is there a solution?
