How SingleInstanceService of Jnlp Api works?

As it is mentioned that SingleInstanceService allow applications launched under Java Web Start to register themselves as singletons, and to be passed in new parameter sets when user attempts to launch new instances of them. How it works ? We register listners to the service once and it won't allow it to create another instance.but basiclly how it works that i am not getting. SingleInstanceService sis; ... try { sis = (SingleInstanceService)ServiceManager.lookup("javax.jnlp.SingleInstanceService"); } catch (UnavailableServiceException e) { sis=null; } ... // Register the single instance listener at the start of your application SISListener sisL = new SISListener(); sis.addSingleInstanceListener(sisL); ... // Remember to remove the listener before your application exits sis.removeSingleInstanceListener(sisL); System.exit(0); // Implement the SingleInstanceListener for your application class SISListener implements SingleInstanceListener { public void newActivation(String[] params) { // your code to handle the new arguments here ... } } what i want to know is that how it won't allow another instance once we have bind our application with SingleInstanceListener ?
