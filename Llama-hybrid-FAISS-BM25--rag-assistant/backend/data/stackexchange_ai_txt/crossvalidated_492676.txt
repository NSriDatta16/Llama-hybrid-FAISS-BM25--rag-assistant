Yes, AIC (or AICc) are still "generally appropriate". We make the assumption of a Gaussian error (see below). Avoid computing AIC manually if both models are of the same type, that said: Comparing across model types requires attention to detail to make sure that parameters are counted using similar rules, and that additive constants are consistently included or not. (from: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-August/250839.html ) For more information type stats:::logLik.nls to see for how the log-likelihood is calculated for nls fitted models as a function of their residuals and their associated weights. (Effectively it is just a Gaussian log-likelihood of the weighted residuals.)
