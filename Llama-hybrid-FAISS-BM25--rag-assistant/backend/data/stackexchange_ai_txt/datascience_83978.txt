Can a Box plot be used for finding the useful features from the dataset?

I am reading a book by professor Trevor Hastie and professor Robert Tibshirani called "Introduction to Statistical Learning". In the applied section of the chapter 4, there is a question 11(b) that says: Explore the data graphically in order to investigate the association between "mpg01" and the other features. Which of the other features seem most likely to be useful in predicting "mpg01"? Scatterplots and boxplots may be useful tools to answer this question. Describe your findings. Here I tried plotting those box plots but how to find the useful features by analyzing them. I'm certain that from the correlation matrix and the scatter plots I can judge what all features could be useful, but how come a box-plot be used for that matter, could someone please share their opinion.
