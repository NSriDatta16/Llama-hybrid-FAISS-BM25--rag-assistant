Log transformed response variable and overfitting issues in random forest regression

I am trying to fit random forest regression for continuous skewed response variable with so many zeros. Here is the plot of the response variable: In An Introduction to Statistical Learning , authors used log transformed salary to fit regression trees so that its distribution has more of a typical bell-shape. How does this log transformation of response variable work in random forest regression? I see some conflicting suggestions are available online! I have got the following results so far without log transformed response variable using Python sklearn framework: MAE train: 4.07 MAE test: 12.25 MSE train: 26.46 MSE test: 231.33 R^2 train: 0.96 R^2 test: 0.68 Sample data: (Sample size 179) I see that the above results have issues with the overfitting although I knew that random forest regression doesn't suffer from overfitting. Not sure what happened here! I appreciate your suggestions! Thanks!
