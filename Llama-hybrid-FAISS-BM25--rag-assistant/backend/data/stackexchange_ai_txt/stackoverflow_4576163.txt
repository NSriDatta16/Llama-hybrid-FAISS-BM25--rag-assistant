Clarification needed about Python CSV file format parsing

Format is like: CHINA;2002-06-25 00:00:00.000;5,60 CHINA;2002-06-26 00:00:00.000;5,32 CHINA;2002-06-27 00:00:00.000;5,31 and I try to use Python's CSV tools to parse it but cannot understand the paragraph, source : And while the module doesnâ€™t directly support parsing strings, it can easily be done: import csv for row in csv.reader(['one,two,three']): print row Could someone clarify the line ['one,two,three'] ? How would you use it with format A;B;C ?
