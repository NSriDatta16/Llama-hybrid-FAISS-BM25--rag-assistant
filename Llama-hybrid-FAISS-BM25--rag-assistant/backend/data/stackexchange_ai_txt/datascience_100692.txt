Reinforcement Learning - after 800k timesteps agent wont learng

I'm study and try a reinforcement learning. now im using gym and stable-baseline. My project have a step where I calculate a reward with a function. -> step() -> calculate_reward() -> return calculated reward -> in step(): I set total_reward = -1000 and Done = True But agent will interrupt everytime to this step becouse it using the same action. Tick: 23 Price: 131.067600 - Next Price: 126.127800 - Action: 0 - Reward: 4.939800 Tick: 24 Price: 128.367200 - Next Price: 130.804100 - Action: 0 - Reward: -2.436900 Tick: 23 Price: 131.067600 - Next Price: 126.127800 - Action: 0 - Reward: 4.939800 Tick: 24 Price: 128.367200 - Next Price: 130.804100 - Action: 0 - Reward: -2.436900 Tick: 23 Price: 131.067600 - Next Price: 126.127800 - Action: 0 - Reward: 4.939800 Tick: 24 Price: 128.367200 - Next Price: 130.804100 - Action: 0 - Reward: -2.436900 What is wrong in my concept?
