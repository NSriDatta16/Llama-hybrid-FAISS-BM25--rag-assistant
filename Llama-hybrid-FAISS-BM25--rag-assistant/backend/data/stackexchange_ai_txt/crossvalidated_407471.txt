As already said in comments, you should analyze your counts as is, and not convert to percentages. The information in a percent value of 10% is very different between 1 of 10, or 100 of thousand, say ... and you loose that information! So you could analyze this as binomial data, with a logistic regression. I just give some code to get you started: Y =19"," =19") missing |z|) (Intercept) -4.5862 0.1750 -26.213 =19 0.7505 0.1877 4.000 6.34e-05 *** Age14-18 0.9559 0.1894 5.047 4.49e-07 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 237.77 on 5 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 176.53 on 2 degrees of freedom AIC: 221.53 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 This is just a start of a full analysis ... I leave it there. Just a hint: look at the large deviance residuals.
