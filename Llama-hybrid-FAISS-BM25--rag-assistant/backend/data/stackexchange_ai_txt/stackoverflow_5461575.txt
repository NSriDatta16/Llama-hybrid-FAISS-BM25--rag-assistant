Animated 'show' without jQuery

I want to do a little animation on this latest website ii'm working on. Basically, I need one or two divs/paragraph show/hide based on onClick event on either radio buttons set or checkbox (then, if radio/check is value A, show div/p, if it's B then hide it) The thing is, that this is all I would like to javascript-ify on that particular website, so jQuery looks like a little overkill (even the minified version) Is there any simple [I can't stress this enough] way to do this either by vanilla JavaScript or some other minimal library [I'm generally looking for something Edit Thanks to everyone, I just realized, that although some of the things I need to could be done via smart html+js, the rules of showing/hiding the right divs are so complicated, that it's worth of 30kB of including jQuery (even more if it's already cached from CDN), so I'll stick with jQuery. Cheers to everyone :) Edit JS+CSS3 transition follow-up, it works :) http://jsfiddle.net/ygZM7/23/ JS: var $setter = document.getElementById('setter'); $setter.onclick = function(){ var el = document.getElementById('div1'), h = el.clientHeight; el.style.height = (h==200?100:200)+'px'; } The only thing is: if height was previously not set (dynamic), first time you set it, the background flicks (goes from 0px height).
