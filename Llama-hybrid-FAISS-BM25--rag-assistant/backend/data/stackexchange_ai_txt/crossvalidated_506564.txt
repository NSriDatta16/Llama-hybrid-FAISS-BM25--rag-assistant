Goodness of fit for a multi-level model

I'm currently trying to figure out how to properly express a 'goodness of fit' criteria for a Bayesian model that has several steps. I have a 2 dimension dataset of position values (x and y) and parameter values at those positions. I first fit a radial profile with just a straight line (emcee), and then the azimuthal variation with a Gaussian Process Regression (scikit-learn). I can calculate the BIC for the straight line fit, and pull the marginal log-likelihood out of the GPR, but it's unclear to me how I can combine them for an overall goodness of fit. Any suggestions here would be much appreciated! Alternatively, if someone can point towards scikit-learn to include this 1-dimension radial term in the fit, that may also solve my problems, but I don't think this is possible. Thanks in advance!
