As you recognise, grade is ordinal and not interval. It follows that variance is not well defined and tests of normality do not really apply. For example, the grading of "withdrawal" as $-1$, and indeed any other grading, is arbitrary other than respecting the order and such results are highly sensitive to the particular grading you use. Indeed, it's a widespread view that normality tests don't make much sense when applied to a 6-level ordinal variable. Chi-square tests could be applied here, although in turn they won't pay any attention to the ordinal nature of the variable. The problem of small frequencies is real, but it is not so much an assumption as a condition that stretches the test somewhat; in any case a Fisher exact test is an alternative if that is a major concern. I don't see any defensible alternative to tests that respect, or are consistent with, the ordinal nature of your response, and ordinal logit certainly seems a candidate. The possibility that your smaller group is too small to say much reliably about any differences is with you whatever you do. There are many, many threads here on what to do with such data. Likert scale is a search term as well as ordinal scale.
