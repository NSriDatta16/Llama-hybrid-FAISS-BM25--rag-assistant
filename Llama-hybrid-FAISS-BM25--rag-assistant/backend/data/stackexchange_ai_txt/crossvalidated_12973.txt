For the rudiments of statistics: http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1091350 and http://www.robertniles.com/stats/ For a good guide to data visualisation: http://www.perceptualedge.com/ - in particular, try the Graph Design IQ test at http://www.perceptualedge.com/files/GraphDesignIQ.html (requires Flash) NB these are orthogonal - there are lots of statistics experts who are terrible at data visualisation, and vice versa.
