You can put these things in the classpath if your build tool doesn't get confused. Eclipse won't try to compile your jpegs and neither will Ant, so there isn't much to worry about. The nice thing is that if you have lots of related things you can keep them together, organized by functionality as opposed to by file type. We do this where I work; we have email messages which require a bit of code and a handful of static resources. All of these things are kept together in one folder in the java source path; we can add and remove an email from the system easily, without forgetting things or making mistakes like src/resource paths mismatched or orphan files in one tree not present in another tree.
