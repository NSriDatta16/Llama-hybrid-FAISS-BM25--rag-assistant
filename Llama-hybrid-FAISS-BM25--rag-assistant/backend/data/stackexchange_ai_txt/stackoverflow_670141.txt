The problem you're running into is that Canvas, unlike many WPF panels and containers, does not size to contents. That means if you add an element which goes outside the canvas boundaries it will not update it's size. Hence embedding a Canvas in a ScrollViewer will do no good unless you manually update the size of the Canvas. It sounds like what you want is a Canvas which supports size to contents. This blog entry has exactly that control. http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2008/11/auto-sizing-canvas-for-silverlight-and.html
