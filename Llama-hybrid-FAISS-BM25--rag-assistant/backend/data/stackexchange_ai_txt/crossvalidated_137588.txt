I agree these questions are strange (and, arguably, unsound to use as test items). But perhaps they can be answered if we adopt some reasonable assumptions. First, what does "matters more" mean? There are several ways this can be understood, even when variables are not commensurable (and we can hardly conceive of how a change in gender could be equated with some number of years of education!). We could look at the standardized coefficients, which express how much the fit varies (on a standardized scale of income) when an independent variable is changed by one unit (on a standardized scale). For binary explanatory variables, which are naturally quantized regardless of how they are coded, we could compare the effects on income of switching their values. (Please note that neither understanding of "matters" is intended in a causal sense: they only address the degree of association as estimated with this linear fit, accounting for these particular variables.) The latter sense does not enable us to draw any conclusions about question (1), since education is not binary, but it immediately implies that gender "matters more" than marital status, because a change in gender makes $1.5$ times the difference in predicted income of a change in marital status, ceteris paribus. The first sense of "matters" is more problematic, because we aren't given the information needed to estimate the standardized coefficients. If we assume the study is a typical large Western adult population, though, then Years of education will vary from less than 12 to more than 16, most likely with a standard deviation of several years. (However, if the study focused on one particular kind of job where almost all workers have comparable educations, then the SD of years of education could be well below $1$.) There will be approximately equal numbers of each gender. Their standard deviation therefore will be quite close to $1/2$. (In some cases--such as a study of a male-dominated field--it nevertheless is possible for this standard deviation to be much lower.) There might be approximately equal numbers of married and unmarried people--or maybe not. If not, then the standard deviation might be a little less than $1/2$--or even a lot less if one status is relatively rare in the sample. I have listed these from the likely largest standard deviation to smallest. The larger the SD is, the larger the standardized coefficient will be (since it is proportional to the SD of the explanatory variable). Under these assumptions we would have a basis to conclude that years of education matter the most (by far) and that gender still matters more than marital status. If we worry about imbalances in gender and marital status, then we can no longer conclude anything about which "matters" more, but it remains the case that education matters more than either provided there is a sufficient range exhibited within the data. Consequently, we have developed reasonable arguments why the answer to (a) is "yes" (education matters more than marital status) but that the answer to (b) is either "yes" or "maybe" (gender matters more than marital status). Most importantly, we have also uncovered possible situations where these answers could be completely reversed. What our analysis really has accomplished is to characterize the situations where the reversals could happen. In comments, @Buckminster brings up the point that even though each estimated coefficient is significant, perhaps we should not be quick to assume that one of the true coefficients is greater than another. How reliable is that assumption? When an estimate $b$ of a coefficient $\beta$ is "significant," that means a two-sided test of the hypothesis $\beta=0$ is rejected. We are told the significance level is at least $99\%$. This implies the standard error of $b$ is less than $b / Z_{1-\alpha/2}$ for $\alpha = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$ and, usually, $Z$ is a quantile of the standard Normal distribution. Consequently, if two estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$ are uncorrelated (or negatively correlated), the standard error of their difference cannot exceed $$ \sqrt{\left(\frac{b_0}{Z_{1-\alpha/2}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b_1}{Z_{1-\alpha/2}}\right)^2}.$$ In the case $b_1 = 1.5 b_0$ this gives an upper bound of $0.7 b_0$, implying $b_1-b_0$ is $0.5/0.7 = 0.72$ standard errors away from $0$. We are concerned only whether $\beta_1 \le \beta_0$: this is a one-sided test with p-value $1 - \Phi(0.72) = 0.24$. Although that's not terribly low, it is some evidence that we can act as if it truly is the case that $\beta_1 \gt \beta_0$. But because the evidence is weak, @Buckminster is well justified in calling this issue to our attention.
