A stream is an abstraction that provides a standard set of methods and properties for interacting with data. By abstracting away from the actual storage medium, your code can be written without total reliance on what that medium is or even the implementation of that medium. An good analogy might be to consider a bag. You don't care what a bag is made of or what it does when you put your stuff in it, as long as the bag performs the job of being a bag and you can get your stuff back out. A stream defines for storage media what the concept of bag defines for different instances of a bag (such as trash bag, handbag, rucksack, etc.) - the rules of interaction.
