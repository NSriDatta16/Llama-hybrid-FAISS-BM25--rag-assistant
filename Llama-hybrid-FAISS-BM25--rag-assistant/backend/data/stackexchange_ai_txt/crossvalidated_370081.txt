Welcome to the site. Of course, there are lots of ways to transform z scores into positive values: You could take absolute value, you could square them, you could add 20 to all values, you could rank them and probably some other methods. Which method should you use? In one comment (which should be added to your question), you say: The first reason is that it values higher students that are equally good on both metrics and not students with extremes scores. The second one is that I need to compute historical analysis also and it allows to rank higher students with regular good performance You could certainly rank them. You would then no longer need the geometric average. But, since ranks are ordinal, you might want the median rather than the mean. That is, by ranking, you have lost some information. For the first problem, adding a large constant could work, but I'm not at all sure geometric mean is what you want. The geometric mean is most useful when different items have different ranges - for instance, if you were trying to take the mean of GPA (range 0 to 4) and SAT scores (range 0 to 1600). z scores already do that. If you want to value "regular good performance" then you probably need at least two numbers.
