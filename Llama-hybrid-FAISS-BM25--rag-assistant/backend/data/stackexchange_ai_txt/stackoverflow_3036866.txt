In mod_rewrite and PHP the variable REQUEST_URI refers to two different part of the URI . In mod_rewrite, %{REQUEST_URI} contains the current URI path ; in PHP, $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] contains the URI path and query . But in both cases the URI fragment as this part of the URI is not transmitted to the server but only used by the client. So, when /one/two/three?foo#bar is requested, mod_rewrite’s %{REQUEST_URI} contains /one/two/three and PHP’s $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] contains /one/two/three?foo .
