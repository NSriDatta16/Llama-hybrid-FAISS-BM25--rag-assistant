Natural Sort in MySQL

Is there an elegant way to have performant, natural sorting in a MySQL database? For example if I have this data set: Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 4 Final Fantasy 10 Final Fantasy 12 Final Fantasy 12: Chains of Promathia Final Fantasy Adventure Final Fantasy Origins Final Fantasy Tactics Any other elegant solution than to split up the games' names into their components Title : "Final Fantasy" Number : "12" Subtitle : "Chains of Promathia" to make sure that they come out in the right order? (10 after 4, not before 2). Doing so is a pain in the a** because every now and then there's another game that breaks that mechanism of parsing the game title (e.g. "Warhammer 40,000", "James Bond 007")
