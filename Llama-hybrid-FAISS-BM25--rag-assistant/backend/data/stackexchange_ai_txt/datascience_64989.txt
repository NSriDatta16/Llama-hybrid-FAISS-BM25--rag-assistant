How to perform Permutation Feature importance?

I am trying to perform feature selection. Currently with Tree based classifiers, even randomly generated column is ranking above some of my real columns. So I was reading about PFI . Can someone help me understand the steps to be followed? 1) Have my data in csv file 2) Fill in missing values/clean/prepare data 3) Split the data into train and test 4) Standardize train and test data 5) Select a model (let's say logistic regression) 6) Fit train data to logreg model 7) Predict using input test data I have given the code below for my model logreg=LogisticRegression() # step 5 logreg_cv.fit(X_train_std,y_train) # step 6 y_pred = logreg_cv.predict(X_test_std) # step 7 Would really be helpful if you could kind of explain in a way a noob can understand. I am new to ML, so it would really be helpful Where does PFI fit in here? I see that we have eli5 package but couldn't find an example yet. update - my code after suggested solution logreg=LogisticRegression() pi=PermutationImportance(logreg, cv=2).fit(X_train_std,y_train) # error is in this line. rfe=RFECV(pi, step=1, n_jobs=-1, cv=5, scoring="auc").fit(X_train_std,y) y_pred = rfe.predict(X_test_std)
