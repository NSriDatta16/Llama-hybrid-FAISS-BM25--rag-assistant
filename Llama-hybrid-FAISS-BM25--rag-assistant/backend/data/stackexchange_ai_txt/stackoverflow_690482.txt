One suggestion I would offer is to use if statements instead of a switch in this case: if(lastKey == SDLK_RETURN) lastResult = ENTERED; else if(lastKey == SDLK_ESCAPE) lastResult = ESCAPED; else if(lastKey >= SDLK_SPACE && lastKey (lastKey); lastResult = NOTHING; } I took some liberties and included some characters that you didn't have in your code above, such as the ampersand, quotes, parentheses, brackets, etc. If you don't want those keys, you can add a few more if statements to break it down a bit more. This assumes that the enum for the keys doesn't change a lot. If it does change a lot you may be better off with what you had.
