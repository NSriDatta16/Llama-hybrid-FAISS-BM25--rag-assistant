normalizing before feature extraction for SVM and C 4.5

I'm experimenting with normalization and feature extraction based on Mutual Information before classification for SVM and C4.5. So far I have come to the following conclusions: Feature extraction significantly improves C4.5 performance but not SVM performance on real world (finance) data and test data. Normalization is needed much more for SVM and practically not needed for C4.5 So as a conclusion C4.5 needs feature extraction and SVM normalization. Are those conclusions correct?
