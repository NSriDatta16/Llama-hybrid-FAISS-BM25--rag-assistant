What UI framework do you use? In case it is Swing, you could wrap your download code into SwingWorker and update progress bar on buffer writes. You could also store written byte count in local variable and utilize Timer, however it seems less elegant (but working). If my assumption about Swing is correct, wikipedia has good SwingWorker example to help start you with.
