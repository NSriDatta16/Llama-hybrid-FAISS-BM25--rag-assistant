More important than buffer size is number of allocated objects, and total memory allocated. Is memory usage an issue at all? If it is a small app may not be worth worrying about. The real advantage from pooling is to avoid memory fragmentation. The overhead for allocating/freeing memory is small, but the disadvantage is that if you repeatedly allocated many objects of many different sizes memory becomes more fragmented. Using a pool prevents fragmentation.
