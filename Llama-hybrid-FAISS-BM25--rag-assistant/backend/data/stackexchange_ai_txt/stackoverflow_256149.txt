The key questiopn may be: how do you need to access them later? If you need to associate each point with a timestamp and location ID, and later need to retrieve individual measurements based on time/time range and location from multiple clients, an database may indeed be the most efficient at retrieval . OTOH, if your client will load and process the data of a whole day of one location, storing the data in one file per location and day reduces dependencies and may be easier. Other concerns is backups and archival, and if your users can/should deal with that themselves.
