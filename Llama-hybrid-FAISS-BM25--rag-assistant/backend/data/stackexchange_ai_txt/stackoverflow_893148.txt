I think that executing files on a shared/widely accessible drive is probably not the best idea. How many people are we talking about? Since you only have 7-8 people in your group, maybe the best solution here is to simply make the setup executable available on your shared drive, that way your users can have access to the newest version of your tool whenever they like and can install it on their machine at their leisure. sure there are more elegant solutions here, but they may take too much hassle to implement for such a small group, especially if you are not getting paid to distribute this tool to your peers. Sometimes the simplest approach is best, and I don't usually condone manual efforts, but in this case it may work best for you. Good luck, -Robert
