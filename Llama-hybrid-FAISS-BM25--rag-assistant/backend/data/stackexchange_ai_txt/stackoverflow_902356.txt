Check out this basic ASP.Net Menu control page . You can click on the "Run" buttons to see very basic versions of the menus. The advantage of using this particular approach is that you can tie it to a sitemap, so you don't have to keep updating the menu code. You just add the page(s) to the sitemap, and the menu picks it up. You can also dynamically link the menu to different sitemaps, such as one for the admin menu and another for regular users' menu. The Menu control is in the navigation section of the toolbox. To experiment with the built-in functionality (before writing your own code to do what it will do for you), just drag and drop a menu control onto your form. Then, use the common tasks menu to: autoformat -- good for quick & dirty because it sets hoverstyle too set the data source set the view type (static or dynamic) define menu items with an editor work with templates to set appearance You have to go to properties to set menu appearance.
