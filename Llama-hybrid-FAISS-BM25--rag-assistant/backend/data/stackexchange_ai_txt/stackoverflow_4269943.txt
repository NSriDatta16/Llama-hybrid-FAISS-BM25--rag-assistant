A cookie-based solution does seem a logical fit since you can programmatically modify them from JavaScript and you can set their expiry. Calculating the date in pure JavaScript can be done as such: var millisPerYear = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365; var birthdate = new Date(year, month, day); // from user input. var age = ((new Date().getTime()) - birthdate.getTime()) / millisPerYear; // Now set the "age" cookie. All that is left is for your server-side response handlers to return content conditionally based on the value of the "age" cookie from the request agent.
