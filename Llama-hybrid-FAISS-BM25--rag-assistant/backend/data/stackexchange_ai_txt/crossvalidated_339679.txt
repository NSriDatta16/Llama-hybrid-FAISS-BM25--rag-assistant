How XGBoost choose where to add splits?

I have been reading about the XGBoost algorithm here: http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model.html and here: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/gradient-boosting-decision-trees-xgboost-cuda/ I am still not sure how the algorithm decides where to add new splits at each iteration of boosting. I know that it builds up the forest additively, but does it consider splitting at every single possible leaf in the existing trees for the available features, as well as the possibility of adding a new tree? Or does it do something else?
