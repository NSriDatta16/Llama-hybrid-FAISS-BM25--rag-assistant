SSRS Report rotation

I have tried to search for solutions but found nothing, could be because there is a lot of issues with rotation of different report elements (text, images etc.), but this is not what I look for and I don't know how to re-phrase it better. What I need to do is to switch between 2 reports back and forth, in i.e. 60 second intervals. I'm not sure if this can be done, I would assume there is no custom properity which could point AutoRefresh to different report, but if it was possible to run action based on time past since &ExecutionTime it could be made. At the moment I am considering a very dirty alternative of running the report in IFRAME with something like but I'm almost sure there is a more elegant way to solve it. EDIT: I found one similar thread on MSDN SSRS forum and it was suggested to use one report with subreports with visibility parameter depending on minute, i.e. visibility =iif(Minute(now()) MOD 2 = 1 , True, False) and the oposite for the other subreport, but I'm still looking for a prettier solution.
