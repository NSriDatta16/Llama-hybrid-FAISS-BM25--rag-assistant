How can a Mann-Whitney U-Test return a p = 1.00 for unequal means? Because it's not a test for means. I'm wanting to compare scores derived from a reaction time task between two groups with unequal sizes (G1 = 78; G2 = 23). However, when I run the U test it tells me there is no significant difference, U = 897.00, z = .000, P = 1.00. How am I getting significance of 1.00 when there is at least some difference between the means (.21 vs .20)? Because it doesn't compare means! (Nor does it compare medians, in spite of many books saying otherwise) Even though the difference in means is slightly different from 0, the thing that the Mann-Whitney looks at* turned out to be 0. * whether conceived in terms of average rank or as two-sample Hodges-Lehmann difference. (See this answer , for example) I was expecting no difference, but these stats are different from what I got from t-testing. If they were always the same, you wouldn't need two different tests. I am running the U-test to account for unequal group sizes and non-normal data on several different variables, but is a z-statistic of .000 and P value of 1.00 accurate to report? I'm not sure what you mean by "accurate" but I'd just report those figures; they're certainly possible.
