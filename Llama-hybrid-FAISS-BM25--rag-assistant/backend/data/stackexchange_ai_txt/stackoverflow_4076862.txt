Organize class in CSS file

During development a lot of times I need to apply just a small enhancement to an html tag. For example : a red border ,or a float left. The best practice dictate to keep all the code in one/several css files,avoid inline styling and keep ids to a minimum. So how do I keep organize the css file with so many small groups of properties and how do I remember if I have one already or not. Should I just build a lot of small css classes ? How does this concept apply in a team ?
