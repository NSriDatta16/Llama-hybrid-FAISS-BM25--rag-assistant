It is the shell discarding those characters. Pass arguments properly (which includes quoting any which contain spaces, and escaping any quotes inside) and that won't be a problem: ./my_script.pl "2MT5 4XAW KEAR TTRR YYMM \"TEMP 2012 FEB 01\"" "Single" "123.x" Then you don't need to mess around with splitting and joining. You'll have the arguments properly organised in the first place.
