For Eclipse, that would be .classpath and .project files. My team uses Maven, and developers are discouraged from checking in Eclipse-specific files. Because they can be generated from Maven, these files are redundant. Also, checking project-specific files seems like it would save time, but it usually winds up being a pain because of variations in different developers' workstations, resulting in wasted time resolving conflicts in the IDE-specific files. The only way to get around that is to force everyone to set up their environment the same way, which goes against the IDE-agnostic approach.
