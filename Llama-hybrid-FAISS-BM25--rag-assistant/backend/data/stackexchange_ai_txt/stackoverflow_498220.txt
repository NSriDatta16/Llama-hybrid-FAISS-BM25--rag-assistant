If you're writing the class that has reference to files/images, it's your responsibility to provide a mechanism for these to be released. For all .NET applications (not just WinForms), implementing IDisposable on any type that hold references to large file/memory resources is always a good start. If you are making use of framework types that access resources, then as others have said, the using blocks are an elegant solution. It is also possible to force the garbage collector to dispose of types at the time you request it to do so (deterministic), however it is strongly recommended you do not do this, and instead allow the garbage collector to decide for itself for both improved performance and memory managment. Finally, because actually calling Dispose (directly or via using) is done by the user of your types, clearly documenting this (XML comments etc) is essential. See this earlier SO question for much more detail
