You can send a single request which the server can reply to immediately, like a heartbeat. Do this many times and you can get an average delay and standard deviation for jitter (or you can calculate jitter another way from the same data) There is no easy way to determine or estimate packet loss with TCP, but with UDP can you can. However, I would leave monitoring packet loss to the network administrators who should have tools to detect this. If they don't have it, why is it important to you?
