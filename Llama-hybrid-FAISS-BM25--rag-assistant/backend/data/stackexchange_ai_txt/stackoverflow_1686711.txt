What are some interesting, free, open-source Dynamic Analysis tools for Java?

I am looking for some interesting dynamic analysers to use and report on for a university assignment. The tools should be: Open-source (so I can learn from them) Free (both as in speech and beer, because I want to be able to share the results, and I'm tight-fisted, respectively) Intended for Java (source or bytecode) This includes, but is not limited to, performance profilers. They can perform any kind of analysis, as long as it's dynamic, for example, code coverage, multi-threaded correctness. The results generated should be useful in some way, but they do not have to be industrial strength .
