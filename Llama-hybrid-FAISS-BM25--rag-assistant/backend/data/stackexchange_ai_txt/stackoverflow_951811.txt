Does this help you: window.onerror = function() { alert("Error caught"); }; xxx(); I'm not sure how it handles Flash errors though... Update: it doesn't work in Opera, but I'm hacking Dragonfly right now to see what it gets. Suggestion about hacking Dragonfly came from this question: Mimic Window. onerror in Opera using javascript
