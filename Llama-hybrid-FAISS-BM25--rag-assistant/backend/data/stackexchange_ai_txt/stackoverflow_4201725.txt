The commercial JIDE Grids has a DualList (scroll to page bottom for a screenshot). Generally it's not easy to create a really solid Swing widget. You don't have to use custom UI for DualList, but it still takes a lot of work to get the MVC and UI (under all current LAFs) all working well. Currently JIDE DualList doesn't support drag-n-drop between the lists, but they promised to add it soon (you can search their forum for DualList if you're a paying customer).
