Jquery Draggable - How do I create a new draggable div on the fly that can then be dragged?

I'm creating a day planner using jquery, draggable and droppable. When a job is dragged from the unassigned column into a hour time slot, the original draggable item is removed, and a new div is placed into page, with the job details. This newly created div block of code, has all the parameters in it to make it draggable . When it's rendered on the page load, these assigned jobs are draggable . It's only when they are created on the fly using javascript is something occurring that stops them from being dragged about. When I create these new div tags on the fly with Javascript, is there something I need to do to tell the jquery that these new items are meant to be dragged? (thanks in advance as always) Steps We have a div container with a list of jobs (more divs) inside it. #unassignedjobs is the parent div for these jobs, with the following jobs inside, #jobN ,#jobN2, #jobN3 We have another area which we can drop these items into, and inside this area is a container for displaying jobs, per person, lets call these #person1 and #person2. The aim is to drag a job from the unassigned jobs list, and place it into the persons lists of jobs At the minute when I do this, I refresh all of the html inside of #person1 when an item is dropped and using ajax/php to remake the list of jobs for this person (#person1) and repopulate #person1 using innerHTML . Every time a page is created from php any jobs inside #person1 are present when jquery is activated, making them draggable. It's only when the refresh and re-population of the innerHTML is ran are the items (#jobN or #jobN2) unable to be dragged var createdContent = httpRequest.responseText; jobcolp.innerHTML = createdContent; Hopefully this makes the problem a little more clearer.
