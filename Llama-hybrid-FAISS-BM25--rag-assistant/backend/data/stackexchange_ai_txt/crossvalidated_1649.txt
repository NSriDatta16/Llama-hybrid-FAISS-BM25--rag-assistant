Using mixed effects modelling to estimate and compare variability

Say I observe two groups of 10 people, measuring some quantity 100 times in each person. There will presumably be some variability across these 100 measures in each person. Can I use mixed effects analysis to assess whether this within-person variability is, on average, different between the two groups? For example, using traditional statistics, I could compute the standard deviation (SD) within each person then submit these SDs to an anova comparing the groups, but I wonder if this two-stage process can be replaced by a single mixed effects model, consequently obtaining the various advantages of mixed effects modelling (shrinkage, accounting for different numbers of observations per person, etc) as well. To be clear, here is R code depicting the scenario described above and the SD/anova-based approach: set.seed(1) group_A_base_sd = 1 group_B_base_sd = 2 within_group_sd_of_sds = .1 n_per_group = 10 obs_per_id = 100 temp = data.frame( id = 1:(n_per_group*2) , group = rep(c('A','B')) ) #generate example data library(plyr) #to avoid loops (for coding convenience only) obs_data = ddply( .data = temp , .variables = .(id,group) , .fun = function(x){ #generate a unique sd for this individual # based on their group's sd plus some # within-group variability id_sd = ifelse( x$group=='A' , rnorm( 1 , group_A_base_sd , within_group_sd_of_sds ) , rnorm( 1 , group_B_base_sd , within_group_sd_of_sds ) ) #generate data points with the above generated # variability to_return = data.frame( obs_num = 1:obs_per_id , measurement = rnorm(obs_per_id,0,id_sd) ) return(to_return) } ) #first step of an anova-based approach: # compute SDs within each Ss obs_sds = ddply( .data = obs_data , .variables = .(id,group) , .fun = function(x){ to_return = data.frame( obs_sd = sd(x$measurement) ) } ) #second step of an anova-based approach: # compute the anova on the SDs summary( aov( formula = obs_sd~group , data = obs_sds ) )
