How can I give a component more than one DropTargetListener?

I just learned (the hard way) that Java Component s can only have one DropTarget . No sweat, I said, I'll just add another DropTargetListener to that DropTarget --only to discover that DropTarget s can only have one DropTargetListener ! I have two DropTargetListener s that listen for very different events (one handles things being dragged and dropped within the component, the other handles things from outside the component). Must I combine them into one giant DropTargetListener , or is there an elegant way to keep them separate?
