The third and last edition of the Cascading Style Sheets, css , styling language (often shortened to CSS3 ) brings together powerful visual capabilities and versatile design manipulation techniques. CSS3 is the last "edition" of the CSS standard , at which point individual modules will level up independently. This modularization implies that there cannot be a generic or collective "CSS4", as work may begin on level 4 modules while level 3 and brand new level 1 modules are still in draft. Although CSS3 is still under development, many features are supported by major browsers, and since most CSS2 properties and techniques are still present in CSS3, questions regarding previous levels (CSS2.1, CSS1) are still appropriate and encouraged. Browser support for css3 Because not all browsers correctly parse CSS code, developed coding techniques known as CSS hacks can either filter specific browsers or target specific browsers (generally both are known as CSS filters). The former can be defined as CSS filtering hacks and the latter can be defined as CSS targeting hacks. Both can be used to hide or show parts of the CSS to different browsers. This is achieved either by exploiting CSS-handling quirks or bugs in the browser, or by taking advantage of lack of support for parts of the CSS specifications.
