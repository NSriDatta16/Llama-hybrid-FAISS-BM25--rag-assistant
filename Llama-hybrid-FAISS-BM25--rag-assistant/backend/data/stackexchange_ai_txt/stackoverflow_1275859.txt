I've learned a lot from the Alt.Net mailing list, and my own local user group mailing list. One note on the local mailing list: not only is it an excellent way to learn new ideas, and keep up with what is going on, it is a great way to find local experts. People you can have over for a beer (or lesser beverage of choice) to discuss problems. For more involved issues, that is often the best way to solve them. I find that you are much more likely to find actual mentorship in these mailing lists as well -- and less RTFM (you don't get that as much when people can find out where you live).
