How to go from sparse matrix to linear regression model (using SVD)?

I am trying to replicate the Kosinski, Stillwell, & Graepel (2013) study about predicting private traits and attributes from Facebook like data for study purposes. First I have admit, however, that I am quite a newbie to data science and building prediction models in R. My Data: A sparse matrix (dim 237 x 43232) that contains 237 users and if they liked one of the 43232 fb-pages or not (indicated by 1 for liked and 0 for not-liked). The row-names contain user.ids. A data.frame with columns containing the user.ids, age, gender, and several survey scores, for this example lets take the SOP2 score (optimism-pessimism score). My goal is to predict the SOP2 score with the user likes. Kosinski et al. describe their model building in this graphic . So far I have done a SVD using the irlab R package: Comps.likes And this is where I am stuck .. how to go on from here? From what I assume I should get to something like this: fit or an equivalent using the caret package. What I am trying to figure out: The step missing is how to get from the Comps.likes (SVD step) to the regression formula with a coefficient for each Facebook like to predict SOP2. The step to actually predict SOP2 from a user vector with the likes per user.id. Any help or hints to further resources?
