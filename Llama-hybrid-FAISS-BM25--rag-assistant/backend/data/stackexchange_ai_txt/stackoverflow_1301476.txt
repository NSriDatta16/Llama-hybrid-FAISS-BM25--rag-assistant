Do you really need to fetch the phones themselves, or are you simply looking for the average value? If you have a :has_many set up between users and phones, you can do the following. user.phones.average(:call_count) (Obviously, you need to replace your real field names in there.) That will generate a query similar to this: SELECT avg(`phones`.call_count) AS avg_call_count FROM `phones` WHERE (`phones`.user_id = 1)
