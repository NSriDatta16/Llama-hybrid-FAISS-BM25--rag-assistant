Is it possible to make a CS:GO Machine Learning AI?

I am not an expert on Machine Learning, Neural Networks or NEAT. In fact, I probably have no clue what I'm talking about. My question is if you can make a learning AI that learns to play complex multiplayer games and possibly outpreform humans. If it is possible, could you also recommend a language or languages to make this AI in? (I know I'll probably have to take a VACation for botting, but it's something I feel like we should try.)
