Patterns to mix F# and C# in the same solution

I studied few functional languages, mostly for academical purposes. Nevertheless, when I have to project a client-server application I always start adopting a Domain Driven Design, strictly OOP. A complex solution written in a .Net framework could get advantages using more than a language and sometimes more than a paradigm. Mixing C or C++ with LUA or Python is a common practice, sometimes embedding prolog can be very interesting. I never tried to mix OOP and functional paradigm. F# is a newer functional and object oriented language, I see that's it's technically very easy to mix C# with F# libraries in the same solution. But I wonder if it makes any sense: I use LINQ to satisfy many of my functional requirements. When and how, do you think it's a good idea to mix these two languages together? I wonder if exists a set of patterns that tries that. Do you actually use F# in a C# solution?
