No suitable ARIMA model found error

I am trying to forecast the sales for next 48 days from the data given by modelling for multiple seasonality and day of week , promotional effects. R could not come up with a suitable model. I need help to figure out what I am doing wrong. Given data has daily sales information of a store for 2 years and 7 months along with other information like holidays, promotion, week of year etc as shown below. Sales is 0 when store is closed. I have replaced 0 sales with NA's as mentioned in this post https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/347074/208891 As it can be seen from the below 2 screenshots, sales are highest during mondays and when promotion=1. sales hit the bottom on sundays when promo=0 I found that, the series shows both weekly and yearly seasonality using the results of tbats: yearly So, I created a multi seasonality time series store_578_ts The resulting plot: I built a dynamic harmonic regression model with fourier terms for multiple seasonality. To model the day of week effects that I mentioned above, I created 6 dummy variables (day1,day2..day6) and included them along with promotion and foruier terms dummy Am I missing something here? I really need some help with this. Note:It is able to get me a model if I use only weekly seasonality, instead of multiple.
