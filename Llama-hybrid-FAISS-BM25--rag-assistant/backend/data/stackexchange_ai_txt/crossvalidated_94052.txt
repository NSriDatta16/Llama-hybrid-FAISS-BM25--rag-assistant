How remove variations in a time series X caused by another time series Y?

I have a time series on a monthly basis (a commodity) of which much variation is caused by the weather. I want to adjust this commodity for weather changes. I use Heating degree day as a proxy for the weather conditions (If the average temperature of one day is below a threshold value, the absolute value of the difference is the heating degree for one day. This is summed up for all days in a month.) Important: I already adjusted for the series for seasonality. How should I proceed?
