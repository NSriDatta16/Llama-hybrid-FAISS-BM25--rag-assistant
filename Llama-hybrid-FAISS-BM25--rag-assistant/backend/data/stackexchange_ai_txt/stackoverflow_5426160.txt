Are you using a custom table view cell? The result of NSCell's hitTestForEvent:inRect:ofView: determines whether a dragging operation can be initiated. It also determines whether your outlineView:writeItems:toPasteboard: should be called. This method should return NSCellHitContentArea to initiate a drag, or NSCellHitTrackableArea to extend or change the selection. A standard text cell returns NSCellHitContentArea when you click on the actual text of the cell, and NSCellHitTrackableArea when you click outside of the text. This produces the drag behavior you see in Finder's table view. You can override this method and always return NSCellHitContentArea if you want all areas of the cell to initiate a drag operation. See Hit Testing for more information.
