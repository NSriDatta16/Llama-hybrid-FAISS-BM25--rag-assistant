With a binary target and categorical features, logistic regression can be viewed as a type of log-linear model or contingency table analysis. In chapter 10 of Wickens book, Multiway Contingency Tables Analysis for the Social Sciences , approaches to adjusting degrees of freedom and model results for the presence of structural zeros are discussed. Wickens main point is that "data tables with structural voids lack a complete factorial structure," a necessary requirement for logistic regression tests of independence, where "impossible cells assert themselves as dependencies," pps. 246-247. One option is to step back from considering time as continuous. Discretizing time would place the model design into the form of a contingency table. This permits one to ignore the missing cells and test for quasi-independence of the valid cells only. Wickens suggested solution is to employ an iterative proportional fitting algorithm to construct the maximum likelihood estimates which he goes through on a step-by-step basis -- much too involved for a response on this blog. In essence, in constructing the test statistic, the structural zero cells are ignored and degrees of freedom are adjusted or reduced for the missing cells, devising a new test statistic based only on valid cells. Apologies if this is too involved for a stats newbie but, in point of fact, your problem is not a big one and is quite readily answered. The only issue is that these methods go well beyond the full factorial chi-square tests of independence dealt with in stats 101 courses. There are many, many references and resources on log-linear models, contingency table analysis, and categorical data analysis. While Agresti's books are among the standard, stats "go-to" resources, I prefer Wickens for the greater clarity and lucidity of his writing. To be able to fully address, understand and answer your question, you need to drill into those references.
