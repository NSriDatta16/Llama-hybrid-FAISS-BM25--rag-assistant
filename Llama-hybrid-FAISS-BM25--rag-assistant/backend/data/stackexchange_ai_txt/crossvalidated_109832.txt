What is R squared for a neural network and what does it signify?

I calculated R square for my neural network based on a formula I found somewhere, which goes something like: $$ R^2=1-\left(\dfrac{ \overset{N}{\underset{j=1}{\sum}}\left( t_j-o_j \right)^2 }{ \overset{N}{\underset{j=1}{\sum}}\left( o_j \right)^2 }\right) $$ It should be something around 0.98-0.99. But, when I operate it on my network, it yields very low values, sometimes even negative. What can be the reason for this? What does R square signify?
