That's strange. I get super-crisp images in my pdf files. There are few differences between what I do and what you have. For example I create the image like this: Image instance = Image.GetInstance(System.Drawing.Image.FromFile(pathToImage), Color.WHITE); Furthermore, since my image is too big to fit I call: instance.ScalePercent(90f); Another difference is that I add the image directly to the Document and not to a Paragraph , although I doubt that that's it. Edit : And finally, my images are jpegs. Hope it helps.
