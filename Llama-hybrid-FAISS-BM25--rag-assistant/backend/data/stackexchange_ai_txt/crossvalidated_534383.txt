Time Series Structural Break and ADF Test

i have a time series variable which i checked it for stationarity using ADF test and arima proc in SAS proc arima data=&td19; identify var=interest_rate stationarity=(adf=4); run; quit; Below is the ADF test and trend & correlation analysis i started from the table from the bottom (trend model) and using the Tau compared it with 5% until to reject the null. i concluded that the series is stationary since 0.0315 However, when i see the ACF/PACF, based on my understanding, the series in not stationary. This is because the ACF decays slowly My questions are : is this series stationary or not?
