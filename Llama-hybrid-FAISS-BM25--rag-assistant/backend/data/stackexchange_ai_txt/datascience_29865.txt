A binary classification between business and non-business is very simple: Extract plain content from the news, for example using dragnet . Tokenize each text and represent them with vectors with the bag of words technique. A simple way to perform this is using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn. Clusterize them using some classification technique like k-NN (k nearest neighbors). You will find the k-NN sklearn implementation very helpfull. To perform a multilabel classification like companies related news , you have to use TfidfVectorizer which weights more the rare words that appear only in few news, like Apple or Coca-Cola .
