Can I squareroot r2 to get r in a logistic regression?

I am conducting a meta-analysis and I am extracting pearson's correlation coefficient (r) from studies in order to meta-analyse them. Some studies have not used correlations so I am having to calculate r from the statistics they report. One study has reported a logistic regression, is it meaningful to squareroot r2 to get r, or should I convert the odds ratio to cohen's d and then cohen's d to pearson's r?
