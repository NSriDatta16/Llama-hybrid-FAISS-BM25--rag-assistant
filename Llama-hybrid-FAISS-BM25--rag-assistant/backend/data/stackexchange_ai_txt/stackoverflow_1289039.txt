Did you re-initialize your webserver on changing "allow_url_fopen"? OR The user agent "PHP" may be disallowed on the server you are querying. OR From the PHP Manual page: Note: If you're opening a URI with special characters, such as spaces, you need to encode the URI with urlencode(). You can do a test of the php.ini settings like this... if (ini_get('allow_url_fopen') == '1') { // use fopen() or file_get_contents() } else { // use curl or your custom function }
