Does streaming media in SharePoint pose a performance risk?

Can anyone comment on the performance implications of storing streaming media in a SharePoint 2007 document library? Iâ€™ve heard this can be detrimental to the performance of the farm due to the media being streamed from storage in a SQL DB. Has anyone had any firsthand experience with this and if so, what alternatives have you used to provide users with the ability to publish and mange their own video content? Assume a secure internal environment so external services like YouTube are not viable in this scenario.
