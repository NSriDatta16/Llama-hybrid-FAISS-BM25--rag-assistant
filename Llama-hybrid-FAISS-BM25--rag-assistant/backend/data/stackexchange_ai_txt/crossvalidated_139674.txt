"Our business growth is essentially slowing over the years --- but I'm not sure if a 0.0 beta trend is reasonable for a model --- a sudden up-shot would affect the level, but not the trend whatsoever." "Like say I have my ETS with a September forecast, plus this sales "add-on" value. Come July, we have a HUGE sales spike with expected clients, the ETS model adapts upward, now the 'add-on' for September is --- well the growth is being counted twice." To the above, I would respond using a quote from the book " Principles of Forecastin g" by Armstrong (which I highly recommend) - A trend is trend is a trend But the question is, will it bend? Will it alter its course Through some unforeseen force And come to a premature end - Cairncross(1969) Armstrong follows: Will the trend bend ? some statisticians believe that the data can reveal this. In my judgement, this can best be answered by domain knowledge. Experts often have good knowledge of the series and what causes it to vary. Trend forecasting is one of the hardest thing to accomplish in forecasting real world problems. I would take Armstrong's advice and use your expert judgment in forecasting trend instead of relying on extrapolation methods like ETS/dampened trend. If I interpret it correctly, you have following questions: What would be sales forecast when you get new clients ? what is "expected current client growth" and "Expected new client growth" ? This is not a statistical question, only market intelligence/field sales/primary market research can address this question. You are bound to get large forecast errors if you use your intuition. Use a well structured judgmental forecasting to forecast these type of problems. Once you have the above question answered - second question is how to incorporate this into time series model ? step 1 is to create a baseline model using statistical and/or judgmental methods. Extrapolation methodslike exponential smoothing can be one of the techniques. Once you have created a baseline model, you could use different scenarios from the above question and add-on to your baseline and communicate to decision makers the best and worst case scenarios using your judgement. Get organizational buy in in advance to reduce bias later on. This is called scenario forecasting . You basically add your judgmental probabilities/forecast to baseline model and communicate scenarios. The third problem is integrating this "expected current client growth" and "Expected new client growth" with the Triple Exponential Smoothing model .... isn't this model ALREADY boosting the level and trends based on sales growth? Like ... simply slapping the "expected growth" on top of the ETS model can be "double-counting" it. No, ETS just extrapolates past trend, seasonal and other patterns. ETSdoes NOT know what you are going to get incrementally with adding new clients. If you have evidence that ETS already captures new client sales then I would say ETS is providing you overly optimistic baseline forecasts and you should probably dampen it or use another method. You also have existing data an 30 clients, why don't you use them as your analogue and forecast sales of new clients. This is called forecasting by analogy . This takes the guess work out of your forecasts. Should I need to decompose the problem? Of course break down(decompose) complex problem and solve it at the lowest granular level and add them finally. Complexity is reduced when you break down the problem and solve it individually. Here is another nice article on forecasting by decomposition.
