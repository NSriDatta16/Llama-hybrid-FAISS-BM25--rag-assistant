clj-apache-http has a preemptive-basic-auth-filter that you can use. It supports combined username / password strings of this form "name:password". Use of the function is not well documented but can be found here . Example (not tested): (http/get (java.net.URI. url) :headers {"User-Agent" user-agent} :parameters (http/map->params {:default-proxy (http/http-host :host "localhost" :port 8888)}) :as :string :filters ((preemptive-basic-auth-filter "name:password")))
