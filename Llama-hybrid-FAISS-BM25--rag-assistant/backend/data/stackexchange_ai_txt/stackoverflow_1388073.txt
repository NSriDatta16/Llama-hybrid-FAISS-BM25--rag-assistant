Another free textbook is The C++ Annotations by Frank B. Brokken. You can browse it online, or you can download the pdf version . A quote from the first page: This document is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about, or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for Frank's C++ programming courses, which are yearly organized at the University of Groningen What I like about "The C++ Annotations" is that is being kept uptodate, version 8.0.0 has added C++0x chapters.
