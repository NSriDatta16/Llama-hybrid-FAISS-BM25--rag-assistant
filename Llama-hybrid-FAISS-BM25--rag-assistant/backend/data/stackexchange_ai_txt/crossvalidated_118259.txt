Paul Tol provides a colour scheme optimised for colour differences (i.e., categorical or qualitative data) and colour-blind vision on his website , and in detail in a "technote" (PDF file) linked to there. He states: To make graphics with your scientific results as clear as possible, it is handy to have a palette of colours that are: distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers; distinct from black and white; distinct on screen and paper; and still match well together. I took the colour scheme from his "Palette 1" of the 9 most distinct colours, and placed it in my matplotlibrc file under axes.color_cycle : axes.color_cycle : 332288, 88CCEE, 44AA99, 117733, 999933, DDCC77, CC6677, 882255, AA4499 Then, borrowing from Joe Kington's answer the default lines as plotted by: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl import numpy as np x = np.linspace(0, 20, 100) fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2) for i in range(1,10): axes[0].plot(x, i * (x - 10)**2) for i in range(1,10): axes[1].plot(x, i * np.cos(x)) plt.show() results in: For diverging colour maps (e.g., to represent scalar values), the best reference I have seen is the paper by Kenneth Moreland available here " Diverging Color Maps for Scientific Visualization ". He developed the cool-warm scheme to replace the rainbow scheme, and "presents an algorithm that allows users to easily generate their own customized color maps". Another useful source for information on the use of colour in scientific visualisations comes from Robert Simmon, the man who created the "Blue Marble" image for NASA. See his series of posts at the Earth Observatory web site.
