Are there faster algorithms than Dijkstra? Yes. The question isn't qualified so as to require better performance in all cases, or even in most cases. An algorithm with better performance in a single case is sufficient to establish an affirmative answer. Despite the generally larger number of iterations required by the Bellman-Ford method over Dijkstra’s method, in practice the Bellman-Ford method can be superior because of the smaller overhead per iteration [Golden, B., 1976. “Shortest-Path Algorithms: A Comparison,” Operations Research, Vol. 44, pp. 1164-1168]. The quote above is from Dimitri P. Bertsekas (March 1992). "A Simple and Fast Label Correcting Algorithm for Shortest Paths" (PDF). Networks, Vol. 23, pp. 703-709, 1993. http://www.mit.edu/people/dimitrib/SLF.pdf . Retrieved 2008-10-01. In short, my claim is based on Bertsekas' interpretation of Golden. Whether my conclusion stands up or not, you may find Bertsekas interesting for its classification of the Dijkstra algorithm as a label setting method, as contrasted with label correcting methods.
