You're finding this is difficult because your ThingFormat types are not URIs. They expose URIs and can correspond to URIs, but that does not make them URIs. Perhaps you're pining for implementation inheritance , but interface inheritance fails here because this is not a proper is-a relationship; it fails the LSP . Consider, for example, whether a ThingFormat has a scheme or a fragment component, or if one can be resolved against some base URI. Those are facets and operations of URIs that don't have much to do with ThingFormat , whatever it happens to do.
