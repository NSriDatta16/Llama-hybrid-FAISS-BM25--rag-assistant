How to estimate standard error of prediction error in Table 3.3 of Hastie el al (2017)?

On page 63 Table 3.3. of "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie el al. (2017) 12th print. It gives the summary results of different regression results on the cancer data. However I don't understand how the std err in the last line is calculated (esp. for the LS column). The authors on page 61 have the following explanations: "The last two lines of the table give the average prediction error (and its estimated standard error) over the test set." Still could anyone please help me understand how we get the std err in the last line especially the LS column? Thanks!
