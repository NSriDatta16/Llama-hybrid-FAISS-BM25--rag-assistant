I deduct there are only 3 factor levels for life-stage. It looks like "lifestage" uses "adult" as the referent level, meaning that the contrasts created by the GLM compare intermediate to adult and juvenile to adult. I think your concept of "intercept" is referent level. As you'll see, logistic regression has a very specific concept of an intercept. The statistical significance of the juvenile term means there is a difference in survival between adults and juveniles of the same species who receive the same treatment. This is the correct interpretation of effects in multivariate adjusted models with balanced design or simple random sampling. The intercept (the term (Intercept) in the output) is a log-odds of the outcome for an adult, not receiving treatment, and of the 4th unlisted species. Your odds ratio for the Life.StageJuvenile does not compare all juveniles to this group. I think your intuition of the effect is almost right, it simply is not the intercept, but the referent level (adult, unspecified species, unspecified treatment). To see an example of a different contrast, modify the formula by specifying. (cbind(Alive, Dead)) ~ 0 + Treatment + Life.Stage + Species, family = binomial(link = "logit") If you want a treatment specific and/or species specific comparison, you will need to fit stratified models or control for interaction terms. This is good practice for such statistical analyses as it verifies a hidden assumption of homogeneity of effects (that is that the stratum specific effects approximately match the overall adjusted effect).
