How do you turn a FileSet into a list of Files in a Mojo

I'm writing my first Maven Mojo, in it I'm wanting to take a file set and process all the files it refers to. In pseudo code what I'd like to do... void myCode(org.apache.maven.model.FileSet fileSet) { List files = FileSetTransformer.toFileList(fileSet); for (File f : files) { doSomething(f); } } So what I'm wanting is the real code for "FileSetTransformer.toFileList", it seems to me like a very common thing to want to do but I can't seem to find out how to do it.
