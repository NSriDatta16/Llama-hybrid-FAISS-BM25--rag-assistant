Can I convert a frequentist p-value into a Bayesian Posterior Probability No. Bayes theorem is $$P(H_0|\text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data}|H_0)}{P(\text{data})} \cdot P(H_0)$$ as mentioned in the comments, this $P(\text{data}|H_0)$ is not the same as a p-value. Related questions What is the information in an exact p-value? In some cases a p-value can be regarded as a sufficient statistic and, in a way, can be used for computations in inference like the computation of a posterior probability. Expressing one-sided p values of directional hypothesis tests as Bayes factors credible intervals and confidence intervals may potentially coincide. For such cases p-values can be used to express computations with credible intervals.
