How to specify Assembly attribute in a WiX Fragment generated using Heat.exe from the command line

I am using Heat.exe to harvest a directory containing my DLLs that need to go into the GAC. The fragment is correctly created and I can build my MSI. The problem I am having is that after the wxs source file is created I have to manually edit the file adding the File/@Assembly =".net" attribute. Is there a way to have heat include Assembly=".net" for each File when using heat.exe from the command line? Using WiX 3.0.
