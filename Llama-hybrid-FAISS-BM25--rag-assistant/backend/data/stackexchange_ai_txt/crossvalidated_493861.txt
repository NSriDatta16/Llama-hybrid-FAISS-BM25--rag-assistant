Market Mix Modeling using Random Forest

I am trying to build a random forest-based market mix model, wherein I want to calculate the contribution of each of my X variables towards the target. Typical MMM problem statement, but here am not sure about how to get this done using random forest In the past I have worked with a typical OLS approach where I can easily get the coefficient/elasticities. But what about the random forest?
