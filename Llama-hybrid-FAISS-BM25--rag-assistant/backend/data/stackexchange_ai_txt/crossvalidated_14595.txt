Are decision forests and random forests the same thing?

Based on an answer on Cross Validated I've been looking into implementing a random forest in .NET/C# to classify documents of text. Looking around the web to see if there are existing implementations, I came across an algorithm for a decision forest on Alglib . The thing is, I can't seem to find anything specific to "decision forest" anywhere (it's ambiguous even here ), it's typically mixed in with random forest. That said, are the two the same, just being referenced differently, or are there inherent differences between the two?
