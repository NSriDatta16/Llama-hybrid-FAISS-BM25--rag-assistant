Letting users manually sort items in a webapp

I would like to make a simple web app that displays 20 or so images to users and lets them manually sort the images from favorite to least favorite, either by dragging or by using some form of up/down controls, and then submit this ordering. Are there existing tools, either in Javascript or Silverlight, that make this easy? By the way, I'm thinking of using either Django or ASP.NET MVC.
