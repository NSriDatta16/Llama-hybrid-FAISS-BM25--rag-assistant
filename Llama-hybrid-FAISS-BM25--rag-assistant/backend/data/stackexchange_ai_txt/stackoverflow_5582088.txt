php proximity script - how to calculate the number of words/characters between 2 given terms/words?

Basically - I want to calculate the "Proximity" of various terms. By "proximity" I means Specifically the number of spaces/characters/words that sit between them. Example: Terms = Word1 / Word2 Chunk = " blah Word1 blah blah blah blah blah Word2 blah " Proximity = Word1-Word2:5 THe script would see the 2 terms, locate them and then see the distance based on the words that lay between them. A more advanced version would be to examine the semantic structure - and identify whether the terms occur within the same semantic element, or a sibling, or a parent etc. Thus proximity discovery of terms may be within the same paragraph, or in sequential paragraphs, or under the same "parent" (heading) but otherwise separate etc. Further - introducing things like word stemming/relationships/soundings at a later date may be useful too. . I've looked around the net (Google, here, php forums, php script sites). Not seeing anything like it. I can see tools on some sites that do similar (limited) - usually SEO based tools. I want to be able to apply this to "text" in general ... as I may apply it to uploaded word/txt files etc. I'm not seeing any real examples - so I can only assume it's mroe than a trifle to code it. The question is - how can I do this? How would I handle variant order of the words (Word1+Word2 / Word2+Word1)? How could I handle identifying proximity within/outside of the same element/structure? Hoping someone can shed some light/make some suggestions.
