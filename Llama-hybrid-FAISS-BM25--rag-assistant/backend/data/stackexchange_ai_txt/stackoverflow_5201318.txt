Here's my attempt: 1) what's the runtime environment of as? The Flash plugin loads swf's, swf's are binary / compiled actionscript 2) how about the run mechanism ? Download to browser and run - it can communicate externally with services just like JS - load, send, POST, etc 3) How about the as? The FLA is a shell in which you CAN write your actionscript. It's proprietary to Adobe's Flash IDE software. You can write and compile actionscript though in a variety of ways. Adobe's Flash Builder doesn't use an FLA, open-source FlashDevelop uses the open-source Flex SDK to compile it's actionscript. FDT is a similar tool, but not open-source (or free) that compiles actionscript. All of these either compile actionscript to a SWF, an Adobe AIR app, or can be cross-compiled to a variety of other platforms (like Android, iOS, etc). 4) Should the actionscript be complied? Not SHOULD, but HAS to be. You cannot run a raw .as file - it's just a text file with actionscript code in it. 5) how to get started with actionscript,I mean the dev environment. You can download FlashDevelop and Eclipse if you want a free method to start development. You can also download a 60-day trial of Flash CS5 or Flash Builder to see what their tools offer. 6) But how about the actionscript? Since from google I heard people said the flex sdk is needed,I am not sure about their realationship. Flex is similar to Flash in that they both use actionscript, yet Flex is aimed more at application development whereas Flash somewhat leans towards web-only stuff, which may or may not have animations as part of the end result. These lines are VERY fuzzy though, as you can create almost any type of actionscript project in either one. Flex has a slightly different approach to the language, in that you end up writing an MXML file, whereas Flash uses an FLA file which has library assets that you can use, a timeline for animations / organization, and a stage on which to display it all. 7) Also,Do I have to learn how to create the flash - xx.swf? what's the realationship between the actionscript and the flash file? Any populate tool? You write your code in actionscript, then your tool compiles the end result (a swf, an AIR app, etc). The Flash IDE is the most popular tool, as well as Flash Builder, FlashDevelop, FDT, etc.
