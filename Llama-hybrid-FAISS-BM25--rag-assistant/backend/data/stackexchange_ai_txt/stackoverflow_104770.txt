I can't drag anything int SWF you linked, just zoom via mouseWheel. You can make more than one movieClip dragging at once using events mousedown, mouseMove and mouseUp. Add event handler for events via Mouse.addListener(object). In mouseDown set some flag and remeber current mouse position. In mouseMove if the flag is set calculate move offset and just change .x and .y of all movieclips you want to drag. In mouseUp set the flag to false
