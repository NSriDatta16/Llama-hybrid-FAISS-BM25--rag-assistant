Logistic regression vs chi-square in a 2x2 and Ix2 (single factor - binary response) contingency tables?

I'm trying to understand the use of logistic regression in 2x2 and Ix2 contingency tables. For instance, using this as an example What is the difference between using chi-square test and using logistic regression? What about a table with multiple nominal factors (Ix2 table) like this: There is a similar question here - but the answer is mainly that chi-square can handle mxn tables, but my question is what is specificalyl for when there is a binary outcome and a single nominal factor. (The linked thread also refers to this thread , but this is regarding mutiple variables/factors). If it's just a single factor (i.e. no need to control for other variables) with a binary response, what is the purpose difference of doing logistic regression?
