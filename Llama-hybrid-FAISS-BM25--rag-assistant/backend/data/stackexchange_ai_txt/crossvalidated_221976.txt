As the other answers said, it is definitely subjective and dependent on what type of granularity you are trying to study. For a general approach, I cut this one to give me 2 clusters and 1 outlier. I would then focus on the two clusters to see if there was anything significant between them. # Init import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns; sns.set() # Load data from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes # Clustering from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, fcluster, leaves_list from scipy.spatial import distance from fastcluster import linkage # You can use SciPy one too %matplotlib inline # Dataset A_data = load_diabetes().data DF_diabetes = pd.DataFrame(A_data, columns = ["attr_%d" % j for j in range(A_data.shape[1])]) # Absolute value of correlation matrix, then subtract from 1 for disimilarity DF_dism = 1 - np.abs(DF_diabetes.corr()) # Compute average linkage A_dist = distance.squareform(DF_dism.as_matrix()) Z = linkage(A_dist,method="average") # Dendrogram D = dendrogram(Z=Z, labels=DF_dism.index, color_threshold=0.7, leaf_font_size=12, leaf_rotation=45)
