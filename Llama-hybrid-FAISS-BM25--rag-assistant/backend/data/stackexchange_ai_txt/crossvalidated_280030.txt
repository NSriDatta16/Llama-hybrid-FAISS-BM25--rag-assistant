The answer to this question hinges on whether you already include individual fixed effects. An interpretation of your question: Q : If I already have individual fixed effects in my model, can I increase prediction power by adding right hand side variables (eg. gender) that don't vary within an individual? A : In the context of classic linear models (eg. linear regression), the answer is no . All it would do is change your estimate of the fixed effects and none of your predictions would change at all. If you ran the following two regressions: $$y_{it} = \hat{a} + \hat{b}_1 x_{it} + \hat{u}_i +\hat{\epsilon}_{it}$$ $$y_{it} = a + b_1 x_{it} + b_2 z_i + u_i + \epsilon_{it}$$ Your forecasting power would be the same, and you'd have $\hat{u}_i = b_2 z_i + u_i$. Q : Moving beyond ordinary least squares regression, could it change things? A : Yes. In the most general sense, you need not have the equivalence. I would not expect it to improve things (since the data is collinear), but perhaps in certain contexts it could? Eg. repeating the same feature in a random forest could give it a higher probability of being selected etc...
