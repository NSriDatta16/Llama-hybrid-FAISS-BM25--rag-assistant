Putting your data into R, I agree with your values for the sample mean and standard deviation. x = c(9.50, 4.75, 7.50, 5.75, 10.25, 8.00, 8.50, 8.25, 7.75, 6.25, 7.00, 10.25, 8.25, 4.50, 10.75, 10.00, 9.50, 5.75, 15.50, 10.25, 8.75, 7.25, 11.25, 4.50, 12.00, 9.75, 3.00, 10.50, 6.00, 3.75, 5.75, 5.00, 11.75, 11.50, 5.75, 9.00, 9.75, 12.25, 5.75, 13.00) summary(x); sd(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 3.000 5.750 8.375 8.363 10.250 15.500 [1] 2.836885 The sample mean $\$8.36 > \$7.50.$ You would use a one-sample t test (not z test) to see whether $\$8.36$ is 'statistically' larger than $\$7.50$ so that the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu \le 7.50$ can be rejected in favor of the alternative $H_a: \mu > 7.50.$ You would use a t test because the population standard deviation is not known and is estimated by the sample standard deviation $S = 2.84.$ Here are results of a t test in R: t.test(x, mu=7.50, alt="gr") One Sample t-test data: x t = 1.9229, df = 39, p-value = 0.03091 alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 7.5 95 percent confidence interval: 7.606748 Inf sample estimates: mean of x 8.3625 The P-value $0.031$ is smaller the $0.05 = 5\%,$ so we can reject $H_0$ at the 5% level of significance. Does this mean that the owner of the restaurant should price this item at more than $\$7.50?$ Maybe not: the average amount the customers in the survey are willing to pay is $\$8.35$ and the 95% lower bound is $\$7.61.$ Maybe the item will sell better if the 'average' opinion is that it's a bit underpriced. The second part of the question asks if the proportion of customers willing to pay more than $\$7.50$ exceeds 70%. In the sample of $n = 40$ asked, $25$ (or $\hat p = 0.625 = 62.5\%)$ of them gave prices above $\$7.50.$ sum(x >= 7.50) [1] 25 mean(x >= 7.50) [1] 0.625 stripchart(x, meth="stack", pch=20) abline(v=7.50, col="green2", lty="dotted") So it seems that the correct proportion is nearer to $p = 0.625$ than to $p = 0.7.$ We could formally test $H_0: p \le 0.7$ against $H_a: p > 0.7,$ but the outcome seems obvious. The data don't support the idea that more that $62.5\%$ would be willing to pay more than $\$7.50.$ Of course, a (futile) test of proportions, cannot reject $H_0.$ Results from R: prop.test(25, 40, .7, alt="gr") 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction data: 25 out of 40, null probability 0.7 X-squared = 0.74405, df = 1, p-value = 0.8058 alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.7 95 percent confidence interval: 0.4825422 1.0000000 sample estimates: p 0.625 I suppose, you could 'turn it around' and test $H_0: p \ge .7$ against $H_a: p which does not lead to rejection. But if that was intended, then the wording of the question "[T]est whether or not there is statistical evidence that the proportion of target customers who are willing to buy the sandwich by paying $7.50 or more is greater than 70%." seems awkward, not-quite-English, or wrong. prop.test(25, 40, 0.7, alt="less")$p.val [1] 0.1941837 Based on the data, a reasonable, and perhaps useful, statement about the percentage who would pay more than $\S7.50$ is the two-sided 95% CI for $p:$ $(0.458, 0.768).$ prop.test(25, 40)$conf.int [1] 0.4580964 0.7682594 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 Note: A test of $H_0: p \le 0.6$ against $H_a: p > 0.6$ would make more sense, but it does not reject. prop.test(25, 40, .6, alt="gr")$p.val [1] 0.4358993 Also, the null hypothesis $H_0: p \ge 0.8$ against $H_a: p does reject. prop.test(25, 40, .8, alt="less")$p.val [1] 0.005094466
