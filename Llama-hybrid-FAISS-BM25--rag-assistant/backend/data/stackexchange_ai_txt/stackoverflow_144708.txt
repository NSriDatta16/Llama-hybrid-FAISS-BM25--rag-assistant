I'd highly suggest using FileBrowser by Lussomo. It's as easy as 'drag and drop' :D I've used it for my game development team where we had a raw dump of over 200 concept art images, and we simply extracted FileBrowser to a PHP-enabled webserver and dumped the images in appropriate directories (1 per album), and ran the thumbnailing script. It handles cropping of the images, and optimizing their size for you. So much better than using something like Menalto Gallery where you have to upload them through an awkward upload interface.
