There is nothing wrong with what is happening here. Because of the way floating point numbers are represented in memory, 42.479999999999997 is the closest representation of 42.48 that a double can have. Read this paper: http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html It explains what's happening there. There is unfortunately nothing you can do about the storage of it.
