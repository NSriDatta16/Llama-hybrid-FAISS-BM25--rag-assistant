I don't think this is possible. What I did when I wrote a 'desktop toy' that manipulated the desktop was to take a screenshot, create a window as big as the desktop and put the screenshot on the back of my application window. This did stop things like the start menu and the desktop icons from working of course but that was fine for my purpose, don't know what you're trying to do. You could try to subclass the window you get from GetDesktopWindow()... Somehow I have a suspicion though that Windows has safeguards against this sort of shenanigans.
