Data flow diagrams are used to describe data flow within a system. They can depict transformations on data as well as storage locations. They trace the route that data travels in a system, from start to finish. Control flow diagrams are used to describe the detailed logic of a business process or business rule. Control flow diagrams can easily illustrate decisions within the system via decision nodes that branch in different logical paths.
