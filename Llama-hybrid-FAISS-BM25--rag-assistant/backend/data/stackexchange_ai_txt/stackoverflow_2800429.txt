The $_REQUEST['url'] value is being urlencoded as opposed to urlencoding just the querystring. Somewhere in your code and/or FLEX service is causing a "double urlencode". Simply url decode it and you should get the value you need. Also, I noticed line feeds and tabs so you might want to trim it as well. curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, trim(urldecode($_REQUEST['url']))); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $timeout); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $userAgent); $response = curl_exec($ch); if (curl_errno($ch)) { echo curl_error($ch); } else { curl_close($ch); echo $response; } ?> That's it.
