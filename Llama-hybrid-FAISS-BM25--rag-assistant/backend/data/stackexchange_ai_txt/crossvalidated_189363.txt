Can the probabilities of classification trees be compared with the ones from logistic regression?

When I use the same data set to estimate a tree and a logistic regression model. Is there a way of comparing the resulting probabilities? In my view, there is not. Because, for logistic regression, I look at the effect a particular feature has on the outcome holding all the features constant (for example). But for classification trees, I only get conditional probabilities dependent on features further up the tree. Is this a correct reasoning?
