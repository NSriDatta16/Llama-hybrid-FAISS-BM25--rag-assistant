Judging flatness of time-series

I have multiple short (say, length By "non-flat" time-series I mean the ones that have relatively short periods of significantly increased values. By "flat" time series I mean the ones that have all the time very similar magnitude of changes. Some kind of slight linear trend may, or may not, be present in the series. Can you suggest something? I tried multiple approaches starting from simple ones (using variance), to more sophisticated ones (using methods for change-point analysis), but without satisfactory results.
