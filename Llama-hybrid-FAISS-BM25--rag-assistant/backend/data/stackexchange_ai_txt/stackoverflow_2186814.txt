Have you considered a short ternary solution? 'Sex' => ( isset($sex) ? $sex : "n/a" ) This is essentially performing if-else logic, but not nearly as verbose. Our condition is isset($sex) . If this is true, we return $sex , else we return "n/a" . Whatever is returned becomes the value of 'Sex' . If this isn't sufficient, I would encourage you to require valid values during instantiation. If the user doesn't provide proper and expected values, refuse instantiation of the class.
