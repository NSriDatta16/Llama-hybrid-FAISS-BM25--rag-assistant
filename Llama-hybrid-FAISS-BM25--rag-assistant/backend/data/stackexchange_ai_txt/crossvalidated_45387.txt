Panel data random effects probit model

I know that for panel data RE probit model we should average out the individual effects and in order to do that we do the following: $$f(y_1,...,y_T|x_i, \theta) = \int[\prod_{t=1}^T f(y_t|x_{it},c;\beta)\frac{1}{\sigma_c}\phi(\frac{c}{\sigma_c})]dc $$ I would be very grateful if someone could explain how an assumption that $c$ is independent of $x_i, \epsilon_i$ allows me to conclude that $$ f(y_1,...,y_T|x_i, \beta) = \int[f(y_1,...,y_T|x_{it},c;\beta)\frac{1}{\sigma_c}\phi(\frac{c}{\sigma_c})]dc $$
