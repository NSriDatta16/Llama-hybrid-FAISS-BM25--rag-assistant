Generate a String that matches a RegEx in Python

Possible Duplicate: Reversing a regular expression in python I think I ran into a problem that sounds easier than it is... I'm not too sure. I want to define a regular expression, and I want to build a number of strings matching it. Is there any module I can import that has got this functionality? Preferably not a brute-force approach using re.search or re.match . There must be a more elegant way to do that.
