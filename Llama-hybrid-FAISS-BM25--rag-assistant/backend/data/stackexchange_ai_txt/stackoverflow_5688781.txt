Why C++ can't see my lua script file?

I have a simple problem with integrating Lua with c++. I have my project in Visual Studio : https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNw6H.png and I run my lua_init() function : bool lua_init(std::string &luaScriptName){ // Create the Lua state. Explanation from Lua 5.1 Ref. Manual: globalL = luaL_newstate(); // 5.1 OK - Lua 5.0 or lower will probably require different commands if( globalL == NULL ) return false; // Loads all Lua standard libraries luaL_openlibs(globalL); // 5.1 OK - Lua 5.0 or lower will require different commands // This lot below could be replaced with luaL_dofile, but that just does: luaL_loadfile(..) || lua_pcall(..), which gives no reporting of error messages etc. int initError = luaL_loadfile(globalL,luaScriptName.c_str()); switch( initError ) { case 0: // The file loaded okay, so call it as a protected function - to stop fatal errors from exiting the program lua_pcall(globalL,0,0,0); break; case LUA_ERRFILE: std::cerr } but don't know I get the "Cannot find / open lua script file:" error should I point somehow my script.lua to the Visual Studio ? the file is located in the project directory.
