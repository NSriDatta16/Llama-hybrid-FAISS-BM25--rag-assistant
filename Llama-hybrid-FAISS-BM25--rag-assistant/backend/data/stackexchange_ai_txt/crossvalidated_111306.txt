The Matlab package PACE can deal with data with different observed time points (irregular data), which is exactly suitable for your analysis. In your example, as long as all the data pooled together are dense in [0, 1000], the FPCA function in the package can estimate an individual curve even if its measurements are on [200, 1000]. The method used by FPCA to deal with irregular data is Principal components analysis by Conditional Expectation (PACE, see Yao, Mueller, and Wang 2005 ). An individual curve can be represented by its functional principal components (FPC, Wikipedia has an entry) in the eigenbasis. The method aims to estimate the FPCs even if individual data are observed sparsely, i.e. with only a few observations. The estimated individual curves can then be recovered from the FPCs. One choice for fitting a functional linear model with functional response and scalar predictors is to obtain the FPCs of the response first, and then reduce the problem to a linear regression model with multivariate response. You can consider using the FPCreg function in PACE , although it require a functional predictor (you can make a scalar predictor a constant function). If you prefer manipulating the data in R while using Matlab for FPCA you can try the R package R.matlab , which let you pass around some R and Matlab objects.
