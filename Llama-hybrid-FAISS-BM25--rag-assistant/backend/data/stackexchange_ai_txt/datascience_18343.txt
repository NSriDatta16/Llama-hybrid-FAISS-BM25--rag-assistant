I agree with the two answers above me! This is a time series forecasting problem. Python with tensorflow and keras would be the best route to build the model and have it able to be exported to train somewhere else. Start off with something nice and simple, if it doesn't do what you want add some more layers, tinker with the learning rate, etc. Here is a link very similar to what you want to do: Tutorial Hope that helped! Enjoy building it, this stuff is a lot of fun!!
