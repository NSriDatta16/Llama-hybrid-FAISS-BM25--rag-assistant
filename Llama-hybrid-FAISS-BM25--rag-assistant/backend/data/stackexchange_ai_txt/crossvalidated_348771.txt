If you know about Science, then you will not believe in Physics. If you believe in Physics, that means you don't understand Science. Reasons: The search space containing the physical laws which explain our universe is infinite, and we don't know which grand unified theory of physics generalizes the best (mind you, none of our grand unified theories even explain gravity yet!). I think you should relax your definition of "belief" from mathematical-proof levels of rigor to "does it work?". And deep learning works, so I "believe" in it. And I'm pretty sure I understand machine learning. Hopefully, you would "believe" in physics not because physicists have finally got a Theory of Everything (they don't), but because physics is useful and necessary for a wide variety of modern technologies such as GPS, and also conveniently models how much of the universe works.
