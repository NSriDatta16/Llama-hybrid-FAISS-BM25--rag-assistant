I've looked at the WPF source code using .NET Refector and found this answer to a related question that might be a better solution for you. Set the BitmapImage.CacheOption to BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad forces the image data into memory and closes the file immediately. Using that option, you can delete the from the file system at any time afterwards.
