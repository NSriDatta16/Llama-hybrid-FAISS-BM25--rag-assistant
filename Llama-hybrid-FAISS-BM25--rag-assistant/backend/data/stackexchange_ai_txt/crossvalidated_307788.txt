Annual mean, standard deviation for markedly nonuniformly sampled metric

I expect that this is a common issue and that I just need the correct terminology so that I can Google more efficiently. I'm interested in calculating an annual mean and standard deviation for a quantity $y$ that is sampled throughout a year. Due to logistical issues, there are far more samples in the summer than in the winter leading to a very patchy data set. If I simply take an average of all my samples within a year, for example, the mean will be biased by the heterogeneous sampling intensity. Is there a standard approach for dealing with this issue?
