You are looking for a mixed model (i.e. model which will allow you to use random effects along with the fixed effects you already use). You want to include device-specific random effect for the slope of log(X) . Say you have a data.frame with columns logY , logX , deviceNumber . Than you get your desired result by: require(lme4) m This will give you a general mean slope (over all devices), which will be something like an "average over device specific slopes". Along with proper standard errors and p-values. It is better to fit it like this in a single model , than fitting in separate models and then use the mean slope. It is because the mean slopes are uncertain values with given standard error, and these standard errors wouldn't be involved in estimation of the standard error of the mean slope. It would also be a mistake to fit them in a single model without random effects, like lm(logY ~ logX) . Because the linear model assumes independence of the data points, but the data points of the same device are likely to be more similar or have more similar slope, so the assumption of the independence would be violated - which would result in incorrect standard errors.
