Allow multiple values to BDC Column

I have added a column called Customer to my documents library, this is a business data column. What I want to do is relate a document to multiple customers by entering customer codes into this box. Currently I can add 'FLC' for example, but I want to put 'FLC, MFT, SAL' for a specified document as it relates to many customers. Any ideas? Cheers, Albert
