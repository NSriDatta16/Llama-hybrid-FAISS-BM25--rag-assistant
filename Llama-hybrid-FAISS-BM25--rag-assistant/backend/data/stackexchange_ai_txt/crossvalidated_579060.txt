How can I model, and train a Bayesian Netwok from a given dataset for predicting cause-effect scenario?

I have a dataset that I used to train my ML model for prediction. I created my prediction models using XGBoost and Neural Networks. Now I want to create another model that can give me the causal relationship between the values that I have. What I actually want to know is which parameters influenced in what manner in predicting my outcome? I know how the outcome is correlated to some of the parameters by using the Correlation Matrix. But it does not give me causality. I am working with Python, tensorflow, and Scikit learn
