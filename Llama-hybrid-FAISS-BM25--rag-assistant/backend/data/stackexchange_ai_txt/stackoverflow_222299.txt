In TortoiseSVN, you can right click on the working copy and drag it somewhere else. And when the popup menu appears, select "SVN Export Here". (This requires that all code in the working copy was checked in since the export will be from trunk and not from the working copy) See these resources for details: http://tortoisesvn.net/most-forgotten-feature (about the right click+drag context menu) http://tortoisesvn.net/node/343 (About unversioning an svn working copy). If you use this method, I think that your unversioned files will remain in the folder but I haven't tried it...
