Yes. It seems like you're looking for sample complexity . VC dimension is a related concept. The field that deals with these concepts is called computational learning theory. Understanding Machine Learning is an example of textbook that uses this approach to ML and contains calculations/estimation of VC dimension of the methods it covers (it's free BTW).
