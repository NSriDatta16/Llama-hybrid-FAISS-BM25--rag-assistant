Honestly, it all depends on how the relative risk is calculated. This answer describes how it's done using linear models. If the relative risk is an average over multiple stratification groups, computed using e.g. The Mantel Haenszel Method , then you cannot infer anything about a unit increase in any of the stratification variables, since they are typically discretized.
