The commonly accepted maximum length (in de facto use in Apache httpd, for example) for a given header is 8k. (8192 bytes) The security issues with storing this data would be the same as storing any user-provided data. Use parameter binding (like as offered by PDO). Don't simply count on escaping the strings. There are other performance considerations with your database schema. You might consider changing the columns to type TEXT because of this : ( Every table (regardless of storage engine) has a maximum row size of 65,535 bytes [..] BLOB and TEXT columns are counted at [9-12] bytes per column toward the row size limit because the contents of these columns are stored separately from the rest of the row )
