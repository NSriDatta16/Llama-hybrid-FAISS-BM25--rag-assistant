Since you're working with set steps and trying to number them, then you should probably try to use an ordered list instead. The ol indicates that the items belong in the given order, and it provides numbering without any extra work! If you really want to use CSS, then counters are what you're looking for. In the containing element for these paragraphs, apply the style counter-reset: step . Then for your paragraph tags use: p:before { counter-increment: step; content: counter(step)". "; } This should work in modern browsers, but because of simplicity and legacy browser support, I think you'll be happier with just an ordered list.
