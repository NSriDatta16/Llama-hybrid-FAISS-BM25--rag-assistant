How do we know that Logistic regression actually returns the probability

My question is pretty straightforward... Logistic regression returns a non linear transformation of an affine transformation of the input data, that appears to be in $(0,1)$ ... my question is then, who are we sure that this is not just a number between 0 and 1, and instead is $P(y=1|x, w_{model})$ ? I mean, in instead of the logistic function I would have used something like: $$f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+1}$$ I would still have outputs in $[0,1]$ , but that does not mean that it's the probability that it's how sure is the model that $Y=1$
