What are the anomalies/fault/outliers detection algorithms

I'm working on a weather application that uses data coming from multiple sensors in real time (the data is time series), i've made an anomalies detection model using One Class Support Vector Machines, and it's working good. I need to do a benchmarking on that results. What are the anomalies/fault/outliers detection algorithms that i can use?
