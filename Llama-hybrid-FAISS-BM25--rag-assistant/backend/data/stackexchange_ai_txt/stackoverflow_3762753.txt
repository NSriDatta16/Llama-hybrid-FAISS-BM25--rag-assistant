Converting HTML emails to "Well Formed XHTML Code"

I've trying to submit html emails to amazon's mechanical turk using the questionform xml data scheme. I'm having issues converting the html emails into well formed html data. I just input a script to grab it from my table and print the data inside the tags of the html email, but as you can see below, it's terribly formed and will not pass to mechanical turk - I've had to send the data as htmlentities() until now and this makes it difficult for HIT workers to easily solve my issues. Here's an example of how not well formed the data is - any tips on how to send this data through mechanical turk (php) or convert it to well formed html data would be appreciated.

Summary Introduction What Cloud Computing Can Mean for Your Business, Part II: Starting Your Cloud Infrastructure The IE9 Beta Review Creating Shadows Around Polygons in CSS New Technical Articles Techy Forum Threads More Techy Blog Entries Starting Your Cloud Infrastructure What Cloud Computing Can Mean for Your Business, Part II Starting out, what do we need? We have to be able to communicate with our customers and suppliers, so we need email, perhaps instant messaging. If we have overseas or long distance clients, some kind of VOIP phone would help to keep costs down. We must ensure that anything we're working on is properly backed up from the business plan to product concepts and beyond. Any loss of data could be crucial when getting your product or service to market at the right time. Keeping an eye on our schedule is vital to make sure important events, tasks, and meetings are managed. There's a lot more to address, but this much is enough to get us up and running so we can get about the business of doing business. &#160;But if you're not an IT person and you don't know how to setup email servers or backup systems, where do you begin? Email Google has been a provider of innovative products in the cloud for some time, but many are unaware just how powerful these applications can be. Gmail, for example, offers free email accounts with enormous amounts of storage, and an easy-to-use interface. Your email can be accessed from anywhere, you never have to delete as everything can be archived, and backups are taken care of for you. The only issue is that you may want to avoid sending emails to a big potential client from an anonymous, free Gmail account; to make a proper impression, you need to be able to have your own email address under your company name. Google can still help you here, though; you can actually use the Gmail system with your own domain name. As long as you have a domain , you can purchase a Google Apps for Business account for the trifling sum of US$50 a year, which lets you transfer your email hosting to Google's servers. It's a very simple process, and once done you have full IMAP access to your email from anywhere in the world, with a guarantee of availability and uptime that few can compete with certainly not in a small business. The cost increases as you add more email accounts, but it's still less than you'd pay to host a server with your own email software on it. You can set up a normal email client like Outlook or Apple mail to use the server, or use the user-friendly Gmail interface on the Web. This means that no matter what happens, you'll always have access to email and the ability to send from your own email address, even if your personal computers fail. There are more great benefits to using Google Apps, but we'll explore those in the next article. For now, check out Google Apps for Business to get up and running with your email.
