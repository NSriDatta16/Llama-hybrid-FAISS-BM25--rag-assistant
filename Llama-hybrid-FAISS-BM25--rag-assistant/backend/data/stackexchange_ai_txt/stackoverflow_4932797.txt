I found what part of the slidingDrawer that was causing this. The onInterceptTouchEvent() method returns false if the slidingDrawer is locked. Anyway, I "solved" this problem by fakeing a slidingDrawer by creating a new Activity wich slides up and down using: startActivity(yourIntent); overridePendingTransition(R.anim.yourNextActivity_InAnimation, R.anim.yourCurrentActivity_OutAnimation); The downside is ofcourse that it is no longer possible to drag the drawer with your finger.
