The error message you are getting, looks like is due to empid being missing as Kragen points out. I think that you could simplify your code a great deal: You have an object that you cast to a byte array You then use the byte array to create a stream You then convert the stream to a byte array. Why not just return the byte array? This link may also help you: http://www.worldofasp.net/tut/images/Displaying_images_in_ASPNET_using_HttpHandlers_92.aspx
