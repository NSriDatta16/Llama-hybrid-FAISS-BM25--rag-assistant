How to apply Hypothesis test on time series?

I am working on a project that is related to Wikipedia's revision history. I have around 10 time-series and each one represents how the relative frequency of positive words changes over time. I need to test the hypothesis, that the batch of females samples have larger relative frequencies than the batch of males samples. But, this I want to hold over time. I have tried ANOVA, but I am not sure if it is the proper way and how to interpret the results, because I am testing only one value which is the average over time. What is the proper way to apply hypothesis tests on time series data?
