Non-Binary Significance Testing?

It's been awhile since I've done significance testing... I need to compare 2 average scores: Score A is 7.9 on a 0-10 scale (11pt scale). Score B is 8.2 on a 0-10 scale (11pt scale). The samples sizes are A=70 and B=300. How do I determine if the change in average score is significant or not?
