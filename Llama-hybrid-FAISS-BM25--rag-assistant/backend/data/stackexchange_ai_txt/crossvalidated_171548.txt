Why use detrending methods when studying seasonality of a phenomenon?

I have a basic question, I am trying to study the seasonality of birth in a town, and all the material I am researching use moving average for detrending and these values are eventually used for linear regression to study the effect of certain conditions that may/maynot affect the seasonality. I am trying to understand why detrending is used, it takes out the trends but it is the trends(seasonality) that I want to understand. I'd appreciate it if someone could explain the theory behind it.
