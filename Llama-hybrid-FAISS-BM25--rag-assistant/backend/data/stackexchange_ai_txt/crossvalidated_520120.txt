Amemiya (1981, p. 1488) shows that for slopes, $\beta_{Logit} \approx 4 \cdot \beta_{OLS}$ . He shows that these comparisons work quite well for slope parameters if 0.1 ≤ p ≤ 0.9. This pins down the logit slope to 2 in your example. The intercept is going to be trickier. You do know that $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \hat p= \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \Lambda(\alpha + \beta \cdot x_i).$$ Here $\Lambda()$ is the inverse logit. If you happen to know the average success rate in your OLS sample and are willing to make some assumptions about $x_i$ s in your new experiment, you can solve that for $\alpha$ . Or perhaps there is a better way to get that from the log odds. Amemiya, T. (1981), “Qualitative Response Models: A Survey,” Journal of Economic Literature , 1483–1536.
