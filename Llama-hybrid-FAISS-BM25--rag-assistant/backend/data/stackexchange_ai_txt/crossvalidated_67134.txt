Time series and cross correlation

I have two time series: numbers of subscriptions per hours for 10 days, for a website. the time where TV ads, for a specific TV channel, have been displayed e.g. 10:25AM on Monday 12 of August, TV AD1 displayed on CNBC as an example. The issue with that time series is there is only the time and the date but nothing else. I would like to do a cross correlation to see the impact, or the lack of impact, of the TV ads on the numbers of subscriptions. But with only the time of the adverts, is this cross correlation doable? If yes, how? I'm not asking for a specific solution designed by any of you, rather website links where I can find some ideas or any hints as I'm stuck at the moment.
