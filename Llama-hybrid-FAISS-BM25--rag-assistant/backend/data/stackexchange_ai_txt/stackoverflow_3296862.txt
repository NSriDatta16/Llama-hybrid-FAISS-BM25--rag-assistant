how to send an object to C# WCF service from PHP using SOAP

I'm having trouble sending a custom object thats defined as a datacontract in my WCF web service from PHP. I'm attempting to accomplish this via SOAP. Here is what the dataContract looks like: [DataContract] public class simplyCustomer { [DataMember] public int id; [DataMember] public string name; [DataMember] public string contact; [DataMember] public string street1; [DataMember] public string street2; [DataMember] public string city; [DataMember] ... } So I have a function that takes simplyCustomer as parameter on WCF service. The php can receive simplyCustomer just fine using another function that returns one. However, if I call the one that accepts it using this code in PHP: $retVal = $simplyService->__soapCall("addCustomer",array('parameters'=>$params)); The SOAP envelope that this call generates leaves the object NULL causing the WCF service to complain about null reference. Here is the envelope that is generated: The parameters should be where addCustomer is but there's nothing there. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
