There are some tools to convert UML modeling diagrams to into code - specifically, UML state diagrams. For example, I used a tool called "Rhapsody" (from I-Logix) back in 2000 that would convert a UML diagram to C++. It was cool because the tool could run the state machine directly, and could also run code on a remote machine (in this case, a board running vxworks). But generally speaking, UML is best used as a modeling tool. Use it to model your system and provide diagrams for your design papers, or whatever. Then use that knowledge to develop your system in an organized manner.
