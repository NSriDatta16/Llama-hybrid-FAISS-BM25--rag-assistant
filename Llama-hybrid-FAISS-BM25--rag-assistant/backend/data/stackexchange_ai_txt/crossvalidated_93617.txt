Posterior Density in R

I'm new to the site, and to Bayesian statistics and was hoping to get some help. I'm currently working through some study exercises and am required to compute the mean and variance of the posterior density in R. The prior density is represented by a normal curve with a mean of 6 and variance of .25, whereas observed mean from a sample (from a normal density) of n = 24 is 7.69 with variance of 2.0. Most of the readings and study I've done relate to probability estimates - nothing specifically related to the exercises I'm currently trying to work through. Any assistance or advice or information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
