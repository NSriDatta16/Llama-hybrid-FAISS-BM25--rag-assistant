Is it possible to solve Rubik's cube using DQN?

I'm trying to solve Rubik's cube using deep learning and I came across with DQN, so I decided to give it a try. I developed all the code and started training but I got this results: Loss goes up and test never get better results. I have tried to change learning rate, epsilon greedy decay, reducing scramble moves to one but it still can't solve it with just one move. That's why I would like to know if it just impossible to do it this way or I could miscalculating some values.
