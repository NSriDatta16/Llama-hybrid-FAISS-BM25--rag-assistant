Can mean plus one standard deviation exceed maximum value?

I have mean 74.10 and standard deviation 33.44 for a sample that has minimum 0 and maximum 94.33. My professor asks me how can mean plus one standard deviation exceed the maximum. I showed her many examples about this, but she doesn't understand. I need some reference to show her. It could be any chapter or paragraph from a statistics book that talks particularly about this.
