Yes.Sure you need to encrypt users passwords.Because most of the users using the same password almost all sites.At that time they are not want to show the passwords to admin.And another reason is most of the time the site DB may be accessed not only by admin.Some other technical persons in the organization.So it is better to encrypt the password.SHA1 is the best way to make the encryption. Where and how will i store the passwords. I am not sure what you mean by this.Every one use the database for it like phpmyadmin.
