I think it's worth distinguishing a few aspects of the problem: Precision : If you have a bigger sample size, you will typically be able to estimate parameters with greater precision whether you define this in a frequentist sense in terms of smaller confidence intervals or in a Bayesian sense in terms of smaller credibility intervals. Thus, if you conduct an epidemiological observational study with a bigger sample you will have greater precision in describing the magnitude of a parameter of interest. This is true whether the parameter is a simple correlation coefficient or a regression coefficient in a broader model with many other predictors. It's also true whether the parameter of interest is derived from an observational study or an experimental study. So for example, you might get a very accurate estimate of the correlation between eating chocolate and Body Mass Index. Associations, whether causal or not, are real and interesting. Generalisation : However, even if you know the value of a parameter in your particular sample, there are still issues of generalisation. In epidemiology there are plenty of issues related to generalising across time, culture, social groups, and so on. Often we have theories and empirical evidence to guide us in this process of generalising. For example, we may argue that is safe to generalise a chocolate-BMI association over reasonable periods of time, but that perhaps across nations it is more complex, perhaps because of different eating and exercise habits, etc. Causality versus association : However, you seem to be particular interested in causal inference. At a basic level, the absence of an association in an observational study does not prove the absence of causality, just as the presence of an association in an observational study does not prove causality . Even if observational studies showed no relationship between, for example, chocolate and BMI, this would not prevent experimental studies from showing that when kids were fed more chocolate, they put on weight. The association or lack of association in an observational study may be informative as to causal processes, but it is not definitive. You still need to think hard about the theorised underlying causal processes.
