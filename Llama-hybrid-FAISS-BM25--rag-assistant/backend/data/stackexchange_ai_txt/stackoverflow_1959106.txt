android: how to create different "screens" and nav between them using touch-and-drag?

Can i create the same kind of navigation that I have on the main screens? That is, I want different screens that I can navigate between using the touch-and-drag? I haven't seen anything about it, so it was time to ask :) Oh, Im talking about apps for android :)
