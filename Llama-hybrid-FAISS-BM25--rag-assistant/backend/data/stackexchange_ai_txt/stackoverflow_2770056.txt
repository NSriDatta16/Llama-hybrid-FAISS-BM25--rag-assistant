Here are two examples I can share: Matrix multiplication: I have a blog post comparing different matrix multiplication implementations . LBFGS I have a large scale logistic regression solver using LBFGS optimization, which is coded in C++. The implementation is well tuned. I modified some code to code in C++/CLI, i.e. I compiled the code into .Net. The .Net version is 3 to 5 times slower than the naive compiled one on different datasets. If you code LBFGS in F#, the performance can not be better than C++/CLI or C#, (but would be very close). I have another post on Why F# is the language for data mining , although not quite related to the performance issue you concern here, it is quite related to scientific computing in F#.
