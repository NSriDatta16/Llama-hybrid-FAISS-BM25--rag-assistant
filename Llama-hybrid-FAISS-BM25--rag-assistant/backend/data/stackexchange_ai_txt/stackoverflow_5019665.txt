delete records from staging table after they have been added to the real table

I have an asp.net program, that adds tasks to my staging table and executes a stored procedure that takes these tasks and places them in my actual table, i would like to delete the records after they are added, because my staging table will get too big fast. here is my stored procedure code INSERT INTO dashboardtasks SELECT [tour], tourname, [taskname], [deptdate], [tasktype], [desc], [duedate], [compdate], [comments], [agent], [compby], [graceperiod], completed , canceled FROM staggingtasks WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM dashboardtasks WHERE (staggingtasks.tour=dashboardtasks.tour and staggingtasks.taskname=dashboardtasks.taskname and staggingtasks.deptdate=dashboardtasks.deptdate and staggingtasks.duedate=dashboardtasks.duedate and staggingtasks.tourname=dashboardtasks.tourname ) ) END
