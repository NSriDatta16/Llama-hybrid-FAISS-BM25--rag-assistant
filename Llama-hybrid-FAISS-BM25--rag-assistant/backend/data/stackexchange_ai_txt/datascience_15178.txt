Tool for visualizing long time series data

I am searching for a software / tool / R package (any of these) that enables easy visualization of a time series. My problem is the following: I have a multiple time series with 7 attributes I want to have all 7 attributes plotted beneath each other with a own y-axis I want to be able to set y-axis resolutions for the plot The time series is very long (1 year) but I want to look at each day individually and then basically scroll right to see the next day
