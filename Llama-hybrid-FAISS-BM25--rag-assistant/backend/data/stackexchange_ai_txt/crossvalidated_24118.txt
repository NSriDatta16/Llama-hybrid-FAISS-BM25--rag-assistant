Practical PCA tutorial with data

Searching the internet for PCA tutorial gives thousands of results (even videos). Many of the tutorials are very good. But I am not able to find any practical example where PCA is explained using some data-sets which I can use for demonstration. I need a tutorial which provides some small data set which is easy to plot (not 10000s of lines of data with 100s of dimension) before and after the PCA analysis and the difference/results can be clearly demonstrated. (I think a step-by-step practical example with a data having about some 100 lines and 3 dimension will be great). Do you have any suggestion??
