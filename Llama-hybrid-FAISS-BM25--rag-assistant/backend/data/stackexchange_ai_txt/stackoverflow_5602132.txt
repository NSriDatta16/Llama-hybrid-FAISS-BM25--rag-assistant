Is it possible to change the background color of the WebBrowser control before loading content?

I have a page that contains a WebBrowser control that is frequently updating content. I am using a black background, but the default color before loading content of the WebBrowser is white. I could change it by loading a small HTML string with the background set to black but there is still a period of time when the WebBrowser appears as white so there is a sort of a flickering effect happening. My question is this: is there any way to change the color of the underlying control of the WebBrowser ? I have tried a few solutions such as hiding the WebBrowser until the content has been loaded but none of these feel very elegant and don't work all that well.
