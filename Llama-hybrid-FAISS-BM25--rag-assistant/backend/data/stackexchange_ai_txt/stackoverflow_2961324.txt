Ajax Request using jQuery in Rails

I am sending an Ajax Request using jQuery. What happens is that I am getting an "405 Method Not Allowed" Error. I am just posting a form, which would get the detail from the form and insert it into the DB. Just the usual stuff.I am using WEBrick that comes as default with the rails package. Can somebody please tell me how to fix this. This is the code that triggers the Ajax Request $.post($(this).attr("action") + ".js",$(this).serialize(),null,"script"); Response Headers Cache-Control no-cache Allow GET, PUT, DELETE Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length 9502 Server WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/1.9.1/2009-12-07) Date Wed, 02 Jun 2010 20:41:33 GMT Connection Keep-Alive Request Headers Host localhost:3000 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest Referer http://localhost:3000/viewspot/3 Content-Length 141 Pragma no-cache Cache-Control no-cache
