OLS Heteroskedasticity correction

I have a data and was trying to correct for heteroskedasticity (which is significant as per Breush Pagan test). However, after using the robust command in stata, my standard errors of almost all the variables increase. Shouldn't it be opposite? In class we were taught that after correction for heteroskedasticity, the standard errors decrease. I am kind of confused here. Please help me out.
