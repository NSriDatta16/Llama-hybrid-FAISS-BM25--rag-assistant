I found the grid was being generated in the following location: /app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Report/Shopcart/Abandoned/Grid.php From there I was able to find the model being used for the abandoned shopping carts was: $collection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/quote_collection'); $collection->prepareForAbandonedReport(array(1)); $collection->load(); I was able to get my end goal done by adding two column to the Grid.php file. I did that by doing the following: $this->addColumn('customer_firstname', array( 'header' =>Mage::helper('reports')->__('Customer First Name'), 'index' =>'customer_firstname', 'sortable' =>false )); $this->addColumn('customer_lastname', array( 'header' =>Mage::helper('reports')->__('Customer Last Name'), 'index' =>'customer_lastname', 'sortable' =>false ));
