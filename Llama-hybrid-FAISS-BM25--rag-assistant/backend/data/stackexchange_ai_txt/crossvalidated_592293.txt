Automatic way to classify if a time series has a peak in a particular month/qtr of the year

I have around 20 Million time series(say of product demands or merchant's activity for a few past years). I am looking to develop: An automated way to classify these time series as being regular or seasonal(Seasonal here means there is peak activity in some part of the year say every April or even April-May-Jun). For those who are seasonal, I am also looking to tag them with the exact months of their peak activity. Currently I am exploring a time series clustering based approach on a sample with hope that they will be clustered as per their seasonal patterns. And then build a classifier to classify the remaining into different seasonal time series.
