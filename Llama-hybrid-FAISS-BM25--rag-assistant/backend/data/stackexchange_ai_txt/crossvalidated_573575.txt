Squared Pearson correlation is equal to the “proportion of variance in $y$ explained by $x$ ”. This is also equal to a common regression metric called $R^2$ that has an intimate relationship to minimization of square loss and maximum likelihood estimation when a conditional Gaussian variable is assumed in a generalized linear model (when there is an intercept in the model, which is most of the time). Your advisor seems to want to mimic that. As Spearman correlation has a similar relationship to proportional odds ordinal logistic regression and Pearson correlation has to regular OLS linear regression, I would not be surprised to hear that there is a relationship to maximum likelihood estimation for the proportional odds model, though I don’t know that.
