How to incorporate the customers leaving (addition of new ones) in the measurement of treatment effectiveness?

Consider I have taken a random sample for forming control group in month of January with sample size 5k and treatment group size being 95k. I am Sending offers to treatment group which are intend to increase the purchasing capacity of the customers. At every month end I am computing the effectiveness of treatment by computing: (Average purchases of target group - Average purchases of control group) * Target Group size Now Consider every month there people leaving from the target and control group also, people are getting added every month. So, I have two questions: How do I make changes to the Control group to be able to compute uplift accurately? What should be the validity (expiry) of control group/ when should I refresh my control group?
