Johansen Cointegration on a stationary time series?

Following question. Assume we have 6 variables A - stationary at level . I(0) B - stationary at level . I(0) C - stationary at level . I(0) D - stationary at level . I(0) E - stationary at level . I(0) F - stationary at level . I(1) We applied a Granger Wald test to A - B with the result that A causes B. Unidirectional. C - D with the result that C causes D. Unidirectional. E - F No causality. For this test, we applied a VECM Granger testing model, since F was I(1). Question: Is it okay to also test A + B and C + D for Johansen cointegration, though they are both I(0), i.e. stationary at level? We tested E + F for cointegration with each first differences. The point: The results of cointegration were very much the same as for the Granger Wald test. A - B existence of cointegration vector. C - D existence of cointegration vector. E - F no existence of cointegration vector. I only wonder why I should maybe not test A + B and C + D with Johansen, or if it's nonsense once both variables are I(0).
