Update: I never got this piece of code to work robustly so I ended up switching back to letting visual studio generate the DataContext via the drag and drop graphical designer. I still struggle a bit with fixing the names on the relationship links after an update of the db schema (I carefully name all relationships in the db but the designer tool seems to ignore those names) but since I discovered that the db.designer.cs file can be opened in an xml editor rather than with the GUI, the job got a lot easier.
