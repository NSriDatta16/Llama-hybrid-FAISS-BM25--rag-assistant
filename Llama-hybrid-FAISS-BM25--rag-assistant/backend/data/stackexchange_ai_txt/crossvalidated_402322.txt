What type of neural network is used for image to restore pictures from pixels

When we have small low resolution, fuzzy image for example: and if it to zoom, an unrelated set of pixels is obtained. For example Tell me, please is there the way to train a neural network to recognize a magnified image. Clear it of pixels, so that it looks like this: (it is initial picture) I want to understand: What type of neural network is used for this? What type data are needed to train neural network? What should be the format of data?
