In the cube designer, check the "Dimension Usage" tab. Make sure that the intersection between a dimension and a measure group has something there (If there's meant to be a relation). What happens if you drag & drop the measure to the browser, without any dimensions? Also what version of SSAS are you on, is it 2005? That had IgnoreUnrelatedDimensions set differently to 2008 I think..
