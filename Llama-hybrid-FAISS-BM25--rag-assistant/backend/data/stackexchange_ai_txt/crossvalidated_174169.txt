Agree with @RUser4512 - is the street really the best representation of that feature? Would something else like zip code, census tract, etc. be better for the problem you're trying to solve? If street is the appropriate representation, then SVM could be a good approach. It works well with sparse data, and is the approach Google takes with their Sofia package.
