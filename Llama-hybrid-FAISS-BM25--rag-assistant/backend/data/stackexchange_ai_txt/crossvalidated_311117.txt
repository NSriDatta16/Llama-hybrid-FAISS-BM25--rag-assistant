More generally let $\pi$ be a permutation matrix. The act of permuting rows an columns is equivalent to $\pi P \pi$. Let $\mu$ be the stationary distribution of $P$, and suppose $\pi P\pi=P$. Define $\mu'=\pi^T\mu$. Then: $$\mu^T=\mu^T P = \mu^T \pi P\pi=\mu'^TP\pi$$ Multiply both sides on the right by $\pi^{-1}=\pi^T$ ($\pi$ is orthonormal afterall). This gives: $$\mu'^T=\mu^T\pi^T=\mu'^TP.$$ Since the Markov chain $P$ is assumed to be irreducible and aperiodic, it has a unique stationary distribution, which allows us to conclude $\mu'=\mu$. Thus if $P$ is left invariant under permutations of its rows and columns by $\pi$, this implies $\mu=\pi\mu$, i.e. $\mu$ is invariant under $\pi$. If you look at the individual coefficients, you get $\mu_i=\mu_{\pi^{-1}(i)}$.
