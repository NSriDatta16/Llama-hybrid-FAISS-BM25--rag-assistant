How would you add a step in the AccountController of Magento?

I need to add a tracking code to a Magento template, pretty simple, but I need it on the confirmation page when a user register, but when it does, he's redirected to the index page, as any user who log in. I think to add a step by override the account controller because there no such configuration (or I wasn't able to find it), but even if it's just a method override of confirmAction to handle the redirect, it doesn't look like the best way, because this redirect is called several time depending on several things and add session message. Any ideas?
