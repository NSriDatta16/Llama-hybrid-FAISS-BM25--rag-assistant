If you suspect that your system may not have a simple harmonic oscillation behaviour, but have more periodicities at different frequencies, then a Fourier transform may not even be the optimal method to find those frequencies â€“ some corrections are needed. For the optimal method, and also for quantifying the uncertainty about your results, I recommend Bretthorst's great text, Bayesian Spectrum Analysis and Parameter Estimation (Springer 1998), freely available on his website. The introductory chapter of that text gives you a complete answer, more complete than could be written here.
