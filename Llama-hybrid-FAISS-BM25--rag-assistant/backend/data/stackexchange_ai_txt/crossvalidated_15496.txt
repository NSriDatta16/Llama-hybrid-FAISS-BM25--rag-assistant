Imputing missing data for Likert scale variables

I am in the process of imputing data (two variables that are 3 point Likert type responses and items of both variables yield multiple subscales). While these variables are ordinal variables, given that they are summed and/or averaged to create subscales, is it appropriate to simply use the SPSS MVA to impute item scores then round up the values to create original response options (e.g. 0=never 1=sometimes 2=often)? What are the recommended ways of dealing with Likert type missing data?
