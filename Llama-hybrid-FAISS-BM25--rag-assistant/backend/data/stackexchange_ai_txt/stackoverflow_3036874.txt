Is existed web markup languages with possibility insert sql query?

Actually what I want - simple DB with simple User Interface. Like MS Access, but for web and it can be without Dragn n Drop, but described with markup language. For example if I want to create list report, then i need to write something like: It needed for simple data applications. In that kind application no programming logic required. Just working with DB. Changing DB data and showing it.
