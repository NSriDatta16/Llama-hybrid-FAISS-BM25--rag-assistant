IF your server is a Mac , then I recommend webkit2png , which is a short python program that leverages WebKit's Objective-C API to render an URL. Personally, I use it in combination with WWW::Mechanize to walk my development site and make screenshots of every page -- useful for testing functionality, showing clients and keeping screenshots up-to-date. The resulting screenshot is perfect, but sometimes very tall for long, scrolling pages. IF your server has a non-bare-bones Linux distro with KDE installed, then you might try khtml2png . I have not tried that myself, but saw it mentioned on the webkit2png page.
