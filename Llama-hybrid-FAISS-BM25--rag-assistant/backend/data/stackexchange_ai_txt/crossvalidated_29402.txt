It's not clear to me what you've graphed when you say "scatter plots between sales, R&D, and advertising". For example, have you done something like: library (lattice) xyplot (sale ~ xrd | year, groups=sicagg) xyplot (sale ~ xrd | sicagg, groups=year) Not sure what sicagg is; I assume it's a factor variable in my example. In your plot of advertising per industry, did you plot lines for the averages and points for the specifics, coded by industry? Density plots might also be useful: densityplot (~sale, groups=xrd) densityplot (~xad, groups=xrd) etc. Once you get complex and combine graph types, lattice gets complicated fairly fast, but it makes these kinds of plots easy.
