I believe I have identified the problem and come up with a fix. When you call the pam() function with a dissimilarity matrix as an argument the resulting pam object cannot save the original variable data, this is because we have only provided it with the derived distances. fviz_cluster() needs the original data to apply PCA and project the results onto 2D plane. We can fix the "missing" data problem by simply setting data array in the pam object to the original data and then call fviz_cluster() on the newly modified pam object. pamx$data fviz_cluster(pamx) This solution has worked for me. Unfortunately, I am unable to determine whether the PCA projection is useful/informative when clustering is based on correlation distances instead of euclidean distances.
