Random forest and ridge regression

Can we apply the concept of ridge regression in random forest for predicting the values in order to get more accurate results? Random forest using regression trees for the prediction. When there is a problem of multicollinearity we will use ridge regression. Multicollinearity definitely can affect variable importances in random forest models. To overcome those multicollinearity in random forest can we use the concept of ridge regression?
