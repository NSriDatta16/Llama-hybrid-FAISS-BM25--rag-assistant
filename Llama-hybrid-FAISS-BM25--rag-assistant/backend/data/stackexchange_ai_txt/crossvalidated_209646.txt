Delimitation: feed forward- and radial basis networks

I am trying to get myself involved with the topic of neural networks for the purpose of a GPGPU project at university. Now, Wikipedia distinguishes between "Feed forward neural networks" and "Radial Basis function networks". As far as I understood, the defining attribute of a feed forward network is that there are no loops involved, thus making the Radial Basis function network a subtype of the former. Is that correct? If not, why? I haven't found any explicit answer to that question and the fact that these two types are treated as equal on Wikipedia makes me doubt my comprehension.
