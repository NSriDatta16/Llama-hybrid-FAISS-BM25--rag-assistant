Try a seasonal ARIMA model. The auto.arima() function in the "forecast" package has an automatic algo. The function documentation points to a paper by Hyndman and Khandakar. There also exist seasonal differencing and seasonal unit root tests. These tests are called: Canova-Hansen, OSCB, HEGY and a little known one by Kunst (1997). Search for them in Google scholar. D. Osborne is well known in this field. There is also a great time series book by Phillip Hans Franses. You should be looking for a seasonal unit root and seasonal lags. It is also possible to have both a seasonal unit root and a non-seasonal unit root. Likewise, both seasonal lags and non-seasonal lags. Try an ETS model. It is implemented in the ets() function of the forecast package. Again, the documentation points to the literature.
