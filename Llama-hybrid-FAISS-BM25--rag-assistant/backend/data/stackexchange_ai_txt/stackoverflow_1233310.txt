Source Control Process - missing fixes

I am using Subversion and Subclipse for my source control and follow the process of having a main trunk and taking branches for versions. This works well and there are no major problems merging. However when there are significant changes to a file both in the trunk and the branch (unfortunately necessary) I have to manually edit the conflicts. The problem is that I am finding that I occasionally miss a bugfix or two. How do others handle this situation? Aside from paying more attention or employing someone with better eyesight; are there any other possible solutions? I add my JIRA references to any commits, however these then get lost in the merge. Thanks.
