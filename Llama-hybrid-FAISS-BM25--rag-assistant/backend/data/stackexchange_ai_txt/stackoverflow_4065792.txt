Use the primitive int type. It is 32 bit on all Java platforms; see JLS 4.2.1 . and yes, memory use has already been shown to be an issue here Well, if you say so. We don't know what you are doing here. But if you are concerned about the memory usage in representing huge numbers of IP addresses in memory, then maybe you need to: not keep the IP addresses in memory, increase your Java heap size, or (if necessary) up-size your hardware or operating system. Or maybe you've just gotten memory "wastage" out of proportion. Java is intrinsically memory hungry, and the pragmatic answer is to let it have what it wants. FOLLOW UP Java does not have an unsigned int type. But you don't need that to represent IP addresses, not least because you don't need to do arithmetic on them. (And even if you did, there are ways to do it. Bear in mind that if you want to squeeze the last ounce of memory "wastage" out of a Java application, you are going to need to do some ugly things.)
