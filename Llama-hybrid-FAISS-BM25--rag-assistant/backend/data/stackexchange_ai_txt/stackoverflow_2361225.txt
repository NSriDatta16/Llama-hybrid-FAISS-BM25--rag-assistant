Why malloc always return NULL

My dev environment is VS2008, DX9, Windows XP. I try to add protection handling to the out of memory case. When malloc return NULL, I would page some resource to disk, and release the resources in the memory. But sometimes, malloc always return NULL, even if I release most of resources and process memory usage and VM size is only 800MB in task manager. I think to use malloc to allocate 88 bytes should be fine, where process memory usage is only 800MB. But malloc always return NULL. Could this be memory fragmentation? It doesn't look like that, since process memory usage is not too much. alt text http://i.imagehost.org/0267/Snap2.jpg
