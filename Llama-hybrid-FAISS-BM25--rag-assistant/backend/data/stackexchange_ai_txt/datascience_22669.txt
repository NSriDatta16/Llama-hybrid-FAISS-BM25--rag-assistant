Yes, LSTMs are fairly used in time series prediction. They can even handle missing data which is quite common in timeseries: Learning to diagnose with LSTM recurrent neural network . Still, I don't recommend starting directly with LSTM as the training takes time and you have to try many parameters to find the best that fits your data. You should start with some basic regressors like RandomForest or XGBoost.
