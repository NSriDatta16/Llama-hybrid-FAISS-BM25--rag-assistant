To answer the easy question first, we do not have to execute the program unit. We have to compile it. That is relatively simple: SQL> alter session set plscope_settings='IDENTIFIERS:ALL' 2 / Session altered. SQL> alter function str_to_number_tokens compile 2 / Function altered. SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ', level*2, ' ') || name AS name, type, usage, usage_id, line, col 2 FROM user_identifiers 3 START WITH usage_context_id = 0 4 CONNECT BY PRIOR usage_id = usage_context_id; NAME TYPE USAGE USAGE_ID LINE COL ------------------------------ ------------------ ----------- ---------- ---------- ---------- STR_TO_NUMBER_TOKENS FUNCTION DECLARATION 1 1 10 STR_TO_NUMBER_TOKENS FUNCTION DEFINITION 2 1 10 P_STRING FORMAL IN DECLARATION 3 2 10 P_SEPARATOR FORMAL IN DECLARATION 4 3 13 P_SEPARATOR FORMAL IN ASSIGNMENT 5 3 13 RETURN_VALUE VARIABLE DECLARATION 6 6 5 REGEX_STR VARIABLE DECLARATION 7 7 5 REGEX_STR VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT 8 10 9 P_SEPARATOR FORMAL IN REFERENCE 9 10 31 REGEX_STR VARIABLE REFERENCE 10 17 46 P_STRING FORMAL IN REFERENCE 11 17 36 REGEX_STR VARIABLE REFERENCE 12 16 47 P_STRING FORMAL IN REFERENCE 13 16 37 REGEX_STR VARIABLE REFERENCE 14 12 57 P_STRING FORMAL IN REFERENCE 15 12 47 RETURN_VALUE VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT 16 14 22 RETURN_VALUE VARIABLE REFERENCE 17 19 16 17 rows selected. SQL> (Credit where credit is due, I took that query from my mate Tim Hall's Oracle-Base site ) Incidentally, note that PL/Scope operates on named PL/SQL programs (procedures, functions, packages, etc). It doesn't work on anonymous PL/SQL blocks. I mention this because you talk of "scripts" rather than programs. It won't do anything with a SQL script containing some PL/SQL blocks. The other thing to bear in mind is that PL/Scope populates tables on the SYSAUX tablespace, and can chew up a lot of storage. That's why it isn't run by default, and it's why we should use it judiciously. As for backwards compatibility: it is a new feature in 11g, and it is a compiler feature at that. So I doubt whether it is something you could just crowbar into a 10g install.
