As already stated, configuration nightmare and exceptions can be cryptic. You can enable tracing and use the trace log viewer to generally troubleshoot a problem but its definitely a shifting of gears to troubleshoot a WCF service, especially once you've deployed it and you are experiencing problems before your code is even executing. For communication between components within my organization I ended up using [NetDataContract] on my services and proxies which is recommended against (you can't integrate with platforms outside of .NET and to integrate you need the assembly that has the contracts) though I found the performance to be stellar and my overall development time reduced by using it. For us it was the right solution.
