Using a neural network to learn to distinguish blurry images?

Is it possible to train a neural network to detect whether an image is blurry or not? I'm currently using synthetically blurred images to build the classifier. However, I'm worried that this approach is not valid as we are using synthetic images. What are the challenges of using an approach like this?
