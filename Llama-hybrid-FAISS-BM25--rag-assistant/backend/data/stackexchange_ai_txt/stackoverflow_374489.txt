As someone who has to both hire and work with a variety of developers, I think that you need both breadth and depth. You need to know a wide range of technologies and platforms to show that you are flexible, can pick up new skills as needed, and are interested in broadening your knowledge. You also need one or two areas where you have deep knowledge, to show that you are capable of becoming an expert. I'd much rather hire someone who has a range of skills, but not necessarily the exact set of skills that I need, instead of someone who is an exact match, but can't learn anything new. One of the few certainties in development is that whatever we are doing today won't be the same thing as we are doing 5 years from now. As for C++, we are making heavy use of that in order to develop highly distributed agent based simulations. Think hundreds of millions of agents, tightly coupled across a couple of thousand machines. For this niche, we haven't found anything that beats C++.
