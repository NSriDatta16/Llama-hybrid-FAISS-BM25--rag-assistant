Clustering algorithms that require you to pre-specify the number of clusters are a small minority. There are a huge number of algorithms that don't. They are hard to summarize; it's a bit like asking for a description of any organisms that aren't cats. Clustering algorithms are often categorized into broad kingdoms: Partitioning algorithms (like k-means and it's progeny) Hierarchical clustering (as @Tim describes ) Density based clustering (such as DBSCAN ) Model based clustering (e.g., finite Gaussian mixture models , or Latent Class Analysis ) There can be additional categories, and people can disagree with these categories and which algorithms go in which category, because this is heuristic. Nevertheless, something like this scheme is common. Working from this, it is primarily only the partitioning methods (1) that require pre-specification of the number of clusters to find. What other information needs to be pre-specified (e.g., the number of points per cluster), and whether it seems reasonable to call various algorithms 'nonparametric', is likewise highly variable and hard to summarize. Hierarchical clustering does not require you to pre-specify the number of clusters, the way that k-means does, but you do select a number of clusters from your output. On the other hand, DBSCAN doesn't require either (but it does require specification of a minimum number of points for a 'neighborhood'—although there are defaults, so in some sense you could skip specifying that—which does put a floor on the number of patterns in a cluster). GMM doesn't even require any of those three, but does require parametric assumptions about the data generating process. As far as I know, there is no clustering algorithm that never requires you to specify a number of clusters, a minimum number of data per cluster, or any pattern / arrangement of data within clusters. I don't see how there could be. It might help you to read an overview of different types of clustering algorithms. The following might be a place to start: Berkhin, P.
