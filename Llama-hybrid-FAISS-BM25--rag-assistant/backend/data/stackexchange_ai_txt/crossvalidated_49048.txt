Markov chain model likelihood ratio test

Suppose I am using two Markov Chain Models, one with order $k=1$ and a second one with order $k=2$. I am "reducing" the higher order model to a $k=1$ model in order to have easier calculation possibilities. I train each model on the same data and also calculate the log likelihoods on the same data. Now I want to determine the log likelihood ratio test in order to make a model selection, as they are nested. To do so I need the LRT (which is straight forward) and the degrees of freedom. Currently, I am determining the df by calculating the difference between the parameters of the $k=2$ ($m^2(m-1)$) and the null model $k=1$ ($m(m-1)$). The problem now is that the degrees of freedom are very, very high and so I come up with a high p value all the time, which says that I should stick with my null model. I am unsure, if this is the right way to do so. The second order model is much sparser, so do I really need to calculate the worst case number of parameters, or can I make any limitations to that? Maybe someone can help me out with that. Cheers!
