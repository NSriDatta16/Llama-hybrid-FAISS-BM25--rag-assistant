few question about hand-writing recognition

hi i'm studing machine learning, and i want to write a simple handwriting recognition software with python and opencv. for simplicity now i'm going to recognize only capital words of same size. i think a good way to recognize letters is use expectation-maximization algorithm for learning parameters of a gaussian mixture model, use a training set and compare the new letters gaussian-mixture with the trained ones. but i don't understand how to select how many gaussian in the mixture. the second problem is how to understand how many words are in a page and how many letters there are in a word. i don't think that em-algorithm or similar (k-means for example) could be the solution but there are some segmentation issues for sure some advice?
