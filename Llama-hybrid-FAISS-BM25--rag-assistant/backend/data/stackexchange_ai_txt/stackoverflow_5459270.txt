jquery change different text in divs

Hallo, I have three different divs and a paragraph in each one of them. I would like to click on div 1 and text 1 changes - if I click on div 2, text 2 changes while text 1 is changing back to normal... Just the text in the div where I just clicked should change. Since I am a newbie to jquery I can just achieve that all the texts are changing, but not the single one. Who can help me? Thanks!
