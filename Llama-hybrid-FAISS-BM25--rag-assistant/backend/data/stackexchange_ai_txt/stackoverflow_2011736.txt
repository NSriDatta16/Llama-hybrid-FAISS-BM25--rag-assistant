Embedding a file into C# .NET application and then reading it in slowly?

I have a rather large resource (2MB) that I'm embedding into my C# application ... I want to know read it into memory and then write it to disk to use it for later processing? I've embedded the resource into my project as build setting Any sample piece of code will help me startup.
