I see two ways in here, first, when you are going to do it asynchonous request, you can measure how long this takes in an average (10secs) and use this value for measure how far are we now. Second way is more suitable for huge data uploads .. You would need the database and application support and upload the data using batches. Then you can measure how many data you have and how far are you in the submitting.
