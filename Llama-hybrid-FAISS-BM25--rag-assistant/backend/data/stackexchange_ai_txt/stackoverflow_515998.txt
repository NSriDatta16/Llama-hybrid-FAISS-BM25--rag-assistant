I think that the only way you would be able to do this is to process the TestNG XML output after the two runs. You should be able to collate the XML files from the two runs and combine it into a single HTML report using the Ant JUnit Report task . If you aren't happy with the output you get from this, it could be because TestNG organises its JUnit XML output oddly. You get better results (in my opinion) if you use the JUnitXMLReporter from my ReportNG project and run JUnit Report on that. Alternatively, you might be able to use this XSLT reporter for TestNG to combine the XML output from the two test runs into a single HTML report, though I've no idea if it supports this or not.
