First, you say "DTW distance as the metric". It is important to know that DTW is not a metric, it is only a measure. https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/DTW.pdf It is perfectly possible to use DTW for clustering (of any kind). The one thing that makes a big difference is setting the warping constraint. This seems hard, given the lack of labels. But there are ways to do this, see [a] In general, for clustering, no subsequcne is privilgled or special, so you want to use a classic symmetric implementation of DTW [a]. If scaiblity is an issue, then you should use LB_keogh pruining to speed things up. There are 128 nice test datasets here https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/ Email me is you need more help.
