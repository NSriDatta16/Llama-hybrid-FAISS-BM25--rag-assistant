You could follow the leader and user HTTP for that :) For instance in their AJAX API, they use it in conjunction with JSON ( or is it plain javascript ? ) Here is an example. For the following query: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/language/translate?v=1.0&q=hello%20world&langpair=en%7Cit&callback=foo&context=bar The complete output is this: HTTP/1.0 200 OK Date: Thu, 12 Feb 2009 05:13:31 GMT Content-Length: 97 Content-Type: text/javascript; charset=utf-8 Expires: Thu, 12 Feb 2009 05:13:31 GMT Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache X-Backend-Content-Length: 16 X-Embedded-Status: 200 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff Server: GFE/2.0 {"responseData": {"translatedText":"ciao mondo"}, "responseDetails": null, "responseStatus": 200} Of course the test is very simple, but using java the implementation could not be simpler that that. Of course it depends on your project needs, security, access control etc, but by using HTTP you can relay on a super tested protocol.
