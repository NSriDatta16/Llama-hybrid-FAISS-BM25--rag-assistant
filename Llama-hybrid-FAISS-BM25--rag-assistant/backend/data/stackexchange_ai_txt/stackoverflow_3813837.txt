Release early, release often. Criticism is a good thing as long as its constructive. Ignore the haters, pay attention to the folks filing bug reports and commenting. The internal structure of the code matters, but it matters more if it works for its intended purpose. In general, refactoring will change how code works internally but will not affect how it is used. Same inputs and outputs.
