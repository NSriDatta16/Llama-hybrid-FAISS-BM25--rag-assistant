Spending some tender time with Google, I found that automated grammar-based fuzz testing is hard , and a subject of current research. In particular, P. Godefroid at Microsoft Research is working on a piece of software called SAGE. I dug up a research paper by him. Automated Whitebox Fuzz Testing (joint work with Michael Y. Levin and David Molnar) Proceedings of NDSS'2008 (Network and Distributed Systems Security), pages 151-166, San Diego, February 2008. I also found the XML-based Peach software, but it is unclear to me on a casual reading how I might leverage it in an afternoon of work for a non-security application. So my conclusion is: "It's a subject of current (Apr '10) research and there's no quick-use tool out there".
