At first glance, this post looks like a serious case of premature optimization (some have said it is the root of all evil). Also, saying that your data storage is CMS-like but not a CMS seems rather... confused. Storing your content in a database does not make you CMS-like, it's the workflow of handling your content (the way you enter it through to how it is displayed for the final presentation) that makes a CMS, not the underlying mechanisms. That being said, it sounds like you are trying to optimize the data types in your tables, and that is just fine. For this sort of thing there is no better place to learn about MySQLs particulars than the documentation . After skimming through what's available to you, it will be much easier to make informed decisions about how to organize your different schema. Even so, do no constrain yourself too vigorously. Give yourself lots of room to breathe and grow, and if you find that your application has grown in a way that differentiates greatly from your original design path, you can revisit the issue then pretty easily. This type of optimization barely affects disk space even in the millions of rows per table, with dozens of tables, as long as you were even marginally close to your actual use case. For efficiency of queries, the best I can offer is using JOINs effectively to constraint how much data you are relating per query.
