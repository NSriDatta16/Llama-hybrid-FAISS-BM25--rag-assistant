Embedding youtube channels in android application

I want to be able to display a certain youtube channel's videos and allow the user to select one of their videos to watch. Do I have to do this manually (parse the source code of the webpage to get each individual video link and then display them) or can I use the youtube api? If anyone has done this, example code or tutorials would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
