It depends on what you mean by: expose it through OData The only way to access data in an Azure table is via the REST API which is all OData. So as long has you have the correct authentication details (which might be non standard, I haven't tried to use it this way), all of your tables are already exposed as OData. (the url should be http://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/mytable ) If you're looking to use Azure tables in a Visual Studio project, rather than accessing it via the API, generally it's easier to just use the storage client library . If you want to expose the data in a table using some form or authentication other than what is currently provided (maybe you want to make it available publicly without giving away your storage keys) you will have to create your own wrapper service to do this (similar to the method that is mentioned in the link provided by Gaurav)
