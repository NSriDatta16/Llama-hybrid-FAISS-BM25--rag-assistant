WPF UI control vendors - ActiPro, Telerik, Xceed, Infragistics, DevExpress and others

I have to choose a commercial WPF UI control library for our project. Browsing the web I have found these major vendors: Actipro : http://www.actiprosoftware.com/Products/DotNet/WPF/WPFStudio/Default.aspx Telerik : http://www.telerik.com/products/wpf.aspx Xceed : http://xceed.com/pages/TopMenu/Products/ProductSearch.aspx?Lang=EN-CA&Category=0617b4dd-af9a-4e34-a1a1-d1129237d614 Infragistics : http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf.aspx#Overview DevExpress : http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/OnlineDemos.xml There may be others, of course. My impression is that Actipro and Telerik give more controls than others. ActiPro, however, is the only one with WPF property grid control, which, as they claim knows to present the common properties of a multiple selection and allows to edit it. But, they lack the data grid and tree view controls, which Telerik has. The UI we have in mind will surely need the following controls: - Property Grid - Tree View - Data grid - Wizards Which means, that no single vendor can satisfy this list, because of the Property Grid control. My question is this - did anyone need to embed these controls in his/her app and how did (s)he manage it? BTW, by no means do we wish to implement any of the controls ourselves, so, please, do not propose it.
