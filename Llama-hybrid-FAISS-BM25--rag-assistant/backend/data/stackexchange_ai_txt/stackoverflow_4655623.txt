How to change public properties of User control?

I have a very simple user control in my web site project which has public property declarations as following public DateTime StartDate { get { return _startDate; } set { _startDate = value; } } public DateTime EndDate { get { return _endDate; } set { _endDate = value; } } When i drag the ascx file to one of my aspx page and when i go to code behind of aspx page i can access the controls properties through intelisense, but when i run the project through visual studio i get error "The name 'uctTest1' does not exist in the current context " any suggetions to fix the error? This is the line where Error shows when i run the project uctTest.StartDate = DateTime.Now; aspx page markup : aspx page code behind : protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!IsPostBack) { uctTest1.StartDate = DateTime.Now; } } protected void btnEdit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { }
