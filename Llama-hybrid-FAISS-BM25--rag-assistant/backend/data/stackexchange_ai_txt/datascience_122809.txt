How to apply supervised machine learning when the target variable depends on multiple rows (with varying number of rows)?

Here is a example dataset that resembles the one I am using. Let's call one row = one experiment. I'm trying to predict Y based on features X1 through X7 The problem I am facing is very similar to this one , in that the target Y to predict depends on several input rows (several experiments done the same day). But what is different in my case, is that the number of experiments (so the number of rows) varies from 1 to 9. By using the method suggested in the most upvoted answer (namely, concatenating the features for the same day so I have one row for 1 day, with 7*n_experiments features), I end up with a large dataframe of 100+ columns (I have more than 7 X features in the real dataset). Most importantly, by using this method, the last columns (representing the case of days with a lot of experiments, like 6,7,8,9 experiments on the same day) contains a lot of null values because those cases of days are pretty scarce (they are more days with 1-4 experiments than days with 8-9 experiments, so the latest columns are almost never filled with values). So by following the method of concatenating my X features to have 1 row = 1 day, I end up with a dataframe that is, to me, useless for my prediction problem. How would you approach this problem then?
