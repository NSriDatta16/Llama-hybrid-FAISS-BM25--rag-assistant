I am using C#. I am probably going to use XML but I am just learning and I wanted to know some alternatives. Basically, I wanted my program to be similar to a program like Office, where you add something and then save it to a file for future retrieval. If you were to look at the Office file in a text editor, it would be all garbled and I think it's binary. When you retrieve the file then, would it just be pulling in the info and saving it to a collection or something?
