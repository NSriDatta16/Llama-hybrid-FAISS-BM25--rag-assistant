I suggest subdomains, personally. I wouldn't include the mobile at all - use the useragent to determine this, and possibly a cookie incase the user wants to view the full site on their mobile (think how Flickr and Google do it). But for languages, yes - primary language at http://mydomain.com/ , secondary languages at i.e. http://de.mydomain.com/ or http://fr.mydomain.com/
