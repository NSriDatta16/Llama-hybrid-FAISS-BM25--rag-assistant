It would really help if you would specify the target OS. Though, the "easy enough for the average Joe to install" bit suggests Windows. :-) If my guess is right, have you looked at Microsoft SQL Server Compact 3.5 ? There are couple of features that might actually meet your needs: Free to use and distribute No administration required Single file, code free database format Support for ClickOnce, XCopy, MSI, CAB, and non-admin embedded installation options less than 2 MB of files to deploy and with no dependencies on back-end services If the name Microsoft by itself is enough to give you nightmares, there's also the SQLite server. I personaly have not used it and can't vouch how good it is. However, it is backed by big names like Adobe, Mozilla and Symbian, so I would assume it should be good enough for you needs too.
