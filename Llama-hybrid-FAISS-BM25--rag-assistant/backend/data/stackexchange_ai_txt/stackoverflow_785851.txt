Why is WPF application running in debug mode slow?

I know that running applications in DEBUG (build configuration) thru the visual studio adds a level of overhead but I have a WPF application that I am testing out that is painfully slow in its execution and other functions such as drag/drop of items. When I run the application in Release mode it performs like one would expect, very quickly and without hesitation. I've set up no special debugging parameters or any other watches, settings or breakpoints that would interrupt the application. Has anyone else run across an issue like this or is there possibly just some setting that can be adjusted? It's not really an issue more of a why is this happening... thanks.
