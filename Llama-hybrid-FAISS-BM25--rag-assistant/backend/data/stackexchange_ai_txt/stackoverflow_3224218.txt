I suggest looking into a client-side template system, like the mechanism discussed here: http://blog.reybango.com/2010/07/09/not-using-jquery-javascript-templates-youre-really-missing-out/ That approach would let you keep your CSS fragments separate from the code, which would be a lot cleaner. You'd put your CSS into blocks that have a "type" deliberately made so that the browser won't try to execute them.
