If you are only interested in distinguishing between the 1 and non-1 outputs, the standard method is indeed to build a binary classifier (e.g. a SVM or a Maxent model) that will attempt to divide the two classes based on the provided features. You do not need to delete examples (it's nearly always a bad idea to remove data, epecially when the data set is small). It's better to replace the values 2,...5 but a "not-1" value to simplity the problem to one of binary classification. You might want to use non-linear SVMs if the boundary between the two classes is particularly complex. If the numbers 1,2,...5 reflect some ordinal variable (i.e. if you are not really interested in the numbers per se, but rather in the relative ordering between data points), it might be worth looking at methods for "ordinal regression" instead of classification.
