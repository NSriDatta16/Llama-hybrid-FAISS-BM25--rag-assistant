Can we interpret a parameter's estimate if some of the other parameters haven't reach their stationary distributions (MCMC convergence)?

I tried to estimate parameters values in a simple mechanistic model via MCMC (adaptive Gibbs with jags). I have 27 parameters, but it looks like some of the estimates haven't reach their stationary distributions. I calculated the potential scale reduction factor to assess convergence but I sometimes have psrf > 1.2 (like 1.35 or 1.42). Can I still interpret some of my parameters values (for which psrf Thank you in advance ! PHen
