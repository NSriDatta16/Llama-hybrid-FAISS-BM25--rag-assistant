Photoshop does not allocate gigantic images in contiguous portions of memory as you are trying to do. There are some memory limitations I've encountered when creating very large images. Consider subdividing your images. This has the benefit of better memory management. If you edit one of your subdivided images, you won't have to update the entire image. As an aside, a 16000 x 16000 at 4 bytes per pixel is roughly a gigabyte! That's huge . Good luck!
