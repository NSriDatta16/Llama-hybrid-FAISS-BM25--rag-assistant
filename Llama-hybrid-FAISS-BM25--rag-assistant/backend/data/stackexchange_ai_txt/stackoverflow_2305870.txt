Difference between/use of dev.site.com and beta.site.com

Am trying to implement a few deployment policies in my organization. Usually, we do all the development on localhost and then simply deploy the site to the production site (i.e. site.com). Am trying to place a rule to first deploy the site to say beta.site.com, test it completely and then deploy it to the final site. Now I know many companies use dev.site.com, then beta.site.com and then finally site.com. Am wondering what exactly is the purpose of dev.site.com and then beta.site.com. Will be both be active at the same time or is it that during development we should use dev.site.com and then later beta.site.com? What exactly is the use of a staging server/site then? Please feel free to ask if anything is unclear. Thankyou for your time and patience.
