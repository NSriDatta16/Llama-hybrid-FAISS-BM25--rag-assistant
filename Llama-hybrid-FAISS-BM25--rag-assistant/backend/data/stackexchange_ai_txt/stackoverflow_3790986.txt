Get drop index in Silverlight drag / drop

This article shows how to implement a copy operation on a drop event. I'd like to do the same but I want my dropped item to appear in the collection according to where it was placed on the UI. So I need the StartIndex much like on a NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs when an ObservableCollection changes. In the article you'll see that eventually you get a SelectionCollection object whose items have an Index property. But unfortunately this is the index of the source collection (where it was picked) and not the destination collection (where it was dropped).
