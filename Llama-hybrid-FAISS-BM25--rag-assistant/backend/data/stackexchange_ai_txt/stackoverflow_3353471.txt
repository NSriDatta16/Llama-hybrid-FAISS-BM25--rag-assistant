Magento adding install object

I'm creating a module that let's you define some extra options for categorys in Magento, following this tuturial to get started: http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/0_-_module_development_in_magento/installing_custom_attributes_with_your_module I built on a skeleton module created with ModuleCreator. I have created Setup.php (with the capital) in Infoweb/Margins/Model/Resource/Eav/Mysql4/ and in it my class defined: class Infoweb_Margins_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Setup extends Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup{} I also added this line in my config.php(the rest was already there because of the skeleton module): Infoweb_Margins_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Setup Now when trying to load a page, magento searches for this class but gives a fatal error saying the class was not found ... Error: Fatal error: Class 'Infoweb_Margins_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Setup' not found in /home/users/A000456/xxx/xxx/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Resource/Setup.php on line 160 Thoughts on where the problem lies? Using Magento 1.4.1.0
