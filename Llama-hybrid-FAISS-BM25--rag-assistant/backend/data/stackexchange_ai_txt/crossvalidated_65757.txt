How to deal with a non-significant threshold value in ordinal regression in SPSS?

I am running an ordinal regression in SPSS. I have independent variables on nominal and ordinal scales. My dependent variable is ordinal, indicating a level of action, coded 0, 1, 2. Unfortunately, I currently don’t know how to deal with the non-significance of a threshold level for my dependent variable indicated by SPSS in the parameter estimates table. The SPSS output of the parameter estimates looks like this: Threshold Level of action = 0 Estimate = .6 Sig. = .143 Threshold Level of action = 1 Estimate = 2.2 Sig. = .000 Independent variables … I read that “ non-significance of a threshold suggests that the cutting point is not truly different and therefore some levels of the dependent variable need to be combined ” (Garson, G. D. (2012). Ordinal Regression. Asheboro, NC: Statistical Associates Publishers). I have not come across such a statement before. Also some ordinal regressions I had a look at did not mention an issue regarding a non-significant threshold and interpreted the output nonetheless. So now I am wondering how severe that issue is. If I stick with ordinal regression, how would this non-significant threshold impact my results (given all other assumption are met)? Would they still be valid? Or does this mean that I definitely have to combine the outcome categories 0 and 1, which basically would mean I need to run binary logistic regression instead of ordinal regression?
