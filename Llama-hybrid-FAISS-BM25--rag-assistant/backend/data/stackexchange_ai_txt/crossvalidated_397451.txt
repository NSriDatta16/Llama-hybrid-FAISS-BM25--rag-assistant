What are the units of a medcouple?

Let's say I have a distribution of some weights in kg. I want to estimate the skewness of this distribution using a robust statistic, the medcouple [ G. Brys; M. Hubert; A. Struyf (2004). A robust measure of skewness. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 13(4), 996-1017.] Could you help me with the units of the medcouple measure? In this example, are they kg or 1/kg or kg $^2$ or something else, or does it have no units?
