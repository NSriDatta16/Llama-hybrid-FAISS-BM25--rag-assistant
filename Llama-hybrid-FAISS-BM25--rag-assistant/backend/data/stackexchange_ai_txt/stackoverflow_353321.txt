I would argue that IntelliSense is a vital tool for a product as comprehensive and complex as the .NET Framework. With literally thousands of types, there is no way any developer could hope to memorise even a small subset of them without recourse to some sort of help system. Better to have it available as you type than via F1 in my opinion ;) Microsoft's IntelliSense, coupled with the design of the Framework and tools like FxCop mean that you have a (mostly) consistent development framework that you can leverage to develop your own software more quickly and with better organisation. Compared with, say, developing with VB 6, it certainly is a brave new world, but I think Microsoft has stood on the shoulders of giants and produced an excellent - if sometimes overwhelming - successor.
