Bayesian updating with continuous prior in continuous time

I am considering an example where a person flips his (unfair) coin to examine what is the probability of getting head. I could find some posts saying that the posterior distribution follows Beta distribution in discrete time. Would there be a formula for continuous time as well? Thank you.
