Why don't you want to stick to relational table model as a basis if you're using a model driven approach? It sounds quite reasonable in this case. If you had your RDMS agnostic model (in DDL, like CREATE TABLE... ), you could leverage any language's tools to deal with it (generate source code and so forth). I agree that inheritance in DDL is quite cumbersome, but it is still possible (e.g., see this article )
