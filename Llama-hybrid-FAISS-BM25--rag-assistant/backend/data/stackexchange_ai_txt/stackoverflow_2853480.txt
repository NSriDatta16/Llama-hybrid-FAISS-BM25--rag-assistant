It turns out there was no problem in the code at all. The reason it was crashing was that Xcode was trying to attach the debugger to the release build for some reason! We are still trying to figure out why, because we have checked the most obvious places, but I'm sure it won't be too hard to track down. The build works fine if you install from iTunes or the Xcode organizer instead of building and running from Xcode directly, so it won't affect your end-users at all, as long as you are careful to check for other first-run issues.
