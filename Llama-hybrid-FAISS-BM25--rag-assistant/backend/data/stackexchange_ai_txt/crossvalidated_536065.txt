Include or discard non-significant coefficients in the total Y estimate/calculation?

In Y= b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3 x1 * x2 where e.g. b1 is not significant. What is the correct estimate (calculation) for Y? Since b1 is not significantly different from 0, wouldn't a correct interpretation be the exclusion of said parameter b1x1? That is, despite b_1 changing the resulting Y estimate if included in the total estimation/calculation for Y. Note: "Include" here refers to inclusion of the non-significant coefficient in the sum of coefficients to calculate the overall estimate Y . That is, the model that is run to reach said estimates remains unchanged. More specifically, working with a logistic regression where b = log(OddsRatio) , including the non-significant OR of b1 changes the resulting OR interpretation. Example: b1 and b2 are the coefficients for binary, dummy-coded factors. Note, coefficients in OR. Hence OR*OR instead of logOR+logOR. 1.7(b1) * 1.5(b2) * 0.5(b3-interaction)= 1.28 1.7(b1) * 0.5(b3-interaction) = 0.85 Taking the non-significant effect into account, the estimated change in odds is a factor of 1.28 (an increase from the reference group). On the other hand, excluding said non-significant effect, the resulting odds ratio is 0.85 (hence, a decrease compared to the reference group). Consequently the question: Should non-significant estimates be included in the calculation? Given the coefficient is non-significant it should not (reliably) change the estimate either way. I would thus assume b=0 / OR=1. Is that not correct? Since the non-significant model coefficient is in fact not b=0 / OR=1, I wonder if I would insensibly alter the Y estimate if I discard the non-significant coefficient. Discarding here refers to including a NULL input, hence, b=0 / OR=1, which would simply not take into account any effect of said coefficient. Yet, again, I wonder if that would insensibly/incorrectly alter the estimate Y. Perhaps someone could help clarify the role of non-significant coefficients in a model when estimating Y, and how one should interpret/deal with such non-significant coefficients when calculating the estimate Y. Thank you!
