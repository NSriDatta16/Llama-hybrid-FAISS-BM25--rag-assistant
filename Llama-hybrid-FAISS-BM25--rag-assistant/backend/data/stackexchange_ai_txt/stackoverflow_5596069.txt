Happened to me too. Basically there is a new CR for VS 2010 that you need to install it manually. It used to be come in the box with VS but not for VS2010. You need to do code changes. Word of caution to pay attention to the 64 or 32 bit CR. You can download it http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/crystalreports-dotnet
