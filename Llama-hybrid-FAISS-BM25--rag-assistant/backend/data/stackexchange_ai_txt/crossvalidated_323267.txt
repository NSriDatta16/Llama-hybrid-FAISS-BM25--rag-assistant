SparkML has EM (Expectation Maximization) with Gaussian Mixture which can be used for anomaly detection . Apart from that, if you run on Spark, you could try H2O, just googling returns a bunch of results on anomaly detection using H2O. For example in H2O you can train autoencoders - the H2O Deep Learning documentation booklet illustrates them with such application.
