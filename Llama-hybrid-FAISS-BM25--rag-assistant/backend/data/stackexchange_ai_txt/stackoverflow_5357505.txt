How to Detect a TouchScreen Phone for Mobile Site

I have two mobile pages, One designed for touchscreen phones and one designed for non-touchscreen phones. I need to detect and redirect based on which type. I'm trying to brainstorm here. I thought about possibly detecting screen resolution and using that but phones like the Blackberry Bold (non-touch but with 480x320 display) don't fit into that rule. The obvious solution is to maintain two lists of user agents and use them to redirect. The problem is, it would be pretty time consuming to create those lists. I also imagine that once I start looking into it there would run into all sorts of exceptions where a browser like opera mini is on two sets of phones (one touch and one non-touch). If this is my only option, any idea where to start with gathering the data about the phones? var touchScreenRegEx = new RegExp("(ipod|iphone|opera mini)"); var noTouchScreenRegEx = new RegExp("(blackberry|palm)"); var userAgent=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); if (userAgent.match(touchScreenRegEx)) { window.location = "/mobile/touch/"; } else if(userAgent.match(noTouchScreenRegEx) { window.location = "/mobile/no-touch/"; } Any Suggestions?
