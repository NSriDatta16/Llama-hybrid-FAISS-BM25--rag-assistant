As stated by @podludek as long as you have a hidden layer your neural network should be able to learn label correlations. There is also indeed a risk that your neural network learns deterministic rules of label co-occurence, by "assigning" some hidden units to some particular label sets. One way to alleviate this would be to use dropout, to force your neural network to learn general representations of your examples rather than making a deterministic encoding of some specific training data points. You can for instance refer to this paper investigating this label correlation with NNs on text data. So in a nutshell: yes NNs can inherently capture some multilabel correlations. Still, there exist several methods to help them capture the correlations better, and as always in ML, there's no free lunch and you will have to try and check what works best for your setting.
