Drupal 7 - Update node fields via ajax/frontpage

I have a few jQueryUI draggable objects that represent nodes generated on my front page in Drupal. I want to grab when a user drops an element and save the x/y coordinates to the server so when the next user opens the page it will still be where it was last left at. I created two integer fields, homex and homey, but I can't seem to figure out or find enough documentation to learn how to tell Drupal to update the values for a given node. I'm fairly familiar with how to create modules in Drupal, and ajax in general - but combining the two in this case is perplexing me. Can someone help me understand how to attach to Drupal so I can save the coordinates dynamically? What would be preferable is if I could just write a simple handler module for Drupal that takes the x/y pair in a get/post request then updates them in the database and responds with a success/json. Really if it wasn't being done in Drupal this would be a fairly simple setup.
