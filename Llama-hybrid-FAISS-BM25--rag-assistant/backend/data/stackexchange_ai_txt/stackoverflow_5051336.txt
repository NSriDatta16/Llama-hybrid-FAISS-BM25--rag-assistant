2nd question - it looks like combobox inside and outside of dataform receives different DataContext and hence trying to locate Departments properties on different sources. It is not clear how to fix it since you haven't shown most of your ViewModels. Pay attention to the VS output window, it usually provides very detailed info regarding binding errors and I'm assuming there are binding errors in your case. Try modifying your department related bindings in following way: Where localViews should be an xml-namespace for departmentTechManager.Views . Try the same trick for SelectedItem binding.
