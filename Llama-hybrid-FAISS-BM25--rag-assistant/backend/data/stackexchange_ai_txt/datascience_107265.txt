1/0 and 1/2 binary columns are treated equally when training deep learning models?

Usually when I have columns that are binary I do not perform any transformation since it is already one-hot encoded. What happens when binary column consist of two values but are not 1/0? Would column with 1/2 have greater impact on learning?
