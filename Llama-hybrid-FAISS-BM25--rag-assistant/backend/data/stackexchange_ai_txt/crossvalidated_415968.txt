I would take a different approach. You have a "before" score and an "after" score for each subject. You can find the distribution of score changes by subtracting the "before" score from the "after" score. If you find a significant improvement of 2.2 sentences (significantly different from zero), you can phrase that in terms of percent improvement: 2.2/30 = 7.33 percentage points average increase. This relies on the fact that each subject evaluates ten sentences. If some evaluated ten sentences and some evaluated nine (or if there were more sentences evaluated after the training), this would not work. If you decide to examine the proportions directly, then your setup calls for paired testing. The first test that you described is not a paired test but a two-sample test. The regular two-sample t-test of means or two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of general distribution equality would apply in that setting. In your example, it would mean that students $X_1,\dots,X_{30}$ are not treated, but thirty separate students $Y_1,\dots,Y_{30}$ are treated before they evaluate the sentences for errors. Since you measure $X_1,\dots,X_{30}$ before the treatment and then again after the treatment, you have dependence between the two groups.
