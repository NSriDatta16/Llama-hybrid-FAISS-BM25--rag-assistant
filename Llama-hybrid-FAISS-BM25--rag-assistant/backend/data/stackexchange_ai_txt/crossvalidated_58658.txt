Luce choice axiom, question about conditional probability

I'm reading Luce (1959) . Then I found this statement: When a person chooses among alternatives, very often their responses appear to be governed by probabilities that are conditioned on the choice set. But ordinary probability theory with its standard definition of conditional probability does not seem to be quite what is needed. An example illustrates the difficulty. When deciding how to travel from home to another city, your choice may be by airplane (a), bus (b), or car (c). Let A, B, C denote the uncertain states of nature associated with form of travel. Note that if one elects c all of the uncertainties of A and B remain because planes fly and buses run whether or not you are on them. However, if you elect either a or b , then your car remains in the garage and the set C is radically altered from when the car is driven. So there really is no universal event underlying the sources of uncertainty. The choice axiom of chapter 1 was introduced as a first attempt to construct a probability-like theory of choice that by-passed the fixed, universal sample space assumption. source: http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Luce's_choice_axiom For me the probability measure is defined with the triplet $\Omega$, the sample space, a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ and finally a measure $P$. With respect to the foregoing example what seems to be the problem if I define: $\Omega = \{ \text{bus}, \text{car}, \text{airplane} \}$ One crucial assumption in common statistics is the ceteris paribus condition. Is this the reason we need to adjust basic probability theory in the context of choice behavior because the c.p. assumption is violated?
