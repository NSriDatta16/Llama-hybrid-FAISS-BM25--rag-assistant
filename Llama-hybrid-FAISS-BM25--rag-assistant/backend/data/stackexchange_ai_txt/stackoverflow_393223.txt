Tools for a lone developer setup?

I'm a lone developer who would like to get some structure to my projects. My hardware setup is a laptop running windows XP and a desktop running Ubuntu that acts as a storage server. I currently use Mercurial as my source control system with my working copy of the repository stored on my laptop and clone the repository to the Ubuntu machine every couple of days as a backup. What other tools would you recommend for a lone developer to do things such as bug tracking, project planning, etc? I'm looking for something simple that either has to run on windows or as a web app on Apache.
