Sounds like there is nothing you can do about it (except copy the data to a table with matching data types), so I'm not sure what to say. It will have an impact on performance, but probably not nearly as bad as converting from varchar or double. If your primary key is int and this is meant to be a foreign key bigint, then the bigint should never hold anything outside of the range of int, so the option of casting the bigint down to int (instead of upcasting from int to bigint) is never going to product a problem. Also, depending upon your query and its execution plan, the performance hit might be minimized - depending on things like direction of join, inner or outer join, cardinality/statistics, which indexes are available, etc.
