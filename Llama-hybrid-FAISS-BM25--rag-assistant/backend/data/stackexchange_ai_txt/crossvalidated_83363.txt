Bayes factor calculation

I am a newbie to Bayesian stats... I came across an article for calculating Bayes factor by rounder etal.. In this article how am I supposed to put t value..n scale r on effect size parameters. If you could help me with a specific example it would be a great help.. I have 2 groups in my sample group A sample size 110, mean 112.76, SD 30 group B sample size 89, mean 100.4, SD 28 What are t value ( is it by routine t test ?) and scale effect for r size in this case..and how can I calculate them Further how do we interpret the output..accompany article is a bit inaccessible to me because of my non mathematical ground...if anyone could explain..how can I interpret these ratios..?
