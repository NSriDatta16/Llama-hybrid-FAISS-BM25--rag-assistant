XERGM R-package: GOF error with bipartite, temporal ERGM

I was able to estimate the following temporal, bipartite ERGM using the xergm package in R: require(xergm) model1 When I try to estimate the goodness-of-fit (GOF) for the model using the xergm gof command, the following error appears: gof(model1) Error in MHproposal.formula(constraints, arguments = control$MCMC.prop.args, : The combination of class (c), model constraints (), reference measure (Bernoulli), and proposal weighting (default) is not implemented. Check your arguments for typos. My hunch is that the previous error relates to a problem with the way I specified the model for the goodness-of-fit. I used the data.table package to construct the adjacency matrix, so it may be that xergm and data.table are not working well together.
