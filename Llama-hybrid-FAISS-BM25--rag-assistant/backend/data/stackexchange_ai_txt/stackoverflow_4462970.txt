Changes need to be persisted somewhere. If there is no database, there is no where to save those changes. As Shurdoof mentioned, you can save them in cookies, but if the user has cookies disabled, or if they clear them later, then all the changes will be lost, and this will not be a reliable solution. Short answer, this is not possible with Javascript/jQuery. EDIT :With HTML 5, you may want to look into local storage .
