Advances in Financial Machine Learning is a good reference for practical usage of ML in the context of financial time series. Basically : Formulating your label in term of level attained in a given amount of time (see chapter 3 barrier method) will help you build practical and realistic strategies. Unless you are doing some market making, you usually don't care about the price at the next ticker. For application you might need to go further and use meta labeling (ie. two algo, one to predict the trend, one to predict the amount to bet). Regarding feature building, you often go with stationnary processes, that you obtain trough fractionnal differenciation (getting rid of noise without getting rid of information), instead of integer differenciation (0: price, 1: return). See Chapter 5 - Fractionnaly differentiated features. As mentionned by others, there are complex mechanisms at play, and numerous actors on the market such that any meaningfull price prediction will be taken advantage of and nearly immediatly corected. That's why whitout external/original/new info, you won't get meaningfull prediction (and why underlying are often modelled as randow walks with drift for option pricing). Basically you need external info to predict price movement. See here for an exemple where tweets are used ( financial-tweets ). So generally speaking, when using ML for Finance you just don't predict next price from past prices. There is barely any value in doing that. The exception might be in HFT when you are trying to predict price change from limit order book, but that is a very specific case. And, to answer your general question, there is no easy way to deal with it : any 'easy' solution has already been implemented and has been optimised to the point it is difficult to compete.
