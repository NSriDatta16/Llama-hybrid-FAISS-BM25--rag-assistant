The database stores the value indexed as a B-Tree key, and the record pointer as a B-Tree value. Whenever you search for a record holding a certain value of an indexed column, the engine locates the key holding this value in the B-Tree , retrieves the pointer to the record and fetches the record. What exactly is a "record pointer", depends on the storage engine. In MyISAM , the record pointer is an offset to the record in the MYI file. In InnoDB , the record pointer is the value of the PRIMARY KEY . In InnoDB , the table itself is a B-Tree with a PRIMARY KEY as a B-Tree key. This is what called a "clustered index" or "index-organized table". In this case, all other fields are stored as a B-Tree value. In MyISAM , the records are stored without any special order. This is called "heap storage".
