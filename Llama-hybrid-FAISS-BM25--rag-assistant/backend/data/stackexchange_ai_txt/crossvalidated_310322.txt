Approaches to forecasting hundreds of time series at once

I have several hundred time series that I need to forecast for. Some of these time series have a machine id number in common and provide somewhat similar behavior. Some of the time series are also for periodic daily, monthly and yearly values (not necessarily the same series that have the same machine ID). I have two questions I am thinking over: 1) How to leverage common information for those time series that have the same machine ID (or other another type of clustering) 2) If I am measuring my performance for all the series as a whole by averaging their RMSE, what is the best way to go about validation? My thoughts so far: For 1) Develop a meta model for series with similar machine ID's. Use a smoothing parameter in an additive model for the individual time series predictions. For 2) For ease of coding do k-fold cross-validation of samples from the following: series1[1:t] --> series1[t:t+h] series2[1:t] --> series2[t:t+h] ... seriesN[1:t] --> seriesN[t:t+h] The other obvious choice would be step-wise cross-validation of each time series and the average the cross-validated scores from all models. This is not only more complex from a computational standpoint, but also this strategy seems to focus more on how each individual prediction performs as opposed to my strategy towards modeling all the series as a whole. Thanks for the help.
