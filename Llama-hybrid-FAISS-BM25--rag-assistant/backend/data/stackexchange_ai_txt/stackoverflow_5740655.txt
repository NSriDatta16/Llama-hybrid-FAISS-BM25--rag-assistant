Dragging and dropping TreeViewItems in non-clickable area of TreeView [WPF]

A question about dragging and dropping tree view items in WPF. My original question is a little complex. So I simplified it, and here is the code: XAML And code-behind: public partial class Window1 : Window { public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void TreeNode_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this, DateTime.Now.ToString(), DragDropEffects.Move); } } private void TreeNode_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { string str = (string)e.Data.GetData(typeof(string)); MessageBox.Show(str); } } So what I want to do is very simple, just pop up a message box when one tree view item is dragged and dropped on another tree view item. When I drop it right on another item, it works fine, like this: But if I drag it slightly off the boundary of the item, it does not work, like this: The mouse cursor is displayed as a “forbidden sign”, sorry I can’t get it in the screen shot. So now my question is: how to make the second condition work? How to make the Drop event still fire up when the dropping location is slightly off the boundary of the item? Thanks in advance.
