The coefficients returned by function marginal_coefs() in GLMMadaptive are on the linear predictor scale, i.e., in the same scale as the coefficients you obtain directly from mixed_model() or glmer() of lme4 . The difference is in the interpretation of these coefficients. The coefficients that have the problematic interpretation are the ones directly returned from mixed_model() and glmer() because they have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. On the contrary, the coefficients you get from marginal_coefs() have the usual population interpretation you expect to get from a model. In your example, lets take the coefficient for YEAR . From both glmer() / mixed_model() and from marginal_coefs() this coefficient denotes the difference in the log expected counts for a year increase for CONDITION set to the reference level. But the key difference is for which expected counts are we talking about. In particular, in glmer() / mixed_model() these are the expected counts conditional on the random effect, i.e., for a specific ENTITY_ID ; in marginal_coefs() these are the expected counts across entities. To give another example say that you have put sex into your model, with levels male and female. From glmer() / mixed_model() you would get the coefficient that would tell you what would be the difference in the log expected counts if a subject changed sex (i.e., conditional on the random effect; most often not what you want). Whereas from marginal_coefs() you would get the difference in the log expected counts between the group of males and the group of females (i.e., averaged over the subjects, what you typically want).
