It is very unlikely that POS tags on the input would improve representation from BERT or similar models. A linear classifier based on BERT is the state-of-the-art POS tagger, BERT already has all the information about POS tags a model can possibly have. The tags you would provide to the model as the input would be Either from BERT (so it will not bring any new information); or Worse than what BERT can do on its own and therefore probably useless.
