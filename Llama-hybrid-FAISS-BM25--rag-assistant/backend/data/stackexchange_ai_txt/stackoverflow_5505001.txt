Boy, this has me running a little scared. I have an app that has both non-consumables and subscriptions. The subscriptions give user access to a cloud account where they can store content captured on their iPhone. During the subscription creation process, they create an account online. It is not for the purpose of purchasing the subscription that they register, but for the subsequent use of the cloud storage. Does this sound like it could be a problem with Apple? I'd hate to have come this far and find my entire business model is screwed because of their policies.
