I believe that the problem is with your guess that the inverse gamma is so easily extended to the multivariate case. From the distributions appendix of Gleman et al, Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd Edition), 582 The Inverse- Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior distribution for the multivariate normal co-variance matrix. ... The Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior distribution for the inverse co-variance matrix in a multivariate normal distribution and is a multivariate generalization of the gamma distribution. I'm uncertain whether you'd like to proceed in your own investigation with this hint, or if you'd like me to spill the beans and post a full solution. (Though, turning to page 73 of the same text, we find the particular underlying algebra that you're interested in.)
