Ajax is asynchronous . The onSuccess callback is called later, after the validateField function has been finished. The return true will vanish into thin air. You would have to either make your call synchronous - I'm sure MooTools has a setting for it - but that is highly discouraged, as it can freeze the browser. Or, this is the better alternative, change your code so that everything relevant happens in the onSuccess callback.
