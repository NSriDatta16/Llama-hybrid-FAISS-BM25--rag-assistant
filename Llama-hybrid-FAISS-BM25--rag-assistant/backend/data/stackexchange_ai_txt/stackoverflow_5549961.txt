My guess is your server is not configured to display errors while your debug environement is. Check the php documentation : error_reporting and display_errors Your dev server should be configured as to display errors ( error_display=On in your php.ini) and the level of error reporting should be E_ALL | E_STRICT . On your real server, errors should not be displayed but logged in a file instead. And I encourage you to use the error and exception handlers to display some usefull message to your user when some fatal error occur.
