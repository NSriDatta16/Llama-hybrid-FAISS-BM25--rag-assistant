My team and I recently experienced a similar problem. We used a Random Forest to be able to predict between 10 authors with about an 82% accuracy, as the number of users went up the accuracy went down. We were then asked to try and identify a new author which we implemented by creating a dynamic threshold for votes from the individual trees in forest. With the new user identification and 10 authors we were at about 65% accurate. We were working with twitter data also, so our document sets were fairly small. I have seen documentation where other teams have simply used the count of stop words in documents and a random forest that was 80% accurate, they weren't trying to identify a new user however. In your situation, breaking up your problem into two different problems might yield better results. First identify if the new document belongs to any of your known users and if it does then try and decide which one.
