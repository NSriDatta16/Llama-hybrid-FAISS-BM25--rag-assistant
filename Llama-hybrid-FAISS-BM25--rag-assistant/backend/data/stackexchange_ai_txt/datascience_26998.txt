solving quadratic equations using machine learning?

I am attempting to solve quadratic equations using machine learning. I tried to write code using mxnet but fails because it is using linear regression while my problem is non-linear (as far as I know). It is possible to predict the solution for arbitrary equations provided the at least one real root exists?
