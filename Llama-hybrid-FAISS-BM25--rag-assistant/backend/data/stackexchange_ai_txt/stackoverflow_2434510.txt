Organize them into a [Safe|Unsafe]NativeMethods class . Mark the class as internal static . If you need to expose them to your own assemblies, you can use InternalsVisibleTo - though it'd be more appropriate if you could group related ones into each assembly. Each method should be static - I honestly wasn't aware you could even mark instance methods with DllImport . As a first step - I'd probably move everything to a Core assembly (if you have one), or create a Product.Native assembly. Then you can find dupes and overlaps easily, and look for managed equivalents. If your p/invokes are a mess, I don't suspect you have much in the way of layering in the other assemblies that will guide your grouping.
