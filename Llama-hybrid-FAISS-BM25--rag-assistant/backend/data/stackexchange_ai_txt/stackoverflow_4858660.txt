Pattern matching is definitely a language feature. That said, because writing control flow structures in Scala is so easy (and pattern matching is robust), you could easily write your own match (compared to other languages). match , on the other hand, is still a part of the language core (I think), but it behaves much more like something in the library. It feels so organic because of how powerful pattern matching is. That said, yeah, you could definitely rewrite match .
