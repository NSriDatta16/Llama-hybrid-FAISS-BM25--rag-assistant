Time Series prediction using LSTMs: Importance of making time series stationary

In this link on Stationarity and differencing , it has been mentioned that models like ARIMA require a stationarized time series for forecasting as it's statistical properties like mean, variance, autocorrelation etc are constant over time. Since RNNs have a better capacity to learn non-linear relationships ( as per given here: The Promise of Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting ) and perform better than traditional time series models when the data is large, it is essential to understand how stationarized data would affect its results. The questions I need to know the answer of are as follows: In case of traditional time series forecasting models, stationarity in time series data makes it easier to predict, why and how? While building a time series prediction model using LSTMs , is it important to make the time series data stationary? If so, then why?
