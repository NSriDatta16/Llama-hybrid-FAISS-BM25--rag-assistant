Adding Child items to DevExpress XtraNavBar

I am using the XtraNavBar from DevExpress and I would like to figure out how to add a child item to an existing item. I have added Groups and Items to those Groups but I have been unable to figure out how to add child items to the Items. Has anyone else done this? Can it be done either through code or any other way? (for reference) Product Page Feature Page Edit I found ONE way to do this, HERE , but I was hoping there was another way, I guess. Building a separate control ( TreeView I'd guess ) and embedding it was not the answer I was HOPING for.....
