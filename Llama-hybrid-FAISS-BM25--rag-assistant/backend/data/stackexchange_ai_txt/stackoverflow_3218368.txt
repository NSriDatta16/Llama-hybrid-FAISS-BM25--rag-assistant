Even if you packaged your web site up into an executable with its own bundled browser, you would only be obfuscating your source. A determined hacker could still retrieve your JavaScript. If you want a closed-source executable, write a closed-source executable in a client-side programming language. Like C, C++, or Java. Making a web page into an executable is a gigantic leap backwards for functionality. The executable will be much larger, less flexible, and hungrier for both RAM and CPU time. Also, bolding your question does not make it easier to get an answer.
