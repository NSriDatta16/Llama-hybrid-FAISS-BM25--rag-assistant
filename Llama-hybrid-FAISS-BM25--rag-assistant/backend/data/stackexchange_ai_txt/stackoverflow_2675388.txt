Detect if a table contains a column in Android/sqlite

So I have an app on the market, and with an update I want to add some columns to the database. No problems so far. But I want to detect if the database in use is missing these columns, and add them if this is the case. I need this to be done dynamically and not just after the update to the new version, because the application is supposed to still be able to import older databases. Normally I would be able to use the PRAGMA query, but Im not sure how to do this with Android. I cant use execSQL since it is a query, and I cant figure out how to use PRAGMA with the query()-function. Ofcourse I could just catch exceptions and then add the column, or always add the columns to each table before I start to work with it, but that is not a neat solution. Cheers,
