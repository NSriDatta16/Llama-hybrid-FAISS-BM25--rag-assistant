You really have to use the try..catch method. It may be less elegant, but it's foolproof. If there is more than one client updating this table, then another client may insert a record between your check and your insert. You can still check if you want to, to save trying to do the insert needlessly. It might be a small performance increase if that's what you're worried about, but only if there is a duplicate. But every time there isn't a duplicate, you've paid a performance penalty by doing both a SELECT and an INSERT. Anyway, what are the odds that there will be a constraint violation? Probably small, so why bother with the check?
