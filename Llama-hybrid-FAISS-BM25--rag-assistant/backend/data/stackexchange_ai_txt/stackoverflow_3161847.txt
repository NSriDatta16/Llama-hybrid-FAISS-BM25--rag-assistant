Is standardizing the email address on every record as we search through too expensive on the db? Yes. Even if this table takes less than 8 pages of storage space, Yes, it is too expensive. Do you need to track the email address in all the myriad forms entered by the users? If so, having the second "clean" column is perhaps ugly, but probably necessary. (Creating a calculated column based on your function would perform as poorly as the original soluation.) If you do not need to maintain the addresses precisly as entered (each time) by the users, why not: Clean the existing data using your function, e.g. UPDATE... set EmailCol = dbo.STANDARDIZE_EMAIL(EmailCol) Apply the rule to clean email addresses whenever they are added to the database
