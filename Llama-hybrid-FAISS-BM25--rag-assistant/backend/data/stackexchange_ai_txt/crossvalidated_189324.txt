PCA works on the raw data, not on the similarity matrix. I.e. in applies eigendecomposition on the $\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ covariance matrix (or SVD on the data matrix), whereas spectral clustering decomposes the double-centered similarity matrix (which is $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ ) using eigendecomposition. I.e. they have a common mathematical operation, but are not that similar. Some links between k-means and PCA have been discussed (see Wikipedia, and questions here) but may be not too strong. PCA components will (at least for $k=2$ and maybe $k\leq d$ ) provide a useful initial estimate of the cluster centers, but at a rather high computational cost.
