Converting an empty string into nil in Ruby

I have a string called word and a function called infinitive such that word.infinitive would return another string on some occasions and an empty string otherwise I am trying to find an elegant ruby one line expression for the code-snippet below if word.infinitive == "" return word else return word.infinitive Had infinitive returned nil instead of "", I could have done something like (word.infinitive or word) But since it does not, I can't take advantage of the short-circuit OR Ideally I would want 1) a single expression that I could easily embed in other code 2) the function infinitive being called only once 3) to not add any custom gems or plugins into my code
