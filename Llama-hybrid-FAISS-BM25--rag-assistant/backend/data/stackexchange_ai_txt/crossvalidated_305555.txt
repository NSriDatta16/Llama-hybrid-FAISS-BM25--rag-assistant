Calculating standard error from mcmc output (WinBUGS, JAGS etc...)

I am looking to apply the concept of type M and S errors to a network meta-analysis Iâ€™m working on, hoping to use the following function developed by Andrew retrodesign s*z exaggeration Where A is your hypothesized true effect and s is the standard error of your estimate. The code for NMA calculates basic parameters which in my case is the mean difference between each active treatment and placebo. These are then used to calculate all the remaining pairwise comparisons. My question is an embarassingly simple one, and is really just meant to make sure I am not making a huge error: Am I right to calculate the standard error for a comparison based on the SD of the mcmc results for that parameter (e.g. sd/sqrt(n))? Or do I just use the SD of the estimate in lieu of the standard error?
