I finally figured it out. I now know the difference between statistical model fitting and machine learning. If you fit a model (regression), that's statistical model fitting If you learn a model (regression), that's machine learning So if you learn a logistic regression, that is a machine learning algorithm. Comment: Pardon me for being an old geezer, but whenever I hear people talking about learning a model, or learning a regression, it makes me think of Jethro "I done learned me an education".
