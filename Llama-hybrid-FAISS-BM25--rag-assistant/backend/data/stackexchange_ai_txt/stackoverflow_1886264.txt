Avoiding loops in R

I have decided to learn R. I am trying to get a sense of how to write "R style" functions and to avoid looping. Here is a sample situation: Given a vector a , I would like to compute a vector b whose elements b[i] (the vector index begins at 1) are defined as follows: 1 Essentially, if we pretend 'a' is a list of speeds where the first entry is at time = 0, the second at time = 1 second, the third at time = 2 seconds... I would like to obtain a corresponding vector describing the average speed over the past 5 seconds. E.g.: If a is (1,1,1,1,1,4,6,3,6,8,9) then b should be (NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, 1, 1.6, 2.6, 3, 4, 5.4, 6.4) I could do this using a loop, but I feel that doing so would not be in "R style". Thank you, Tungata
