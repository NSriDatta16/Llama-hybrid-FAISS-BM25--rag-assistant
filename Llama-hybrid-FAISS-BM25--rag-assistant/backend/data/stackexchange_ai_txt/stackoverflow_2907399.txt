The first pixel is typically the bottom-left, though it can be top-left if the height is specified as a negative number. The scanlines are organized left to right. Note that the scanlines are padded to DWORD boundaries, so the "stride" (distance from one scanline to the next) may be a little more than the actual width of the line.
