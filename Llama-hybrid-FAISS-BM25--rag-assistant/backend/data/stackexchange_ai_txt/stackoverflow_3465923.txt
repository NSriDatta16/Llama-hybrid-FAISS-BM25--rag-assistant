Deploying Java application compiled with Netbeans - Can't find 3rd party class

I've built my application in Netbeans 6.8. The application contains various references to third party products (such as Microsoft database driver for SQL Server and JIDE). When compiled it produces a dist folder that I thought you could simply xcopy to a location and it would work. When I run my application, as soon as it encounters a reference in a form to the JIDE classes the application reports an error and exits. Essentially the stack trace is: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.jidesoft.gantt.PeriodBackgroundPainter at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) I have the JAR files copied into the lib folder in the folder where my jar file is. \MyApp\MyJar.jar \MyApp\lib\all application jars However, when I copy the contents of the lib folder to C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\ext then everything works fine. Am I missing something? I am running on Vista SP2. I have built a new simple project with the same reference to the JIDE components and compiled it. When I run the jar file, the application runs up and displays the components. The only visible difference I can see between the projects is naming conventions on the packages used. Our main application does not conform to standard com.company.application naming and has various package names contained within. My application uses the com.company.application convention.
