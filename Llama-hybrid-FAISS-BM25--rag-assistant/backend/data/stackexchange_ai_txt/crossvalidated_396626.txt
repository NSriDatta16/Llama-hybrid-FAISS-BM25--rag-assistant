An alternative is Wasserstein loss, which supposedly helps with mode collapse. See this paper for details Are you training a separate GAN for each label? AFAIK the discriminator is usually a binary classifier. It's trying to predict whether an input is either real or generated. I found an interesting post on semi-supervised GAN training , but I've never attempted it myself. Hope that is helpful.
