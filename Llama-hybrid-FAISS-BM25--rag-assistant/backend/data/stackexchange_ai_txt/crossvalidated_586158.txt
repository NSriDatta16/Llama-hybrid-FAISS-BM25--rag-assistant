If you want to analyze X case separately from the other cases, you will probably want to use something akin to a one-sample sign test. You will want to compare the counts of e.g. "increase" and "decrease" to null counts. You might want to ignore observations of "no change" and simply compare counts of "increase" and "decrease" to a 50% / 50% split of counts. That is, if you had 12 increase, 10 no change, and 3 decease, you would compare 12 out of 15 with either a binomial test or a chi-square goodness of fit test. In R, binom.test(12, 15) or chisq.test(c(12, 3)) . Depending on your purpose, you might consider an analysis that includes counts of "no change" along with those of "increase" and "decrease". You might group them: "decrease + no change" vs. "increase". Or you might use all three counts. If you want to analyze X case with e.g. Y case, Z case, and so on, you might look at logistic regression, for either a binomial dependent variable or a multinomial dependent variable.
