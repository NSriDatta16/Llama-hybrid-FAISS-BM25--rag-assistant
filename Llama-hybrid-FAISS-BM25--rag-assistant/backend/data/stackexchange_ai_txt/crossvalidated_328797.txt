Why do we use Vector Autoregressive Models?

Let's say we want to estimate the system $x_{1,t}=\phi_0+\phi_1 x_{1,t-1}+\phi_2 x_{2,t-1} +\epsilon_t$ $x_{2,t}=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 x_{1,t-1}+\gamma_2 x_{2,t-1} +\eta_t$ Do we gain anything be estimating using a VAR method in terms of consistency, standard errors of the estimates, power of the tests, etc. as opposed to simply estimating the equations separately using appropriate time series techniques?
