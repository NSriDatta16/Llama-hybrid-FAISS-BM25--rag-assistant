Nesting and tags?

Question: Which of these is the proper way to nest the and tags, and what is your reasoning behind it? Choice A: Some Title Here's some text and whatnot. Here's another paragraph filled with other text and other whatnots. Choice B: Here's a Really Awesome Title Here's a paragraph with text and whatnot. And here's another paragraph. I think this one is pretty awesome too. Opinions seem mixed about this, and I'm not 100% which is the correct answer.
