Is there anything that went wrong? Taking your question literally, yes. You used feature F4 to predict F4 (or at the very least, something derived from F4 ). This is clearly invalid, and the most clear cut possibility of data leakage. Would you obtain similar performance if you used a decision tree instead? The problem here is with the human, not the algorithm. This would be invalid if you used a random forest, tree, gradient booster, regression, svm, neural network, anything. As long as the algorithm can draw a line of slope one to any given granularity, it will do so, and predict F4 perfectly from itself.
