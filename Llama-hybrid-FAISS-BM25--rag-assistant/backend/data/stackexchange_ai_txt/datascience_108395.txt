Ordered categorical xlabel number - what to call xlabel

Say I have 105 brand names from a store, and I know the average retrun percentage for the products of the different brands. . For example: Brand = Nike, return_rate = 30% Then I order all these brands and simply put in an integer instead of the name (since I can't put all brands on the xlabel) So now Nike is simply number 50: Brand = 50, return_rate = 30% The graph looks like this I have no clue what to call the xlabel.. Would love your help.
