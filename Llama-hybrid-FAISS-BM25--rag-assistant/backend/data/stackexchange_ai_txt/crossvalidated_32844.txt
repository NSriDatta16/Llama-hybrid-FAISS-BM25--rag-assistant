The IQR captures the middle 50% of a distribution. The variance-covariance matrix records second moments, which we can think of as weighted averages of values--with the weights given by the values themselves. Thus a few extreme values will influence the latter while having little or no influence on the former. These two characterizations suggest we can construct a counterexample by combining a distribution that is narrow along the middle 50% of its values with one that has a small proportion of extraordinarily large values. Do this along one axis and along all axes orthogonal to it, do something "tame." Thus: set.seed(17) n The eigenvectors, which are close to $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$, show that the principal directions are essentially $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. The eigenvalues indicate there is much less variance along the latter direction (4.1 vs 38.2). However, the IQR along the first principal direction (0.86) is only about a third of that along the second direction (2.6), exactly as planned. Although this does not exactly determine $\alpha^*$, I hope it makes it clear why $\alpha^*$ and the smallest principal direction can be arbitrarily far apart. These data can be made "skew" in the technical sense (of a substantial standardized third central moment) simply by extending some of the extreme $x$ values on one side of the plot compared to the other. This will barely change the eigenvectors or the IQRs.
