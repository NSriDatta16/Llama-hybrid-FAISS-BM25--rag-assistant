Have a clear license with your code if you don't have one already (preferably one which encourages modifying / improving / sharing your code ...) Have public version control and/or a public bug/issue tracker and/or a mailing list. There are a lot of good sites which offer these services for free. Seperate documentation is not a deciding factor to me (if the code is well documented and the code quality is high).
