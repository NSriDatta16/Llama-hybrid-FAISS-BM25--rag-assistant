By setting the UserNameCredentials you are in fact leveraging the Username Token Profile. This causes the token to be added to the message as a SOAP header. The SOAP header will look something like this: jdoe passw0rd Now, I'm not exactly sure why you're mentioning WSDL. The token wouldn't appear in the WSDL, though the WSDL should contain the proper WS-Policy annontations on the operation. This would let consumers of the WSDL discover that they actually need to send in the UsernamePasswordToken to the request. Finally, someone brought up RequestSecurityToken (RST), but there shouldn't (need to) be an RST involed if you're just using simple UsernameToken authentication. The only time an RST needs to be involved is if you're doing a token exchange with a Secure Token Server (STS) using WS-Trust.
