It depends on what you are building. For classification tasks, you want 1 object to exist, and to take up nearly the entire frame. For object detection tasks, either will work. Classification CNN works differently than Object Detection. In a classification CNN, the CNN learns features and then there is a head which does the classification. A classification CNN does not tell you the location of the object because the object is the image. A classification CNN only tells you the object, which is why it doesn't make any sense to include multiple objects in the image. Only include the bounding box of 1 instance of the object. In an object detection CNN, the CNN learns a location and a classification ID of an object. So here either multiple instances or single instances are useful to train the CNN. One book that helped me a lot with understanding this is Advanced Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras, Chapter 11. Edit: What is a "head" in "the CNN learns features and there is a head that does the classification"? There are 2 types of layers in a CNN: (1) convolutional layers and (2) fully-connected layers. Convolutional layers are used to extract features. Fully connected layers correlate features to an image classification.
