Syncing SQL Server tables / view over VPN

I realise there is some other questions and info about replication and syncing but had hoped to get a fresh answer based on my requirements. Main database is SQL Server 2000 Standard and has a few tables with 100k rows with inserts / updates every minute or so. Target databases are SQL 2008 Express over VPN and each site would require its own subset of the data, a synced view would be preferable but would be happy to sync all 6 tables required as long as it is only the filtered data synced. Sync would be hourly at most with option for a forced sync. What would be the best option out of all the replication options, DTS, sync services, linked servers with SQL Agent jobs or .net service for this task?
