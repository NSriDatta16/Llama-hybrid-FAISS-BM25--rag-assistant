"True" answer for MCMC model

Theoretically, given a model with $N$ parameters and $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}.\; p(x)>0$ in the prior of all parameters. If i'm interested only in the end result and not in time-to-convergence, given infinite amount on time, will I get the same posterior distribution for every possible choice of prior ?
