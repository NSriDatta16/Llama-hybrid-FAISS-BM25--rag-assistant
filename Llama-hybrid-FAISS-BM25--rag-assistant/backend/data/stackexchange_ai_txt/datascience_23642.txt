Interpretation of probabilities from logistic regression in Credit Score Card modelling

I was trying to understand the probabilities output by a logistic regression in credit scorecard, let us say that I have performed Vintage analysis and identified the performance period as 6 months , and Bad rate is defined as 90DPD , so when I perform logistic regression for incoming new customers , the probabilities would define the probability that a customer will go Bad in the next 6 months ( which comes from performance period) ?
