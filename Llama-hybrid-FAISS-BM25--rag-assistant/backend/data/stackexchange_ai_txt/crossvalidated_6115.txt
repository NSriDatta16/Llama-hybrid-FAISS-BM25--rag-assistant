I am not sure, but I think your probability model is a special case of Multinomial logit model with no covariates and only the intercept terms ($w_i$ will be the intercepts). This is model is a special case of GLM and hence there exits an iteratively weighted least square method (IRWLS) to get the maximum likelihood estimates of $w_i$. If you don't want to code the IRWLS algorithm yourself, please check the polr function in the MASS library in R to accomplish the ML estimation of $w_i$. EDIT As @whuber points out, unless you adopt a Bayesian approach, there is no distribution for the parameters (assumed fixed), but there exits one for the estimates (here: ML) as they are estimated from the data, hence the randomness.
