... because the mean of the $n$ values is not $\mu$ . A sample mean would normally be denoted as $\bar{x}$ ; it's not the case that $\bar{x}=μ$ in general. Consider the case where I have 99 tickets labelled 1,2,...,99. The population average of those values, $μ$ , is 50. I draw five of them and get 76, 48, 34, 8, 71, which averages 47.4. If we take the knowledge that the population mean is 50 and the first four sample values were 76, 48, 34, 8 that doesn't really constrain that last value (if we're sampling without replacement there's a few values it can't be, but otherwise it could be any of the other values and so could produce a wide variety of sample means).
