Drag and replace elements in an element

Hello everybody and Merry Christmas, I've created some li elements in a news website, just as follows: //news feed //news feed //news feed //news feed css: .other{ padding:0; margin:0; width:715px; list-style:none; font-family:tahoma; margin-bottom:10px; } .other li{ text-align:right; width:300px; height:300px; float:left; margin-top:10px; margin-left:20px; padding:10px; } and I've written a jquery code to drag these elements: $(document).ready(function(){ $('#others li').draggable({ containment:'parent', revert:'invalid', opacity:'0.91', cursor:'crosshair' }); }); As you can see (if you already programmed with jquery) this code drags the element, and then the returns to its initial position when mouse released(while shifting opacity)... well, I just want to know how can change places when the dragged elements reaches the x and y position of a second element. (note: the elements are draggable in both x and y directions) thank you
