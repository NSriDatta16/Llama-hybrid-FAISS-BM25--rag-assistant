Is there any difference between 'classification' and 'categorization' based on machine learning terminology?

When I was learning about classification models, it came to my mind that if there is any difference between "categories" and "classes" on the basis of machine learning terminology? If there is no difference then why do we say classification models, why not categorization models?
