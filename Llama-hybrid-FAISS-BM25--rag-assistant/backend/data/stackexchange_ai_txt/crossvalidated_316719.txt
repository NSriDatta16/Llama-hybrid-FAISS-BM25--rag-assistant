Is a policy always deterministic in reinforcement learning?

In reinforcement learning, is a policy always deterministic, or is it a probability distribution over actions (from which we sample)? If the policy is deterministic, why is not the value function, which is defined at a given state for a given policy $\pi$ as follows $$V^{\pi}(s) = E\left[\sum_{t>0} \gamma^{t}r_t|s_0 = s, \pi\right]$$ a point output? In the above definition, we take an expectation. What is this expectation over? Can a policy lead to different routes?
