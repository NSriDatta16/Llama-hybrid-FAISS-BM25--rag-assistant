Is multicollinearity an issue when doing stepwise logistic regression using AIC and BIC?

As far as I understood, it should not be a problem as long as I don't have perfect multicollinearity since I don't mind if the standard errors get inflated. However, what about using the Likelihood-ratio test to do feature selection? I assume, I then need to look for multicollinearity?
