The problem is that the hint syntax is not a comment, it just looks a bit like one. It really has to go between the SELECT and the selected columns, whereas setComment() prepends the comment before the SELECT . Beyond that, there are no silver bullets. FIRST_ROWS is not a performance enhancing tool. It may end up taking longer to get all the rows back. Of course, in a user-facing program retrieving the first ten rows may be all we need to do. But, which ever way you bounce it, if you want to use Oracle's hint syntax you'll need to go down the Native SQL route. What else can you do? I don't (yet) have much experience tuning Hibernate. The one time I have under such a task the query was grabbing rows from a whole bunch of tables to instantiate an object with lots of sub-types. Each sub-type was a separate table. The query generated by Hibernate had many OUTER JOINs, which confused the heck out the optimizer. Breaking that monster into several focused queries (one per sub-type) which used only INNER JOINs produced a two hundredfold reduction in retrieval time. This may not be of any immediate use to you. But the principle is, look at the Hibernate query and see whether it can be implemented in a different, more efficient way.
