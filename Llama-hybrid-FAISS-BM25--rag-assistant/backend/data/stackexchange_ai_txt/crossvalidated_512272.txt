What is the minimum sample size depends on the question: "Minimum sample size to accomplish what?". A paired-t test can be done on as few as 2 pairs if the only goal is to be able do some computations and get an answer (and you do not care about the quality of the answer). If the question is how big a sample size do you need for the Central Limit Theorem to allow you to use normal based tests like the paired-t when the population is not normal? then this depends on how non-normal your population of differences is. Intro stats classes and text books use a rule of thumb with numbers like 30, but those are not really justified other than keeping things simple in an introductory class. In some cases 6 is big enough, in other cases 10,000 is not big enough. An important thing to remember is that for the paired test it is the amount of skewness/outliers in the differences, not the original values that will be important. This is one of the reasons for using paired tests. One question that I don't see asked or answered in your description is how much time before and after are you going to measure water consumption for? I would expect much more normality and lower variability in the average daily usage for 3 months worth of data before and 3 months after compared to a single day before and after. If your question is the minimum sample size to have a certain power to detect a given effect size, then this really depends on the effect size that you want to see and how much variation you expect (the standard deviation of the differences). If you have no idea what these may be then you need to either do some more research, talk with an expert, or do a pilot study of some sort (or better, all 3). Think about what effect size will be meaningful, a large enough study could show a reduction in water consumption of 1 table spoon, but I doubt many people would care about that small of a change. If you can get some information on current water consumption, then one approach to explore some of these issues is to simulate some data based on the data you can get and some assumptions about what may change (try different effect sizes, etc.), then analyze your simulated data to see if it gives you meaningful results (confidence intervals are precise enough to be useful, power, etc.). Another issue to think about is seasonality of when you collect your data. Do the households in the area of interest consume different amounts of water during different seasons (if water used to water the lawn/garden is included in your measurements then this is probably a strong yes). If your before time points may differ significantly from your after time points in weather/temperature/etc. then you should make an effort to address this in your experimental design and analysis. One option would be to include another 50 "control" households that do not receive any device but are measured before and after to give an estimate of natural differences between before and after periods. For the analysis, you can do paired-t tests, but it would probably be better to do a randomized block ANOVA design, or mixed-effects model (or a Bayesian Hierarchical model) with households as the blocks/random effects to still give you the pairing but also allow you to compare between the different machines (and control) and look at other factors. You also ask why paired tests require smaller sample sizes than unpaired. Simply put, the sample size depends a lot on the amount of residual variation (variability after accounting for other factors), if pairing is natural, then it will also reduce that residual variation. In your case you are going to have household to household variation (a family of 4 will likely consume much more water than a single person), in a non-paired study that household to household variation will be included in the residual standard deviation, but proper pairing will remove/adjust for most of the household to household variation, so the paired sample size calculation will be based on a much smaller standard deviation than the unpaired equivalent.
