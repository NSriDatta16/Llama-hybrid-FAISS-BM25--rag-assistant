One pragmatic issue is that with explicit MM it is generally a lot easier to profile, identify the bottleneck, and resolve it. With a GC system, when your nice O(N) code turns out to trash the GC in a pathological way that makes it O(heap size), it can be harder to work out what is going wrong. Sometimes even as hard as fixing a memory corruption.
