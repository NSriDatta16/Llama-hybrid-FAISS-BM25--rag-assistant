The problem is that you are simulating data where the risks/probabilities and the group sizes are both relatively low. As a result, the sampling distributions of the log relative risk are not very well approximated by normal distributions and the sampling variances are poorly estimated. Take a look at: sum(d0 == 0 | d1 == 0) You will find that 0 events in at least one of the two groups are relatively common (in more than 15% of the cases). Things start to break down under the 'normal-normal' model under such conditions. Try making the risks not quite so low and the studies a bit larger: p0=0.18 # P(success) in control group N = round( rchisq(.k, df=2) * 30 + 100 ) Things start to look much better then. If you find yourself in a situation where both risks and sample sizes are low, you may have to switch to a 'binomial-normal' model. For relative risks, this is a bit more difficult, since you would have to fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a log link, which is a bit more tricky than the usual logit link (which is used to model odds ratios). For 'binomial-normal' models with a logit link, take a look at the rma.glmm() function. For example, if you are patient, you could try: rma.glmm(measure="OR", ai=d1, bi=n1-d1, ci=d0, di=n0-d0, model="CM.EL", verbose=TRUE) Note that you won't be estimating $\tau^2 = .30$ then, since that applies to the (log) relative risks, not the (log) odds ratios. But when risks are low, then relative risks and odds ratios are similar, so you will get something not too far off.
