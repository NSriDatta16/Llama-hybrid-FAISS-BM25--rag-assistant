Create a Linked Server instance on SQL Server, using an account that has access on the Oracle instance. Then, you can update the SQL Server table with the missing contents using: INSERT INTO [SQLServer].[dbo].[table] SELECT columns FROM [Oracle].[database].[schema].[table] x WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT NULL FROM [SQLServer].[dbo].[table] y WHERE y.student_number = x.student_number) There are NOT IN and LEFT JOIN/IS NULL alternatives -- NOT IN and NOT EXISTS perform better than LEFT JOIN/IS NULL when the columns compared (in this case, student_number) is not nullable (the value can never be NULL) . It's easy to script this as a SQL Server Agent Job if you need it to run periodically .
