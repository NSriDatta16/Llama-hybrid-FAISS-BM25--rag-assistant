You can limit to a single useragent by issuing the client with a client side SSL certificate created with the keygen element, this gets the browser to generate a key pair, keeping the private key in the user agent, then you receive an SPKAC, which you can use to openssl create a certificate, which you then send back to the user agent, it installs it and it can be used to identify the user in that specific browser only via HTTP+TLS from then on. Anything else, simply won't work 100% - although you can hack ways that appear to work (until something goes wrong and it doesn't work) :)
