You're looking at the wrong bits of the error message. The part you're looking at is where it tries to send the headers (ie: where it realizes something is wrong). The relevant part, however, is the part where it began producing output. For the first error, it says the output was already started at index.php, line 2. You probably have whitespace in front of your opening tag. I'd check that first...
