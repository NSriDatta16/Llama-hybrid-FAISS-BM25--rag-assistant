Parse a JavaScript string best practice

I have this var checkBox = e.target; var tableRow = checkBox.parentNode.parentNode; var key = tableRow.attributes["key"]; var aKey = key.nodeValue; at this point aKey = "[123]" what the best way to return 123 as an int in javascript? note that aKey could just as likely be "[5555555555555555555]" so I can't just grab characters 2-4. I need something more dynamic. I was hoping this could be parsed as like a one element array, but I see this is not correct. This is really a dataKey for an Infragisitcs grid. Their support is not very helpful. Thanks for any advice. Cheers, ~ck in San Diego
