For (a), $\theta_2$ will be chosen as $0$ since $\lambda_2=\infty$ , and there is no other way to minimize the loss. Similarly, for (b), $\theta_0=0$ . (a) If we have $\theta_2=0$ , the decision boundary will look like $\theta_1x_1+\theta_0=0$ , i.e. the vertical line. (b) If we have $\theta_0=0$ , the decision boundary is $\theta_1x_1+\theta_2x_2=0$ , a line passing from the origin. For having a horizontal line as boundary, you need $\theta_2x_2+\theta_0=0$ , where $\theta_1$ is forced to be $0$ due to $\lambda_1=\infty$ . Normally, you'd have a threshold in logistic regression, but here it is chosen as $\tau=0.5$ as I follow.
