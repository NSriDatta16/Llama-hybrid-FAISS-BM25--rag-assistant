Magento Grid Container Block not loading grid

I just set up an admin module with a grid view using the module creator, and it works great, but now I need to add another grid view within the same module. I copied and renamed all the files relevant to the grid view(controllers and block files, but not models, as they are not needed for what I'm doing) , and added the newly created block to the layout xml under the handle for it's new controller. Using Firephp, I've worked out that everything loads fine for my new view up until the Grid.php which doesn't load, and the end output is just a blank page. As far as I'm aware, this new view is identical to the original working grid view generated by the module in all aspects except name, so what could be causing it to not recognize or load the Grid.php?
