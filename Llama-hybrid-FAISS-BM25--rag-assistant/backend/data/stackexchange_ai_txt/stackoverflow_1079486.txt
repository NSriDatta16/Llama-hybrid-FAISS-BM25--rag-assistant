look, in asp.net the SiteMap is greatly implemented unlike it's 'non standard' implementation in asp.net mvc :). I have to choose also for my app how to organise a site map. I think this solution is far to be ideal and elegant, but it seems very nice for me. In my Base data view object that I use for displaying data on the view I make all this functionality fluently for the sake of commodity (I love fluent code ), so there is there a method that generates hard coded path in dependanse of the ''link''. So what is link?, the link represents a static class with all my links in my site. So for example your : http://localhost/myarea/contract/viewcontract/12 In ''links'' means: Links.ContractView and in my controller I have smth like this: BaseDV.SetPageMapBasedOnLink(Links.ContractView) and in SetPageMapBasedOnLink you have a switch that based on Links value sets the appropriate title or what ever you want. I hope you got the idea, and this will help you to decide!
