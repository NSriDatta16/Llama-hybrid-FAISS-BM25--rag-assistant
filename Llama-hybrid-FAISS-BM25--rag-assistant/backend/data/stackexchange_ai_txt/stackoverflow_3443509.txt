Unable to link directly to WMV video file

I have a wmv video hosted in SharePoint. I've created a Content Editor web part with a bit of custom content and I've placed a simple link to the video Click to view . There is really nothing special going on here. Some users can click on the link and the video opens in their default video player. Other users see a range of different errors/prompts. Some users are prompted for their network credentials and others receive a generic "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage. The same problems occur if I create a generic HTML web page (outside of SharePoint) and have users try to launch the video. I am trying to avoid embedding the video in the HTML and just have users link directly to the video itself. Has anyone encountered this issue and do you have any suggestions for making this work?
