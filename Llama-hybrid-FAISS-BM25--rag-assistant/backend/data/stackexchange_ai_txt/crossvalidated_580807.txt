Is it possible to learn/separate this data?

I have a highly imbalanced (~0.4% minority class) binary classification dataset of time series (flux) observations, and am now at a loss on how to classify it, as the data aren't separable. Here's what the data look like, both originally and with SMOTE oversampling. I have tried SVM, KNN, RF, ANN, and CNN. SVM, KNN, ANN, and CNN produce similar resultsâ€”classifying both training classes correctly about 60% of the time, but only classifying the test minority class correctly 1-2% of the time. RF overfits with 100% training accuracy/recall/precision, but the same results on the test data. I get these results regardless of the resampling technique I use on the training data. Is it possible to do better than this, i.e., classify the minority class more than 2% of the time on unseen data? The classes pretty much overlap, so is there a way to separate them? I've seen some threads mentioning probability calibration, which I am familiar with. Is this something worth trying out even though I am only predicting class labels?
