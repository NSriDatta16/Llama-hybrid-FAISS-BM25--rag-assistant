The immediate problem with your script is you need to fix the quoting: regex='[a-z0-9!#$%&'"'"'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'"'"'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?' However, this regular expression does not accept all syntactically valid email addresses. Even if it did, not all syntactically valid email addresses are deliverable. If deliverable addresses are what you care about, then don't bother with a regular expression or other means of checking syntax: send a challenge to the address that the user supplies. Be careful not to use untrusted input as part of a command invocation! With sendmail, run sendmail -oi -t and write a message to the standard input of the sendmail process, e.g. , To: test@terra.es.invalid From: no-reply@your.organization.invalid Subject: email address confirmation To confirm your address, please visit the following link: http://www.your.organization.invalid/verify/1a456fadef213443
