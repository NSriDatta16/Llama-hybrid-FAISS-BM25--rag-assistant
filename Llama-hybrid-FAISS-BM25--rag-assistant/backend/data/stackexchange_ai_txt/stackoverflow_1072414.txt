A few things to focus on that will exercise a lot of areas of SQL that you should know if you're going to be writing a lot of it: Joins - INNER and OUTER (difference between LEFT and RIGHT JOIN) GROUP BY clause and working with aggregate functions such as SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.. WHERE - for filtering records returned in a query Subqueries - Subqueries and Correlated subqueries CASE, COALESCE, BETWEEN, CONVERT, CAST functions/statements Find a good data set and try to run some meaningful queries on it. Make sure you start with a problem you want to solve (i.e. what is the average order amount for people who live in WA in the Northwind database?).
