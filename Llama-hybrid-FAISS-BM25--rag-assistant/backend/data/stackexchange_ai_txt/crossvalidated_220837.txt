Demand Forecasting Models

I want to forecast demand of various products using time series data of 2 years (using loops on products in R), frequency is daily and demand is to be forecasted for next 90 days I have used the following models till now ARIMA SImple Exponential Model Holt Exponential Model (with trend) Holt Winters Exponential Model (with trend and seasonality) My ARIMA results gave same point forecasts for many products for all 90 days, while the Exponential models are giving high errors (seen through MAPE) Why does ARIMA model give same point forecast for all 90 days. What other models can be used for time series forecasting other than these four Should ARCH-GARCH models or sarima be used?? # Demand Forecasting - ARIMA model- Weekly Demand Forecasting for next 13 weeks using 104 weeks data- 27-6-2016 #Required libraries library(forecast) require(forecast) library(MASS) require(MASS) #Setting up working directory getwd() setwd("C:/Users/21202/Desktop/ARIMA_27-6") getwd() #Reading the data weeklyproductdemand
