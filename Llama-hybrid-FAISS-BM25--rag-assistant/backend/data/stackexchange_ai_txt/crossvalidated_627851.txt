OK, first, it sounds like you have a Likert type scale and are dichotomizing it into "agree" and "strongly agree" vs. everything else. You can do that if you want, but it's generally not a good idea. Second, if you want to test just two specific years, you would create a subset of your data with only those years, and then do a logistic regression with the response as the dependent variable, and group, year, and the interaction as independent variables. If you dichotomize your response, the you can use "regular" logistic. If you follow my suggestion, you would use ordinal logistic. Third, it might be better not to subset your data and to look at all years at once. You could treat "year" as either categorical or continuous, depending on what you think is going on.
