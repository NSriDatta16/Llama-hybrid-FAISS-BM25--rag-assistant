Your bias is really through a fairly narrow range. It is from 0-7K; and >32K. At >32K it looks like you have relatively few observations. So, those seem to all be outliers that may be difficult to fit. I would pay more attention to the 0-7K range where you have a lot more observations. Maybe there is a simple way to add a predictor variable for the 0-7K range. This predictor could be structured as a simple constant or an interaction variable with some of the other predictors that would change the coefficient associated with that other predictor. If the above works, and it probably should; you could then try something similar with the >32K range.
