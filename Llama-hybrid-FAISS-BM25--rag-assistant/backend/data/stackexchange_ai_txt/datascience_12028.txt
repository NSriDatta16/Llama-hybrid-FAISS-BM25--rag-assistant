You could represent your input with numerical values for each fruit, negative if the fruit is in basket 1, positive if it's in basket 2 and 0 otherwise. This representation generalizes to larger baskets. The representation will cause some algorithms, such as logistic regression, to take advantage of the symmetry of the training set. For other algorithms like k-nearest neighbor, you can mirror the training data - for each example, include another example with the identities of the groups reversed - which would let you use separate variables for each fruit-basketID pair.
