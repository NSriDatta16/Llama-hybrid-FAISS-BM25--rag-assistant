HTTP specified different methods for different purposes. The GET method is intended to be used to “retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI”. Especially, it is intended to be a safe and idempotent method . That means a GET request should not have side effects (i.e. changing data): In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. And sending an identical request multiple times results in the same as sending it just once: Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property.
