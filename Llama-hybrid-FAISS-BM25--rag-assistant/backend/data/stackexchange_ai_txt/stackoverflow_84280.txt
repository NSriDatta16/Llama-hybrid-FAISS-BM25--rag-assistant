You'll probably want to at least store attachments separately to optimize storage. It's astonishing to see the size and quantity of attachments (videos, etc.) that most users unhesitatingly attach to emails. In the case of outgoing emails you may have multiple emails sending the same attachment. It's far more efficient to store a single copy of the attachment that is referenced by all emails that share it. Another reason for storing attachments separately is that it gives you some archiving options later on. Should storage space become an issue, you can always go back and delete large attachments older than a given date in order to compact the database.
