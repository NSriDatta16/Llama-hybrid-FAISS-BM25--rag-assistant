Unless someone comes in with a better reason, this looks like a bug with autodie in relation to the open pragma. Changing the last open to open my $fh2, ' fixes the problem on my system. So that could be a temporary work around. I just checked RT, and this is a registered bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=54777 Looks like it has to do with each pragma using different ways of overloading the open function.
