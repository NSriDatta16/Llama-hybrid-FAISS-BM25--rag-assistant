From my knowledge, Oracle Internet Directory (OID) is an LDAP compliant directory whereas Oracle Access Manager (OAM) is much more complex and consists of two main systems: Identity System (users, groups, workflows) Access System (single/multi domain SSO solution for Web and non-Web based applications). Access Manager relies on an Identity Server which is a stand-alone server process that communicates with any Directory Server (AD, OID, Sun Directory server..). So you can use the new OAM and link it with your existing OID... to retrieve users/groups and metadata. All that you could do with OID will be doable with OAM as it brings more abstraction layers. But in my opinion, and considering your case, directly accessing LDAP servers (OID, AD, etc) and using a light and "home made" SSO system is cheaper than relying on those big systems.... I think OAM is a usefull solution when you have lots of heterogeneous applications (web, non web, mobile, ...) and/or multiple organizations/domains with links and/or you need a very scalable approach.
