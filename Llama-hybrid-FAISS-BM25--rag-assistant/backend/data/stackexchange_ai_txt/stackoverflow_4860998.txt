But that means move method cannot be in class Agent since it creates a dependency on (at least the interface of) classes that describe terrain, etc The agent must know about his surroundings. That means that the Agent must use the interfaces that describe the terrain, yes. I wouldn't call that a "dependency", though. There is nothing wrong with assuming that the class that implements ITerrain actually follows the ITerrain interface. :-) So you put .move() on the agent. The move() method then would check the surroundings and try to move through them according to the rules of movement.
