The problem is simple: recall, precision and F1-score work only with binary classification. If you try with a example manually you will see that the definitions that you're using for precision and recall can only work with classes 0 and 1, they go wrong with class 2 (and this is normal). When working with more than 2 classes you must use either micro f1-score (but this is the same as accuracy) or macro f1-score, which would be the standard option with imbalanced data. Macro F1-score is the average of the f1-score across all 3 classes, where the f1-score for one class is obtained by considering all the other classes as the negative class.
