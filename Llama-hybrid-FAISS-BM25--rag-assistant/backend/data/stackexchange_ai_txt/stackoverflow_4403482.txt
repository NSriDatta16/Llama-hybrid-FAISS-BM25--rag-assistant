What is a good book or resource for writing large ajax applications?

I am very experienced in engineering large-scale systems, but I am still relatively new to ajax-based design. I know how to use the apis, and I am fairly comfortable using jquery and javascript as a whole, but I often find myself thinking way too hard about the overall architecture. Right now, my current application just has javascript files sprinkled all over the place, all in a /js directory. Most of them use jQuery, but some use YUI or a combination between the two because the features weren't available in jQuery. Some of my REST server methods accept normal GET methods with request parameters, but others needed much more complex POSTs to handle the incoming data (lists of lists of objects). The handling of all of my ajax stuff is a mix and mash of different methods as a result of the complexity of the data I'm dealing with. What I'd really like is to read about how to design an ajax-based system that is very clean and elegant architecturally, and is consistent from the simplest to the most complex of cases. Does such a resource exist? Also suggestions on naming conventions of javascript files and conventions for ajax endpoint directory/method names? Also how to do with entering form data? Should you use get or post to do this? Also about validation of form data when all the constraints are already on the server? How to make this very trivial to do so you're not doing it for each form? What are the best ways to generate new page content when people click things and settings this up so that it's easy to do over and over. How to deal with application-specific javascript files depending on each other and managing this nicely. I am also using Spring and Spring-MVC, but I don't expect this to make much difference. My questions are purely browser related.
