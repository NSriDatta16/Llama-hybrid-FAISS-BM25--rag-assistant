You're far better off taking a subset of the functions of the C++ executable and building it into a library. You'll keep type safety and you'll be able to better leverage Exception Handling (not to mention finer grain control of how you manage the calls into the functions in the library). If you go with grabbing the data from the OutputStream of the executable, you're going to have no visibility into the processes of the executable, no real exception handling, and you're going to lose any type information you may have had.
