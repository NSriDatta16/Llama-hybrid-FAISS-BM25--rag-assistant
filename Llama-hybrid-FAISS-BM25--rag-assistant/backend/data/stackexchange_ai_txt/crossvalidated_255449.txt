Your question is not very clear but I think this may answer it: $t+h$ is just a short hand way of denoting the $h^{\text{th}}$ lag rather than writing out long hand all the predictors for $Y$. For example, if you have monthly data and seasonality is important then you will may want $t-12$ as a predictor in your time series (in which case h=12), you may even want $t-24$ and $t-36$.
