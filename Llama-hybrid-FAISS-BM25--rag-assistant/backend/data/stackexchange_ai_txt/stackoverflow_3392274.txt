You're probably hitting memory fragmentation issues. Playing with REALLY large dynamic data structures in a 32-bit world tends to cause this. Personally I have only hit this with a 300mb string but I normally avoid getting into the situation so that doesn't say too much. As others have said, break it up so you don't have such a large string.
