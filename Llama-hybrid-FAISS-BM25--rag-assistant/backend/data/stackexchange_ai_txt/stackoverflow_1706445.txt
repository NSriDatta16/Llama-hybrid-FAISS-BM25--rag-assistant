wrong registry key. you need to set LocalServer32, not InProcServer32 in HKCR\CLSID{classId}. However, windows cannot instantiate a DLL. So you need to change your program into a full COM server exe. Windows will start your EXE and send in the argument /embedding. You can then create the CComModule and start your program.
