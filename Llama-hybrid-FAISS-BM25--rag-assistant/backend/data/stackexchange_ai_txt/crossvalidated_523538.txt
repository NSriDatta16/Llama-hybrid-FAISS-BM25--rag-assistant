This would typically refer to something like logistic regression that allows you to model a binary outcome (or ordinal regression for more than 2 ordered categories) adjusted for some covariates. Example: A randomized clinical trial of a drug versus a matching placebo might analyze whether patients admitted to an intensive care unit die within 30 days of randomization to either treatment. We might have the APACHE IV score before randomization available and might use it (or the logit transformed probability it predicts) as a covariate. We then have a regression model that looks like $$\text{logit}(\pi_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{treatment}_i + \beta_2 \times \text{APACHE-IV-score}_i$$ and $Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$ for patient $i$ . The (maximum-likelihood) estimate $\hat{\beta}_1$ of the regression coefficient for treatment would then be an adjusted estimate of the log-odds ratio for the effect of treatment (and correspondingly $\text{logit}^{-1}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ the adjusted odds-ratio estimate).
