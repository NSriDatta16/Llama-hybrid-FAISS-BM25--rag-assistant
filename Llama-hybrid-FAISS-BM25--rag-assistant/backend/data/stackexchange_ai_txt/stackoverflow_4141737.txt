"" --> Cstrings are terminated by convention with a x'00' null character so literal "" consists of one character x'00' and has sie of 1 byte. NULL is by default a null pointer which on particular 32 bit machines has a size of four bytes on different platforms it could br 1,2,3,4,6 or 8. Maybe even 5 or 7 but I have never come accross a 40 bit or 56 bit addressing. Also in some older architectures there may be extra bits associated with a pointer to indicate data vs. instruction vs. device buffer storage etc.
