Two great options you've already listed are Python and Lua. Here are some of the tradeoffs for your consideration: Python A much more complete and powerful language (IMHO!) with libraries for anything and tons of support and communities everywhere you look. Syntax is not entirely C-like Although Python wasn't designed specifically for embedding (it's much more often used as a standalone language extended by code in C/C++), it's tot really hard to embed. The official docs contain some examples, and following Boost's examples shouldn't be much harder. Lua Designed from bottom up for embedding, so it should be the simplest one to embed. Syntax more C-like than Python's If you foresee a definite future need for scripting, building in a scripting engine early is a good idea as it may open some interesting possibilities for you as you go on developing the program. Both options listed above are good ones, you should have no problems embedding any of them without much effort.
