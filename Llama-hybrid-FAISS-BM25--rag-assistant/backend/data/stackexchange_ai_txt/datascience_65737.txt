Keras is an application programming interface (API). It is a single interface that can support multi-backends, which means a programmer can write Keras code once and it can be executed in a variety of neural networks frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano). TensorFlow 2.0 is the suggested backend starting with Keras 2.3.0 .
