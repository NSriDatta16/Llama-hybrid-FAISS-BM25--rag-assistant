What is the motivation of unsupervised visualisation algorithms

I am having trouble getting my head around what we are really trying to do with our unsupervised visualisation algorithms. I can't help but look at common techniques like t-SNE, PCA, clustering etc.. and think that our 'metric' is, "ohh, that looks pretty"... or simply that it matches our intuitions. What I am trying to say is that I find the whole thing to be a bit too subjective for my tastes. Is there a more precise definition of the aim of these algorithms?
