On the time complexity of Bayesian linear regression and Gaussian process

By drawing analogy, I believe that Bayesian linear regression has a time complexity same to standard linear regression $(^2+^3)$ which is dominated by the number of features $p$ ( What is the Time Complexity of Linear Regression? ). To be more specific, the $O(p^3)$ term arises because we need to invert $X^TX$ . On the other hand, in Gaussian process regression we need to invert a $n$ x $n$ covariance matrix (with noise), which results in $O(n^3)$ . But Bayesian linear regression can be interpreted as Gaussian process at the same time. So why is there such an inconsistency or am I missing something?
