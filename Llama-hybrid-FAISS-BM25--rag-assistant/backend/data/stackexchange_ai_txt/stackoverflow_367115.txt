Is there a Python equivalent to `perl -pi -e`?

I know of python -c ' ' , but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant python equivalent to perl -pi -e ' ' . I still use it quite a bit for things like find and replace in a whole directory ( perl -pi -e s/foo/bar/g * or even find . | xargs perl -pi -e s/foo/bar/g for sub-directories). I actually feel that that which makes Perl Perl (free form Tim Toady-ness) is what makes perl -pi -e work so well, while with Python you'd have to do something along the lines of importing the re module, creating an re instance and then capture stdin, but maybe there's a Python shortcut that does all that and I missed it (sorely missed it)...
