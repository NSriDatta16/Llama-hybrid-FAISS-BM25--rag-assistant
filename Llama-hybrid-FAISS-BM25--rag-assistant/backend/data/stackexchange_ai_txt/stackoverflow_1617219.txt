BeautifulSoup will do bad with malformed HTML. What about some regex-fu? >>> import re >>> >>> html = """ This is paragraph with a bunch of lines ... from a news story. """ >>> >>> pattern = re.compile('(? ).+(?= >> pattern.search(html).group() 'This is paragraph with a bunch of lines\nfrom a news story.' You can then assembly a list of valid tags from which you want to extract information.
