I recommend that you read up further on Symfony to better understand the basic structure of a symfony project. The Jobeet tutorial available on the symfony website covers this. In brief, for what you describe, you would likely need: 1 application (frontend) multiple modules (homepage, gallery page, whatever page) some fragments such as partials and components for reusability You would only need a backend application if you want some type of backend access, like for a CMS.
