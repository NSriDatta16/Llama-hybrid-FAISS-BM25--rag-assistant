Standard deviation and CV

I'm using 10-fold CV to compute the classification accuracy of some classifier. I do the CV 10 times with randomly chosen folds. How do I correctly compute the standard deviation? Do I collect all hundred accuracies and then compute the standard deviation or do I average the accuracies over all 10 runs and then take the standard deviation?
