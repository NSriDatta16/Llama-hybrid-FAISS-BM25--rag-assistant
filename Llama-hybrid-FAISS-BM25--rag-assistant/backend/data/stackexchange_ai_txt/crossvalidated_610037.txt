This seems like an ordinal outcome (ordered categories from negative to strong) with an arguably unordered categorical predictor (tumor type). If there were sufficient counts in all cells, you could just use some standard frequentist maximum-likelihood approach to ordinal data (e.g. ordinal logistic regression). The zero and near-zero counts might cause some problems there, although it might work. An alternative is a Bayesian version of this, where you can regularize the coefficients by introducing weakly informative proper prior distribution (or if you want to and have prior information, you could also use informative priors). Bayesian models with weakly informative proper prior distributions tend to have good small sample performance. One good option for having modeling flexibility there is the brms R package, for which there is a whole in-depth tutorial (that also got published in a journal ) on how to fit such models with explanations of what each option assumes and how to be more flexible with distributional regression (e.g. do you want to estimate an overall "tendency to be in a higher category"-effect, or do you want to estimate a separate coefficient for being in a category vs. a the next higher category etc.).
