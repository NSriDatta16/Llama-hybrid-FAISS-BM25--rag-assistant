Power simulation for Difference-in-Difference

Referring to the simulation approach suggested by Snow for ordinal logistic regression: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/22410/231675 Here is a simple example with ordinal regression: library(rms) tmpfun I am looking to do the same thing for Difference-in-Difference Analysis. I am not sure how to adjust the parameters to fit a Difference-in-Difference. Does anybody have any suggestions?
