A simple nested RGB loop would not generate your red-yellow-green-blue gradient. If that is really what you specifically want then you should know a bit about the color wheel: red | magenta__ | __yellow \|/ __/|\__ blue | green | cyan This is actually a HSV color wheel that works very well for understanding additive colors. According to this, you get yellow by mixing red and green. So, for your gradient: // in javascript: function cssColor (r, g, b) { return 'rgb('+r+','+g+','+b+')'; } var colors = []; // Start with solid red: var r = 255; var g = 0; var b = 0; // From red to yellow: for (var g=0;g =0;r--) colors.push(cssColor(r,g,b)); // From green to blue: for (var b=0;b This give you an array of 768 colors. If you use every eighth color you should get your array of around 100 colors: var subColors = []; for (var i=0;i Anyway, using this knowledge, you can get any gradient you want.
