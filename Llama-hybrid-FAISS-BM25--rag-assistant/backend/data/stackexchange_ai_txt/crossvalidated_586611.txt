How can one evaluate the similarity of non-independent data-sets

I have a set of time series from different runs of a computational model. I know that the computational model is highly historical in the sense that the state early in a trial heavily influences (in a non-linear, difficult to summarise way) what the state will be later in that same trial. Accordingly, I understand the data in these time series to be non-independent. My goal is to show that when I change a particular parameter in the model from Value A to Value B , it has a consistent influence upon the dynamics. When I plot histograms of the state variables, it is clear to me that this is the case, but I am looking for a statistical test that will allow me to say so with less subjectivity. I don't know how to do so. I have searched around for non-independent statistical tests, but most of what I find are tests for detecting if your data is independent or not. I know that my data is not independent, and this non-independence is an essential feature of my model, so I can't get rid of it. I have 10 trials of each parameter value. I thought I might divide each of those sets into two groups of 5 trials, thus: Data Set # 1 : Parameter Value A, trials 0-4 Data Set # 2 : Parameter Value A, trials 5-9 Data Set # 3 : Parameter Value B, trials 0-4 Data Set # 4 : Parameter Value B, trials 5-9 I then could (somehow!) show that Data Set #1 is more similar to Data Set #2 than the amalgamation of Data Set #1 and #2 is to the amalgamation of Data Sets #3 and #4. ...and similarly show that Data Set #3 is more similar to Data Set #4 than the amalgamation of Data Set #1 and #2 is to the amalgamation of Data Sets #3 and #4. Is that a good plan? If so, what measures of similarity should I learn about that can be applied to non-independent data?
