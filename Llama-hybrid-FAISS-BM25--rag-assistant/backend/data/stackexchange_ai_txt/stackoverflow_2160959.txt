Is there any way to stop a method being called at compile-time?

I have some classes, which have several methods which I don't really want to be there, but are there simply because the XML Serializer needs them. Is there anyway to generate compile-time errors/warnings if they get called from user-code? I am aware that I can implement IXmlSerializable, and I am also aware that I can separate out the classes into purely data storage classes, however, I am not asking a question about how I should design such a system, I am simply asking if there is a way to generate compile-time errors/warnings if they are called by anything that is not the XML serializer...
