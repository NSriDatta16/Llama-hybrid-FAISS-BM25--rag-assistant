You are right that without data on those who didn't crash, you can't sensibly predict how likely a crash is. For example, maybe your data show there were twice as many crashes among young male drivers in County A than in County B -- but is that because County B is safer, or just because it has a smaller population? If you can find data on population counts by gender, age, & area, then you can make a multi-way table that counts how many crashes and how many non-crashes there were for each gender-by-age-by-area combination. If you are in the US, data.census.gov may have this information, as long as the geographic areas you're working with are not too small. Then it may be possible to fit & interpret a logistic regression. However, be aware that it might be more complicated if your crash data are recording where each crash took place, while the census data show where each person resides (if people don't crash in the same area where they live).
