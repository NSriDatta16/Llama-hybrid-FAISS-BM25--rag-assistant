It is very easy to user a parallel port to control a stacked status indicator. They look like a pile of hockey puck-sized lenses that light up. Usually used in factories. Attached to machines. Can be a bit pricey. They have a RED light, a green light and etc... in a stack. Some talk to CAN buses, but the cheapo ones are just lights. You get yourself a parallel port relay card, and an appropriate plug-pack(wall wart). The easy thing is all you have to do is write a single letter to the parallel port. Set bits turn on lights. Not very "extreme" though, (although the optional strobes and hooters are very attention-getting) Because you don't need to do anything clever to the parallel port, it can be a USB parallel port.
