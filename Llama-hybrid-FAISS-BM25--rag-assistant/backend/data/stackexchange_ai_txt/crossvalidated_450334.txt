The best method to achieve this would be a PCA or factor analysis on the variables before you do the regression. Think about it this way: If $A$ and $X$ are highly correlated, and $B$ and $X$ are also highly correlated, then very likely (but not necessarily) $A$ and $B$ are also correlated. So your variables $A,B,C,\ldots$ don't really capture independent information. This leads to problems in the analysis. So it is better to first remove this correlation and identify the underlying actual information in the variables. A PCA can achieve this.
