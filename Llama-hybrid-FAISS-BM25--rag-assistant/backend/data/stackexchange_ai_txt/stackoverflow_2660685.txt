Annotated compile errors: error CS1061: 'Result' does not contain a definition for 'status' error CS1061: 'Param' does not contain a definition for 'ReservationID' Code using generic type arguments can only compile if the compiler knows the member of the generic type. It doesn't know that the Result type argument has a "status" member. It certainly doesn't if you invoke TestFn () . You'll need to use a constraint to make this work. You already do, but new() isn't strong enough. Something like "where Result : IResult" for example, where IResult is an interface type that has a status property. Or a base class. The compiler can now be 100% sure that any allowed concrete instance of the generic method will execute without causing runtime errors. Since it can only ever be compiled when it was invoked with a type that has a "status" property. All the same applies to the Param type argument. The usefulness of a generic method here rapidly disappears when you do this, it is not the proper usage. Unless you can leverage IResult, like you can IEnumerable.
