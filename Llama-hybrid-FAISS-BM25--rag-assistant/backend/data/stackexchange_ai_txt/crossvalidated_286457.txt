My guess is that the dependent variable of your logistic regression is not coded as 0/1, which I think will cause problems with the statsmodels GLM routines. Also, I don't think you want the left side of the equation (ahead of the ~ ) to be the sum of two variables. If you really want the arithmetic sum, you could use this: I(FTG+FST) ~ Team+Opponent+Home but I don't think that's what you actually want. If you have a count of attempts per player, and also the number of successes, you could use Poisson regression, with number of attempts as the exposure (or just include log(attempts) as a covariate). Or, if you have shot-level data, instead of player-level data, you could use logistic regression, but then you might want to think about the correlation among records for the same player.
