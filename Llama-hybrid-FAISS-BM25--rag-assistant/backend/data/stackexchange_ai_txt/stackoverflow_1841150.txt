Workflow Custom Activity building workflow parameters

Let's say I have a Workflow with 2 dependency Property : Prop1, Prop2. I'd like to create a custom activity that when I drag into the workflow, It will show Prop1 and Prop2 in the property grid in the designer. Is this possible ? Like the invokeWorkflow, when you select the TargetWorkflow, it populates the property grid with Parameters of the workflow, so that you can bind.
