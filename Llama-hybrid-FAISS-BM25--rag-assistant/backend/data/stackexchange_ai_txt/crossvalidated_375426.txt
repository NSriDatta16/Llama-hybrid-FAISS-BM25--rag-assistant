Mean of two time series

I'm trying to estimate the covariance of two time series using the formula where X and Y are two time series. I don't understand how to calculate the value of the first term: does that mean I have to calculate the mean of the means, or do I have to multiply the X serie by the Y serie, and then calculate the mean? If so, how do you multiply two series? Forgive me if I'm asking a silly question, I'm new to this subject and it is pretty confusing. Thanks!
