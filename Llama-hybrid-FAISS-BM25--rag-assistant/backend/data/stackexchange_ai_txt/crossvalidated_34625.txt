Interpreting tree classification errors in Matlab

I am currently using Matlab to generate random forests. I am using the TreeBagger class with the function oobError . I can plot a 2D figure which puts my tree count on the X-axis (IKA weak learners count) and classification error is on the Y-axis. My question is: How can I interpret the actual error of my classifier (something like cross-validation which gives you a double as your classification error)? Another question is: Is the X-axis of my figure the number of trees in bag or is it describing which tree (tree #50 for example) has the accuracy given at the corresponding point on the Y-axis?
