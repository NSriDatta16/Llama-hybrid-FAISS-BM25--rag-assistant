Error when compiling C program

I'm trying to complete a project for school involving the use of semaphores. I have included the proper header files ( plus one for pthreads). I have pointed the compiler to the proper libraries as well. This is written in C. Yes, this is an assignment, but please be aware I am not looking for help with implementation, rather I can't seem to figure out this damnable compile error. Here are lines 47 through 50 of my code, which are "simple" declarations of the semaphores and initializing them: sem_t empty; sem_init(&empty, 0, 5); sem_t full; sem_init(&full, 0, 0); Here are the messages I'm getting when I try and compile for line 48. I get the same set for line 50 but didn't post it for the sake of brevity: |48|error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before ‘&’ token| |48|error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before numeric constant| |48|error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before numeric constant| |48|warning: data definition has no type or storage class| |48|warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘sem_init’| I have declared all these outside the main() function. How can I resolve these errors? I'm baffled because it seems to indicate no data type for sem_t, but it is defined in semaphore.h, which I have included. I am compiling this using Code::Blocks under Ubuntu, which is using gcc. This error occurs even when compiling from the command line. Thanks in advance for the help.
