Fat-tailed proposal distribution

I am solving a program using my own MCMC Bayesian code. I block propose my vector by calculating the co-variance using the last 10 000 steps (sampling my posterior). I want to implement a fat-tailed proposal for the step size, but I want to keep my normally distributed co-variance proposal for the direction. Therefore, I was thinking of drawing a normally distributed X as before, and multiplying it by Y a Cauchy distributed random variable with median 1. Therefore, my proposal is XY. However, all the literature I've seen about "mixing" distributions or implementing fat-tailed proposals add two variables X+Y where X is normally distributed and Y is some fat tailed distribution. Why is this? Can I multiply instead?
