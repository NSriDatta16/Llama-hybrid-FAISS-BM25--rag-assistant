The Name field in IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY contains the internal name of the module (i.e. original name that was used while building the module). This is useful in the cases where the actual file itself is renamed. For example, NT kernel that supports PAE is named as ntkrnlpa.exe . But, the Name field in its IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY struct still contains ntoskrnl.exe .
