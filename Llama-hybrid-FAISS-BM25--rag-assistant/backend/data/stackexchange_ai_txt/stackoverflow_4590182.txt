I've been struggling with this for some time now too. Looking at the Android source code, it appears that Google made a transparent activity called QuickContactActivity and placed the QuickContactWindow (the class that creates the popup) inside of that. I tried the same thing and the transparent activity does work but I'm having trouble getting the badge to show up. I know about Qberticus's QuickActions code and I did try it out but I'd rather just use the quickcontacts that google wrote because to duplicate its functionality and looks is pretty challenging. I've also been getting ActivityNotFoundException when I try to use the QuickContact.showQuickContact() method on Eclair - it works great on Froyo though. Here's my question. It would be really awesome if we could work together to get this issue solved: link
