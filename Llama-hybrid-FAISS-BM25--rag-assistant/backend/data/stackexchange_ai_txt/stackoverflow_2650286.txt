The DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit can parse C#, both as full files and in fragments (e.g., the stuff inside the brackets) and can parse HTML both in clean and dirty format (the stuff you really see in HTML files). DMS automatically produces trees ("DOM models") for what it parses. With minor bit of effort, and HTML dialect with would be easy to define, and then one could parse ASPX files. We've done essentially this for PHP already.
