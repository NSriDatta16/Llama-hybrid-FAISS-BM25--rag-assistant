Observations from logistic regression - coefficients, R

Let's say that I generate observations from logistic regression: n But now if I fit a model: df = data.frame(y, x) mod Coefficients I get are: (Intercept) X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 -7.0004768 16.5132458 -0.6912072 11.7006775 1.5552072 7.0992499 It aswell might be a very dumb question showing lack of knowledge, but why are my coefficients returned by glm different than these from b ? A shoot in the dark is that while generating y I rely upon probability given by a binomial distribution, so there is a room for uncertanity. Am I right? In the sense that drawing from binom(4, 0.5) I could get e.x both (1,1,0,0) and (0,1,0,0) .
