Magento CE :: Discount on First Order?

Is there any plausible way to give a customer a discount on their first order? I imagine it would require the user to sign up for a free account, which is fine. But after that, I'm stumped. The Promotion feature in Magento doesn't cater for anything like this and Google doesn't find any good leads. Ideas? :)
