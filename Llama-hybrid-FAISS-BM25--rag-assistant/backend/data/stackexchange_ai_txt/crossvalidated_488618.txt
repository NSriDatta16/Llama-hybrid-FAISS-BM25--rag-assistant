Is it possible to create a binary classifier from bayesian network?

I have a labeled data set consisting of longitudinal data and I would like to train a dynamic bayesian network. The output should be probability of the observation being 1 in a selected step given the evidence. Does this make any sense? I am new to probabilistic models. EDIT from comment: more details on the problem I need an interpretable model, I want to know why did the probability of label switching from 0 to 1 changed compared to previous estimates for the specific individual and why is it higher/lower compared to other individuals. Regarding data: I have groupped individuals for which I have multiple observations of multiple features in time. there is a seasonal trend in some variables, which is different for groups of individuals. More details about the data: Which algorithm suits for classification of multivariate time series data?
