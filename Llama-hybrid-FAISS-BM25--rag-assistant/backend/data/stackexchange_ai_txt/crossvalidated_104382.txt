Image processing with neural network

I am trying to learn how neural networks work on image recognition. I am confused on how to give input to neural network. Let's say I want to find (track) object in sequence of images, in particular the image that come from aircraft travelling, and images captured with camera. Point being that most of objects in the picture look the same. How to track this type of object with neural network? What input should be given to neural network?
