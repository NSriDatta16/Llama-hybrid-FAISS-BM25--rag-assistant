Which service could I use to train my networks?

My laptop's Intel i7 3630QM 2.4GHZ, 8Gb RAM and GXForce 670M are clearly not sufficient... By reading some papers, I've written an SRGAN with Python Keras. At runtime there is no error but training only 2 images (324*324) with 1 epoch, batch size of 2 lasts too much...perhaps more than 1 hour of training... Which service could I use to train my deep neural networks, see the console outputs, eventually see plots, and download the trained model? Are there such paid services? Free services? The idea would be that I query the compute server from my laptop.
