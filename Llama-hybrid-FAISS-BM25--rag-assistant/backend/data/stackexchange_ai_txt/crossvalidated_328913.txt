It depends on what model you are using. If you can write the model as a (nonlinear) autoregression, then yes, LOOCV is ok. It sounds like your model is of the form $$ y_t = f(y_{t-1}, x_t, z_t, \varepsilon_t)$$ where $x_t$ and $z_t$ are exogenous variables and $\varepsilon_t$ is a white noise error process. That would fit within the models discussed in Bergmeir, Hyndman & Koo (2018) , where we prove that under some conditions CV can work for time series models.
