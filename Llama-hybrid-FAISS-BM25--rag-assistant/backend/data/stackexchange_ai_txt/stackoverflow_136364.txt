There's no definitive list. Patterns are discovered, not invented, so there's no organization that can say "this is a pattern" and "this is not a pattern". Even if there were one, it wouldn't be useful for anybody. Despite that, the "famous" patterns are the ones described in Design Patterns, or the GOF book.
