The order of your numbers do not match with the Kahneman quote. Because of this it seems like you may be missing the overall point. Kahneman's point one is the most important. It means literally estimate the average GPA -- for everyone. The point behind this advice is that it is your anchor. Any prediction you give should be in reference to changes around this anchor point. I'm not sure I see this step in any of your points! Kahneman uses an acronym, WYSIATI, what you see is all there is. This is the human tendency to overestimate the importance of the information currently available. For many people, the information about reading ability would make people think Julie is smart, and so people would guesstimate the GPA of a smart person. But, a child's behavior at four contains very little information related to adult behavior. You are probably better off ignoring it in making predictions. It should only sway you from your anchor by a small amount. Also, peoples first guess of a smart persons GPA can be very inaccurate. Due to selection, the majority of seniors in college are above average intelligence. There actually is some other hidden information in the question besides Julie's reading ability at four years old though. Julie is likely to be a female name She is attending a state university She is a senior I suspect all three of these characteristics raise the average GPA slightly compared to the overall student population. For example I bet Seniors' likely have a higher GPA than Sophmores' because because students with very bad GPA's drop out. So Kahneman's procedure (as a hypothetical) would go like something like this. The average GPA for a female senior in a state university is 3.1. I guess that based on Julie's advanced reading ability at 4 that her GPA is 3.8 I guess reading ability at 4 years old has a correlation of 0.3 with GPA Then 30% of the way between 3.1 and 3.8 is 3.3 (i.e. 3.1 + (3.8-3.1)*0.3 ) So in this hypothetical the final guess for Julie's GPA is 3.3. The regression to the mean in Kahneman's approach is that step 2 is likely to be a gross over-estimate of the importance of the information available. So a better strategy is to regress our prediction back to the overall mean. Steps 3 and 4 are (ad-hoc) ways to estimate how much to regress.
