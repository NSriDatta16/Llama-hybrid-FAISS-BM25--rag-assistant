First, let us be strict about what we are discussing. Auto covariance is defined here . Let me assume $\bar{Y}_t \equiv 0$ for all $t$ , just to make life easier. It looks like you are missing an implicit assumption in the calculation of the auto covariance. For the observed time series, stationarity is implicitly assumed. Otherwise, writing $\lambda(u)$ does not make much sense - it has to depend on $t$ !!! Under the assumption of stationarity, the quantity $\lambda(u) = \mathbb{E}[Y_{t+u} Y_t]$ is well defined and does not depend on $t$ . Hence, one can estimate it by averaging lags at different time indices $t$ as you have suggested (again, Wikipedia helps here). BM (contditioned on $W_0 = 0$ ) is a completely different story. It is not stationary and cannot be made statinary! Thus, an autocovariance has to be calculated by averaging over different realizations.
