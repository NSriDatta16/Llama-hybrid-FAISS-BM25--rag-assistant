In version 3, Spring no longer provides the all-in-one Spring jar. Note: The spring.jar artifact that contained almost the entire framework is no longer provided. Source: 2.4 New module organization and build system Depending on your project needs, use org.springframework ${artifactId} 3.0.5.RELEASE where ${artifactId} may be e.g. spring-context (IOC core, standard ApplicationContext implementations) spring-orm (ORM technologies: Hibernate, JPA, (I|My)Batis) spring-webmvc (The Spring Web MVC framework) spring-aop (Aspect-Oriented Programming support) etc. The selected dependencies will pull in their required libraries as transitive dependencies, so you usually just need the "most exotic technology". E.g. if you select Spring MVC and Spring ORM, you also get AOP, TX, Context, Web etc. Reference: Obtaining Spring 3 Artifacts with Maven
