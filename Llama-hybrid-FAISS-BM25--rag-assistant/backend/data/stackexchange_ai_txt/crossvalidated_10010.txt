Classifying spectra

I am currently trying to do the following in R: I have thousands of measured spectra (x,y; see below). Each spectra has one or two peaks. Also I have sets of "training" spectra obtained in more controlled conditions and I would like to know which of my training spectra has the closest match to the measured spectra!? I was thinking that some sort of pattern recognition would be useful but I know too little to make an informed choice as this is a bit outside of my usual work-area What is the most promising way/function in R to do this kind of pattern recognition I want? In case pattern recognition (like PCA) is not the most promising way, what other options are there? I am looking for sample bits of code or literature dealing with this kind of data analysis. EDIT The peak position will most probably always be the same, however the laser used to record the spectra is temperature controlled and slight variations are possible. The intensity will change depending on experimental conditions. The two peaks sould be treated as independet peaks.
