i would say the answer is 'no', you need a different representation to generalise the mod function as opposed to just memorising the mod for a fixed range of numbers. simple solution (make input the correct output) for eg mod 2, you use some kind of recurrent neural net with a single input (0/1) (and sequence of inputs represents increasing powers of 2) then first/last input is the answer.note that this representation handles all integers. since recurrent neural networks are turing complete, in theory there is an rnn that could compute the mod function. whether this is learnable is a different problem!
