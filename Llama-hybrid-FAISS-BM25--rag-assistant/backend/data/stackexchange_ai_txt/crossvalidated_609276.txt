It was developed by Khintchine in Korrelationstheorie der stationare stochastischen Processe, Math. Ann. 109, 604-615. As $\rm [I]$ notes: The second line of development began with a series of papers in 1932-1934 by the Russian mathematician Khintchine who introduced both stationary and weakly stationary stochastic processes and developed the correlation theory for weakly stationary processes [see Khintchine (1934)]. This development was important not only for time series analysis but was also one of the pioneering works in the modern theory of stochastic processes. Later, Kolmogorov (1941a) developed the geometric theory of weakly stationary time series and Cramér (1942) discovered the important spectral decomposition of weakly stationary processes… Reference: $\rm [I]$ The Spectral Analysis of Time Series, Lambert H.
