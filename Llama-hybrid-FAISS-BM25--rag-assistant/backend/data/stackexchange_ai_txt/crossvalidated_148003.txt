What are good values for autocorrelation, Gelman, and cross-correlation in rjags?

I don't want to post my whole code since it is long, so I will only post part of it: model I then checked the Gelman diagnostic, cross correlation, and autocorrelation. gelman.diag(mcmc_samples) crosscorr(mcmc_samples) autocorr.plot(mcmc_samples) For the gelman, the highest Upper C.I. for a variable I got was 1.08. I also got a few values in the .42-.46 range for the crosscorr . Are these acceptable? However, for the autocorrelation, the plots for some variables clearly did not converge to 0. How can I improve this? Do I have to exclude some variables from the regression and MCMC? Or do I have to increase the number of iterations or burn-ins? If so, how do I do that?
