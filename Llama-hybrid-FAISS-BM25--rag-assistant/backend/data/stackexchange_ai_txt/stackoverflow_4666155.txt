Have you tried using memmap file? You can iterate through your input file (in chunks if possible) and convert the incoming data and insert them as rows into a memory-mapped numpy array. The downside is incurring more disk i/o in case there is insufficient main memory and paging from swap becomes necessary. See: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html Another alternative is PyTables. You'll need to construct some special sql-like table, but it's fairly simple. In fact, it provides transparent disk persistence (automated serialization) and hierarchical organization for your data. It also limits the amount of main memory used. See: www.pytables.org/moin/HowToUse Best of luck!
