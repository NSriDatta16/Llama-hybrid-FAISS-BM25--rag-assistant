How to close on pressing X on PocketPC

On PocketPC, when you tap the (X) to "close" the application, it stays open in the background. The only way to close it (without third-party programs) is to go to the settings->memory and close the program. Or you can run other programs so when the PPC gets to no memory it will close the earlier programs. I am developing an application for PPC and I was wondering if there is an elegant way to actually CLOSE the application when user taps the (X) button in the top-right corner. Is there an event raised for this? (Using .NET CF 3.5)
