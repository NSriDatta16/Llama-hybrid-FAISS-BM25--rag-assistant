Yes, I think you would run into major problems. The first one is that the average of two Standardized variables could be absent of meaning. Let's say variable A has a standardized value of - 3.0 and variable B a standardized value of + 3.0. Their average is 0. The average has essentially wiped out the fact that both variables had an extreme value 3 standard deviations away from their respective Mean. The second problem is also associated with absence of meaning when you will average those two variables that have completely different scale. Let's say variable A has a scale that is 100 times greater than variable B. If you average variable A with variable B, the average of variable A at 2.0 and variable B at 0.0 is the same as the average of variable A at 0.0 and variable B at 2.0. But, when you understand the underlying compositions of those two different averages they have a completely different meaning that gets masked by their identical average.
