I've got a part-built visual debugger for spatial algorithms (GIS stuff)... it even sort-of works... at the time I was hacking away at a clipping algorithm, and I thought it would be marvelous to like watch a movie or in slow-mo, or frame-by-frame, and/or set break-points and step through the code; watching it's effect on the geometry... I just never quite got it to do all that... It turned out to be quicker/simpler/easier just to write "the current version of" the geometry out to WKT, and paste it into JUMP (simple open source GIS package)... So I got lazy again... and went back to my real job ;-( However: This "stalled" project lead to the visual debugger aspect of another little project ... one for which a sizable TODO list (difficulties-wise, for me anyway) remains outstanding... and it ain't gonna get shortened this weekend either. So yes you might say I leave a cookie-trail of incomplete projects behind me... just incase I ever feel the urge to quit programming and regain my sanity ;-) I have a short attention span... If a for-fun-project can't be done in a couple of weeks it ain't gonna happen! Cheers. Keith.
