After some more reviewing I came across the following solution: So basically Logistic regression's input is supposed to be numerical values, while the Neural networks (NNs) that I have gave string-based classes. I simply encoded each class to numeric values, (I had 10 classes so 1,2,3..10) and fed these as input to "multi-class logistic regression" and I was able to furthur refine the output from several NNs closer to the ground-truth.
