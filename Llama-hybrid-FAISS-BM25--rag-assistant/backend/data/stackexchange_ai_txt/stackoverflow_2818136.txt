in javascript you may use navigator.userAgent. note that this may vary from browser to browser. a good example how to use it can be found at quirksmode . However be aware that you can edit the userAgentString at any time using the appropriate browser, script or code. so no absolute guarantee on the result - but at least a starting point. cheers, markus
