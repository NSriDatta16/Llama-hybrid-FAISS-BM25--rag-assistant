Using Cross Validation technique for a CNN model

I am working on a CNN model. As always, I used batches with epochs to train my model. When it completed training and validation, finally I used a test set to measure the model performance and generate confusion matrix. Now I want to use Cross Validation to train my model. I can implement it but there are some questions in my mind: 1- Why most CNN models don't use Cross Validation? 2- If I use Cross Validation, how can I generate the confusion matrix? Can I split dataset to train/test and then do cross validation on train set as train/validation (i.e., doing cross validation as train/validation except for the usual train/test) and at last use test set the same way? Or how?
