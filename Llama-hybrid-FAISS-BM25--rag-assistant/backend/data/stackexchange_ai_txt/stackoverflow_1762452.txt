It sounds like your timer code is wrong. If a frame truly did happen in less than 1 millisecond and it rounds down to zero, that's fine, because eventually as time increases that will reach 1 millisecond and you'll see movement, averaging at the proper rate. It sounds like you're trying to measure a frame's duration instead of measuring the time since the same point in the last frame, which will cause you problems if the majority of the time is actually spent outside of your update function (eg. in the vsync mechanism). It also sounds like you might be having rounding issues - show the data types you're using. Dividing a small integer by 1000 will tend to make it into zero and you'll lose any data within it, even if it was 999 before. Often it's best to cast it to a float first before doing the division.
