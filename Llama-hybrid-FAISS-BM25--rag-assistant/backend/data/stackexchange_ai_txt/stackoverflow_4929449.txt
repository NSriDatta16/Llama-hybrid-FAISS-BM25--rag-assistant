Database organization

This isn't much of a coding question as opposed to seeking help on going down the right path. So, I have my users set up with username, password, email, posts, & id. The basic forum stuff. But, if I were to add more, say some games in the website that you play and store data with your forum account (being your account for the whole website, in other words), would it be wiser to add those fields to the existing table (i.e.: game1_money) or make another table for each individual side project, then create and link it to each user upon starting the "game" or whatever it is? If I'm too vague, tell me and I'll try to clarify.
