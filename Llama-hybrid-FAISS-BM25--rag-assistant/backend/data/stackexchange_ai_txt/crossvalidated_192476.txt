Variable importance in regression with large number of missing values

I have a dataset with multiple (approximately 20) categorical and ordinal predictors and a numerical outcome and I am trying to understand which and how each of these predictors affect the outcome (explain the variance or are more correlated with it). Some of the categorical predictors have a large number of levels (e.g. can be a city or a website domain). My problem is that each predictor has a large number of missing values (a bit more than 10-15%) but at different rows. The missing values are missing at random (are not available due to the lack of logging and are not systematically missing). Since I am currently just exploring the dataset, I do not know which of these predictors to keep. I tried to perform some kNN imputation but it did not work because of the large number of missing values. I would like to either use a random forest and look at the variable importances or run some multiple linear regression model (possibly using a Lasso procedure), however the more predictors I add the higher is the number of missing values in the dataset that makes it more difficult to derive any conclusions. Is there any systematic method of dealing with this problem? Being a complete novice, any references would be highly appreciated.
