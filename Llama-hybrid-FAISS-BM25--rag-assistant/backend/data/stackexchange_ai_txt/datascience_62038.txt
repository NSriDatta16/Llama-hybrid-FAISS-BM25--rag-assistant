How to handle missing data in a logistic regression?

I am building a model to solve a binary classification task. So far, the input is low dimensional (10 dimensions at most). I need to face the occurrences of missing input. It is my first time at trying to handle that. I am thinking of doing some feature engineering where I add a binary variable for each dimension taking values 1 if missing and 0 if not. This is a data based solution. Are there canonical ways or known better of handling this in the literature? What are the limitations or weaknesses of my train of thoughts?
