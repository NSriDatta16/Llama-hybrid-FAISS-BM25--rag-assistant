The first visible thumbnails in my tableview fail to appear - using LazyTableImages example as a base

I adapted the code from the LazyTableImages example on developer.apple.com and it all works except that it failed to load the images for the first 4 rows (there are 4 rows visible on load). When I scroll down and stop, the new rows' images are loaded correctly and when I scroll back up, the fist 4 images are also loaded correctly. So the problem is the initial loading. I use fetch controller for loading the table data and it reads from a CoreData database. In my cellForRowAtIndexPath method I added an additional check like this: if (self.screeningsTable.dragging == NO && self.screeningsTable.decelerating == NO && movie.MovieID) { [self startImageDownload:movie forIndexPath:indexPath]; } as to check if the row actually has a valid object yet. So in order to load the images of the first rows, I added [self loadImagesForOnscreenRows] after the data has been loaded from the database, but it doesn't work. Can you tell where I should put the [self loadImagesForOnscreenRows] so the first images are correctly loaded?
