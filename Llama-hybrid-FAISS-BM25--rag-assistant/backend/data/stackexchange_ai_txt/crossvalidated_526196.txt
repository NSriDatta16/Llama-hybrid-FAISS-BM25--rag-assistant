Did the MCMC model converge?

Would you consider model with these MCMC traceplots and R-hat values as converged, and good enough for publication in a peer-reviewed journal? My peers claim convergence is good; the models ran for two weeks already. But by my opinion, the models need much more iterations and thinning and are not acceptable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal as they are.
