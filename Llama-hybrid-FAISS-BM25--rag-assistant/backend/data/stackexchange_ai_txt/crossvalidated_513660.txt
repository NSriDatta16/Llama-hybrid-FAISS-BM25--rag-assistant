How do I chose the right distribution for this specific circumstance?

Posted this on stack overflow and people said its probably more suited for this forum. I am currently generating a panel dataset with random numbers. I simulate a questionnaire where "people" get to answer on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being the best. Creating the data was easy. I used this to get answers where I assume that the average answer would be around 7. In R code variable Now in the panel data I want to create fluctuations in later periods, which is also not too difficult jut changing the probability parameter and then compare them to a historical mean to infer whether the change in wellbeing is statistically different. So my question is: What test do I conduct hypothetically in a real scenario? Since people can only answer from 0 to 10 it is not really normally distributed, however I can choose n to be very high. T-test? And what about confidence intervals? So let's say, the baseline mean of average wellbeing is 7.0 (n=2000 individuals) Some periods in the future a natural catastrophe negatively influences wellbeing and the observations from this period show an average of 6.2. What test will I use to decide if this is significantly different from 7? Any help is massively appreciated!
