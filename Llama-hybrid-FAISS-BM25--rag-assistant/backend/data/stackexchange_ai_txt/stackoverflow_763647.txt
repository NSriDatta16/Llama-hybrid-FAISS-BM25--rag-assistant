SlimDX SDK might be option, if your willing to start a bit from the bottom, its basically a way of giving you access to DirectX from .NET. They also have a collection of samples for you to start from. Ogre - a 3d engine under LGPL or purcache a license garagegames.com - also has a few engines, depending on your language of choice ( Also "low" price. no 500k $ engines here ) Both Ogre and garagegames.com have "old" 3d engines, so you should be able to find either full games or demos so you can check out the performance. Im not familiar with writing cad applications, so when you say you have 3D objects im not sure if thats static or objects that can change while the application is running.
