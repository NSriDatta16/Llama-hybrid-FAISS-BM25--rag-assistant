How can a Windows Phone 7 application register for push service updates when the phone starts?

I have a WP7 app and want it to register for push notifications when the phone starts up? Image I have some kind of messaging app, and don't want to force the user to click the tile to sign in and register for push notifications. Are there any events that happen on startup that would give me access to my application? I'm extremely lazy, and if I had a WP7 phone I wouldn't want to have to click on a ton of tiles just to log in if I have saved my credentials in isolated storage and had the ability to 'sign in when the phone starts'.
