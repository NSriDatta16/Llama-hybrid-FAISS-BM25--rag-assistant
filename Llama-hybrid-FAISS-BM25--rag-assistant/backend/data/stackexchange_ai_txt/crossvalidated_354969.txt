You are misunderstanding the documents linked to. They probably makes an iid assumption for their examples , so that they exclude other cases, they do not make an universal assumption. To use likelihood methods you need to be able to write down a joint density function (or joint probability mass function), and that is simple in the independent case. But it can be done in many cases for models with non-independent observations. Some examples, time series model with serial correlation, an example Beginner learning resources : Pdf and likelihood function for non-Gaussian time series model . Spatial models, I do not find really good examples on site, but here is one: Maximum likelihood fitting of truncated, mixed, two population systems or mixed models, for instance: http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/Sta613/2017/lec/LMM.pdf
