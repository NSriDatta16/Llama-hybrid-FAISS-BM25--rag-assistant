In an LE environment, you would call CEEGTST and CEEFRST to get and free storage. They both take a 12-byte result token as the first parameter -- if you pass null, LE will abend for you on a failure. The second parameter is the address. In the case of CEEGTST, you also pass a third, length, parameter. Example to allocate: Call 'CEEGTST' using omitted address of some-linkage-item length of some-linkage-item End-Call Example to free: Call 'CEEFRST' using omitted address of some-linkage-item End-Call
