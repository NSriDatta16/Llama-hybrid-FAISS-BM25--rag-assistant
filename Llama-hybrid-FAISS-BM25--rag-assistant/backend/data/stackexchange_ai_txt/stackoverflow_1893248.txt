Probability transition matrix

I'm working on Markov Chains and I would like to know of efficient algorithms for constructing probabilistic transition matrices (of order n), given a text file as input. I am not after one algorithm, but I'd rather like to build a list of such algorithms. Papers on such algorithms are also more than welcome, as any tips on terminology, etc. Notice that this topic bears a strong resemblance with n-gram identification algorithms. Any help would be much appreciated.
