@Mark scaling, using client side processing as compared to bigger or more servers reduces cost etc. I'm not sure I would entirely agree with this. It would seem to cost less to buy 1 powerful server and 1,000's of "dum terminals" than an average powerful server and 1,000 of powerful desktop computers.
