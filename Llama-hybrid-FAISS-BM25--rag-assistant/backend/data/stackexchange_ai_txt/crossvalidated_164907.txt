It is not a matter of personal opinion so let's look at some figures on terms appearing on arXiv pages (some random Google queries with few domain-specific terms): cross validation site:arxiv.org returns About 17,800 results monte carlo site:arxiv.org returns About 187,000 results sampling site:arxiv.org returns About 141,000 results forecasting site:arxiv.org returns About 11,300 results regression site:arxiv.org returns About 51,100 results EDIT As @Scortchi noticed, arXiv posts its own statistics. stat category appears in reports for the last three years as below: year submissions % submissions 2014 2025 2.2% 2013 1602 1.7% 2012 1284 1.5% This however may not fully represent the content of published papers since some of them may be highly related to statistics but be tagged as different domain (e.g. as math or cs ). Also, Xi'an's blog could pose as a case study. He writes much about Bayesian statistics and often mentions arXived papers (having their own tag ). It also seems that we mentioned "arXiv" on CrossValidated in 689 posts and comments until now (including here). Does this make it popular or not? Still, hard to say, but for sure thousands of statistics-related papers were posted on arXiv and its popularity is growing.
