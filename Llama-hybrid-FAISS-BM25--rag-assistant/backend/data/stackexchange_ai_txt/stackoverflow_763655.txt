How to build upload functionality into a web page

I've seen a number of different solutions for doing this but I wonder if anyone can suggest which is the most elegant and secure version of letting users upload their own files to a folder on their own shared hosting? ( php.ini etc is out of bounds). Files will be anything up to 100mb in size, so maybe an FTP based solution would be best?
