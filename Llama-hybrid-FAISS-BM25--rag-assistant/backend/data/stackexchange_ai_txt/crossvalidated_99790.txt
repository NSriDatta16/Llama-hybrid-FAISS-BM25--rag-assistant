Why we need single class classification?

I have started learning classification in machine learning. I face two terminologies, one is "single class classification" and a the other is "binary class classification". I am confused about when to use single class classification and when to use binary class classification. My question mainly concentrates on single class classification. Why do we need single class classification?
