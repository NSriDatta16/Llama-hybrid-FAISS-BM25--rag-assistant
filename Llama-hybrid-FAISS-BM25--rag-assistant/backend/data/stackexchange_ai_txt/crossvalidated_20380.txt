If you really want to learn fundamental concept of Bayesian statistics, definitely you should read Bayesian data analysis written by Andrew Gelman. I encourage you do the exercise. You will learn much from it. Doing the math of Bayesian statistics is an important step for you to learn Probabilistic Graphical Models. It seems you are freshman to Bayesian concept. DO NOT read Probabilistic Graphical Models hastily if you have not learnt any basic concept and not familiar with the Bayesian mathematical calculation. you know my suggestion If you have read the video lectures from Stanford provided by Andrew Ng .
