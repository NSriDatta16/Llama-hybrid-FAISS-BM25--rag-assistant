Further information given in comments by the OP suggest that the problem here is separation or quasi-separation since 85+% of the cells formed by a complete cross-classification are zeroes. To answer the original question posed first: the finding of collinearity in the model is not necessarily a red flag as it is sometimes treated. It may not even be an orange alert either. It is conveying important information about the data-set which needs to be looked at before further interpretation is made. This task would certainly need to be undertaken by someone knowing the scientific question and the background to the data-set, information which we do not have. Separation is a topic which has been handed elsewhere on this site and fortunately there is an excellent answer in this Q&A How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? (in my opinion the highest voted answer, not the accepted one is the one to go for if you are short of time to read them all).
