I submitted a bug on the Eclipse site and it was determined that I need to execute Eclipse like so (Assuming Eclipse is installed at c:\eclipse): eclipse.exe -eclipse.keyring C:\eclipse\keyring.txt When Eclipse is first executed my workspace defaults to C:\eclipse\%userprofile%\workspace. For some reason, the user profile can't be determined on the installation of Windows 7 Enterprise Edition that I have. VonC you were on the right track with the parsing issue. Description of what the above command is doing: From what I understand, it sets the Equinox secure storage location. Perhaps your % discrepancy is the cause of your problems, I don't know. Here is the URL to the bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=300577
