What you are observing here is an example of the marginal versus conditional interpretation of the fixed effects coefficients from generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). Namely, in GLMMs the fixed effects have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. For your particular model, and because you have random intercepts only the fixed effect intercept has an interpretation conditional on the random effects. The rest of the coefficients have the usual population-averaged interpretation. You can obtain the marginal intercept by using the transformation: $$\beta_0^M = \beta_0^C + \frac{\sigma_b^2}{2},$$ where $\beta_0^C$ is the intercept you obtain from fitting the GLMM, and $\sigma_b^2$ the variance of the random intercepts. With the new intercept the results are much closer, i.e., betas
