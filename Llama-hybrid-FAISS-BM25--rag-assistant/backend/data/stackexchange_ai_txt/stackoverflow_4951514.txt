Oracle (RAC) vs NoSQL

I am curious if anybody did benchmarks for accessing of data in NoSQL databases vs Oracle (particularly I am talking about Oracle RAC)? The project requires to work with at least 10mil+ of records, search among them (but not necessary have to be real time), the read is very important for speed, and it's also very important to guarantee HA and reliability (can't lose records!!!) I can see for myself how say Cassandra/MongoDB might be better fit (because key value storage will provide faster reads than SQL when you go over 10mil records), but I find difficult to articulate all of them nicely. Any links? Suggestions? Bullet points? Thanks!
