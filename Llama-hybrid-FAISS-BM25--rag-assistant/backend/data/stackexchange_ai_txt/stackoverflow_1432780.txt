Modifying a LGPL licensed image to create iPhone app icons

I would like to use icons under the LGPL license in an iPhone application. I want to modify these icons (size, color or more advanced editing) in order to fit my app requirements. I understand that the modified versions inherit the license. But embedding the app in an iPhone makes it harder to share the images and license files. My questions are : do you credit the authors ? If yes where ? "About" screen ? Where do you put the copy of the GNU LGPL text ? How do you make your modified version available to the community (under the LGPL license) ? Is it acceptable to publish it on the wikimedia commons ? Thanks in advance.
