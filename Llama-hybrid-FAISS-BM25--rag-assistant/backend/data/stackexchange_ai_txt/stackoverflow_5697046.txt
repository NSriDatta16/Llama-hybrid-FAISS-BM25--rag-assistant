Is there a possibility to use cross-platform-solutions additionally or integrate their api

In the recent weeks I have been busy with the issue of cross-platform development. That starts with the problem that I had the feeding to write a wrapper for the communication-API of MoSync (I don´t knew this SDK and others for cpd before). It should be used in our Java environment for instance to easy create a bluetooth-connection to different phones and so on. For me the other question is now, how I can use such SDKs like MoSync, Titanium and others in a existing project? In my opinion it is not possible. Either you develop nativ or with a cpd-framework. I would also be interested in when do you recommend this frameworks (I know already that there are some other threads about this). I personally would say that there isn´t a great future for this SDKs because of technical drawbacks and dependencies. In addition, the market for cross-platform solutions (hybrid, interpreted, cross-compiler) is at least as fragmented as the market for mobile operating systems themselves What are your experiences?
