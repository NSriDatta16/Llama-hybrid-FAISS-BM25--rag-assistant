Magento: save custom address attribute in checkout

This is what i did in my website: Admin->Customers->Attributes->Manage Customer Address Attributes and add a new attribute , the user can see it in his/her profile, under My Addresses option, the new attribute can be edited and is saved when creating a new address, i also can see it in the backend, and edited, until here everything is ok, my problem is in the checkout, i already have the field in the billing and shipping forms and i want the new attribute to be saved when the user click "Place Order" button, but, checkout seems it doesn't know nothing about the new attribute, the attribute is not saved and if i save one value from the user profile checkout doesn't load it in the field. what can i do here?? thanks
