How can I make a html canvas "scroll" indefinitely?

I have a canvas element that automatically fills the entire browser window of the client when loaded. On it you can draw with the mouse, like in the result of any "make a drawing board"-tutorial out there. What I want to do however is to make it so that if you move the mouse to any extreme of the canvas (or maybe select a certain "move"-tool, you can drag the canvas in any direction you'd like), it scrolls. In particular, I want it to be possible to in theory scroll forever, so I can't really pre-generate, I have to generate "more canvas" on the fly. Does any one have any idea on how to do this? If it helps, this is the client-side javascript right now: (the html is just a canvas-tag) $(document).ready(function() { init(); }); function init() { var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas') , ctx = canvas.getContext('2d') , width = window.innerWidth , height = window.innerHeight; // Sets the canvas size to be the same as the browser size canvas.width = width; canvas.height = height; // Binds mouse and touch events to functions $(canvas).bind({ 'mousedown': startDraw, 'mousemove': draw, 'mouseup': stopDraw, }); }; // Triggered on mousedown, sets draw to true and updates X, Y values. function startDraw(e) { this.draw = true; this.X = e.pageX; this.Y = e.pageY; }; // Triggered on mousemove, strokes a line between this.X/Y and e.pageX/Y function draw(e) { if(this.draw) { with(ctx) { beginPath(); lineWidth = 4; lineCap = 'round'; moveTo(this.X, this.Y); lineTo(e.pageX, e.pageY); stroke(); } this.X = e.pageX; this.Y = e.pageY; } }; // Triggered on mouseup, sets draw to false function stopDraw() { this.draw = false; };
