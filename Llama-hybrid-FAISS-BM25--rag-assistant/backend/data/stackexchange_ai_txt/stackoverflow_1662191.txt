That depends, what kind of site your creating, the traffic your expecting etc...Are you going to handle a million requests a second, or 100 a minute...Does your domain justify using a Object Database? Do you really need it? In general, most sites are not heavy hitters so they might not require all the scale out functionality (I believe and this is only a belief that traditional RDBMS have been tested and designed to handle extreme loads where as Object DB's might not have been given the same attention). So then the question is does your domain justify this? Your going to base a core piece of your site on a technology that you will not find a lot of experts in. So how do you handle turn over rate? Are you willing to take the cost associated with training all current and future employees on this?
