How to find the value of a predictor variable necessary to attain a given probability in logistic regression?

I've made a logistic regression model with a categorical response variable of two levels (YES/NO coded as 1/0) and a numerical predictor value (measured in ms). I need to figure out a way to generate the value of the predictor variable (ms) needed to give a probability of $x$ for "YES". For example, what levels of the predictor variable (ms) are needed for the probability to be $0.3, 0.4, 0.5,$ etc.? I have no idea conceptually how to achieve this as I'm pretty new to R . I can include my code if needed but I didn't think it was necessary since essentially what I need is someone to point me in the right direction.
