Is Hidden Markov Model suitable?

I have the following problem I consider to model with HMM. However, it seems to me like a non-standard application or it possibly makes no sense employ HMM. I already have some practical experience with HMM used on time series and quite good theoretical knowledge. Problem: I am observing a continuous, time series-like process, minute data $\{y_t\}$, with bunch of regressors. I want to predict the mean for every hour given the past hour, more accurately, I can use circa past 45 minutes data. So I was thinking of defining the states as whether the hourly mean is greater then zero and otherwise. I would have then a binary state variable. But like this, I can't see how to define a state space model $y_t|x_t \sim p(y_t|x_t)$ $x_t|x_{t-1} \sim p(x_t|x_{t-1}),$ while in my setting, e.g., $y_1, \ldots, y_{60}$ are generated by one state, so the state should last 60 minutes and the transition shall occur at the end of every hour and one state generates 60-observations sequence with 0 probability of transition. The closest problem I can think of is for instance regime detection in financial data, bull and bear market. Thus I don't see some straightforward application of HMM, if at all it is possible, but I would like to use it due its probabilistic interpretation. I wonder, if it is better to define the states like above and transform the problem to classification.. I can also provide more informations if this grabs your attention. Thanks in advance.
