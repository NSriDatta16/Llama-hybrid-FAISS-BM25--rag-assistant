Intuitive 3D Math Resources

I have been trying to find some well presented and explained Vector and Quaternion resources recently to brush up on my 3D skills, and have been having some trouble. Most of the resources I have found tend skip over the high-level reason that performing a particular operation is useful, and dives straight into jargon and proofs that tends to loose my attention rather quickly. I have found that better explained has really good explanations of various math topics, however doesn't have anything for Vectors or quaternions. Does anyone know of any high level Vector and/or Quaternion tutorials?
