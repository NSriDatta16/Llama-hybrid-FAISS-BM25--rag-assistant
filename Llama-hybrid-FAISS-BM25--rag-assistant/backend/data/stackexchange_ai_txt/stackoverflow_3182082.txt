Is rtmp the only way to protect images

I have images that I need to manage access to. I've come across osmf and rtmp streaming which are flash/adobe technologies and would require me to install a special server. Anyone knows of other ways to get the same effect with php. Edit: By "manage access to" I mean that the average user would not be able to save the page and save the image with it. If they want to view the image again, they would have to revisit, re-request it. Flash streaming server offers that, but are there non-flash/adobe solutions to compare it to. Edit: "Give up" is not something you say to your employer who is a publisher and has legal requirements to protect the IP other entities license to them. Sorry, but I don't make management decisions, and I'm not a lawyer. I work in the technical department and need to find the best technical solutions to what's being asked. If it still fails occassionally, I would say this is the best technology has now, and I've given it to you. I don't want to be found personally negligible when I should have done my best. Some people don't seem to have real jobs?
