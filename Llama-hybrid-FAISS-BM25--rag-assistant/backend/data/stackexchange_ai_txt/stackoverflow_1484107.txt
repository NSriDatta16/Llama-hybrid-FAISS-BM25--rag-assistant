The SharePoint web services documentation on MSDN contains several how-tos and walkthroughs. The most important ones from what you've described are: Lists : Retrieving and updating file metadata, checking in and checking out files. Particularly look at UpdateListItems . List Data Retrieval : Query method returns the items in a list. Use a tool such as U2U CAML Query Builder the create the CAML query. If you have trouble finding out how to do something, search this site. Many questions about using the SharePoint web services have already been asked here, e.g. this one for uploading documents . Be warned: relying solely on these web services will probably cause you problems at some point. They are missing a lot of functionality present in the SharePoint user interface and object model. Make sure you test all functionality required with proof of concepts before committing to this approach, or be ready to write a custom web service .
