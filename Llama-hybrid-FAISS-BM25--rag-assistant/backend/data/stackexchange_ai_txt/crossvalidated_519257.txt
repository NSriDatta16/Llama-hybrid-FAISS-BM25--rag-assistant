Sampling distribution: sampling with replacement or without?

The following paragraph occurs in Essentials of Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences(10th edition) : If you actually wanted to construct the distribution of sample means, you would first select a random sample of a specific size (n) from a population, calculate the sample mean, and place the sample mean in a frequency distribution. Then you select another random sample with the same number of scores. Again, you calculate the sample mean and add it to your distribution. Question: Is the random selection/sampling process (highlighted in bold) performed with replacement or without replacement?
