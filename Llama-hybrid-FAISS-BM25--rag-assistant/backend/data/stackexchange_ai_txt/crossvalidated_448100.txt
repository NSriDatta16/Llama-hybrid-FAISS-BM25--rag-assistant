The first thing to note here is that a Moving Average (MA) model is a special case of the ARIMA model that occurs when $p=d=0$ . Thus, if you have evidence that $p>0$ or $d>0$ then this constitutes evidence against the MA model . Any order values above zero constitute a falsification of the MA model, so it is really not terribly important whether you have estimated a large or small (non-zero) order. Note that if you get a large value of $p$ or $d$ then this might mean that there is a trend in the data that is not easily amenable to the auto-regression and differencing in the ARIMA model, which may mean that the model is not a good model for that data. However, even if this is the case, since the MA model is a special case of the ARIMA model, that would mean that both models are performing poorly , and it would still not give a reason to prefer a moving average to the full ARIMA model.
