Calculate correlation between events and signals in time series

I have a time series signal (continuous values) and some events occurring. An event for me is characterized by the fact that it only has a single timestamp assigned to it and not a timespan. Is there any correlation measure to calculate the relationship between the signal and the event? The use case would be, that I want to find out which events are responsible for an increase of the continuous signal, for example. Thanks for any help.
