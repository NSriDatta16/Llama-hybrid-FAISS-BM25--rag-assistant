Lookup jQuery's .post() function. That lets you post to a URL and handle (in a callback function) whatever results the server returns. The server can return some simple data to indicate success or failure, or it can return an HTML fragment to be placed somewhere on the page (under control of your Javascript code), or really anything else you want.
