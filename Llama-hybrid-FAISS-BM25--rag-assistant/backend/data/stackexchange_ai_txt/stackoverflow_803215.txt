If your UI thread is busy for many seconds at a time, then: You won't be able to close a window associated with that UI thread, without peppering your code with Application.DoEvents calls (a bad idea) Your whole UI will be unresponsive during this time. The user won't be able to move any of the application's windows, and if the user drags other windows over the top of it and off again, you'll end up with an ugly mess while the UI waits to repaint itself. Certainly use a System.Windows.Forms.Timer instead of a System.Threading.Timer for simplicity, but more urgently, look at fixing your code to avoid having such a busy UI thread.
