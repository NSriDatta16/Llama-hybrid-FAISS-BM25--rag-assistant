what is the difference between NSP and text prediction

In BERT, NSP (Next Sentence Prediction) is for predicting next sentence based on context and Text prediction task is also for predicting next word or phrases. So, both are for predicting next sentence or word/ phrase only and both are BERT NLP tasks, then why these two?
