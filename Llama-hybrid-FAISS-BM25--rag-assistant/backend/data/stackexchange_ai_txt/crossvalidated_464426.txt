Just to extend the possibilities stated by the accepted answer 1) Yes, it is possible to port RNNs to microcontrollers. An example of a library for doing so is CMSIS-NN . They even have a GRU example and more detailed procedures in its web page, such as how to convert a network . Another possibility is TFMicro , but be aware that currently you will, I could assure, problems quantizing RNNs. However, if you do not quantize it, there shouldn't be any problem. 2) Depending on the easiness that you need I would choose one or another platform. For example, if you want an easy path you can choose a platform supported by TFLite for Microcontrollers . If you want to work on quantization patterns and so, I would, as stated by @Nenovrak, compute the model requirements in terms of size but also in terms of RAM, and then I would choose an appropriate microcontroller with an ARM CPU, juswt to use CMSIS on it.
