Validating power analysis

I'm currently running some experiments in web. The main idea is to validate the impact in some conversion metrics. The typical funnel we have is: Traffic -> Signup -> some Activation event. Our metric of interest is the CVR of some Activation Event. Let's assume a: Traffic -> Event CVR = 1% Signup -> Event CVR = 25% The change in web will happen at the traffic , that means I can't split sellers to Control / Treatment at the Signup phase. Now, I want to get calculate the power sample using Evans Calculator in web, and here's my question: Which CVR should I use? The one from traffic or I can leverage the one from Signup even when the split is happening at the traffic? Once I have the sample size, this sample size means which subjects? Traffic/Signups? Or a combination of Traffic/Signups + Event? Ex. Using data from above, the required sample for Traffic -> Event CVR for a 50% lift (power at 0.8 and alpha 0.05) is 6,650. But 6,650 what, traffic? Note: I know that people LOVES to correct people in Stack exchange, and with good reasons, but I'm not asking for complex things like moving to Bayes, Sequantial Testing, or that this is not even a suitable A/B test. I just want my questions to be clarify. Thanks in advance!
