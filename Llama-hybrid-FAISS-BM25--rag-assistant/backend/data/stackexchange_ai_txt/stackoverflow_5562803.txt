Rails does not throw UnknownAction error when :except/:only options are used in routes

I have a route configuration as follows: map.resources :users, :only => [:new, :create, :edit, :update] When a user tries to access the page http://localhost/users rails should throw an error. I was expecting rails to throw ActionController::UnknownAction error. To my surprise, Rails threw ActionController::MethodNotAllowed error. Similar behavior is seen when :except is used in route configuration. I am relying on ActionController::UnknownAction to display a custom 404 page. In the above scenario I end up displaying a server error page. The problem can be addressed by removing the :except/:only from routes.I am wondering if there is an elegant solution that can work with :except/:only options.
