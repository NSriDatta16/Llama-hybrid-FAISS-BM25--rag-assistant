Long ago, there was a very interesting article series on JavaWorld about " transmogrifying widgets " by Allen Hollub . This serie explain how, using different widgets to sho the same information, a calcoulator can have different styles when viewed with different dimensions. However, for a far simpler (but far less powerful) approach, you should take an in-depth look to GridBagLayout and the (now famous) GBC class. This will give you a fast, and quite elegant, method to resize your whole UI with interesting resizing behaviours (oh and don't forget the associated tutorial ).
