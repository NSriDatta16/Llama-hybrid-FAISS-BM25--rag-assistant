As @whuber said in the comment, it is essentially Pythagorean Theorem . Where Let error $$e=y-X\hat\beta$$ and prediction $$ p=X\hat\beta $$ The first equation is $$ e^Te=\|e\|^2 $$ and second equation is $y^Ty-p^Tp=\|y\|^2-\|p\|^2$. Because vector $e$ and vector $p$ are perpendicular, we have $\|y\|^2-\|p\|^2=\|e\|^2$. Details can also be found in Gilbert Strangs's linear algebra book. Sample chapter here
