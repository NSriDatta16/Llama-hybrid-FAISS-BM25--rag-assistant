I feel like there is no simple way to REALLY answer your question without disregarding some important information about semaphores. People have written many books about semaphores , so any one or two paragraph answer is a disservice. A popular book is The Little Book of Semaphores ... for those who don't like big books :). Here is a decent lengthy article which goes into a LOT of the details on how semaphores are used and how they're intended to be used. Update: Dan pointed out some mistakes in my examples, I'll leave it with the references which offer MUCH better explanations than mine :). Here are the references showing the RIGHT ways one should use a semaphore: 1. IBM Article 2. University of Chicago Class Lecture 3. The Netrino article I originally posted. 4. The "sell tickets" paper + code.
