What are best practices for database setup from a winform client

I have written a winform application that connects to a database on our corporate network. I created the database as I was writing the application. Now itâ€™s time to document the schema and to provide a method of recreation in the event that it is lost for what ever reason. I have been considering that the client application should ask the user if it should recreate it or provide new connection parameters. Note: the current Connection parameters are kept in an obfuscated text file that is included in the application setup. What are best practices for recreation of the database or the storage of the schema. Should the schema be just kept in a text file in the application directory, or should it be embedded in the application as a string resource. Also, does anybody know of a open source application that I could use in documenting the database. Thanks for any assistance or direction you can provide
