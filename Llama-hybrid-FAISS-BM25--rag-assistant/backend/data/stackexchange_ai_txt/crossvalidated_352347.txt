Neural Network: how to learn "Nothing"

I'm working on a neural network for gesture recognition. Let's say I have four different gestures the network can distinguish. How do I design and/or train the network, that the network doesn't output a gesture if the is none or a wrong gesture, for example if the input is just the "background" without a gesture. As I'm using the softmax function at the last layer, the network would always chose one gesture (at random?) even if there is none. I hope my question is clear :) Thanks in advance.
