As I understand it, there's a widespread perception that multithreading is easier than event-driven, since in multithreaded programming every thread has a simple sequential flow of execution, while event-driven consists of lots of small fragments of code. Of course, this is better stated elsewhere, see for example Q.2 of state-threads FAQ .
