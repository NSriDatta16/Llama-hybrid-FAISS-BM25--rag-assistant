SAX parser is the way to go. I've found that SAX parsing can get messy if you don't stay organised. I use an approach based on STX (Streaming Transformations for XML) to parse large XML files. I use the SAX methods to build a SimpleXML object to keep track of the data in the current context (ie just the nodes between the root and the current node). Other functions are then used for processing the SimpleXML document.
