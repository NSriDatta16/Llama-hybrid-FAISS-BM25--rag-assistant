How to Train HMM model with two different sequences using the Baum-Wech algorithm

I am using HMM to visualize drinking gestures of different container types. I began training HMM with one sequence corresponding to one container type, but I want to visualize it with python now with different container types. How can I map different sequences in one model? For the training data do I have to insert them as one sequence (of different container types)?
