Thanks petersendidit. I used a similar sort of idea, but I had to rework it for my dynamic php and AJAX powered site. The key to getting it to work was creating a div on the fly, rather than using an existing one in the DOM. When the user clicks next or previous, the dialog box is destroyed and a new one is dynamically created again. In the example below, I needed a dialog box to page through different students. The students_ids variable are passed from php as a string. eg. stuid1|stuid2|stuid3. The current_student is one of those ids. eg. stuid2. function opendialog_student(url, title, current_student, students_ids) { var $dialog = $(' '); $dialog.load(url + '&student_id=' + current_student); $dialog.dialog({ title: title, modal: true, draggable: false, resizable: false, closeOnEscape: false, position: 'top', width: 800, height: 600, buttons: { "Next Student": function() { students = students_ids.split('|'); for (var i = 0;i }
