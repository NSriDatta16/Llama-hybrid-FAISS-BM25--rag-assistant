there are two different possibilities combining colors: additive mixing (like RGB) subtractive mixing (like CMYK) So in subtractive color mixing the result is what you expected, but there is no blue, instead there is cyan: Yellow + cyan = green In general subtractive color mixing is just "taking away" (filtering) from white while additive color mixing is adding up from black. (base colors of subtractive are inverse from additive: red ->cyan; green->magenta; blue->yellow) So if you start with white screen applying filters: min( white (255,255,255), yellow (255,255,0), cyan (0,255,255)) = green (0,255,0)
