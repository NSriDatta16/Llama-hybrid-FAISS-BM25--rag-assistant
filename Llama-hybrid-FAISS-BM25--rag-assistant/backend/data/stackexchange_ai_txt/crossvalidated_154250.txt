Is continuous inputs an assumption of factor analysis?

Should we use only continuous inputs for factor analysis (FA)? My data is a mix of continuous and categorical inputs: one of the inputs has only 600, 700 and 1000 as values. I found that principal component analysis (PCA) isn't suitable for mixed data but didn't find any FA assumption of continuous inputs.
