fields_for for nested attribute returns nothing

I'm trying to create a nested model form in Rails 3.0.3. Here are my models: class Bird :organism accepts_nested_attributes_for :taxon end class Taxon true end Here's the controller method: def new @bird = Bird.new @bird.build_taxon end And here's the form: New Bird When I run the new method, The fields for taxon don't show up. There's no hint of them in the html source. I've heard that this can happen if the nested model is nil (i.e. if I had forgotten to build it in the controller method), but it's there. I added some conditional code in the view just to make sure. So, who will make me smack my forehead here? What am I missing? Thanks!
