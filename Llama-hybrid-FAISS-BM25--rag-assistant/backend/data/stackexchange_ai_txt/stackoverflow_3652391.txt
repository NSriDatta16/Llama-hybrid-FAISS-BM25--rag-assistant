The Qt documentation of setTitleBarWidget() says: Mouse events that are not explicitly handled by the title bar widget must be ignored by calling QMouseEvent::ignore(). These events then propagate to the QDockWidget parent, which handles them in the usual manner, moving when the title bar is dragged , docking and undocking when it is double-clicked, etc. So I guess you need to add some QMouseEvent::ignore() calls to your MyDockTitle class.
