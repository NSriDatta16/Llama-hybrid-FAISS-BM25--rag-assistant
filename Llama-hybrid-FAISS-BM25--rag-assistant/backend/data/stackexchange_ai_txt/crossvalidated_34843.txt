Bayesian model averaging in R

I have a logistic model that I've built with the nls function in R. I want to use Bayesian model averaging for variable selection, but I can't find a package for that in R. Are there any suitable packages? If not, is it possible to make a not too complicated script for it? Data example: y The model: Sw How would I do Bayesian model averaging on this? I have 190 observations, where about 70 are 1 s and 120 are 0 s. I have 13 variables in total.
