Plot of Probability of Cancer vs Test Sensitivity

I'm looking at the following problem and its solution and am really struggling to understand how they came up with the necessary values. My Questions 1, For part (a) we are asked to plot $y=P(C|+)$ as a function of $x=P(+|C)$ given that P(C)=0.01. The formula (3.87) can then be translated to $y=\frac{0.01x}{0.01x + 0.99P(+|NC)}$ . I don't know what they use for $P(+|NC)$ , nor how it could produce the blue straight line graph that they claim in the solution? I have a similar question about how changing 0.01 to 0.3 will be able to produce the orange curve since it doesn't appear to change the $x$ dependence? 2, Similar problem to above for the second graph - I don't see how we have all the values? Here we use $x=P(+|NC)$ but we don't have $P(+|C)$ ? 3, The claim is that the third graph uses $y=P(C|+)$ and $x=P(C)$ using $P(+|C)=0.9$ and $P(+|NC)=1-0.92=0.08$ . Plotting it on WolframAlpha I get something similar so I can believe this one. However, I would like some explanation of the third paragraph on page 13 which says the biggest information gain is when $P(C) \sim 0.3$ . Presumably this is because there is the biggest "gap" between blue and black curves? And since the black curve corresponds to assigning $P(C|+)=P(C)$ it is basically a useless test that adds no info, right? ** The Original Question and Solution **
