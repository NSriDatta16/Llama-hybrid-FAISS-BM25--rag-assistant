Well, it's basically about keeping JOINs simple - which one is simpler to understand: SELECT p.ID, p.Name, p.City, c.ID, c.Country, c.ISOCode FROM dbo.Parent p INNER JOIN dbo.Child c on c.ParentID = p.ID or SELECT p.ID, p.Name, p.City, c.ID, c.Country, c.ISOCode FROM dbo.Parent p INNER JOIN dbo.Child c ON c.ParentName = p.Name AND c.ParentCity = p.City AND c.ParentCountry = p.Country If you have composite primary keys, anyone joining to your table from a child table must "drag along" all those columns, and all those columns are also going to be present in the child table and the JOIN statements are pretty messy. Much better to have a single (even surrogate) key for the JOIN!
