Weighted average of weigthed data

Consider the following figure where we want to compute the average value on the y-axis. The y-axis is a rate, e.g Km/h. For that we can use weighted average and do something like this (9*35.2) + (41*13) + (24.6*112) + (43.3*5.6) ---------------------------------------------------- = 23.2 (35.2 + 13 + 112 + 5.6) Now, consider that each rectangle has a weight. That means, the weight vector associated with (K1,K2,K3,K4) is (0.21,0.07,0.67,0.035). The question is, how can I get the average value with respect to the weights associated with each part? I would like to call it, double weighted average (!)
