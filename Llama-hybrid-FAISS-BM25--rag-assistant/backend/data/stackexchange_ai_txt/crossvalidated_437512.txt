You should consider the $\epsilon_t$ innovations rather than residuals. In the MA case, you average across the recent innovations, whereas in the AR case you average across the recent observations. Even if the models are stationary and have no deterministic terms, the innovations and the observations are different. For example, suppose the $\epsilon_t$ are i.i.d.. Then, in the MA(1) case, the covariance between $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$ is still positive! However, the covariance between $x_t$ and $x_{t-2}$ will still be zero. In the AR(1) case on the other hand, all autocorrelations are nonzero but decaying exponentially.
