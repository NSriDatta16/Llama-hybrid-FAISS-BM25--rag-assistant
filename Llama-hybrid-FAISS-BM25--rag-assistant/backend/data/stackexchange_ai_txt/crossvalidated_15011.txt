Generate a random variable with a defined correlation to an existing variable(s)

For a simulation study I have to generate random variables that show a predefined (population) correlation to an existing variable $Y$ . I looked into the R packages copula and CDVine which can produce random multivariate distributions with a given dependency structure. It is, however, not possible to fix one of the resulting variables to an existing variable. Any ideas and links to existing functions are appreciated! Conclusion: Two valid answers came up, with different solutions: An R script by caracal, which calculates a random variable with an exact (sample) correlation to a predefined variable An R function I found myself, which calculates a random variable with a defined population correlation to a predefined variable [@ttnphns' addition: I took the liberty to expand the question title from single fixed variable case to arbitrary number of fixed variables; i.e. how to generate a variable having predefined corretation(s) with some fixed, existing variable(s)]
