auto.arima model with many regressors

I am trying to forecast a seasonal series with 30 regressors using auto.arima. I have several questions regarding the correct methodology that I need to pursue. 1) Should I fit auto.arima with all available regressors and pick those regressors with significant t-statistics? 2) Should I fit regressors one by one (and all combinations) with auto.arima and pick the model with the lowest AIC? 3) Should I use PLS (partial least squares, supervised) to reduce the dimension of regressors first and only use relevant ones as regressors with auto.arima? 4) Should I use PCA (principal component analysis, unsupervised) to reduce the dimension of regressors first and only use relevant ones as regressors with auto.arima? Thank you in advance for your guidance. Arsa
