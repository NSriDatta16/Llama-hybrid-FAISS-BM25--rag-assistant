Conditional probability under two given variables

I am reading the online open textbook called Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning . In the chapter 2.1, it mentioned the equation 2.5, which is: $$p(w|y,X) = \frac{p(y|X,w)p(w)}{p(y|X)}$$ where $w$ is parameters; $X$ is design matrix; $y$ is label. My question is that do we assume random variable $w$ and $X$ here are independent, i.e. $p(w) = p(w|X)$ ? Otherwise, based on the source ( https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2613161/conditional-probability-on-two-variables ), $p(w)$ should be $p(w|X)$ . Could anyone help me?
