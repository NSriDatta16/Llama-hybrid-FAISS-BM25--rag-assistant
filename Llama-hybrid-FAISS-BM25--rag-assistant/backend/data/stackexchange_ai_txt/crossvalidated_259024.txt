I suppose you work with the standard (frequentist / classical) methods. In that case "we use the point estimate and confidence intervals to come up with a range within which the population estimate may lie" is not a correct statement. Confidence intervals have to do with the sampling procedure . If you would take many samples and calculate a 95% confidence interval for each sample, you'd find that 95% of those intervals contain the population mean. If you have only 1 sample (thus 1 confidence interval), you can't say how likely it is that the population mean is in it. It is, or it is not. "We can repeatedly keep taking the sample means....we would generally observe a normal distribution called the sampling distribution of mean. The mean of this distribution would be a better estimate of the population mean" Of course. More samples = more data = better estimate. Even better would be not taking samples but examining the total population . In reality this is not practical, hence the samples. *"What if that particular sample mean was like an outlier in the sampling distribution of mean? In that case, doing +/- 2*SE wouldn't be a good judge to measure population mean right?*" True. Therefore I am convinced that the Bayesian method is better suited for answering real life questions. You start with modeling all the information that you have before you take your samples (this is called the prior ), then you take your sample and you calculate the most likely range of the population mean, given your prior and your data.
