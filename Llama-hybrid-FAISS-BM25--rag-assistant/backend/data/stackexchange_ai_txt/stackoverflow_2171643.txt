Different NSTimeZone names being returned

I've noticed that on some devices the NSTimeZone 's name method for a particular timezone can return different values. When testing the Brisbane time zone, my device returns @"Australia/Brisbane" whereas another user's device returns "Etc/GMT-10" . Both iPhone's are running 3.1.2. The Date and Time Programming Guide for Cocoa states that: timeZoneWithName : The name passed to this method may be in any of the formats understood by the system, for example EST, Etc/GMT-2, America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires, Europe/Monaco, or US/Pacific, as shown in the following code fragment. I'd just like to know what could determine which value is used? The device? The language?
