Confidence interval for the maximum likelihood estimate of the minimum of a left truncated exponential distribution

I am currently working on a problem in which I have observations $y_{i}$ that are distributed, $y_{i} \sim \textrm{Exponential}(\beta = ax_{i})\cdot T[b, \infty)$ where, $\beta$ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution, $T$ describes that the Exponential distribution is left-truncated to the interval $[b, \infty)$ , and I have observations of the independent variable $x_{i}$ associated with each observation $y_{i}$ . My goal is to estimate the parameters, $a$ and $b$ . I can do this in a Bayesian framework and get credible intervals for both parameters easily. However, I'd like to also be able to fit this model in a maximum likelihood framework. My main issue is getting a confidence interval on $b$ . As with most minimum/maximum problems, I know the maximum likelihood estimate for the minimum of the distribution, $b$ , is likely to be the minimum observed $y_{i}$ . Furthermore, I know that the minimum value of $y_{i}$ provides a maximum for $b$ . If I fix $b$ to be the minimum $y_{i}$ , I get sensible estimates and confidence intervals of $a$ using standard software for maximum likelihood estimation (the 'bbmle' package in R using the function 'mle2'). However, I'm having trouble coming up with a way to get a confidence interval or lower interval value for $b$ . I've found a paper 'Some theorems relevant to life testing from an exponential distribution' by Epstein and Sobel (1954) in The Annals of Mathematical Statistics ( https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177728793 ) that describes a lower interval estimate when samples are iid from a left-truncated or 'two-parameter' exponential distribution, but, in my case, the observations are not iid. Any help in constructing a confidence interval or lower interval estimate for $b$ would be greatly appreciated whether anyone has an analytical or computational solution.
