Ahh! I'm sorry, didn't mean to vent my frustration on you guys. But I have been at this for hours now it seems. Like i mentioned this code works but since my server is picky I can't user the 5.3 syntax I coded. This is my attempt to make it work on the 5.0 php my server has. In particular I think there is something wrong with the mkdir() and the unlink() functions. if you go to www.helixagent.com log in with test/test then in the url go to /upload2.php then you will see the errors its throwing at me. well, it works perfect if i use 5.3 and DIR but since I'm on 5.0 i tried a different method the errors i get are Warning: move_uploaded_file(./uploads/saiyanz2k/images/banner/azumanga-wall.jpg) [function.move-uploaded-file]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /services7/webpages/util/s/a/saiya.site.aplus.net/helixagent.com/public/upload2.php on line 112 Warning: move_uploaded_file() [function.move-uploaded-file]: Unable to move '/services/webdata/phpupload/phpVoIEQj' to './uploads/saiyanz2k/images/banner/azumanga-wall.jpg' in /services7/webpages/util/s/a/saiya.site.aplus.net/helixagent.com/public/upload2.php on line 112
