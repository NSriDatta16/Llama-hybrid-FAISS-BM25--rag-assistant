I find that Ruby on Rails' convention over configuration makes doing the right thing easier. But that certain libraries such as ActiveRecord can make it really easy to do something really expensive without meaning too. I feel like the primary difference between the two is that Rails is more organized by default and php, being a language not a framework , is not. Which makes it far easier to produce monolithic hunks of code which bloat and bloat and never get fixed. It might be worth investigating some of the MVC frameworks for php before deciding to migrate to RoR. Two of the ones that I tinkered with were Symfony and SolarPHP . CakePHP also aims to be Rails in php but I have not worked with it myself. I think one of the biggest mistakes a developer can make is trying to learn Rails without first learning Ruby. Trying to learn both at once was extremely counter-productive for me and I fared much better after tinkering in Ruby for a few weeks before even touching Rails.
