Multiple Linear Regression for House Price Prediction score is 0.28

I am trying to make predictions using this dataset What I have done so far: Dropped the Administrative column Encoded the categorical data using OneHotEncoder() and ColumnTransformer() Split the test and training data Standard scaled the data (I did it to all the columns for matrix of features). Applied LinearRegression score with x & y train is 0.05 Score with DecisionTreeClassifier is 0.92 I have seen online most people uses LinearRegression for this kind of prediction which is not working well me for me any help would be appreciated.
