How can I query the enable status of a plugin in nose?

I'm currently trying to see if a nose plugin is enabled from within my test harness. The specific thing I'm trying to do is propagate the enable status of the coverage module to subprocess executions. Essentially when --with-coverage is used, I want to execute the subprocesses under the coverage tool directly (or propagate a flag down). Can this be done?
