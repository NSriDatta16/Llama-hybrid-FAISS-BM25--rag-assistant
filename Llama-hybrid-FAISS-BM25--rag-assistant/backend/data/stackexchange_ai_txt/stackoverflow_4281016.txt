If you alloc, retain or copy an object, it is your responsibility to release it. Everything else is dealt with by the system and will be flushed with the auto release pool. There are way too many memory management questions on SO already, have a quick look around to get yourself acquainted https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=memory+management+iphone [edit] Probably the most important part of your question that you need to understand is in your second last paragraph: I was following a book and a scrollView was released before setting properties and adding a subView (but after being inserted in the main view). I haven't seen this code but it is likely that you added the scrollView to your UIView instance. In these cases, the receiving view always retain its subview(s) so you are free to release it. Once the UIView instance is released it wil also send a release message to all its subviews, which includes the scrollView. Makes sense?
