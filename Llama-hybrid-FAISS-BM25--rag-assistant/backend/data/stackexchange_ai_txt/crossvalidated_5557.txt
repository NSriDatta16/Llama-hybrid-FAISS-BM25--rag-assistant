The two key elements that you need to be familiar with before working through this exercise are: The sampling distribution of a mean: in your case, the average of your four measurements will follow a normal distribution, with a mean that equals that of the parent distribution but with a standard deviation of $3/\sqrt{4}$. How to translate probabilistic assertions in terms of the underlying Probability Density Function : given that there is an infinite number of possible PDFs for a distribution described by two parameters (its location and shape), it is often more convenient to work with the standardized normal distribution which is simply $\mathcal{N}(0;1)$, because if $X\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu; \sigma)$, then we know that $Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\sim\mathcal{N}(0;1)$. Then, you just have to figure out how to find $z_1$ and $z_2$ such that $\Pr(z_1\leq Z\leq z_2)=1-0.01$. It often helps to draw the graph of $\Pr(Z\leq z)$ which is bell-shaped, centered on its mean, and whose total area equals 1. For instance, for a given quantile $z_1$, $\Pr(Z As the total area equals 1, the remaining (unshaded) area equals $1-p_1$. Likewise, you may readily express any bounded area as a sum or difference of such inequalities.
