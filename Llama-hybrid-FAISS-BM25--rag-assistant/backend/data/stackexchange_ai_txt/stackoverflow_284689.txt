My recommendation to people is to use property's wherever possible. If you are working in a framework, the ability to use non-fragile instance variables in the modern runtime is a huge bonus and if you aren't, properties make it clear how your ivars are to be managed (assigned vs retained vs copied). There isn't an inherent performance loss from declaring a property other than the time it takes to write the line of code (I actually use a TextExpander snippet to do this for me) but the potential for preventing bugs is large enough that it becomes a fantastic best-practice. If you do plan to user properties for private ivars, you can do so inside your implementation file via an @interface block. For example @interface MyObject() @property(retain) NSArray *myArray; @end
