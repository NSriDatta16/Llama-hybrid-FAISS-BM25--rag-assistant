Encoding necessary for numerical data that can be summarised into a few groups

I have an input parameter that have 200 values. However, among the 200 values, there are only 3 distinct values. For example, like this: X1 10 14 14 10 22 22 10 10 14 . . . Should I treat this parameter as a categorical input and encode it before feeding to a neural network model? However, if the parameter is treated as a categorical input, then it cannot accept any new values? So do we still consider it as numerical input?
