If you mean that you wish to extend the form (in the designer) to the left in order to make space for new controls, I don't believe you can do it - you need to drag out the right side of the frame, then select all the other controls (just drag around them all with the selector tool) and then drag them to the right (you can also move them with right arrow key to ensure they stay at the same Y position).
