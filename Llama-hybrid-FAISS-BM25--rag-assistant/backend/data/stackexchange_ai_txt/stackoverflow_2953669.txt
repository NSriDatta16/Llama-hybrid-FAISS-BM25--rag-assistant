Not using const can mean someone in a team project could declare where int FORTY_TWO = 42 and make it equal FORTY_TWO = 41 somewhere else by another team member. Therefore the end of the world happens and you also loose the answer to life. with const although none of this will ever happen. Plus const is stored elsewhere in memory, when compared to the storage of normal variables, and is more efficient.
