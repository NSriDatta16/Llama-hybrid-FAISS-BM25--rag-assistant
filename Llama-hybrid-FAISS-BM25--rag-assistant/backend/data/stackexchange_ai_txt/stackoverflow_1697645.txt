Could always check out the types in GHCi/HUGS, as the first steps in the tutorial encourage you to download GHC/HUGS. Prelude> :t (:) (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a] Prelude> :t (++) (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a] From their respective types, it's quite easy to deduce their usage. PS: http://haskell.org/hoogle/ is awesome.
