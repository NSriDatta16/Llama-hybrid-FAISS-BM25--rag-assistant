What is the point of an auto-ptr if you only use its internals as a storage location? Yes, pass it to the function. Or do away with it entirely, if you really don't want it. Presumably the function needs it to pass along ownership to something else. It sounds like maybe the alternative you're looking for is much simpler: void ClassA::ExportAnimation(CAnimation &animation) // no pointer // calling method: void classB::someMethod() { CAnimation animation(1,2); // no pointer ClassA classAInstance; classAInstance.ExportAnimation(animation) // no ownership tranfer ... do some more stuff // object dies here, no earlier, no later }
