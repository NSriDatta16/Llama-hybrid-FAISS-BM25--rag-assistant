The easiest thing to do is probably to use os.mkfifo() to create a file pair, add the read end to the select() call, and then write to the write end when you want to unblock. Also, you might want to consider just adding a timeout to the select() call; I can't imagine that you'd be doing enough during the unblocked time to drag performance down.
