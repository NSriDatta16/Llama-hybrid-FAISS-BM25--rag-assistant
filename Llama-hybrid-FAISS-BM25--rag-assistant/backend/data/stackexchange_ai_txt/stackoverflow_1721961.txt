R statistical package: wrapping GOFrame objects

I'm trying to generate GOFrame objects to generate a gene ontology mapping in R for unsupported organisms (see http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GOstats/inst/doc/GOstatsForUnsupportedOrganisms.pdf ). However, following the instructions literally doesn't help me. Here's the code I execute (R 2.9.2 on ubuntu koala 64 bit) library("AnnotationDbi") library("org.Hs.eg.db") frame = toTable(org.Hs.egGO) goframeData = data.frame(frame$go_id, frame$Evidence, frame$gene_id) goFrame = GOFrame(goframeData, organism = "Homo sapiens") However, when i try to map my dataframe into a goFrame object, I get this mistake Error: could not find function "GOFrame" I'm pretty sure the GOFrame wrapper is in the AnnotationDBI library, so I'm puzzled. Any help is extra appreciated :-)
