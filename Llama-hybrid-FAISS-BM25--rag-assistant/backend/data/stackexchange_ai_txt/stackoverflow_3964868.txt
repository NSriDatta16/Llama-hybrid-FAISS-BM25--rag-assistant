magento hide buy now button if stock level = 0

We have a custom attribute that our previous developer (recently disappeared) has created in the magento admin area. This is a getIn_stock attribute which is reading from the point of sale system to check stock levels. It is returning either a 1 (in stock) or a 0 (out of stock). I have been digging around to see how I can display different content based on the output of this attribute. I found a thread that was based on the product price equaling 0 and tried to use it on the getIn_stock attribute but no luck. The following displays 'In Stock' even if the attribute returns a value of 0. getIn_stock==0): ?> In Stock Any advice would be a great help. Thank you in advance :)
