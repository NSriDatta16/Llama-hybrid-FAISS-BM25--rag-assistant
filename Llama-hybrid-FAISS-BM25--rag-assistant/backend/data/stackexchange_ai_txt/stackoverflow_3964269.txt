FOP crashes if you have more footnotes than you can fit on a page. The simple solution to my problem is to make sure I always have enough space to fit footnotes through, by adding an extra blank page as a safety so my footnotes can flow freely. I'm pretty sure there's a more elegant solution out there, but for my needs it's simpler to add a page there and delete it manually if I need to later on.
