Evidence for data mining (specification search) in published results

Is there an established way to assess the prevalence of data mining (as in specification search, not in the machine learning sense) in academic publications? I vaguely remember hearing something about meta studies plotting p-values against sample-sizes or something of that sort, but I can't seem to find a single reference and fail to see right-away why this would be informative.
