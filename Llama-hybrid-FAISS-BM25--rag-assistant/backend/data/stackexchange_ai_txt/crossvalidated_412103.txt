Forecasting time series data using EEMD based SVM?

Splitting of Dataset: Dataset = Train1 + Test1 EEMD(Train1) = train1 + test1 I am forecasting on time series data("Dataset") using SVM . First I found the Intrinic Mode Function(IMF) of time series data (training dataset, Train1 ) using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) .Let's say I got 8 IMF (including resudial). Test dataset( Test1 ) is kept apart for only testing with final prediction. Now I divided each IMFs into training( train1 ) and testing dataset( test1 ). Then trained 8 different SVM (SVR) model (8 IMFs and 8 SVR model) using sklearn (as it is shown in image - step 2 ) Then forecasted as many data points as the number of elements in test dataset (Test1) using corresponding SVR model and IMF dataset (train1) on which it was trained. So now I have forecasted on each IMF. Step 2 is complete. For step 3, I am confused. Confusion 1: What dataset(either Train1 or train1) should I use for training the SVM in step 3? Or Should I use one of the 8 (already) trained model from step 2. Confusion 2: It is written following for doing step 3 in the paper - Use SVM to combine the prediction result of each IMF and residual component and generate an aggregated result as the final prediction of the original time series How can I "combine" using SVM here? Does it mean to use forecasted data from step 2 as 8 input features (X) for SVM in step 3? What should be input(X) and target(y) for training SVM in step 3. I have never done ensembling before. Following is the screenshots from the paper:
