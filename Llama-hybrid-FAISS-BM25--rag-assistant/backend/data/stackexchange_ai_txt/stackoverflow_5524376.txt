Slide down menu with check boxes in android

I've been looking around and searching all over the internet on how to do this. I am really baffled here because I don't think this is a built-in widget for the android API. What I am trying to build is a "list" of items that when an item is clicked, it shows a series of check boxes below it. An example on my EVO is the "News" application when you go to "Add Feeds". I'll try and draw it out here: BEFORE NEWS IS PRESSED: News > AFTER NEWS IS PRESSED: News (arrow points down) CNN.com (checkbox) Yahoo.com (checkbox) I'm sure this has to be custom made but I don't know where to start. Any help is appreciated. Here are the links to the images: Before: After:
