One (perhaps too fancy) alternative is to draw a single polygon that bounds the circle (say, a quad), and then use a fragment program to discard the fragments. This would not be entirely trivial to write, but I would bet it's the fastest way. You would simply pass the circle parameters to the fragment program and discard the fragment if the distance from the fragment center to the center of the circle is bigger than the desired radius.
