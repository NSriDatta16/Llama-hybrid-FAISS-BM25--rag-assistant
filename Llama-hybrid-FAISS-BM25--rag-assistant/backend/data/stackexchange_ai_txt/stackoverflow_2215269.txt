Rails Hash with several object attributes. How do I save them all?

I get hash from a fields_for that looks like this: "affiliation_attributes"=>{ "11"=>{"volunteer_id"=>"14", "affiliationtype_id"=>"1", "organization_id"=>"1"}, "1"=>{"volunteer_id"=>"1", "affiliationtype_id"=>"3", "organization_id"=>"1"}, "4"=>{"volunteer_id"=>"2", "affiliationtype_id"=>"3", "organization_id"=>"1"}, "21"=>{"volunteer_id"=>"20", "affiliationtype_id"=>"1", "organization_id"=>"1"} The first number ( like the 11 ) is the affiliationtype_id and the values next to it are the attributes of it. What I want to do is to save all those Affiliationtypes. How can I do that? Thanks in advance.
