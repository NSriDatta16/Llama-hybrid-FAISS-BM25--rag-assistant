$\newcommand{\fractionBallsRight}{\text{fractionBallsRight}} \newcommand{\BallsToRight }{\text{BallsToRight }} \newcommand{\TotalBalls}{\text{TotalBalls}}$ Let us analyse what happens in both cases. First, your data is in a data table (let's call it Data) with columns: $\BallsToRight, \TotalBalls, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where the $x$'s are explanatory variables. Let's add an extra column: $\fractionBallsRight = \frac{\BallsToRight}{\TotalBalls}$. Linear regression In the linear regression case you try to estimate $\fractionBallsRight = \sum_i \beta_i x_i + \beta_0 + \epsilon$ where some assumptions must be fullfilled. In R this can be estimated by: lm(fractionBallsRight ~ x1 + x2 + .. + xn + 1, data=Data) Logistic regression for grouped data Probably it is good to first take a look at Interesting Logistic Regression Idea - Problem: Data not currently in 0/1 form. Any solutions? What is estimated in this case is the equation $\fractionBallsRight = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\sum_i \beta_i x_i + \beta_0)}}$. Clearly this is a completely different equation than the one with the linear regression, therefore the coefficients and their standard errors will be different. The 'logistic regression equation' can be 'linearised', after some manipulations you will find that $\log\!\left( \frac{\BallsToRight}{1-\BallsToRight}\right)=\sum_i \beta_i x_i + \beta_0$, which again shows that the equation for logistic regression and the one for linear regression are completely different (the right hand side is linear in both cases, but the dependent variable is completely different), and therefore the estimated coefficients and their standard errors will also be different. The R-code for the logistic regression for grouped data is glm(cbind(BallsToRight, TotalBalls-BallsToRight) ~ x1+x2+ ... + xn+1, data=Data, family=binomial) Note that, as @gung correctly said (+1), the estimation method for the linear model is OLS and for logistic regression it is maximum likelihood. It depends on the data, but at first glance I would suggest to use the logistic regression variant for the reasons you mentioned (OLS assumptions are violated).
