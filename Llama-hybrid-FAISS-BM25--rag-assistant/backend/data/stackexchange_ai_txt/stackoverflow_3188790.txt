Flash game data storage

I'm storing a variety of variables containing statistics, items weapons, etc in a flash based game. Currently I'm using PHP and AMFPHP as a backend, calling services to pull the data. This is fine for my own machine, even my own website, however if I want to deploy the game to a site such as Kongregate or ArmorGames, what storage method can I use at that point? I have a small preference of continuing to use a database such as MySQL because I spent some time designing the ER diagram and schema, but if I have to store in a flat file, I can do that too. I'm especially interested in others who have deployed games which have data storage (such as inventory, characters, classes, items, mobs) external to their game. Edit: Looking for answers as to whether people use remote services or another solution for deploying their games to sites such as this.
