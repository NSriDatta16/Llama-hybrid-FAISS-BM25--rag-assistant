Compare Residual Standard Error / r-squared to Accuracy

Using machine learning and having a data set with a target that can be both seen as a numerical value or a class, how could you compare the outcomes of the two possible type of models. For example: Model A sees the target as a class and makes predictions that have an accuracy of 72%. Model B sees the target as a numerical value and end up having an R^2 of 0.4646. How would you explain in this case what the best model too choose is, model A or model B?
