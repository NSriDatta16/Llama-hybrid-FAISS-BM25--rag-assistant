Misunderstanding of use of standard deviation across groups

I'm trying to understand standard deviation. I understand how to determine standard deviation across a group, but I am not understanding using standard deviation to compare groups. Am I attempting to use the correct tool? For example, group 1, 2011, for 10 people, these are the results: 99 98 91 89 88 74 74 72 67 56 average = 81 Variance = 18 17 10 8 -7 -7 -9 -14 -25 324 289 100 64 49 49 81 196 625 1777/10 = 178 so stdev = 13 Group 2, 2012, for 10 people, these are the results: 99, 91, 90, 88, 87, 86, 84, 83, 74, 65 average = 85 variance = 80 stdev = 9 1) If we assume that the tests were similarly hard, but may have slightly different questions, would it be correct to assume both students with 99 have the same ability? Or should I be comparing apples to apples by adjusting both sets of scores to a set average, say, 80? If I need to adjust, what do I do to compare fairly, and what is it called?
