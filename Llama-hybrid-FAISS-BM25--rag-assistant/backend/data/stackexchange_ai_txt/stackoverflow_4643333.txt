Not very elegant but as this is a one time task. WHILE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.tables where is_ms_shipped = 0) EXEC sp_MSforeachtable 'DROP TABLE ?' Works fine on this simple test (clearing a on the second loop after failing on the first attempt and proceeding onwards to delete b ) create table a ( a int primary key ) go create table b ( a int references a (a) ) insert into a values (1) insert into b values (1)
