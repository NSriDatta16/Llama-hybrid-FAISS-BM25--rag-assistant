A Better Way To Write this Bash Script?

This solution (listed below) works, but it doesn't look like the most practical of solutions. What I want to do is populate a folder with children with a name t_###_u and then fill those child directories with two files (one of which should be renamed to parent directory name and appended with a .c) Can anyone post a better, more elegant solution? for i in {1..100} do mkdir `printf "t_%03d_u" $i`; cp ./templates/* `printf "t_%03d_u" $i`; mv `printf "./t_%03d_u/template.c" $i` `printf "./t_%03d_u/t_%03d.c" $i $i`; done echo "Did it work?" Thanks for any help in advance.
