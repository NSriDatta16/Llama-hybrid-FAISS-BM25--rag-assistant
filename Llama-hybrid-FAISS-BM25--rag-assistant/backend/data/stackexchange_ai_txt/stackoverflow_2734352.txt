Get the coordinates of a drop event in Javascript?

I made a Javascript library that lets me drag a marker from a dragzone to one or more dropzones. The problem is... the mouseup event happens over the marker I'm dragging, not the dropzone. How can I detect in which dropzone was the marker dropped, and in what coordinates? Here's my script: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/186012/demos/dragger/drag.html
