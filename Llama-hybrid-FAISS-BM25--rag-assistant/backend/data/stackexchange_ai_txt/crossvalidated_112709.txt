By its construction the logistic regression models predicts probabilities, $$\hat P(Y =1 \mid X=x_0) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{\{\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} x_0\}}}$$ The proportion of $Y=1$ in the test sample of size $n$, with all $x$'s equal, is a different estimator of the same conditional probability , denote it $\hat p_{1|x_0}$. Why the performance of the logistic regression model should be judged against $\hat p_{1|x_0}$? What $\hat p_{1|x_0}$ has in favor of it, so as to function as a test for the validity/adequacy of the logistic regression approach? Well, one could argue that it is non-parametric and even "non-distributional" since it directly estimates a theoretical (conditional) moment from the sample using a method-of moments principle, without making the additional assumptions the logistic regression model does -and each assumption may be a source of misspecification... These are valid points, but test the validity of a model based on how does it predict a single point of the theoretical distribution? No, that's mistaken. Assume that we knew the true probabilities . Then, it wouldn't tell us much if the estimated probability from logistic regression was "away from" or "close to" a single true probability. The inappropriateness of using a single probability increases when we want to pit our model against another estimate, and not the actual probability. As the OP states, with small sample sizes, the accuracy of $\hat p_{1|x_0}$ cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of its "robustness" to misspecification that may haunt the logistic regression model. We should be able to compare how our model does by predicting many different probabilities, not just one. We should form the estimated probability distribution and then measure the distance of it from the true one, by some suitable metric. With large test sample sizes, each based on a given value for the regressor, then, indeed we could more validly evaluate the predictions of our model against the many $\hat p_{1|x_j}$ estimated probabilities.
