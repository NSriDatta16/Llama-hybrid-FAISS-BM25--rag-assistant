The reason why you in theory need a Content-Style-Type setting is for inline style attributes: What styling language is that in? Unlike with and tags there is no type attribute mechanism to tell the browser what language that is: hence the document-global Content-Style-Type. The same applies to Content-Script-Type and inline event handler attributes: What language is that? It's actually equally valid in JavaScript and VBScript; in IE it could be either. In theory, you should give the browser a Content-Script-Type header/meta to tell it. Even with plain old JavaScript, you might want to change the dialect by setting type parameters such as text/javascript;version=1.6 or e4x=1 (if you wanted to use E4X XML literals, which you don't because they're a vile mistake). In practice, none of this is of any use whatsoever, since the default CSS is the only style language you can actually use, many browsers don't pay any attention to Content-Style-Type anyway, and no browser pays any attention to Content-Script-Type . (Ah well, who needs inline style and event handler attributes anyway?)
