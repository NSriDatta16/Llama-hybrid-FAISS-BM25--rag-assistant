How to conduct an A/B test on time series

Assuming I have time series for different for some consumers visiting a website. The time series would look something like this: import pandas as pd foo = pd.DataFrame({'user_id':[1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3, 4,4,4,4], 'time': [1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4], 'clicked': [0,0,0,1, 0,1,0,1, 0,0,0,0, 1,1,1,1], 'group': ['control','control','control','control', 'control','control','control','control', 'treatment','treatment','treatment','treatment', 'treatment','treatment','treatment','treatment']}) foo user_id time clicked group 0 1 1 0 control 1 1 2 0 control 2 1 3 0 control 3 1 4 1 control 4 2 1 0 control 5 2 2 1 control 6 2 3 0 control 7 2 4 1 control 8 3 1 0 treatment 9 3 2 0 treatment 10 3 3 0 treatment 11 3 4 0 treatment 12 4 1 1 treatment 13 4 2 1 treatment 14 4 3 1 treatment 15 4 4 1 treatment which indicate if a user_id , clicked on a banner at a specific time . Lets assume that at time >=3 I changed the position of the banner, but only for the treatment group . What should I run an A/B test in order to see the the change of the banner was successful ? Should the A/B test be: within the treatment group , time vs time >=3 ? or check the difference on click for the treatment group before and after the change of the position of the banner, and then compare this difference with the difference on click for the control group before and after the change of the position of the banner ? If so, how can I compare 2 differences in a statistical way ? or something else ?
