As I mentioned in comment if the time series appears to be periodic fitting a harmonic regression model provides a way to smooth the function and identify the peak by applying the first and second derivative tests. Huber has pointed out a nonparametric test that has advantages when there are multiple peaks and the function is not necessarily periodic. But there is no free lunch. While there are the advantages to his method that he mentions there can be disadvantages if a parametric model is appropriate. That is always the flip side to using nonparametric techniques. Although it avoids parametric assumptions, the parametric approach is better when the parametric assumptions are appropriate. His procedure also does not take full advantage of the time series structure in the data. My approach does but relies on a specific form for the model that assumes periodicity. I think that while it is appropriate to point out advantages of a suggested procedure it is also important to point out the potential disadvantages. Both my approach and Huber's find the peaks in an efficient manner. However I think his procedure takes a little more work when a local maximum is lower than the previously determined highest peak.
