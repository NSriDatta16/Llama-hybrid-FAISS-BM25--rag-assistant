What's the right way to overwrite a directory in my SVN repository?

I have made this mistake several times, and found myself referencing This Post every time I do it. I have an SVN repository with Assembla, and a local copy checked out on my machine. When I manually overwrite directories via my OS (i.e. drag and drop a directory over the old one), and then try to SVN ADD and SVN COMMIT I get the ‘.’ is not a working copy error. Reading the linked post, I understand the error (I think), but what is the right way to do this so I don't have to untangle this error every time? I'm not using an SVN GUI like Tortoise SVN, just the OSX terminal, if that makes a difference. Is there a command that I can use? Feel free to just point me to the documentation, but I googled for it and couldn't find anything. I saw SVN COPY , but that says it only works within a working copy, and I want to copy something from my OS over a working copy directory. Any thoughts? Thank you!
