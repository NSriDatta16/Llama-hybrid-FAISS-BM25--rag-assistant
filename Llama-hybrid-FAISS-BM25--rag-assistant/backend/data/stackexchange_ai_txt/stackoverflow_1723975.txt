difference in mouse events on img/div

I have a little tool on a web page that can be clicked and dragged along a horizontal line. First I had the drag handle as an img. I had some problems with layout and realised later that it would probably be better to use a div with an img background. So I changed the drag handle to use a div, and I discovered a pretty obvious error in my javascript code. I had the onMove and onUp events attached to the handle itself. So for example, if I clicked on the drag handle div and then moved my mouse upwards out of the div (as the div only moves left and right), it then doesn't catch the onUp or onMove events. But the thing I don't understand, is why it worked perfectly when I was using an img tag. Is this a bug or is there something funny about images that makes them behave this way? Is it future-safe to leave use an img and leave the code as is?
