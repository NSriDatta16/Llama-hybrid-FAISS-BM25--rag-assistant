Let's start with a prototype statement you'd like to make at the end, maybe "The first hand group answered an average of 62% of the questions right, well above the 42% for the inexperienced group". Score each question as 1/0 so you can total 7/7 = 100%, 6/7 = 86%, and so forth. For a statistical test, compare the means of each group on these scores by a two-sample t test. This approach seems simple and easily understood. When you look at individual questions, you can use a proportions test to compare the proportions in the two groups who answer correctly.
