From what little data you show it looks like a gamma approximation for the positive values might be roughly reasonable with a Bernoulli for the zero/nonzero, though there may well be other choices. You could then perhaps use simulation to get an approximate CI for the mean ... but you'd need to account for the error in the estimate of the three parameters. However, you don't need to know the distribution to form a confidence interval for the mean since you could (for example) use a bootstrap confidence interval. With a reasonable-sized sample of positive values, that should work pretty well. In addition, there's also the possibility of using a normal approximation. The sample size isn't quite large enough to make the result symmetric -- if I take the idea in 1. and match the mean and variance of the positive values you show to get a gamma and then sample a zero-inflated gamma with the same sample size you have, the sample means that result are still mildly skew, but it's not too bad: I'd think that a confidence interval based on a normal approximation with sample size of about 6000 or more should have something close to the right coverage, and the total width should be about right. One nice thing about using this approximation is that sample size calculations are standard, and straightforward. These can be used to get the right ballpark for the sample size even when you're using methods in 1. or 2. (as long as it's not substantially smaller than the sample size used here, because otherwise the approximation may no longer be accurate enough).
