C++ with fstream or database

I am trying to implement a image recognition program in C++ . I had completed the extracted of feature, now trying to save the large amount of numbers. I had 2 implementation in mind, one is to save the data into binary files, to reduce the overhead of computation, or I can use database to keep the information. Binary file is fast to read and write, but hard to access, while database seem an easier interface to work with, but I am not sure if the performance is fast enough. Do you guys have any experience regarding fsream or database as the choice for fast persistent storage?
