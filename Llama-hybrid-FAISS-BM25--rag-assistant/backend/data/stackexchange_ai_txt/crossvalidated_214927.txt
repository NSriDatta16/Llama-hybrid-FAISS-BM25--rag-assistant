A common approach with k-means is to run multiple times with different initializations, then pick the best. Some other options that let you pick the number of clusters: Gaussian mixture models, agglomerative clustering, various methods based on graph partitioning problems, other k-means-like algorithms (e.g. k-medoids), spectral clustering (which is really just k-means after a nonlinear embedding).
