The reasons are tree will only do a horizontal or vertical split you only have 100 trees/iterations to approximate the oblique split. An visualization of a single tree on 2D space looks like this (picture is coming from my another answers here ). Using the boosting, we can make the split looks like oblique split , (example of oblique tree can be found here ) but it is necessary to have a infinite iterations to perfectly fit the artificial data you generated. And you are only using 100 iterations. Here are more details. For example, to approximate a quartic function using boosted decision tree, the end results looks like this (left figure is ground truth, right figure is the approximation by boosting). (pay attention to the non-smoothness of the contours) And the first 4 iterations of the boosting looks like this. With more iterations, the approximation will be better. But anytime, we can only use "horizontal or vertical cut to make the sculpture". Intuitively it is similar to pixel art, and only have limited "resolutions". To summarize, standard tree can only do horizontal or vertical split, to approximate oblique split or curves, the boosted tree model will have many corners.
