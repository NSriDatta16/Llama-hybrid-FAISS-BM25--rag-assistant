Alchemy uses LLVM to translate compiled C/C++ code into ActionScript. LLVM ( http://www.llvm.org/ ) is a compiler infrastructure (ripped from that page's headline!) that supports compiling C/C++ to a low-level instruction set. You can build a virtual machine on top of it, analyze things about compiled code (like data flow or code coverage or whatever), and generally do all sorts of cool things. I don't think you can use it to translate IL into flash though.
