Finding average number of rolls for recursive rolls on success

If there is more appropriate terminology to better phrase my question, please edit. Imagine I have a 3 sided die: two faces marked 0, one face marked 2 Whenever a two is rolled, two more rolls are to occur. How do I determine the average number of rolls that will occur? I tried figuring this out based on an explanation of exploding dice ( http://axiscity.hexamon.net/users/isomage/rpgmath/explode/ ) but I'm not sure I'm even headed in the right direction. p(number of rolls) p(1) = 1/3 p(3) = 1/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 p(5) = 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 p(7) = 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 p(n) = n+1/3^n Solve for the sum of p(n) ??? Are those probabilities correct or do i have to include the alternate ordering (ex: p(5) = 1/3 * 2/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 2/3) what about a 3 sided die: 0,1,2 where 1 = +1 roll and 2 = +2 rolls? what about a 20 sided die: 15 zero faces, 3 two faces, 1 three face, and 1 five face? Curious why in the heck I care? In an effort to learn python i thought it'd be fun to generate a random dungeon. Now i'm curious about the probabilities of the random (or should I say psuedo-random) generation. I tried digesting the question/answers linked below ... snow crash! If you do help me, please, please, feed me via spoon. I am a statistics baby. How to easily determine the results distribution for multiple dice? Help with probabilities on a game I am making Now i'm going to read http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/torbenm/Troll/RPGdice.pdf while I wait for enlightenment Thanks in advance for said enlightenment.
