Rather than re-invent the wheel, you should look at a solution such as the Open Source DotNetNuke and either buy/build an extension for the portion specific to your scenario. I think for the user app, you should consider a Silverlight app as this will give you granular and secure control over the experience. Overall the solution would be like this: DotNetNuke provides the foundation portal/Content Management so you can create a highly customized experience around the exam experience including support for user management etc. The DotNetNuke extension would enable authorized administrators to manage exams and exam questions. A webservice wrapper would provide access to the business controller used by the DotNetNuke extension. A Silverlight app would interact with the webservice to enable authenticated users to take their exams Overall, such a solution would give you a high degree of control over the user experience while enabling you to focus time/resources that are only specific to your situation while leveraging an existing, robust and popular solution on which to build your solution. (Full disclosure: I am one of the co-founders of the company that manages DotNetNuke. In fairness, you can replace my suggestion for DotNetNuke with Orchard or Umbraco and the solution would be equally valid.)
