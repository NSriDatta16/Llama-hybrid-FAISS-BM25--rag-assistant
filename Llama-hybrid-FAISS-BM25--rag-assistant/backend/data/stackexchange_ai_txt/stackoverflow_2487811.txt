I thought I'd chime in here having been in the same spot you were some 12 months ago. I jumped into CI and haven't looked back. I LOVE CI's MVC approach - I had never really done any OOP before, but CI really emphasises the benefits of this approach. The unexpected benefit is that I've been able to quickly adapt to other OOP frameworks. Also, their documentation and forums are amazing, which is mission critical when adopting something new. I also love the way the urls are handled - very clean: domain.com/className/methodName, AND you can also build in custom routing patterns. I do feel like I should come to CIs defense too...CI does offer autoloading at your discression, but doesn't make any assumptions in blindly loading models. Load them for your site, a class, or an individual method. All in all, I enjoy CI I it's urged me to build stronger more capable web apps - I encourage everyone to give it a try.
