How to link to some region of a (big) web page

This should be a not so rare scenario, I wonder if there is some more-or-less standard solution or trick. I want to place a link in my blog to a external web page, which is quite big in content (say, the full text of a book from gutenberg.org). I wish to point the visitor to a specific location inside that content (say, some paragraph), but the page has no adequate named anchors, so I can't simply append a fragment id to the url. Isnt' there any way, perhaps with javascript? I would be happy with any trick that allowed me to tell the remote browser to open the page and either: scroll to a vertical scrolling position (in percentage) - i know that this would only give an approximate placing, but it would be something emulate the result of a client-side "find text inside page" tell the browser to go to a specific position (counted in bytes or characters inside the html source) (not possible, I guess: javascript only sees the webpage as a DOM tree, not a a stream of byts/chars) I'm open also to some serverside work (say, point the url to some php in my server that makes the redirection), but I don't see this would help. Any ideas? Update: I'm also interested in portions of plain text documents (instead of html). Quoting from here Specific syntaxes for representing fragments in text documents by line and character range, or in graphics by coordinates, or in structured documents using ladders, are suitable for standardization but not defined here. Have they been defined/implemented somewhere else?
