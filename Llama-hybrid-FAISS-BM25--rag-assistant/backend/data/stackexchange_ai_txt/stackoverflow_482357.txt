How can I make an NSOutlineView where some of the entires are buttons?

I want to create an NSOutlineView subclass where some of the entries look like buttons. It would look something like this: + Fruits + Organic - Apples - Bananas [Add Item] + Non-organic - Cherries [Add Item] [Add Item] + Vegetables - Carrots [Add Item] Where all of the "[Add Item]"'s are buttons. I have a feeling this involves using the outlineView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:item: delegate method somehow?
