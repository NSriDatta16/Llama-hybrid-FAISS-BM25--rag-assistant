"expected log predictive density" is the expected density on the rest of the samples in the population outside of your training and validation set , which is impossible to calculate. But it can be proved that "average log likelihood on the validation sets of the cross-validation" is proportional to "expected log predictive density" . That is why in pratice people try to maximize the "expected log predictive density" by maximizing the "average log likelihood on the validation sets of the cross-validation". Another thing is, since you are already using Bayesian method , why bother using cross-validation? A better option is to pick the model that can maximize the marginal likelihood , or minimize BIC if you can't calculate marginal likelihood directly.
