Reconstructing data from PCAP sniff

I am trying to sniff HTTP data through libpcap and get all the http contents (header+payload) after processing the TCP payload. As per my discussion at Writing an http sniffer (or any other application level sniffer) , I am facing problems due to fragmentation - I need to reconstruct the whole stream (or defragment it) to get a complete HTTP packet, and this is where I need some help. Thanks in anticipation !!
