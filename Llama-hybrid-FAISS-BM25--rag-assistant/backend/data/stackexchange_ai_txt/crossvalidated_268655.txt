Some types of nonstationarity are allowed, as long as we can build a model and a testing procedure that account for the specific type of nonstationarity. See Dave Giles' famous blog post "Testing for Granger causality" for the case of unit-root nonstationarity. But obviously, not all types of nonstationarity can be allowed for. If the time series is too erratic for any model we could manage to build, we will not have a way to carry out the test.
