vbscript inserting a line alphabetically

I'm trying to insert a string that begins with the word title as in title: New string to be inserted into a file that has the following format. A bunch of text at the top, a block of lines each beginning with the word title:, and a bunch of text at the bottom. Some content here at the top And more content and the titles will begin next title: Basic String title: How does it evaluate strings title: Identify code links title: Translating vbscript to string some content at the bottom and more content at the bottom The thing is I'd prefer to insert that new string title: New string to be inserted so that it's organized alphabetically in the block of titles to make it easier to maintain this file. How can I do this with vbscript. I discovered it a few hours ago and think it's a great alternative for what I'm trying to do, but not that great at it yet, so any help would be great How would I loop through all lines of the file, copy each line to a new file, until I hit a title that is alphabetically after my title, add my title to the new file at that spot, then copy the rest of the file to the new file and close. Because I'm poor in vbscript syntax, I can only think of a pseudo algorithm, Loop to read through all lines If the line does not start with the word title:, copy it as is into the new file If the line starts with the word title, remove the `title:` sub-string, then check if it is alphabetically before or after my title If before my title, copy it into the new file If after my title, then copy my title there, and copy all rest of the file as is, and EXIT End loop
