I'm not too familiar with iPhone development, but can you set the LUA_PATH env variable before executing your application? For example, in Linux, I could write a script that executes your binary like so: export LUA_PATH="foo" /path/to/executable Windows has similar functionality with batch files. If you really need to change it in code, I don't know how to do that short of using luaL_loadbuffer and lua_pcall to execute a "package.path = blah" command.
