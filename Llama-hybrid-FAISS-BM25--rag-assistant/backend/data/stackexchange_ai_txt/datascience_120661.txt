Data organization

I want to model road accidents using Random Forest and Neural Networks, and predict where (Km) will the next accident occur. I chose 5 variables titles (each variable affects accidents) at the top of the 5 columns, under which I will enter the data. There will be a 6th column containing the km where accident have taken place in the past corresponding to the variables I chose. My question is pretty simple: I do not know, where will the results appear? Where will the Outcome (km of the next accident) be shown? Thank you for any help
