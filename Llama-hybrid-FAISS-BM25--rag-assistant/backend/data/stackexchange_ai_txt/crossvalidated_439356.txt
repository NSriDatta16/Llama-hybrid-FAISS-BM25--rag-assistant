Dimensionality reduction of highly correlated features for predictive maintenance

I have a high dimensional sensor data and many variables are highly correlated. Is it a good idea to get principal components without removing correlated features to reduce dimensions? My final objective is predictive maintenance (classification). So, will dimension reduction remove the important information used to predict machine failure?
