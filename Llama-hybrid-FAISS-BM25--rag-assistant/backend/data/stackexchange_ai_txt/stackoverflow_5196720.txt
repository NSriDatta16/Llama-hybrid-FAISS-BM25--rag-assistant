The fact that the log message will be different in each output is the limiting factor. Extending the block may suffice and defining a CustomTraceListener or ILogFilter may work out for you. This would avoid needing to use the EventAggregator . It boils down to who has the knowledge of what and where to log. Are the differences driven off values within the logging engine such as severity? Are they instead driven by the consumer of the logging engine and therefore tightly coupled to the class itself? These types of questions will dictate your choice. Leveraging the extension points in the logging block would be my first choice before having to rely on using the EventAggregator .
