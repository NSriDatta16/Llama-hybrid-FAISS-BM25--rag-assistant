WebClient is sometimes easier to use than WebRequest . You may want to take a look at it. For JSON deserialization you are going to want to look at the JavaScriptSerializer class. WebClient example: using (WebClient client = new WebClient ()) { //manipulate request headers (optional) client.Headers.Add (HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)"); //execute request and read response as string to console using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(client.OpenRead(targetUri))) { string s = reader.ReadToEnd (); Console.WriteLine (s); } } Marked as wiki in case someone wants to update the code
