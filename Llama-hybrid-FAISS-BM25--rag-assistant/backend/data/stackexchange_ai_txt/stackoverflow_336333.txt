Drag and drop .cs files not using "Add As Link" in Visual Studio

Is there a way to use add-as-link when dragging and dropping source files or entire source trees into a C# project? Currently, dragging a tree of source files onto a C# project will cause Visual Studio to copy all files to mirror tree below my solution file. This can be avoided with the the add-as-link option as depicted in the picture below. However, it gets tedious for large trees or when some files in a directory are already part of the project. Screenshot of the add-as-link functionality in Visual Studio http://jaapsuter.com/images/add_cs_file.jpg I've looked in Tools->Options, searched the web, and held various magic key combinations when dragging and dropping, to no avail. I'm tempted to write a script that just globs my .cs files and runs a regular expression over my .csproj file. I'm aware of NAnt, Premake, and other solutions - but I'd like something lightweight.
