Maybe a little late but... Ji Feng and Zhi-Hua Zhou (2017) have recently proposed an autoencoder model based on tree ensembles. They learn a random forest or build a "completely-random forest" for the encoder part. To decode it, they follow tree branchs backward from leaves to the root which gives a series of rules from which they extract the Maximal-Compatible Rule. Then, using this rule, they are able to more or less precisely reconstruct the input. PS: It could be noted that Biau et al. (2016) showed that tree-ensembles could be seen as a two-layer perceptron. It may be interesting to see the Forest Autoencoder with this scope.
