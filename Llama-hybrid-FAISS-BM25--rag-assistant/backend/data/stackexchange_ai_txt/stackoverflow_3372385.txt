ViewSwitcher dragging (cf. Calendar week view / Google Talk conversations)

I want to implement something like the Android Calendar week view, where you can move through the weeks -- or like the Talk app, where you can switch between conversations. In other words, I want to be able to drag the views, not just swipe them. The only thing that I seem to be able to do is to switch views (with a sliding animation) after the swipe action. In the two examples I mentioned, the views are actually dragged, i.e. the animation shows while moving your finger on the screen. I've been going through the Calendar source, but the classes involved are so huge, I can't make head nor tail of it. Has anyone done something like this, or is there any (relatively concise) source available somewhere? Cheers.
