Choice of model surrogate for bayesian optimization

I am running BayesSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters of my machine learning model. This particular procedure allows the user to choose the surrogate model. The options are Gaussian Process, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Gradient-Boosted Regression Trees. How should my understanding of the hyperparameter space guide my decision as to which surrogate to use? Are there other special considerations to make?
