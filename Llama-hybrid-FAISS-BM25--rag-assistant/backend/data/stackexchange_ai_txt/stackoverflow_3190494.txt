Since you didn't specify whether you are already doing this, the documentation states that you should run git gc occasionally: Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within each repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating performance. Obviously this won't trash your history, but it should drop the repo size a bit if you haven't been running it. Don't be afraid to throw the --aggressive option in there either.
