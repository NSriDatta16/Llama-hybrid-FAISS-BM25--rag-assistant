Hmm, since you asked for advice on what you're doing wrong: Using nonstandard names for fixed-size types instead of the standard names uint8_t uint16_t etc. This is actually the source of your compile error. Using __attribute__((packed)) . Forget you ever learned about it. It's always wrong. Not giving us a sufficiently complete code fragment to determine the cause of the error.
