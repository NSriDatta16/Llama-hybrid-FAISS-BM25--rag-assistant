Query result in MySQL Console does not match the result of PHP's mysql_query()

My MySQL query returns different results depending on how the query is submitted. When the query is submitted through the MySQL Console results in. mysql> SELECT `modx`.coverage_nation.id, -> `modx`.coverage_nation.name, -> `modx`.coverage_national_region.id, -> `modx`.coverage_national_region.name -> FROM `modx`.coverage_nation_part -> RIGHT JOIN `modx`.coverage_national_region ON (`modx`.coverage_nati on_part.nation_regionID = `modx`.coverage_national_region.id) -> RIGHT JOIN `modx`.coverage_nation ON (`modx`.coverage_nation_part.n ationID = `modx`.coverage_nation.id) -> ORDER BY `modx`.coverage_nation.name ASC, `modx`.coverage_national_region .name ASC; +----+---------------+------+------+ | id | name | id | name | +----+---------------+------+------+ | 3 | Canada | NULL | NULL | | 18 | Chad | NULL | NULL | | 17 | Germany | NULL | NULL | | 15 | Italy | NULL | NULL | | 2 | Mexico | NULL | NULL | | 19 | Nigeria | NULL | NULL | | 14 | Russia | NULL | NULL | | 16 | Spain | NULL | NULL | | 1 | United States | NULL | NULL | +----+---------------+------+------+ 9 rows in set (0.00 sec) When the same query is submitted using PHP's mysql_query it returns only one row. $query .= "SELECT `modx`.coverage_nation.id, `modx`.coverage_nation.name, `modx`.coverage_national_region.id, `modx`.coverage_national_region.name FROM `modx`.coverage_nation_part RIGHT JOIN `modx`.coverage_national_region ON (`modx`.coverage_nation_part.nation_regionID = `modx`.coverage_national_region.id) RIGHT JOIN `modx`.coverage_nation ON (`modx`.coverage_nation_part.nationID = `modx`.coverage_nation.id) ORDER BY `modx`.coverage_nation.name ASC, `modx`.coverage_national_region.name ASC;"; $resultSet = mysql_query($query) or die("query failed ".mysql_error()); while($row = mysql_fetch_array($resultSet,MYSQL_NUM)) { // handle each result here } Returns only Canada. Does anyone have any ideas as to how I might solve this?
