Regression using aggregate (averaged) data

I'm doing a project involving the impact that different college grading systems have on MCAT performance. I have access to the following data: Grading system by college Median MCAT score by college Number of students taking the MCAT by college Median SAT score (among pre-meds) by college I would like to regress median MCAT score on (1) median SAT score and (2) grading system (using a dummy variable = 0 or 1). Could someone tell me if this is a statistically valid (or at least defensible) analysis to do? I have read about some of the pitfalls of regressions with aggregate data (ecological fallacy, etc.). Unfortunately, I don't have access to the individual SAT or MCAT scores (I only have the median scores for each college), so this seems like the best I can do. Is there anything I can do to make the analysis more defensible?
