Three years of data is very little. You should not expect remarkable results when using such a small dataset, especially the farther ahead you are going to forecast. You could try using this data to make predictions maybe a few months ahead, not more than a year ahead. Twenty-three years of data would be much better (but see later paragraphs). If you really want to do it, with such a small dataset, you would need to stick to simple forecasting models , like the naive method , or assume linear trend (simple linear regression with time index as a feature). Black-box machine learning would simply overfit your data and be quite hopeless. However, as noticed in the comments, time-series forecasting is not the right tool for the job. We have good physical climate models that are used for this purpose. If you are doing this for fun as an exercise to learn forecasting, feel free to do it, but if you need it for any serious purpose, you should stick to things that are known to work better. We know that climate changes could lead to snowball effects , where some changes provoke more changes, that provoke different changes, etc. The more ice melts, the warmer it is, the more ice melts, etc. This makes future weather harder to predict given the historical data. This year (2023) we already observed extreme heat waves breaking some historical records, as an example. All this may lead to changes that are exponential rather than linear in nature (recall the recent Covid-19 epidemic, which also grew exponentially) making it hard to predict. As an example, see the temperature trends, where the year 2023 is a clear outlier--you can clearly see that historical data does not tell us much to make further predictions.
