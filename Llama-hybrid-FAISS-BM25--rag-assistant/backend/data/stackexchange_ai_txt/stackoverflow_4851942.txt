Essentially, you're correct about what you need to do. Since Objective C is a strict superset of C, your code should run fine, although you'll obviously need to change the API calls to iOS-oriented ones. The main task would likely be to recreate your interface and how it hooks into your code, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem for a well-designed MVC application. You may also need to give consideration to your application's lifecycle - compared to Mac applications, iOS apps tend to be used for much shorter periods, and can be quit with little or no notice, so they need to keep a lot more of their state in persistent storage (or be ready to save it quickly and automatically on exit), rather than relying on the user triggering an explicit save. Without knowing more about your application, I can't give you any more than this general advice. I can only recommend that you give it a shot - the simulator is free.
