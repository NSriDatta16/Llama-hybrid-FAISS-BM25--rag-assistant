If you are comfortable working with a distance matrix of size num_of_samples x num_of_samples , you could use random forests , as well. Click here for a reference paper titled Unsupervised learning with random forest predictors . The idea is creating a synthetic dataset by shuffling values in the original dataset and training a classifier for separating both. During classification you will get an inter-sample distance matrix , on which you could test your favorite clustering algorithm.
