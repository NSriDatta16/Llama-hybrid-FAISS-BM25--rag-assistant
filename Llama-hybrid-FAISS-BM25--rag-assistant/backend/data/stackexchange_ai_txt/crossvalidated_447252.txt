General answer: I would not be using SMOTE for a ratio of 7:3. If you really want to balance your precision/recall, try to set some class weights - they are available in R's implementation of Random Forest. 'sampsize' works that you need to give him a vector in the form of c(300,300) , where the order depends on the level of the factor variable you passed as strata . These numbers don't necessarily need to be smaller than your sample size, as it is a bootstrap and you're sampling with replacement (but this is my take, I am not sure). However, with these rations oversampling will decrease your performance more than it will increase it, as you are adding "fake" points. If you're overfitting RF, try to set a max_depth parameter or better tune the mtry , drop the smote and put some class weights. It should work better!
