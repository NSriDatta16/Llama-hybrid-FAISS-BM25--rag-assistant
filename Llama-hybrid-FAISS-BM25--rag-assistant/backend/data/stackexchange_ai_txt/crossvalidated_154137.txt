Monte-Carlo Weather Simulation

I have a trained model that predicts some interesting things (like energy usage) based on the weather (temperature, humidity, etc.). I would like to run a monte carlo on the model and get a probability distribution for the coming years. I could do something like look at the average temperature (humidity, etc) every day and perturb it, but that feels like a fair amount of work, and I am wondering if there are more standard ways to do this. Maybe there are public domain weather models out there that will generate multiple runs of speculative weather? Any and all ideas welcome...
