NSSplitView splitter pane change notification

Hello I need to implement four views splitters like in Maya, 3ds max, Blender or other similar modeling tools. I use NSSplitView on Mac side of my editor and I need to know when user drags one pane to sync another pane. Is there any way to get new size from one NSSplitView and sync another view to it? I have working code for Windows Forms in C# version of this editor, but I can't figure out how to do it on a Mac. Full source code is at http://github.com/filipkunc/opengl-editor-cocoa . Thanks a lot.
