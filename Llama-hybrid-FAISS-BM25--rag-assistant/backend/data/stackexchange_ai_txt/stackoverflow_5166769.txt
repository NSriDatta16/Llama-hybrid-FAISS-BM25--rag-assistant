when choosing a project methodology such as xp, scrum, crystal which questions should be taken into consideration

Basically I have to choose a project methodology. The components are not big (we develop components mainly for SAP connecting), however the team is rather big , dislocated and and very unorganized. Besides how big is the team which other questions should be taken into consideration? Thank you
