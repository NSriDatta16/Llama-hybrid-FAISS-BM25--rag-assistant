Okay, you're setting the page margins to 1 point in your Document constructor. 1 point is 1/72 of an inch. You should probably use 0f instead, but that doesn't explain a 1 inch margin. Tiny white sliver? Sure... but not what you're describing. The problem almost certainly stems from you wrapping the Image in a Paragraph which is in turn wrapped in a PdfPTable . I suggest you scale the image to match the page size, then add the image directly to the document rather than wrapping it in a table: Image img1 = Image.getInstance(path); img1.scaleAbsoluteHeight(PageSize.LEGAL.getHeight()); img1.scaleAbsoluteWidth(PageSize.LEGAL.getWidth()); // you might need this, you might not. img1.setAbsolutePosition(0, 0); // and add it directly. document.add(img1);
