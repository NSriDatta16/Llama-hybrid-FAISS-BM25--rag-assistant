this question is not stupid, it's great that you want to extract knowledge from logs. However, if you are at the very beginning of this journey, I wouldn't recommend not pondering over LLM but starting from simpler stuff. If I were you, I would start by parsing these logs and organizing an infrastructure for doing that regularly (in a real-time best). Having done that you can consider your first NLP analysis, but for me, the key would be to do something hands-on with this data like visualizing on the Grafana dashboard or creating an alerting. When you trudge along this data, you will see what has potential.
