It looks like this image is being blocked based on the Referer [sic] header. If I click on the link directly, which causes Referer header to be the URL of this page, I get a 403 forbidden error. If I copy the URL into my address bar, which sends no Referer header, I can access the image just fine. This is a technique to prevent people at other sites from embedding someone else's image in their pages; that consumes bandwidth for the site hosting the image, without any benefit to the person hosting the image. If you have permission, you should copy the image to your own web server and host it from there. Otherwise, you should find a different image to use.
