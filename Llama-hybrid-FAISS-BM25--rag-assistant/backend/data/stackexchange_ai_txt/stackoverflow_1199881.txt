Simple C char question

Consider the following simple code fragement: void SetCommand( const unsigned char *cmd ) { iHeader[4] = *cmd; } ... const unsigned char *test = "\x72"; unsigned char iHeader[32]; hdrSetCommand(test); What I wanna do is pretty straighforward: I have a 32 character array and the SetCommand should set me the 4th byte to "\x72". The code as it is here works fine, but what I do not understand is why I do have to write iHeader[4] = *cmd /* instead of */ iHeader[4] = cmd ? And furthermore, when declaring unsigned char *test = "\x72"; I also get an error message that test needs to be declared as constant? How come?
