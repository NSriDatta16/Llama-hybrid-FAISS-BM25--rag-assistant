you are nearly done with doing NSLocalizedStrings . You open up terminal.app and change the dir to your project by changing dir. Type in cd and drop in your project folder. Then tipe in: genstrings ./Classes/*.m this will create a file with all strings you entered. Look in your project folder for Localizable.strings and drag it into Xcode project. Uncheck the box that says "copy into destination group..." and change the text encoding to UTF-16 ! Then open the info window for that file and check "Make file localizable", switch to general tab and enter for ex: fr for the new localization and click add. Now you can change the localization to french, where it says fr (or whatever you have)
