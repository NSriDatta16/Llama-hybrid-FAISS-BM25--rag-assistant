Magento Replacing super attributes table with dropdown

I am trying to replace my magento super attributes table with a drop down menu in place of it, Ive got the menu created but I am struggling to get it to actually use the data from the select dropdown. On submit it calls up function productAddToCartForm, which I feel like if I could modify, I could figure it out. But I have no idea where that function is. My php code looks like the following. htmlEscape($_item->getName()); $prodprice = $this->htmlEscape($_item->getPrice()); $prodcolor = $_item->getFullColor(); $prodsize = $_item->getTopSize(); $prodcombined = $prodname; $prodcombined .= " / "; $prodcombined .= $prodprice; echo " getId(); echo "'>"; echo $prodcombined; echo " "; ?> Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!
