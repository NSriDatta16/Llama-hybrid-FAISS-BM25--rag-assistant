Spring SimpleFormController onSubmit request parameters

I am using SimpleFormController in my application to handle form submisions. one thing i am missing is the request object that is passed onSubmit(request,response..) is a different one from the initial request object that is received by formBackingObject(..) .probably because it is again a new request from web. i just want to use the same parameters from request object in onSubmit(..) that i was able to access in formBackingObject(..) . it could be possible for me to store them in and pass thru hidden fields from jsp, but i am trying to get some elegant approach. is there any way to achieve this? EDIT: i am overriding formBackingObject(HttpServletRequest request)` and onSubmit(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object command, BindException errors) methods in my class. for the intial view formbackingObject(..) will be called and i will have some variables from the request object then if user submits the form onSubmit(..) will be called then i will have another request object which is different from the one i received in formbackingObject(..) . what i am asking is, is there any way of holding the initial 'request' parameters( request.getParameter() kind of...) so that i can use them in onSubmit(..) with out sending them back & forth thru hidden fields ?'
