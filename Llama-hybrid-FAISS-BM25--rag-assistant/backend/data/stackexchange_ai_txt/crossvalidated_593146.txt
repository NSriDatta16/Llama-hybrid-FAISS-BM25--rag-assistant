It means that your neural network didn't learn very much. Compare its performance with the naive forecast , i.e. predicting the previous value $$ \hat y_t = y_{t-1} $$ Very likely the performance of your algorithm would not be better than this. It seems that your model learned exactly that, it is an overtly complicated identity function. That is why it is useful to start with very simple methods before using more complicated ones and use them as benchmarks.
