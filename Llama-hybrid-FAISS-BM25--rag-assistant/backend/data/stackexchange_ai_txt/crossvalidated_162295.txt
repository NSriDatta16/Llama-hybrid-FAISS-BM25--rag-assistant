It's a bit unclear what you mean by "framework"; for example, would Least Squares be the framework you're looking for when it comes to ordinary linear regression? Following Least Squares, GLMs is a broader "framework" that encompasses least squares regressions and more. Eventually, the later techniques you mentioned like SVMs or ANNs can also be considered frameworks. If you look ahead into the course syllabus you should see what other methods the course covers. In addition, there's a great flow chart from SciKit Learn that describes many machine learning methods and when to use what.
