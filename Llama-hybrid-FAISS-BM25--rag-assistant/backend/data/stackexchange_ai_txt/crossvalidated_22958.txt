If I understand you description correctly, you case falls within discrete time survival/hazard analysis (discrete time in the sense of discretized intervals of a continuous process, not in the sense that events only happen after fixed intervals). In that case I would follow Aniko's suggestion and use a logistic regression model with person-years as observations, with event occurrence as a dependent variable and category as a time-variant explanatory variable (together with time of course). An applied handbook recommended for this case is Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis by Singer & Willett, ch. 10-12. See here for worked examples/syntax for different programs.
