Pearson's chi-squared test assumption: independence of observations

I am unsure of how to establish (or interpret) the independence condition of the chi-squared test in (for instance) the following situation. Consider this 2x2 contingency table representing the number of 'statements' that are either negative or positive, by members from the genders 'male' and 'female'. None are members from both gender; however, some statements are made by the same person. |Negative Positive |Marginal Row Totals Male |7683 (7660.06) [0.07] 2983 (3005.94) [0.18] |10666 Female |1259 (1281.94) [0.41] 526 (503.06) [1.05] |1785 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |8942 3509 |12451 (Grand Total) This yields $\chi^2=1.7008$, $p=.192186$ (not significant). I have more tables like this, with different independent and dependent variables, but the same idea. Some of them are significant. There are 150 subjects in total, and each typically make a number of 'negative' statements and a number of 'positive' statements, in a perceptual evaluation experiment where they are typically describing 20 to 40 audio fragments. They can make any number of statements about any fragment, but here there are between 0 and 10, median 3. There are about 180 fragments in total, i.e. each fragment is only assessed by a fraction of the subjects. I therefore assume the following assumptions have been met: simple random sample : hard to test (?), but the idea is that the subjects are representative of the population I'm examining sufficient sample size (whole table) : this looks bigger than any other contingency table I've seen expected cell count : more than 5 or 10 in each cell The one I am not so certain about is independence , as some of the statements are made by the same person, and some of the statements describe the same fragment. I wonder if this is mitigated by the huge numbers. Of course, independence is exactly what this test is supposed to assess, hence the name, though perhaps my understanding of these different meanings of 'independence' is the problem. McNemar's test seems inappropriate for this data, as there is no repeated measures or 'before/after' character to this. I would appreciate any advice on the exact meaning of this 'independence', its effect, and how it can be justified (in case it's fine) or addressed (in case this data needs a different statistical technique).
