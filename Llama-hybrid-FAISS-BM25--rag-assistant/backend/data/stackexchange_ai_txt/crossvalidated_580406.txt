One way to think about the amount of information in a dataset is to see how spread out the data points are. For example, if you had a dataset of five identical body weights x = [120, 120, 120, 120, 120] , there is very little information here as there is no spread or variability at all - knowing the weight of one person tells us the weight of the others. Now, the variance tells us how spread out the data are, by taking the average squared deviations from the mean. So the more spread out our data are, the larger the variance. In x above, the variance is 0, which is consistent with the observation that there is very little information in x . Edit This is an oversimplified and misleading explanation - please refer to kjetil b halvorsen 's answer above for a more nuanced and correct explanation.
