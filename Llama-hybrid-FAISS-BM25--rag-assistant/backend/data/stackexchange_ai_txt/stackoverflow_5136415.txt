Problem embedding an youtube video on iphone

I am trying to embed a video with the following code to avoid launching the youtube app and stay in my app: -(void)embedYouTube:(NSString*)url frame:(CGRect)frame { NSString* embedHTML = @" "; if(videoView == nil) { videoView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:frame]; [movieDescView addSubview:videoView]; } [videoView loadHTMLString:embedHTML baseURL:nil]; } The problem is when I clicked on the play icon, it opens the youtube website with my uiwebview asking to install some web app . I would like to prevent this web app pop up to show or start the video full screen. Actually, any solution to show a youtube video without exiting my app would do.
