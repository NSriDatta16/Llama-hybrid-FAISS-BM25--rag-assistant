If you connect to the site of your bank it works a lot of cryptographic things. The most important is that you use public key of the bank to send a piece of information to the bank, because in every SSL (https) connection server send to client it's public key packed as a certificate. Usage of certificate and world wide PKI is important. You want be sure, that if you gives to the bank your bank pin, that on the other side is really your bank and not an other person. This will be solved, because on every computers there are a small number of public keys of well known organisations (like VeriSign) and bank send you not only his server public key, but a certificate. certificate is a message signed by VeriSign for example, which say "this public key is really from the bank XYZ". So because you have public key of VeriSign you can first verify, that server certificate of the bank is correct. So you can be sure, that you communicate really with your bank .
