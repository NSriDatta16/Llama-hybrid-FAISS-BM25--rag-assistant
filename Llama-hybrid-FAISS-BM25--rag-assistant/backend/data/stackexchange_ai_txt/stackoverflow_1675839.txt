Not sure what your problem is. Are you trying to implement a queue (which also can work as a stack, no need for your quack ) as a ring buffer ? In that case, you need to save both a front and a back index. The mechanics are described in the article linked above. Pay attention to the “Difficulties” section: in particular, you need to either have an extra variable or pay attention to leave one field empty – otherwise you won’t know how to differentiate between a completely empty and a completely full queue.
