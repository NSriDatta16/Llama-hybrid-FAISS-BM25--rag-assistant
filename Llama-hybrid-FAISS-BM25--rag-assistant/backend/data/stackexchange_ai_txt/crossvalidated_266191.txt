This is a comparison between non-normal samples of different sizes?

I have 16 types of experiments (a matrix of 4 conditions and 4 bacterial strains). Each experiment type is composed by a variable number of samples (4-8). Each sample is made of a variable number of data points (50-300). When plotted, each sample gives rise to a non-normal distribution, heavily skewed to large values. I have calculated the median of each sample (as the median is a better descriptor for skewed distributions). Do i need the standard deviation of this median? How can I determine the average value of a given experiment type?- Could it be as simple the mean of the medians? How can I assess the statistical significance between these 16 types of experiments? Could a Mann-Whitney test do the trick? Example: Cell type X, Condition A -Sample 1-300 data points Mean 28.87 median 14.62 -Sample 2-258 data points Mean 35.71 median 14.75 -Sample 3-365 data points mean 24.53 median 13.81 -Sample 4-244 data points mean 28.60 median 18.70 all heavily skewed histograms . -Average mean 29.43, average median 15.47- Is this valid?- Do I get here the standard error of the median (i.e. 1.2533 Ã— SE)? -Can I compare the value of 15.47 to the average median of a different type of experiment? How can I tell if the difference is significant?. I would like to compare a given cell (cell A) among 4 different conditions. Many thanks for reading!
