Which model should I use to test this hypothesis (Hypothesis: Volatility in the European stock market increases on ECB Monetary policy announcement days). If I use this model, how do I test my hypothesis? Using a GARCH model with a dummy in the conditional variance equation sounds like a good approach. The conditional variance equation is $$ \sigma_t^2=\omega+\alpha_1\varepsilon_{t-1}^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2+\gamma d_t $$ where $d_t$ is the dummy variable. Test $H_0\colon \gamma=0$ using a $t$ -test. If you reject $H_0$ , you have an indication for presence of an effect on the conditional variance. Is it possible for me to add other variables than the dummy variables for my event days? I would also like to test if shocks in monetary policy or changes in interest rates has an effect. Yes, you can add more variables to the equation. Perhaps I can also do simple OLS regressions with a measure of volatility as my $y$ variable and the event day as my dummy variable? You could do this, but I think GARCH is a more elegant approach. Obtaining an accurate and precise measure of volatility to use as $y$ in an OLS regression is quite challenging, especially in presence of external shocks that you wish to test for. Meanwhile, in GARCH the measure is embedded in the model itself. (I do not have a good way to explain this now, but I will update the answer if I come up with anything relevant.)
