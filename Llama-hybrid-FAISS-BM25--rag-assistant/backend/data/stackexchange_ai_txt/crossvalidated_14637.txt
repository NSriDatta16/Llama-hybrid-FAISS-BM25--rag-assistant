The answer to this question might depend on your disciplinary background. Here are some general considerations. The beta's in logistic regression are quite hard to interpret directly. Thus, reporting them explicitly is only of very limited use. You should stick to odds ratios or even to marginal effects. The marginal effect of variable x is the derivative of the probability that your dependent variables is equal to 1, with respect to x. This way of presenting results is very popular among economists. Personally I believe that marginal effects are more easily understood by laymen (but not only by them ... ) than odds ratios. Another interesting possibility is to use graphical displays. A place where you will find some illustrations of this approach is the book of Gelman and Hill . I find this even better than reporting marginal effects. Regarding the question on how to get odds ratios, here is how you can do it in R: model
