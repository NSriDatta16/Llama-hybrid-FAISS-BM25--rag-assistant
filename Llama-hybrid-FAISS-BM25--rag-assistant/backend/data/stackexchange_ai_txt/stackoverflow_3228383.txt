The majority of public telephone networks (PSTNs) have a digital core (switch to switch) and an analogue edge (from the edge switch to your phone at home). Business and large campuses (Hotels, Hospitals, Colleges - any large organization on a single or closely located sites) often will have a local phone system and switch (PABX) which will speak digitally to the edge exchange and which, increasingly, may speak digitally to the desk phones also. There are actually a number of different standards in use for sending the CLI over the analogue circuit to your home phone depending on where you are and who your operator is - see the following link as a good starting point, although it is old and the links appear broken): http://www.ainslie.org.uk/callerid/cli_faq.htm#Q_6 This one may also be useful: http://www.tech-faq.com/fsk.html
