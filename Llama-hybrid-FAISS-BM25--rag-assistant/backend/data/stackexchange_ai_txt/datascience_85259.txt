(upgraded from comment to answer) Since your target is a count variable, it's probably best to model this as a Poisson regression. xgboost accommodates that with objective='count:poisson' . @Cryo's suggestion to use a logarithmic transform is also worth trying, but you shouldn't just skip transforming the zeros: instead, use $\log(1+Y)$ or something similar. Note that when log-transforming, your error optimization will inherently be multiplicative: for a true value of 10, predicting 100 or 1 have the same "wrongness".
