Why would my R Squared increase AND my RMSE increase when I add more variables to a model?

I ran a regression with tidymodels following this following along with the random forest example here but using different data. When I ran it with four variables or so, I got an R Squared of 0.94 but a high (for what I’m trying to predict) RMSE of 20000. I added more variables and got an R Squared of 0.97 and RMSE of 40000. Why would the RMSE increase if the R Squared supposedly indicated the model was better? I believe RMSE means how far off my prediction is from the actual test data. I’m trying to bring my RMSE down which is why I added more variables.
