No, the approaches are not the same. $z$ -scaling subtracts the mean and divides by standard deviation. Intercepts (random or fixed) only correct for the mean, they don't scale the data anyhow. Intercept is the mean when controlling for other variables in the model. It is not necessary the same as the arithmetic mean of the sample. This applies to the rest of the procedure as well: correlation does not control for other variables. With random intercepts, they are shrunk towards zero (as with $\ell_2$ regularization or using Gaussian prior with mean of zero). Again, they wonâ€™t be the same as if you calculated arithmetic averages per each group.
