Creating well-separated bins

I want to distribute my hospital data into 4 tiers (bins) based on the score. Tier 1 (good hospitals) has the highest score and Tier 4 (not so good hospitals) has the lowest score. The tiers can be of any size and there is no problem with that. Importantly, I want the tiers to be well separated based on the score, so if this makes the tiers unequal in size that is absolutely fine. In the example below, I created a percentile rank on the score and then used pandas.cut() on the percentile rank to create the 4 tiers. The issue I have is with the tier borders which I think are not well separated. Example (red highlight): DD14 and DD15 have close scores and I don't want them to be in different tiers. Similarly DD24 and DD25 have a similar problem. Is there a standard statistical approach to address my issue? Notes: I can round the percentile rank to a whole number to blunt the different and achieve this, but I guess this is not a standard solution, because there could be another scenario where this approach will create different problems in the tier. I'm not tiering directly on the score and use percentile rank instead because I want to normalize the values before tiering. I think this is a standard practice. Added below part to answer questions in comments The idea is to present hospitals grouped into 4 tiers for selection. Within each tier, I further plan to rank each hospital based on their score or percentile rank. Finally each hospital will have a Tier and a Rank (within the tier). Business will select hospitals based on their Tier & Rank. More than the Rank, business pay close attention to the Tier. Business will review hospitals in the order of their Tier (T1 hospitals first, then T2 hospitals) and then select hospitals based on other factors. They mostly ignore hospitals in the lower tiers because they are not expected to be good. Business are not happy that DD14 & DD15 have a very close score but still are in different tiers. They prefer to see DD15 also in T1. My question arises from this business concern.
