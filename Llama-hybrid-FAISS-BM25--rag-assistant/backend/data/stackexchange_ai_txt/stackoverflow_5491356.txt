Productivity of WPF development, with and without Telerik (for example)

This is kindred to but different from the question I posted a half hour ago, Is WPF development faster or slower than classic ASP.NET (web forms) . I'm curious about how much of a productivity boost we might reasonably expect, if we use Telerik (or DevExpress or Infragistics, etc) for our WPF project. It's a big enough project that we'll have time to ramp up on whichever library we select. Our application will have a fairly complex UI around a calendar; otherwise it's pretty vanilla. We don't have very much WPF experience. I know that it depends , esp. on how many of the controls are useful, how much we need to customize them for our application, etc. If you can (somehow) encompass those dependencies and arrive at some number, that would be great. In my dreams: I've done large WPF projects with and without a third-party control library (Infragistics, in my case) -- and using the library roughly doubled our productivity. Or halved it, whatever your experience is.
