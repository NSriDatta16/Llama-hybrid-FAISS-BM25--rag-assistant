Those deviations from the normal look like they are largely driven by a few outliers. See what happens when you trim those, and look closely at them to see whether they belong in your model in the first place. They may have high leverage and thereby drive your estimates. If you know why they are what they are, and have data on the mechanism, you should control for it, and possible interact it with your regressor of interest. Also, on a semi-related note, inference in standard OLS depends on an assumption that observations are independent and identically distributed. The first is almost always violated in panel data, and the second is often violated in general, if you assume that heteroskedasticity is the norm, and that homoskedasticity is a special case. To get around this, applied econometricians "cluster their standard errors", which corrects for both problems. Google clustered standard error if you haven't heard of this before; you'll find lecture notes from universities on the subject. It looks like you're using stata, on which this procedure is trivial to implement: xtreg y x, cluster(clustvar) , where the cluster variable is usually the cross-sectional unit, but may be a higher-level unit into which cross-sectional units are aggregated.
