Embedding my .NET control in MS Project 2003

I need to extend MS Project's functionality for my company, so I would like to embed some .NET GUI controls into Project. The plan is that my controls save the user input into my custom DB tables, but I do have to bind them to tasks, current user, resources etc. Could you give me some advise how to start? I am interested in: Sample apps/walk-throughs, how to embed a control into MS Project. How to bind user input of my control to current context (e.g., currently selected task) Since the control runs on the client side, how can I roll it out enterprise wide.
