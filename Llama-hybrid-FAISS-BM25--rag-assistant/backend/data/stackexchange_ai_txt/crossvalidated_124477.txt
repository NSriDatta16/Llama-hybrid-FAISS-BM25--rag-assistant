@Aymen is right, you don't need to normalize your data for logistic regression. (For more general information, it may help to read through this CV thread: When should you center your data & when should you standardize? ; you might also note that your transformation is more commonly called 'normalizing', see: How to verify a distribution is normalized? ) Let me address some other points in the question. It is worth noting here that in logistic regression your coefficients indicate the effect of a one-unit change in your predictor variable on the log odds of 'success'. The effect of transforming a variable (such as by standardizing or normalizing) is to change what we are calling a 'unit' in the context of our model. Your raw $x$ data varied across some number of units in the original metric. After you normalized, your data ranged from $0$ to $1$. That is, a change of one unit now means going from the lowest valued observation to the highest valued observation. The amount of increase in the log odds of success has not changed. From these facts, I suspect that your first variable ( store1 ) spanned $133/37\approx 3.6$ original units, and your second variable ( store2 ) spanned only $11/13\approx 0.85$ original units.
