I've done something like this in the past: SELECT ..... FROM dbo.SOMETABLE AS T WHERE (T.memberType = @memberType OR @memberType = -1) AND (T.color = @color OR @color = -1) AND (T.preference = @preference OR @preference = -1) AND (T.groupNumber = @groupNumber OR @groupNumber = -1) AND (T.departmentNumber = @departmentNumber OR @departmentNumber = -1) Generally, however, my parameters that I don't care about are NULL. Then the query becomes: SELECT ..... FROM dbo.SOMETABLE AS T WHERE (T.memberType = @memberType OR @memberType IS NULL) AND (T.color = @color OR @color IS NULL) AND (T.preference = @preference OR @preference IS NULL) AND (T.groupNumber = @groupNumber OR @groupNumber IS NULL) AND (T.departmentNumber = @departmentNumber OR @departmentNumber IS NULL)
