There is an entire branch of Computer Science devoted to this: Algorithmic Complexity . In short, you analyze the code to determine what performance characteristics it has, for instance, most good sorting algorithms have an average runtime of O(n log n) where n is the size of the array to be sorted. This means the length of time to sort 100 items is 100 * ln 100 / ln 2 * x or 664x where x is the amount of time needed to run one instruction.
