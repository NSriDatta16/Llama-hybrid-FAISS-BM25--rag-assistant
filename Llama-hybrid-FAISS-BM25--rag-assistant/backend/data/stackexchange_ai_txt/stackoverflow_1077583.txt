A good example of neural networks and genetic programming is the NEAT architecture (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies). This is a genetic algorithm that finds an optimal topology. It's also known to be good at keeping the number of hidden nodes down. They also made a game using this called Nero. Quite unique and very amazing tangible results. Dr. Stanley's homepage: http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/ Here you'll find just about everything NEAT related as he is the one who invented it.
