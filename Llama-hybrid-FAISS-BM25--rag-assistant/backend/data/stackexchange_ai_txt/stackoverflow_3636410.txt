Application doesn't see high density's images

My project contains three drawable's folders: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable. I build it with android:minSdkVersion="3" . When it runs on Andriod 1.6 or higher it always uses images from drawable-mdpi on high density screens. How to fix this?
