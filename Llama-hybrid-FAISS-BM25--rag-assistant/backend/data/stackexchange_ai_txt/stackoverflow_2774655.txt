There are no tools in the standard "out-of-the-box" configuration to do anything automated in Cognos 8 (it seems). However, in theory the Cognos 8 SDK could be leveraged to write and run automated unit tests for reports, using something like JUnit. Also, if you are mainly testing how changes to your database affect the result sets of the reports/queries, you could extract the SQL from each report and run automated tests separate from the Cognos environment.
