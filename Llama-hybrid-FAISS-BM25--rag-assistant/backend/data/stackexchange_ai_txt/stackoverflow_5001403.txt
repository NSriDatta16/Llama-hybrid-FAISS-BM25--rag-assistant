If you have a large number of images, it may be better to package them as a zip, packing efficiency will depend on the type of images you are using. That said, there is often little gain in file size when zipping png or jpg images. If there is a good gain in file size, then the downloading time can be offset against the unzipping time. So the easy answer is, maybe : compare file size of the zip vs the combined images, then profile an average unpack time. If you can get a fast unpack + file size gain, then it's worthwhile. Don't forget to factor in the overhead of the unzip library in the SWF file.
