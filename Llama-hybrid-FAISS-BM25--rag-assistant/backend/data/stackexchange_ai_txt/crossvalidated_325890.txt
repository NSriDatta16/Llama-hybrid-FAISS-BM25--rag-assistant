Based on this article , you can decide on the second order stationarity based on p-value T . Although the article only mentions that " In this example the p-value is essentially zero which indicates that there is very strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of stationarity. ", you can apply the general hypothesis test decision rule: $$p\text{-value} If you have no idea what significance level to use, use one of the regular values: 5%, 1% and 0,1% (the less the significance level, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$). So as in the first case $p\text{-value} = 2.109424e-15$ (virtually $0$) and in the second case $p\text{-value} = 0$, the decision is the same: reject $H_0$, what means you can reject second order stationarity on every sane significance levels (i.e. there is no difference in the stationarity of the time series).
