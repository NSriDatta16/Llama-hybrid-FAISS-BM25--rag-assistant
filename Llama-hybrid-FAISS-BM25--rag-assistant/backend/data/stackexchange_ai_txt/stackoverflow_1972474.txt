Storing type information for a java code builder

So I have a a text file that looks something like this: public >ret method(>input ){ //do something with input . . . //return something of type >ret } I want to be able to type something like: HelloWorld is a method that prints "hello world" using nothing as input and returns nothing. The program does HelloWorld once. and the program then finds the specification for the print function and generates a hello world program etc. That all works fine. My problem is that I want to also be able to say something like: An Agent is an object that has a name, which is a String. and it would create an object with a String name as instance variable. Main Question: How do I store all these types? Say I want to do something like create a function that takes the output of another function which has user defined type. Its a pretty simple question but I'm wondering what the best way to do it is. Secondary questions: Should I generate all these objects and what not and THEN write the source code or should I do it incrementally? Thanks in advance.
