Actually, I don't get what you're trying to do with the $link variable . $link = @mysql_connect($server,$user,$pass,$link); is probably wrong, possibly not doing what you want (ie nothing in your example) unless if you have more than one link to databases (advanced stuff) the php.net documention states new_link If a second call is made to mysql_connect() with the same arguments, no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already opened link will be returned. The new_link parameter modifies this behavior and makes mysql_connect() always open a new link, even if mysql_connect() was called before with the same parameters. In SQL safe mode, this parameter is ignored. On my webserver, the load time is always about the same on average (4000 µsecs the first time and 600 µsec the second time) Half a second to connect to a mysql database is a bit slow but not unusual either. If it's on another server on the network with an existing load, it might be absolutely normal. I wouldn't worry too much about this problem. (oh, old question ! Nevermind, still replying)
