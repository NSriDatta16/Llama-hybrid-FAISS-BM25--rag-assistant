ASP.NET uses PostBacks to manipulate the state of the form, such as paging. What this means is that every interaction on the page - a button click, a LinkButton click - is really just submitting (posting) a form back to the same page. Hence the name, postback. An unfortunate downside of this approach is that it breaks the back button. One possible fix is to use the Post/Redirect pattern which is becoming more common with ASP.NET MVC, but the principles still apply. However, I'd strongly discourage using widely in your application, as it would essentially double the amount of requests.
