You would do it like so. Note that 'locationInView' will return the coordinates of the touch with respect to the specified view, so a touch in the top-left corner of a view will return (0,0) regardless of where that view is onscreen. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; // gets the coordinats of the touch with respect to the specified view. CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; // test the coordinates however you wish, ... } To test against a sphere you would calculate the distance from the touch point to the center of the sphere, then check whether this was less than the sphere radius.
