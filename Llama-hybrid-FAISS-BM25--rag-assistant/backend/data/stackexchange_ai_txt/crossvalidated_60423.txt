I'm not an expert on this, but most text books on non-parametric methods have at least a short discussion on the 'root-n consistency' problem, see: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctppca/aarhus/robinson.pdf The basic result is that non-parametric estimators can't achieve a $O(n^{-1/2})$ order of convergence. Kernel methods, for example, give $O(n^{-2/5})$ convergence instead (using standard kernels and assumptions that is!). I hope someone can give you a more specific answer to your question, but I think the general rule is that parametric models work better, when you can justify their assumptions.
