How can I update weights of the previous learned model?

I am trying to develop a neural network model to predict player action in a football computer game. Because we do not have much data at the beginning, I utilize from another existing dataset. In order to develop this model I use a transfer learning approach to learn weights from real world football match data. So, I use the weights from the previously trained model on football game data to initialize the weights of my model for prediction in a computer game. However, when system runs for a while, the data will be accumulated so that I can use it to enhance prediction. My question is how can I use accumulated computer game data in some time intervals to make initial weights more accurate? I will appreciate any help.
