Note that it's quite easy to work out the distribution of $K(X)=\;\stackrel{_\min}{_i}X_i$, and so to identify $Q(X,k)\,=\,k-K(X)$ as a pivotal quantity . From there, you can immediately pass to a confidence interval, by placing the limits on $Q$ so that you get 95% of the probability inside them and then manipulating the resulting interval to make $k$ the subject of the pair of inequalities. You might put all the risk on that one side, as you did, or split the probability evenly, or whatever other approach you choose (as you always can with confidence intervals). Your choice should (on average) produce the shortest interval, I think, and makes good sense in this case, but it's not the only choice.
