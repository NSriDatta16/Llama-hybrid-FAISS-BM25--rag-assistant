Is there any tool for data visualization and manipulation?

I have a time series data set that I need to manually label for supervised learning. What I am doing now is using excel to the plot, and when I see the pattern that I want, I hover over the data on the plot, read its index, then mark the data accordingly on the data. I think it is not very efficient, for example, I can not zoom or scroll. I want to ask is there any tool that I can visualize the data, and manipulate the data at the same time, please.
