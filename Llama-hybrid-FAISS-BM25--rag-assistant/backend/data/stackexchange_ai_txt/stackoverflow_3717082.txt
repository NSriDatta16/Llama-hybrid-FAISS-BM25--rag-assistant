WSDL.exe - generate interface as well as concrete class for easy fake/mocks later

Is it possible to get WSDL.exe to generate interfaces as well as, or instead of, concrete classes when it generates proxys to a web service? We're consuming a 3rd party webservice from an ASP.Net application, and have generated our proxy classes using WSDL.exe all well and good. I now want to write tests against my wrapper and business classes by faking out the web service. There is no interface or abstract base class to the proxy, and they are marked internal, meaning I can't inherit from them without putting my Fake/mock test code into my business project/assemblies. I could manually create an interface (using resharper) and edit the class, however if the 3rd part change their WSDL/web service I or my successors will have to also manually edit the interface, and automatically generated classes, which never seems like a good idea. What's the most elegant way to fake or mock this service? Should I put the fake in the business project? Should I manually edit the files and create an interface? Should I do something completely different?
