Duplicate data for SVM

Can we use duplicate data as an input to SVM? The duplicate data that I mean is, let say we have 50 of same data (maybe being duplicate) from total of 100 data. Will this kind of data effect the performance result that we obtained from SVM? Do we have to avoid any duplicate data for SVM?
