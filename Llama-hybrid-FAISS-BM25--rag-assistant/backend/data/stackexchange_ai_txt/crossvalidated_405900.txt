I've been working on a drag-and-drop neural network user interface (Ennui) that trains on the browser and allows users to export code-generated Python. We have various layers including dense, convolutional, maxpooling, batchnorm, etc. Building branched models like ResNets is also supported. We implemented a few common visualizations as well. Here is a picture of Ennui Here is an example visualization You can visit the website at https://math.mit.edu/ennui The open-source implementation is at https://github.com/martinjm97/ENNUI Feel free to reach out with comments or questions.
