Why are Bayesian methods widely considered particularly "convenient"?

Several times I have come across (in lectures, papers, etc.) informal/tangential remarks that have the following basic form: Philosophical issues aside, Bayesian methods are extremely convenient. ...with the implication being that they are more "convenient" (or "handy", "easy", etc.) than competing ("frequentist"?) methods 1 . As one can tell from the assertion's preamble, such remarks usually come from people who would not describe themselves as "Bayesians". (This is what I meant to suggest by the adverb "widely" in this post's title: i.e. even among "non-Bayesians", Bayesian methods are considered particularly convenient.) What is it about Bayesian methods that make them so convenient? The best answer to this question I can come up with is that Bayesian methods obviate the need for making some otherwise rather arbitrary decisions about parameters, and whole models. Instead, the Bayesian formalism serves as a principled way to simultaneously consider entire ensembles of such parameters and models (weighted by their corresponding priors). Now, my grasp of "Bayesian statistics" is tenuous at best, so I don't put much faith in this explanation. I would love to see a more informed elaboration. 1 One example I can cite is a recent essay by Gelman and Shalizi's, where the authors disavow the "usual story" (i.e. the conventional interpretation of Bayesian statistics) as their reason for using Bayesian methods, and say instead they use them because with them they can "fit rich enough models" (presumably richer than they could fit using non-Bayesian methods). Unfortunately, this is the only hard reference I can provide. The other ones were in the form of informal lecture remarks, or in past reading that I can no longer remember specifically.
