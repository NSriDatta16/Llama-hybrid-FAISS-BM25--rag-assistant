That error message is not saying that you're going to run out of stack, though you will. It's saying that the number is too big to represent in size_t . Make sure you're compiling for a 64-bit target. Furthermore, don't do that. If you need to allocate gigantic amounts of RAM, do it with malloc , not the stack. Or, better yet, with mmap .
