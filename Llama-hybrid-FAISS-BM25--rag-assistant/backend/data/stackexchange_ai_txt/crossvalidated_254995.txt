Adding log odds for combined probability from logistic regression coefficients

I have coefficients of a logistic regression model. I know from the statistical package used that the estimates are log odds. I am interested in combining two variables, beta 5 ( B5 ) and beta 6 ( B6 ) and then converting this combined log odds into a probability (as B5 and B6 are both measuring the same variable; B6 is an interaction term with B5 in the regression). Can you add two log odds together, and then convert them to make a combined conditional probability of, in this case, B5+B6 ? Also, I am following a paper published in a journal that does this and then converts B5+B6 to probability by p = (exp -(B5+B6)) - 1 . This is not the way I have read how to convert log odds to probabilities. Hence I am wondering if the conversion process (from log odds to probability) changes when using combined coefficients?
