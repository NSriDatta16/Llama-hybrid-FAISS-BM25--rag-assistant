Using temperature as feature in Neural Network

I'm currently putting together a Neural Network for doing Sales Forecasting for hundreds of products. The domain experts know that the sales spike when the temperature drops and so I started to use temperature as a feature in my feature-set for an Artificial Neural Network. I'm getting quite sufficient results (getting the model to overfit) on the entire dataset with the train loss at about 0.20 and validation loss at about 0.50. However, after tuning quite a bit of hyper-parameters, the losses won't go down. They seem to be have reached a plateau around the two loss marks that they can't break through. At this time, I'm starting to think that something is wrong with the data, and that temperature might not be a good feature. My question is that should I continue my search to tune and find the optimal hyper-parameters, or do I need to re-structure my dataset? The dataset itself contains historical sales/temperature data organized into weekly intervals going back to 2007. As for the length of the data, it's about 60,000 rows. Also I'm a Software Dev by profession and fairly new to Neural Networks/Data Science but not completely beginner so feel free to give me any advice you can. Thanks!
