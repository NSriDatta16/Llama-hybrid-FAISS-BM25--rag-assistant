Google Maps API not letting go of the mouse click

I'm using the Google maps API to place a map onto a web page, just like millions of other sites have done. However, once I click on the map (and let go), the map then acts if the mouse button is still being held and drags the map all over the page. The only way to get free of this drag action is to hit F5 and reload the page. I've spent several hours scouring Google to find a remedy to this but can't find any mention of this issue from anyone else. The problem can be seen at the bottom of the following page: http://www.ef-deutschland.de/master/lt2010/default.aspx Does anyone have any idea why this is occurring?
