Cannot add an icon to Resources

Have been inputting and testing some sample code and everything seems to be ok. Just that suddenly I am running into this very frustrating problem of trying to add an icon to the project. Have downloaded an icon file (extension : icns) to my desktop and dragged it to the "Resources" group in xCode. Then a dialogue comes up from xCode where I checked the 2 options : "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" and "Recursively create groups for any added folders". But when I press the "Add" button, an "Alert" message box would come up. It says "Could not copy the icon to ...". Hope that someone knowledgable in this area would give me some hints...
