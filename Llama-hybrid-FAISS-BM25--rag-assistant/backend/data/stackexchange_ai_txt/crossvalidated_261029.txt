What you described is not "deep network", where you only have $10$ inputs and $5$ units in hidden layer. When people say deep learning, it usually means hundreds of thousands of hidden units. For a shallow network, this gives an example of define the variable importance. For a really deep network, people do not talk about variable importance too much. Because the inputs are raw level features, such as pixels in an image.
