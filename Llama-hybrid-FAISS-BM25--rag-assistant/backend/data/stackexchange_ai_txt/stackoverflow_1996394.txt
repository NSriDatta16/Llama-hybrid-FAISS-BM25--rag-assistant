How can I update the same line in several different files?

I have a dozen or so Perl files with this line: my $version = " version 0.11 "; This is line 7 of each perl file. The element I need to batch-modify is "X.XX" -- the version number. What is the most elegant script I can run from the shell (in Perl) to open each file, change the version number on line 7, and then write the file?
