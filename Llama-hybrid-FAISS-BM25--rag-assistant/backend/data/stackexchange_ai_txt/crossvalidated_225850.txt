How to design RNN\VAE for sparse sequential data?

I am currently struggling with designing some Deep Learning algorithms that takes as an input sparse sequential data, since the system I try to model signals sparsely (once in a while). I try to predict the next signal (strength, timing, etc). Can you suggest an architecture\design\method\resources for this type of problem?
