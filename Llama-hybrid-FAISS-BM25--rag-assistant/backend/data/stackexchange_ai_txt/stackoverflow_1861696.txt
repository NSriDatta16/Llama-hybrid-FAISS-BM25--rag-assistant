PayPal Pro (Direct) Credit Cart expiration date verification in Magento

I have an installation of Magento shop on my development server and as a payment gateway we are using PayPal Pro (PayPal Direct) which is able to accept users' credit cards. It was fine in sandbox mode, but after switching into 'live' mode and testing with $0.01 transactions, it came out that PayPal seem to accept CCs without checking expiration date, but CC number and CVV are checked. So here are the questions: How insecure is to leave CC processing to work without expire date check? How to get this fixed?
