Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed) Well, only if you want it to copy the files. If you are happy with their existing location and don't want it to copy them, don't select it (that's what I do). Reference Type: A total mystery to me Text Encoding Self explanatory Recursively create groups for any added folders Create Folder References for any added folders Leave this as the default and then organize the folders in your Xcode project any way you want. Add to targets If you add an additional target to your project, e.g. for iPhone vs. iPad versions, then not noticing that it has by default added the files to just one of them (at random?) can cause headaches. Also, make sure you add the new header directory to your search paths in Project Settings > Build > Search paths. I think that's what's causing your problem. Hope this helps, I remember how confusing this was to me at first.
