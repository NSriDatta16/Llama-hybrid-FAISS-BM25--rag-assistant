PartCover 2.5.3 win 7 x64

Could you tell me how you got PartCover running with VS2008 and win 7 x64? Based on this post How do I run PartCover in x64 windows , I ran c:\Program Files (x86)\Gubka Bob\PartCover .NET 2.3>CorFlags.exe PartCover.exe /32BIT+ /Force with result Microsoft (R) .NET Framework CorFlags Conversion Tool. Version 3.5.21022.8 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. corflags : warning CF011 : The specified file is strong name signed. Using /Force will invalidate the signature of this image and will require the assembly to be resigned. I also ran c:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.2\bin\net-2.0>CorFlags.exe nunit.exe /32BIT+ /Force with result Microsoft (R) .NET Framework CorFlags Conversion Tool. Version 3.5.21022.8 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Also, based on my discussion Using PartCover 2.3 with .NET 4.0 runtime? , I also tried to use the x86 version of NUnit What I'm trying to run coverage for is the c# money sample for NUnit 2.5.2 I get the same System.Threading.ThreadInterruptedException ---> System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80040153): Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {FB20430E-CDC9-45D7-8453-272268002E08} failed due to the following error: 80040153 Thank you Edit: same thing with PartCover 2.2 My settings: exe file: C:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.2\bin\net-2.0\nunit-console-x86.exe working dir: c:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.2\samples\csharp\money\ work arg: /config=c:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.2\samples\csharp\money\cs-money.csproj rules: +[*]*
