I decided to take the paranoid approach [that it would create alarm if I sent a whole lot of confidential company information to Google] so here is a fragment of my code. It embeds a Google line chart in a simple table. The table provides labelling for the chart, and Google gets just 'meaningless' numbers. The array $values contains real measurements, but they are scaled wrt the upper and lower control limits, so LCL is 10%, and UCL is 90% of the vertical axis. echo " \n"; echo " Product : Measurement \n"; echo " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n"; echo " AVG \n"; echo " &nbsp; \n"; echo " &nbsp; "; printf("LCL=%6.3f, AVG=%6.3f, UCL=%6.3f", $lcl, $avg, $ucl); echo " &nbsp; \n";
