Can partial correlation help to highlight variable's meaning in the analysis?

I have an interesting problem (interesting at least for beginners like myself :) ). I have a dependent variable Y (class-variable, 2 possible values 0 and 1). I have multiple variables that all together can predict the value of Y with p-value smaller than 0.05. Logistic regression was used to see which variable will stay, and which should be removed. So, I got final model, after eliminating statistically unsignificant variables from the model, with 3 variables a, b, and c. All those 3 variables have p-values The question is, can be partial correlation analysis used to highlight the meaning of the c variable? Does it even make sense to do something like this?
