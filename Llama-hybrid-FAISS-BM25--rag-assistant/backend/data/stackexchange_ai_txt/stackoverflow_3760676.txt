It would be nice to know what you have already studied, but here is what I did when I learnt PHP : Language basics (variables, conditions, loops, functions, etc) Object-oriented PHP (classes, inheritance, ...) : In the beginning it could be a little bit confusing but you will soon realize that it helps a lot in keeping the code organized Object relational mapping (doctrine, ...) Some reading about design patterns (especially MVC) will help you to understand things better Use the previous skills to correctly organize your projects structure Some reading about HTTP could always be useful Try the PHPDoc to correctly document your code Object Oriented PHP Framework : plenty of choice, just try and choose your favorite one (I went for Zend, but CakePHP seems interesting now) For each step do a simple project to apply what you learnt, it's the best way to improve. I think that jumping directly to a framework is a bad thing and could be confusing. I would at least experiment with the Object Oriented PHP first. Another great thing would be to experiment other languages like Python or Java. My Java knowledge prevented me to do bad things in PHP and helped to understand the OO programming. And finally, post questions on Stackoverflow if you have problems :)
