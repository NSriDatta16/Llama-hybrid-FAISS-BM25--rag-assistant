Is is true that Bayesians don't need test sets?

I recently watched this talk by Eric J. Ma and checked his blog entry , where he quotes Radford Neal, that Bayesian models do not overfit (but they can overfit ) and when using them, we do not need test sets for validating them (for me the quotes seem to talk rather about using validation set to adjust the parameters). Honestly, the arguments do not convince me and I don't have access to the book, so could you give more detailed and rigorous argument for, or against such statement? By the way, in the meanwhile, Eric Ma has pointed me this discussion on the same topic.
