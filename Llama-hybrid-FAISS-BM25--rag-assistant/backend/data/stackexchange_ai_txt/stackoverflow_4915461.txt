Rails-MySQL Error - uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes

Trying to get a Rails app running on Snow Leopard. Downloaded mysql-5.5.8-osx10.6-x86_64.dmg and ran installer Ruby 1.8.7 (Default OS X version) Rails 2.3.5 When I attempt to run "rake db:migrate" I get rake aborted! uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes Yes I know this has been asked before. I have already reviewed the following links and followed the steps included in them and the result is the same each time. Rails, MySQL and Snow Leopard http://techliberty.blogspot.com/2009/12/dealing-with-rake-aborted-uninitialized.html http://www.schmidp.com/2009/06/14/rubyrails-and-mysql-on-snow-leopard-10a380/ Prior to the following commands I run "sudo gem uninstall mysql" followed by "sudo gem clean mysql" based on the above links: sudo gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config It is still failing. I am just flumoxed and would greatly appreciate any help. Many thanks!
