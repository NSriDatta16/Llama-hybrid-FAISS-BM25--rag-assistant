My 2 cents : everything start with a utility called "Module Creator" that Google will help you find. This is a ready-to-use skeleton for building module with Magento that can help you understand the MVC model of Magento. Take a closer look at the "Adminhtml" part of the basic module you will create with Module Creator. Then, if you want to add functionnality to the system area of your backend and use those "system variables", please take a look at the etc/system.xml files of existing module. Have fun
