If your data were categorical, then you could use a logistic regression to fit the probabilities of belonging to a class (classification). However, I understand you are trying to fit the data to a sigmoid curve, which means you just want to minimize the mean squared error of the fit. I would redirect you to the SciPy function called scipy.optimize.leastsq : it is used to perform least squares fits.
