You're right - the p-value is a heuristic which needs to be interpreted in context. It should be interpreted as meaning how surprising the data would be if $H_0$ is true. So if p is small, alternative hypotheses look more attractive. According to Bayes' Theorem: $$ \mathbb{P}(H_0|D) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(D|H_0)\mathbb{P}(H_0)}{\mathbb{P}(D|H_0)\mathbb{P}(H_0)+\mathbb{P}(D|H_1)\mathbb{P}(H_1)} $$ So if you actually want to calculate the probability that the null hypothesis is true, your calculation has to include how likely the observed data $D$ is given $H_0$ and how likely $D$ is given $H_1$ , and also a prior probability $\mathbb{P}(H_0)$ for how likely the null hypothesis is to be true. If a study uses a p-value rather than Bayesian analysis to support rejection of a null hypothesis, that's probably fine so long as a) the data is sufficiently more likely under $H_1$ than under $H_0$ and b) $H_1$ is sufficiently plausible (so that $\mathbb{P}(H_1)$ isn't too small).
