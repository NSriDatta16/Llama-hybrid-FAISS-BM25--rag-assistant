How do I run PartCover in x64 windows

I am trying to run PartCover to test the coverage of some tests with Gallio on windows x64. However trying to run it gives the following error. Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {FB20430E-CDC9-45D7-8453-272268002E08} failed due to the following error: 80040153. Edit: I am using PartCover 2.2.0
