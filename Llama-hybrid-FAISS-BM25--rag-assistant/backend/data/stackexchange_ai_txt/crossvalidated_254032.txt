Why would you use machine learning here? Where do you get the training data from? Also, your result will likely be much less accurate than a least-squares estimation using statistics . This clearly is a problem that should be solved analytical rather than hoping that maybe (if tou are lucky) the machine learning will provide a sometimes usable result. choose a parameterization of the circles (e.g. center, radius, normal vector) derive the intersection points for such a circle derive a maximum likelihood estimate for the parameters given thr intersection points
