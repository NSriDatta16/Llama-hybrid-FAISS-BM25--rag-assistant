Django and the domain layer

How to organize my domain layer using django? I know I can write custom managers to hold my queries but what if I want something more flexible like the specification pattern. Is there any domain patterns that are unique to Django? I am currently designing a large application that uses Django and I'd like to know how to do the domain layer right.
