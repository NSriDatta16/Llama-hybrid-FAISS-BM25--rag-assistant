Can Jags be used to fit classical inference state space models?

Can Jags be used to fit classical inference state space models (that is without using a Bayesian approach by specifying a prior)? To be fully clear: can I estimate a state space model such as the following: $y_t = \mu_t + \epsilon_t$ $\mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \eta_t$ in Jags using classical inference? I thought of using Jags as it has many options that other state space packages do not have (I am already familiar with those, so I am not looking for answers that suggest those).
