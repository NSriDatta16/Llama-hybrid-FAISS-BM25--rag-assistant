Solution for optimizing web menu bar

I'm working with a product that has a web-based interface. The functionality is huge and is divided into modules. Access to each module is via a drop down menu available on all pages. Each menu item has at least 2 levels of drill downs (vertically) Problem: Too many top level menu items Solution 1: Group Elements (Logically) so that the top menu fits. Solution 2: Reorganize Menu items using the mega-menu technique (Ã  la republic.co.uk) Solution 3: A menu that's smart enough to know how many elements to show and adds a '>>' sign at the left end.

Solution 1 and 2 will need a lot of soft skills, time and energy... I've love to have solution 3 or 4 .. Any ideas?
