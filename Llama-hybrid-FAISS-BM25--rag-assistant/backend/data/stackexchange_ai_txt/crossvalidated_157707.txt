How do I predict a time series with the help of other forecast time series?

If I have $n$ measured and interdependent time series $M_1, M_2, M_3..., M_n$ and have $n-1$ forecast time series $P_1, P_2, P_3..., P_{n-1}$, how can I predict the last forecast time series $P_n$? Background: Me and some friends are avid river swimmers and we would like to forecast the water temperature. I have logged the past water temperature along with air temperature, wind conditions and solar radiation for the last couple of years. I also have access to the forecast of all these other parameters. What I know so far is to filter out seasonality by only operating on the difference from the averages of the historical measurements. But I lack the the mathematical knowledge to now generate a model which predicts the last time series. Can you give me some indication on what is left to do? The result is ideally a model which given the past data, current conditions and other parameters forecasts for a given time in the future, gives me the water temperature for this point in the future.
