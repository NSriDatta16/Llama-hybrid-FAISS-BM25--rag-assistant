Observing seasonality in a time series

I've got a time series which plots surface reflectance over time. Ideally surface reflectance is high in the winter and is low in the summer, and is fairly constant during both of those periods. I want to do several tests, but am not sure where to start: First, for the time series, I want to test if there actually is a statistically significant high surface reflectance time period and a statistically significant low surface reflectance time period, without doing it visually/manually. If there is this variation, I would like to break the data into sections of time based on high vs low surface reflectance. (ex Jan 20 - May 7 would be high surface reflectance, and May 16- Oct 12 would be low surface reflectance). Are there any specific analytical techniques to do this relatively automatically? Here is an example time series where visually it looks like there is strong variation:
