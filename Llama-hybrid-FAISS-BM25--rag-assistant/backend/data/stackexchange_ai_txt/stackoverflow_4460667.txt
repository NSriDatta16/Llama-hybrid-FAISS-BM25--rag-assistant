View PDFs and Office Documents from within own App?

I'm planning an iOS application which will allow browsing documents on my server using a WebService. The user will have the option to download documents (PDF and MS Office) to have them available offline. Now I know that iPhone/iPad is capable of viewing all kinds of document formats, including PDF, DOC(X), XLS(X) if they are received through email for instance. I assume they are all handled by the same "preview module". The question is: if I have the documents in my app's storage, how can I use the same functionality? Solution in ObjC or MONOTOUCH is fine, or just pointing my into the right direction in general. Ren√©
