Online PCA with spectral bounds

I have question regarding online PCA implemented in the paper . I am interested in the Algorithm 2. I am not clear where the while loop stops. Also I have programmed it in R the problem is that the condotion in while loop is always true and while loop never stops. Can someone please explain step by step what does the Algorithm do?The algorithm is as follows: input : $X$,$\Delta$ $U\leftarrow$ all zero matrix (dimensions are not given in the paper , 0 rows and 0 columns) $B\leftarrow$ a covariance sketch for $x_t\in X$ do Add $x_t$ to sketch $B$ while $||(I-U U^{\top})B||^2 \geq \Delta$ Add the top left singular vector of $(I-UU^{\top})B$ to $U$ yield $\;y_t=U^{\top}x_t$ (I think while loop ends before yielding, not mentioned in the paper) end for $x_t$ and $y_t$ are vectors. Following is the R code I wrote: PCA = delta){ idx=idx+1 test 0){y[1,1:idx] Then to test what I have done make sense I used Fisher iris data, and I got: log.ir Now they(X1=PC1,X2=PC2) make absolutely no sense to me can anyone help with the interpretation?
