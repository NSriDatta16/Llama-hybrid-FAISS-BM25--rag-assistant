A testable product is one that affords the opportunity to answer questions about it. Testability, like quality, is multidimensional and subjective. When we evaluate a product as (not) testable, it's important to recognize that testability to some person may be added or unnecessary complexity to someone else. A product that has lots of unit tests may be wonderfully testable to the programmers, but if there are no hooks for automation, the product may be hard to test for a testing toolsmith. Yet the very same product, if it has a clean workflow, an elegant user interface, and logging, may be wonderfully testable by an interactive black-box tester. A product with no unit tests whatsoever may be so cleanly and clearly written that it's highly amenable to inspection and review, which is another form of testing. I talk about testability here . James Bach talks about it here . ---Michael B.
