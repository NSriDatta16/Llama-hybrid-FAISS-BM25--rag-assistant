For time-series data what is the difference between decomposing and detrending data?

To use AR/MA/ARMA models, the data needs to be stationary. Detrending data by taking differences between sequential data points seems to do this. However, does decomposing the data do the same thing? By separating data into seasonal and noise data, isn't the noise the same as the "detrended" data? If we remove the trend in data, why do we even run models on the remaining stationary data? If we remove patterns why do we expect there still to be one that can be predicted by a model? Do we run machine learning models on this noise data?
