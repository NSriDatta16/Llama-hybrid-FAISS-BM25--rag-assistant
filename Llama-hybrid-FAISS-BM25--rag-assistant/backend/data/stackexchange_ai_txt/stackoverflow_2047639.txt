jBASE 4.1 Database Noobster Questions

I am a software developer with devlopment experience in C#, C++ .Net alongwith SQL Server 2005/08, Oracle and mysql. But somehow i dont get jBASE to work at Windows XP SP3 machine. My goal is setup user accounts, create database on a JBASE ainstallation, authenticate and backup/restore few table via a C++ program. And i dont need to do it with builtin backup/restore tools of jBASE. I am able to install jBASe 4.1 aling with all its accessories on my WINXPSP3 machine. I was able to run the jSlimserver and TEMENOUS server along with licnesing server. I was able to add the license key as well. But after that what i was supposed to do? i have no idea about it. The docs and online help doesnt answer a simple question of how to create a database! The google search results from the jbase site all go to the 404 Pages! Can a jBASE expert guide to the following steps: Create a jBASE database. Create users Authenticate via those users Connect to database Create tables and insert data. Connect via a C++ or C# program to connect to jBASE DB and backup/restore tables. I know that this is too much too ask but i dont get to get the JBASE system. I cant get it to work on my System somehow. Btw, jdc and jexloree doesnt seem to do anything. I have checked that enironmental variables for jBASE are setup correctly and i have verified them. There are no extra JRE or JDK installations on my system. Besides all that, only licensing client, slim server and temenous server seem to run and listen for connections and no other execuatable ever seems to work. A simple tutorial to achieve the objective will be highly appreciated. Also if anyone can point out the mistake that i have done or anything i might need to check, then please do so. I will be highly encouraged and obliged. Thanks Steve
