Self Organizing Map (SOM) Implementation

I'm looking for a C, C++ or Java based SOM implementation with licensing applicable for commercial use (non-zero cost is okay). So far I'm aware that there exists SOM_PAK (from Kohonen), but the licensing forbids commercial use. Is anyone aware of alternative implementations?
