what is the best tool for performance regression testing

our organization is looking for a tool to help with performance testing on each release. We ship a whole bunch of new software and we want to ensure that performance on key functions has not slowed down since the last prod release. We have code in C# and Java. This can be anything from: when i run this function it takes when i run this set of functions the total etc . . Is it best to do this using our basic unit testing continuous integration (nunit, junit, team city) with hand written performance checks or are there specific tools that can help focus on on this area. Any suggestions?
