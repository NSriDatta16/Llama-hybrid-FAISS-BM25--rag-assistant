Categories of social position and social identity—including common demographic variables—are important demarcations of population. In the population sciences, there is a good deal of emphasis on differentiating the mean or median (central) experiences of populations, however, the variability of experiences distributed within populations is also substantively important. Take systolic blood pressure (SBP) as an example: it is approximately normally distributed, and one could imagine two populations with nearly the same, or even identical mean SBP. Does this mean that the health of the two populations with respect to blood pressure is the same? No! If one population is considerably more variable, then its SBP-related health is actually quite a bit worse. First, knowing nothing else but which population an individual is from, we are less certain of their SBP. Second, if there are extremes of SBP (values of it at which risk for bad things happening rises sharply; SBP>130 sharp increase in stroke risk, SBP far more people "falling through the cracks" at the extremes. The cyan shaded region in the below graph (a cartoon I made, not actual data) is how much more likely people in the blue population are to be at high risk due to hypertension or hypotension than people in the red population. The more variable population is more vulnerable . Back to your question, the current US (and global!) social moment of unrest against centuries of institutionalized anti-black racism and against half a millennium of colonization of American Indians, Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and Alaska Natives points out that the vulnerability—the increased uncertainty in outcomes, and the increased numbers in the extremes—of the populations defined by racial demographic groups (among others) is a good reason to look to methods, such as using mixed models/random effects models/hierarchical linear models/multilevel models/etc. (as @Tim rightly points out the language is a smidge muddled) to provide estimates of population variability. NB: I do not see this as an issue of Bayesian vs Frequentist, but as a question of substantive modeling of the world around us.
