Java Iterators - Trying to get a for each loop to work

So I have a Tree class where E is the datatype held and organized by the tree. I'd like to iterate through the Tree like this, or in a way similar to this: 1. Tree tree=new Tree (); 2. ...add some nodes... 3. for (String s : tree) 4. System.out.println(s); It gives me an error on line 3 though. Incompatible types required: java.lang.String found: java.lang.Object The following however works fine and as expected, performing a proper in-order traversal of the tree and printing each node out as it should: for (TreeIterator i = tree.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) System.out.println(i.next()); My Tree class looks like this: public class Tree implements java.lang.Iterable{ ... public TreeIterator iterator(){ return new TreeIterator (root);//return an iterator for the root node } .... } And my TreeIterator class looks like this: public class TreeIterator implements java.util.Iterator { public E next(){ ... } ... } But I want to get the for (String s : tree) loop working properly - any ideas? The whole point of this was to set up a clean foreach loop for use in my program, not to use that ugly for loop. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Edit : As per the best answer (and another equally good answer which was posted shortly after), the following made it work: Changing public class Tree implements java.lang.Iterable{ .... } to public class Tree implements java.lang.Iterable { .... } ...Thanks guys!
