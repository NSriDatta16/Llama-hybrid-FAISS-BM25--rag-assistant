(Easier if followed) The response variable should be one team's outcome. E.g. In India vs. Australia, your response variable can be either India or Australia depicting whether that team won or not (Easier if followed) Once you've done so, check for class populations so as to avoid predicting on unbalanced classes. E.g. If you select Australia, you need to make sure that they have equal wins and losses or somewhat balanced outcome. If Australia wins 90 out of 100 matches, it will add more steps to developing your prediction model (Imbalanced classes) Check out class undersampling or oversampling techniques. R provides packages such as ROSE and SMOTE which handle this imbalance based on defined parameters. I haven't looked at the dataset that you are using but if there are a lot of predictors, you can use PCA to reduce the number of predictors and make the computation quicker and less prone to erroneous interactions and predictors. Logically evaluate correlation results to detect highly correlated variables (Correlation does not imply causation) Try using logistic regression to start your model building process. You can also adopt the decision tree algorithm followed by random forests which use voting mechanism to classify outcomes.
