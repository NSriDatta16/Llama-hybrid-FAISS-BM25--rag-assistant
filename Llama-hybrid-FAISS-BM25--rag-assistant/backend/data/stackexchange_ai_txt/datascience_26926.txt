Find best (most efficient) combination of Ingredients

Question: Suggest me an approach to that kind of problem. Is it pure optimization problem? What might Machine Learning techniques can be helpful here? Case Study My reduced case study is as follows: I have 3 types of ingredients (A, B, C). In each experiment, some combination from the ingredients is chosen and applied on something. Result can be 1:poor , 2:middle , 3:high . Example: | Input | Output | |:----------:|:-----------:| | A | 2 | | AB | 1 | | ABC | 2 | | BC | 3 | | C | 2 | |... | ... | I need to find out what is the winning combination of ingredients according to the results. Thanks
