Uncertainty in spatio-temporal forecasting

We have a time series gridded panel dataset (spatio-temporal). The dataset is in 3D, where each (x,y,t) coordinate has a numeric value (such as the sea temperature at that location and at that specific point in time). So we can think of it as a matrix with a temporal component. The dataset is similar to this but with just one channel: I am trying to predict/forecast the nth time step values for the whole region (i.e., all x,y coordinates in the dataset) given the values for the n-1 time steps and the uncertainty. Can you all suggest any model/architecture/approach for the same? I was initially thinking of the Log-Gaussian Cox Process but it seems it's mostly applicable to point processes, while my dataset is gridded with each grid having a numeric value.
