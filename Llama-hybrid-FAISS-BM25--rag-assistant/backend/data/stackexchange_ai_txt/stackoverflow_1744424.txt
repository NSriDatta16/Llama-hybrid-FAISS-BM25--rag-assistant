handling data structures (hashes etc) gracefully in ruby

I recently did a class assignment where I made a really hacky data structure. I ended up using nested hashes, which seems like a good idea, but is really hard to iterate through and manage. I was doing general stuff, like one tag maps to a hash of items that map to prices and stuff like that. But some of them were getting more complicated. I know that rails uses a lot of more elegant seeming stuff with symbols and such (which I never use shameful face ) and I was wondering how I could optimize this. For example if I had my nested hashes something like this h["cool"][????][1.2] is there a graceful way of pulling those values out? Maybe I'm just a total newbie in this regard but I wanted to set things straight before I started doing more things. Maybe I'm even looking for something different like a mix of array/hash or something. Please let me know!
