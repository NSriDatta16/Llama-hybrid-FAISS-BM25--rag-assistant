When the structure of your data is naturally hierarchical or nested, multilevel modeling is a good candidate. More generally, it's one method to model interactions. A natural example is when your data is from an organized structure such as country, state, districts, where you want to examine effects at those levels. Another example where you can fit such a structure is is longitudinal analysis, where you have repeated measurements from many subjects over time (e.g. some biological response to a drug dose). One level of your model assumes a group mean response for all subjects over time. Another level of your model then allows for perturbations (random effects) from the group mean, to model individual differences. A popular and good book to start with is Gelman's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierachical Models .
