Time series data analysis - determining significance between treatment and control

We have some time series data for evaluating the effect of a drug in an animal model, with two dose levels and a control. So far we've looked at ANOVA for each time point, and there's a significant effect for the middle time points. However, the drug dose is not constant, as it needed to be reduced at later time points, which caused a convergence in the treatment and control by the end, so at the final time point the effect is not significant with ANOVA. What other approaches might we take with analyzing this data aside from the basic ANOVA? We aren't interested in prediction, just in evaluating significance at this time.
