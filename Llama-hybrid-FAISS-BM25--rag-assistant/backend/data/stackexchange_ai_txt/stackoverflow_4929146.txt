AutoUpdate the last five entrys of a table in a MySQL database

On this page you see at the bottom a "real time" updates of a twitter search with a very simple but elegant animation, i want to do the same but showing the last five entrys on my MySQL data base, is out there a good way to do this?, maybe a combination of php and jquery? Thanks for any help!
