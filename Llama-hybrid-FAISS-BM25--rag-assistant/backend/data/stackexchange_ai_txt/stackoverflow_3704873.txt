Looks like a missing jar file, containing the class "com.mmz.mvc.test.AgentDAOTest". Reading your build file suggests the jar used to be located in your "lib" directory. I'm assuming, of course, that this class is not a missing Java source file located under you "src" or "${test.dir}" directories.....
