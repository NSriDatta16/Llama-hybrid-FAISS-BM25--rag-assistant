Silverlight saving to Wordpress Database

I have a wordpress database for accounts and settings (or for this example, joomla accounts and settings database). I also have a working silverlight application that works all by itself without problems. How can I have the two communicate? For example, the user should be able to log on to my silverlight application using my wordpress/joomla DB. Also, any settings should be able to be saved onto the user's account on the website. Is this possible? If so, how? As of now, I am using Isolated Storage however, when the application needs to be loaded at another location, I want to be able to open the same settings as on my home PC. How could this be accomplished?
