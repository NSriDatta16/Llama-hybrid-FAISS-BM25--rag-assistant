Separate imputation models for separate substantive models on the same dataset?

I am working with a dataset for which I have generated three hypotheses, i.e. I built three substantive models (two logistic regressions and one cox regression with a different dependent variable). The dataset contains some missing values and I decided to fill the gaps with multiple imputation. Should I generate a separate imputation model for each substantive model or would it be better practice to create a single imputation model to be used with every substantive model? Or does it not even matter? I work in medicine and have no formal education in statistics, so I might be missing some fundamental understanding - always happy to learn!
