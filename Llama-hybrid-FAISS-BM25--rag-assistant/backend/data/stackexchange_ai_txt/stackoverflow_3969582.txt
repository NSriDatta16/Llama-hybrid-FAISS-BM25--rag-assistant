Embed private Google Spreadsheet

I'm trying to work out the best way to display a Google Spreadsheet in the members section of a website. Although the info in the spreadsheet isn't hugely sensitive, I'm not keen on publishing it and embedding it using an iFrame, so am trying to find a way to embed the spreadsheet while still keeping it private. I've tried using the Spreadsheets API (via the PHP Zend library) with some success, but it seems to fall apart if a lot of the cells are empty. As I'd also ideally like to keep any cell styling, does anyone know of a way to embed the spreadsheet via an iFrame or similar without publishing it? Any PHP/Javascript solutions most welcome!
