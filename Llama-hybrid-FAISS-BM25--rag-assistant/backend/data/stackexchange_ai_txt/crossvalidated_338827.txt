Can I improve my logistic regression model by feature selection, or something else?

I started working on a logistic regression model using R and below is the summary of the model. > summary(log_model1) Call: glm(formula = Outcome ~ ., family = "binomial", data = train_data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4397 -0.7175 -0.4329 0.7320 2.9974 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.819019 0.859810 -9.094 I tested the accuracy on both the train and test dataset but it was not that great (80 for train, 70 for test data). Is there any way the accuracy of model can be improved? Would it help to: Add extra features? (If yes, on what basis features need to be selected?) Removing the existing features? (If yes, on what basis features need to be rejected?) Standardize the dataset? Correct me if I am wrong in any of the above points.
