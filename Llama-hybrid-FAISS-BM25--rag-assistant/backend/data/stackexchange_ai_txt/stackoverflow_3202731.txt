Problem using OpacityMask (XAML)

Can someone explain this WPF behaviour? As I would expect, the above code generates the following image (Kaxaml): alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/11.png When I change the line in the image is as follow (didn't expect): alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/12.png The corners are not rounded anymore! This question is actually a "scaled down" example of a problem I'm experiencing in my software, which uses similar masks. How can I work around this?
