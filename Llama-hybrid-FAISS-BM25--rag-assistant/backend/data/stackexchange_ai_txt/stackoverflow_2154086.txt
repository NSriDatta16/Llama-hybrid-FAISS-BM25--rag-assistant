Do you want to build a site which basically turns into a shop once a user signs up? Then I have to assume you also might want to hide the other ecommerce components such as 'add to cart' buttons, checkout button, etc. You could hide the shop components in various places in your site design template /app/design/frontend/default/xyz/template (where 'xyz' is 'default' or your organization's design folder). Even though it's technically straight forward there are a lot of files to check this way. What you'd have to do is find the HTML that you don't want your guests to see and enclose it like so: isLoggedIn()): ?> lines of html you'd like to disable for guests
