For increasng your accuracy the simplest thing to do in tensorflow is using Dropout technique. Try to use tf.nn.dropout . between your hidden layers. Do not use it for your first and last layers. For applying that, you can take a look at How to apply Drop Out in Tensorflow to improve the accuracy of neural network .
