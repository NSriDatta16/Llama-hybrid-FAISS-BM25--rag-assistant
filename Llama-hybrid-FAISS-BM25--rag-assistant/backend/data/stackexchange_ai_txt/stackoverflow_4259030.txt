Jquery Find and Replace Number

I am really struggling to find a solution to this i want to find every instance of a number in a paragraph of text. this is the number 20px and this is the number 100 and this is the number 10. So i want to take this and have it ouput the following. 20 100 10 $(document).ready(function() { var text = $('.text').text().toString().search( new RegExp( /^[0-9]+$/ i ) ); alert(text); }); from the alert i just want it to output the numbers in the text i.e 20 100 10, i now this is way off but any help to put me in the right direction i am banging my head against a wall, thanks.
