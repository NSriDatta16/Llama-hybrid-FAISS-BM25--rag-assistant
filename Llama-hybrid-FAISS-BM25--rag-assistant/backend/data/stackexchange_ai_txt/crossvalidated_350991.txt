Graph-convolutional neural networks---how to determine feature matrix

I've been recently studying the GCNs---graph-convolutional neural networks. Given a triplet (A,F,C), where A is the network-adjacency matrix, F the network feature matrix and C the matrix of classes, corresponding to each node, GCNs are able to learn a representation of classes. The original paper (Kipf et al. 2016, https://github.com/tkipf/gcn ) uses Cora dataset and some others, where filters are predefined. My question is, how does one define the feature matrix? Where does this come from? Thank you!
