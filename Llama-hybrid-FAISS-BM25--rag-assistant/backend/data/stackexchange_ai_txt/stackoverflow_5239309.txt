Visual C++/CLI - CLR Class - LNK2020 Error - how to fix?

I have a project, where I must connect to a library that is C based, and I was not able to get at the functions from C# using the DLLImport. I have to use a project that is C++/CLI based to surface these functions for use. (more to that story but not important). I studied C++ over 10 years ago, so forgive me if this seems like it is naive. I purchased a few books on the C++/CLI implementation last year, and have some grasp of what is involved - I only dug into those books for this project. (I have been a programmer for a long time). I thought I had better start a small project example project to familiarize myself with what will be involved, to make sure I could compile, etc. I started a project using Visual Studio 2008 SP1; Visual C++ > CLR > Class Library. In the project - I want to use both managed and native from the DLL. So the /clr switch is used. I have used other names in the real code; but this is very, very close. (there are no other files, or functions at this point) Header: //myWrapper.h #pragma once using namespace System; namespace myWrapper { public ref class myWrappedService { myWrappedService(); bool Connected(String ^user,String ^password,String ^domain); } }; And the implementation has this. //myWrapper.cpp //This is the main DLL file #include "stdafx.h" #include "myWrapper.h" using namespace System; public ref class myWrappedService { public: myWrappedService() {} bool Connected(String ^user,String ^password,String ^domain) { //just a simple result to start - no real functionality bool result = false; return result; } }; That is the code - that compiles but gets linker errors. error LNK2020: unresolved token (06000002) myWrapper.myWrappedService::Connected fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved external. This looked dead easy - and I might be thinking to much from a C# approach. I expect this to be something simple - but I am not familiar with what I should be seeing in the CLI approach. (I spent a few hours looking for answers and finally feel I need to post a question where it might get answered).
