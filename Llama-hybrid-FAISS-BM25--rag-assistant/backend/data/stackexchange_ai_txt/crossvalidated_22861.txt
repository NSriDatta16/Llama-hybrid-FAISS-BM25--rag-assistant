Expressing observations in regression

Suppose we are using logistic regression on a binary outcome variable $Y$ with two continuous predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$. Suppose the observation $Y = 1, X_1 = 10, X_2 = 15$ occurs 1000 times. In SAS, how would you account for this frequency in the regression without having to manually type the observation 1000 times? Edit. I figured it out.
