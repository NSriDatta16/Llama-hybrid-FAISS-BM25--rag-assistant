Printing the tweets that were incorrectly predicted after applying a machine learning classifier

I applied the random forest classifier to my csv file to classify the tweets as spam or not spam and after an accuracy of 93%, when I printed the confusion matrix I got [[1068 105] [ 65 1262]]. Now I would like to print the 65 false negative tweets and the 105 false positive tweets but I am unable to do that. I tried to print the y_test and y_predict but it is difficult to map the incorrectly identified tweets. Has anyone please got any advice on this? RandomForest = RandomForestClassifier() RandomForest.fit(x_train, y_train) y_predict = RandomForest.predict(x_test) print(confusion_matrix(y_test,y_predictRF)) Thank you
