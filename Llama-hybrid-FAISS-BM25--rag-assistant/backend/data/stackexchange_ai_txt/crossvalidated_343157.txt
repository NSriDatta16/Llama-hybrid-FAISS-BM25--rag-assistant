I have 20000 potential features but only 200 instances, how can I do feature selection for an SVM classifier?

I have 20,000 potential features, but only 200 instances, how can I do feature selection for an SVM classifier, especially LIBSVM? Is there any fast way to do it rather than brute force? Since, there are too many potential combinations of features with a brute force approach. In the end, I would expect between 50 to 100 features to be enough to maximise unbiased performance. I know the data can be separated through the RBF kernel. Linear kernel has some degree of separation but performs much worse than RBF.
