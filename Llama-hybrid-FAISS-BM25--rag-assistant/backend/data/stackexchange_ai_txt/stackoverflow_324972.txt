A single comments table is the more elegant design, I think. Rather than multiple FKs though, consider an intermediate table - CommentedItem. So Friend, Event, Group, etc all have FKs to CommentedItem, and you create a CommentedItem row for each new row in each of those tables. Now Comments only needs one FK, to CommentedItem. For example, to get all Comments for a given Friend: SELECT * FROM Comment c JOIN CommentedItem ci on c.CommentedItemId = ci.CommentedItemId JOIN Friend f on f.CommentedItemId = ci.CommentedItemId WHERE f.FriendId = @FriendId
