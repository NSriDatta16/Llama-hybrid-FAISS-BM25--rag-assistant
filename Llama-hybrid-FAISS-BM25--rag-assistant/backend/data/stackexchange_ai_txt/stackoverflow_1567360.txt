Huge EAR deployment

I'm trying to figure out how to deploy a huge (40-50 MB) EAR file to the server through a rather slow VPN connection. The EAR contains EJB and WAR projects created in Glassfish, and 90% of the file size is from external dependency libraries used. Has anyone came up with a strategy for elegant deployment to production system from Netbeans, where the deployment (over the network) is done only for what is really needed (i.e. just one WAR, not the entire EAR, or just one lib, not the entire libraries subproject). Related to the first point, how to separate external dependency libs from project in Netbeans, so that the project compiles on development machine, but when the EAR/WAR/EJB is created it does not contain all the dependency JARs, which are making it huge. Perhaps we need to write custom ant script? Start using maven? Thank you all for kind answers, Bozo
