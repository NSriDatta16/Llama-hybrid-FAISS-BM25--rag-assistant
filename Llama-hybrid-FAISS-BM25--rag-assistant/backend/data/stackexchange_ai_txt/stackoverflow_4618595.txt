Styling GWT's DockLayoutPanel

I am trying to create a DockLayoutPanel using GWT. It should occupy the complete screen. DockLayoutPanel dockPanel = new DockLayoutPanel(Unit.EM); dockPanel.addSouth(new HTML("South"), 2); dockPanel.addNorth(new HTML("North"), 2); dockPanel.addEast(new HTML("Easat"), 2); dockPanel.addWest(new HTML("West"), 2); dockPanel.add(new HTML("Center")); RootLayoutPanel.get().add(dockPanel); I believe that the second parameter to the add methods is the width of the respective panels. How does the layout decide the height of the panel? How can I style the layout, like add border to the panels, spacing between the panels, add panel headings in-line with the border? Should the panel background colors be set using CSS, or is there a way to do so from java? Can I make these panels as drag and drop panels?
