I am assuming that categorical variable with 100s of levels code the different items. You can certainly do that, and build a logistic regression model, probably using some form of regularization, maybe fused lasso , see Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? . That will give a model with a separate intercept for each item, but the slopes for the other covariables will be equal. If that seems unreasonable, you can try to include interactions, but be careful, the number of parameters could explode ... If some machines (operators ...) are irrelevant for some items, see How do you deal with "nested" variables in a regression model? . Alternatively, you could build separate models for each item, but that would require an enormous sample size, so the first option is probably preferable.
