"Is it correct to average the predictions as follows". Yes, it is correct. One way to prove it is writing all of $y$ in a vector, $Y=(y_{11}, y_{12}, y_{13},...,y_{n1}, y_{n2}, y_{n3})^t$. Let $$A=\frac 1 n \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&...&1&0&0\\ 0&1&0&...&0&1&0\\ 0&0&1&...&0&0&1 \end{pmatrix}$$ Then your $y$ can be expressed as$$y=AY$$ We have $$y \sim N(A\mathrm{E}(Y), A\mathrm{Var}(Y)A^t)$$ which is the same as yours after some simplifications. I do not understand your last question. Average is just average and there is no better way.
