You can leverage apache's mod_negotiation module . This way you can use the full range of negotiation capabilities the module offers, including your own preferences for the content type (e,g, "I really want to deliver application/xhtml+xml, unless the client very much prefers something else"). basic solution: create a .htaccess file with AddHandler type-map .var as contents create a file foo.var with URI: foo URI: foo.php/html Content-type: text/html; qs=0.7 URI: foo.php/xhtml Content-type: application/xhtml+xml; qs=0.8 as contents create a file foo.php with as contents. request http://localhost/whatever/foo.var For this to work you need mod_negotiation enabled, the appropriate AllowOverride privileges for AddHandler and AcceptPathInfo not being disabled for $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']. With my Firefox sending "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8" and the example .var map the result is "selected type: xhtml". You can use other "tweaks" to get rid of PATH_INFO or the need to request foo .var , but the basic concept is: let mod_negotiation redirect the request to your php script in a way that the script can "read" the selected content-type. So, does anyone know of a tried and tested piece of PHP code to select It's not a pure php solution but I'd say mod_negotiation has been tried and tested ;-)
