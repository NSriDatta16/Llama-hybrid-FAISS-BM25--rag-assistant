I would like to offer you the new feature of HTML5 which is called Dom Storage but since only the new browsers are supporting it, it could be a problem using it at this point. With DOM Storage, you can store data on user browser. Since it can store up to 5MB per domain in Mozilla Firefox[3], Google Chrome, and Opera, 10MB per storage area in Internet Explorer, you can store answers and question ids in the DOM Storage. Even with DOM Storage, let alone Database hit, you can reduce server hits as well. Since we all know working with cookies is hassle sometimes and it can store 4kb, the easiest way is now to store key-value information in DOM Storage. You can store key-value information specifically for sessions as well as locally. When session ends, the session based info will be wiped off from the browser but if you store local based values, even the user closes the tab, the key-value will remain for a while. Example Code: You have viewed this page an untold number of time(s). var storage = window.localStorage; if (!storage.pageLoadCount) storage.pageLoadCount = 0; storage.pageLoadCount = parseInt(storage.pageLoadCount, 10) + 1; document.getElementById('count').innerHTML = storage.pageLoadCount; You can learn more about DOM Storage from the links below : https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Storage http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197062%28VS.85%29.aspx
