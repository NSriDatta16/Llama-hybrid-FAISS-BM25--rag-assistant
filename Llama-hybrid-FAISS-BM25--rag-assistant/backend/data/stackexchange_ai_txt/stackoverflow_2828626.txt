can't you just update the iajc compile target to use the new jar on the classpath? It's not possible to force the classloader to prefer a given jar file over another one. If you must relate to several version of the same class, then you should consider OSGI. The simplest solution will be to just use libraries from the project or a Maven/Ivy repository and ignore the libraries in your global ant folder. An example: Updated: You also have to use another Ant. If you're using Eclipse, try the bundled one directly from the Ant view. You also have another option, but it's a little bit more difficult. That is to use AspectJ load-time weaving instead. If you go for that option, you can compile with an ordinary compile task, but you have to do the weaving with an JVM agent at startup. You can read more about it here . I hope this helps!
