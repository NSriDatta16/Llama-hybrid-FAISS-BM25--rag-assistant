Should I learn ASP.NET AJAX, jQuery or both?

I'm .NET developer. Most of my career I worked on web based intranet applications (ASP.NET WebForms) but always as a server side developer. Client side development was done by my colleagues more skilled in JavaScript and different JS frameworks. At the moment I have some JavaScript skills and very elementary understanding of both ASP.NET AJAX (I mean client side library) and jQuery. It mostly means that I can read JS code and I can write very simple functions. I would like to be better in this area and I'm planning to learn some of these technologies. Should I learn both ASP.NET AJAX and jQuery or skip ASP.NET AJAX and go directly to jQuery? By learning I mean really deep understanding of concepts and whole framework. At the moment I'm reading Introducing Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX but I'm not very happy with it. It doesn't have coverage I would expect. I have already bought ASP.NET AJAX in Action and jQuery in Action . Do you recommend me any other sources? Edit: So nobody defends ASP.NET AJAX? It looks like this API exists only to fill some MS certification exams.
