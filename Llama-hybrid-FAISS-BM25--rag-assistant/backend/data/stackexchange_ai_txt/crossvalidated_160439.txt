How can I test if predicted value is statistically different from the corresponding observed value, accounting for sample size of the observed value?

I'm trying to test whether a observed value is statistically different from its corresponding predicted value. The observed value is a rate of a particular healthcare treatment, the predicted is the expected rate given the value of the independent variables. My first idea was simply to have CIs around the predicted value, and concluding that if the observed value fell outside the CI it was statistically different. But, I want to eliminate the possibility that the observed value falls outside the CI by chance because it is the value for a comparatively small organisation. I'm 'essentially' trying to do what a funnel plot does to identify special cause variation, whilst comparing predicted and observed values. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can do this?
