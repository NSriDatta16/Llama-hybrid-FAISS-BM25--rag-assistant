The optimal amount of folds depends on several things, particularly the amount of instances you have and the stability of the classification algorithm. In your case many training instances are available so there is no practical limitation in number of folds there. SVMs are quite stable, which means that the classifiers won't differ very much across different folds. This means you don't need to use many folds. That said, 10-fold cross-validation is commonly used. Using 50 folds is definitely overkill in your situation. If you have the time for it, repeated cross-validation may be interesting (e.g. 3x 10-fold cross-validation), though some researchers advocate against it.
