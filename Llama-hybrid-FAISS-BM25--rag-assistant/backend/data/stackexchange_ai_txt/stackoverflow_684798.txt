omg, it have a lot of errors: int main - should return value; you don't use template in your function; Mystr - not correct name in function call, names in c++ are case sencetive; char CStr - doesn't have method front, and std::string too; you couldn't get address of first element such as in case with vector; it will be better if you will accept std::string as const reference; you forgot to include string header; ... fixed your example, with your code organize and your naming: #include #include #include void WriteStr2BinFh( const std::string& St, std::ostream &out ) { out.write( St.c_str(), St.size() ); } int main() { std::string MyStr = "Foo"; std::ofstream myfile( "OuputFile.txt", std::ios::binary | std::ios::out ); for (size_t i = 0; i but I've reccomended to use std::fill_n algorithm std::fill_n( std::ostream_iterator ( myfile, "\t" ), 10, MyStr );
