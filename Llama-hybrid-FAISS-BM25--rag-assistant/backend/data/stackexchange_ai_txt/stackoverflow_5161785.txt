If it always comes in that format, you can use $newtime = preg_replace("/\d\d\/\d\d/\d\d\d\d/", "$3/$2/$1", $date); To convert it to yyyy/mm/dd, then just plug that into strtotime() It's definitely not the most elegant solution, I would actually suggest reworking the database (create a new column, run a script to read each entry, generate the new date, then input that in, delete the old date field, then rename the new one, so this only has to be done once).
