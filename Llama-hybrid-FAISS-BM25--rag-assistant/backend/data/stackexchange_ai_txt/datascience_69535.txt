One option is to add an additional neural network model from the output of standard BERT. During training, standard BERT would learn the sentence embeddings. The additional neural network would learn to classify the different senses of the same string literal based on the context of the sentence. One version of this was done in " Using BERT for Word Sense Disambiguation ".
