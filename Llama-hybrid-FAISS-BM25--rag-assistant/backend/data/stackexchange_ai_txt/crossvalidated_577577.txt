How to run Bayesian optimization experiments in parallel?

Suppose I have the following hyperparameters for tuning: learning_rate: [0.00001, 0.1] epochs: [200,300,400,....,1000] batch_size: [16,32,64,128] If I want to run experiments using 4 parallel jobs, can I just divide one parameter space into 4 subspaces to achieve parallelism? For example, 1st job: learning_rate: [0.00001, 0.0001] epochs:[200,300,400,....,1000] batch_size: [16,32,64,128] 2nd job: learning_rate: [0.0001, 0.001] epochs: [200,300,400,....,1000] batch_size: [16,32,64,128] and so on. Does this make sense?
