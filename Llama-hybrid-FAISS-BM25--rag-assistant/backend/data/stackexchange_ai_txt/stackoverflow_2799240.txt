It kind of depends on the nature of the data, and your "target audience". If this is a lot of data, maybe file storage is not something you want, and you want to look at a database-like storage. There are server-less databases like SQLite or SQL Server Compact You can use SQL Server Express (or Oracle Home) if you need to scale to a "enterprise" database If it is some minimal set of user choices, that are often read, and limited written, the registry is a good choice. If you are in an enterprise environment, you also need to be aware on limitations (policies) that prevent you from storing a lot of data in the user profile. If you want the user be able to select the files, allow the user to store the data in My Documents , but get the exact location from the user. Technical data is better stored in the "Local Application data" or "Isolated Storage".
