I'm the author of that report! Thanks for checking it out. The method is indeed extremely simple - no statistics required at all. I use regression and other econometric techniques in most of my other work, but for this research question (how much biking and walking is going on in each census tract?), I couldn't see a great way to do this. That said, you are correct that there is no way to ground-truth the results, and our estimates are rough. A basic regression that aims to explain variation in miles walked at the individual level, for instance, has an R-squared of only 0.04 when I include only gender-age-neighborhood categories as the independent variables. This isn't a good indicator of how accurate the averages in each category are, however, and the accuracy of the averages is what matters here. Goodness of fit statistics will always be much lower when trying to predict individual, idiosyncratic behavior choices than they will be when predicting averages. Nobody really knows how much biking or walking happens in each tract, and our point with this paper is that this really simple method offers a better guess than we've seen elsewhere. The simplicity is attractive because it makes the work easily replicable, even by bike/ped planners who are not experts in statistics. That said, suggestions for improvement are very welcome! A quick additional response on the cluster analysis - we did not go into this in the paper, but the cluster results become quite unstable when we identify more than four clusters. In addition to the instability of the clusters, tracts that we know (from personal experience) are extremely similar to one another begin to get classified in different groups. This is why we use the four cluster solution for the neighborhood types in the analysis.
