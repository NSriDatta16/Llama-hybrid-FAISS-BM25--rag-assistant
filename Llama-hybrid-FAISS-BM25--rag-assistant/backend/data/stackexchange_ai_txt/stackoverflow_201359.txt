How to get the result of strlen into an int without a warning when compiling with /Wp64

int l = strlen(s); warning C4244: '=' : conversion from '__w64 int' to 'int', possible loss of data I need to replace strlen with an inline function int l = new_strlen(s); But how do I portably get the result of the strlen into the int without a warning, and without using pragmas? I can guarantee there aren't more than 2 billion characters in my string! All the obvious things like reinterpret_cast, static_cast also produce errors or warnings. EDIT: Argh. a c-style cast: (int) does work. I had been convinced that it did not.
