RTF files begin with two control sequences, the first of which specifies the RTF version (not the standard, but almost always the cs \rtf1 ), and the second of which specifies the character set, which is one of \ansi (usual), \mac , \pc , or pca (almost never encountered). Immediately after this, it is possible to specify Unicode codepages that modify the default interpretation of characters, given by \ansicpg . There's not a whole lot of documentation I can find on this. Try looking at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140301(office.10).aspx , and the nice folks on the AbiWord developer's mailing list have spent a lot of time deciphering the various RTF specs.
