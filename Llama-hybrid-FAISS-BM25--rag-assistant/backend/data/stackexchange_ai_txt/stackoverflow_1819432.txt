Trying to understand what snmp4jAgentJMX does and if it suits what I need

I been trying to write an snmp wrapper agent for my JMX Enabled application which will translate all the information that is layd out in JMX MBeans into SNMP attributes. I'm a bit at loss in trying to understand where to start and what to use. From what I've read, snmp4j is probably the go to snmp library for Java but I couldn't manage to understand the code examples that are in the Snmp4jAgent. Also, from reading the description for SNMP4JAgentJMX in the authors web site I think Snmp4jAgentJMX could help me write this agent but I could not understand how to use it. Actually, looking at the example code (org.snmp4j.agent.mo.jmx.example.JMXTestAgent) I could not find the part where the code registers with any MBean or JMX Factory, which led me to assume that what I did not understand correctly what this code does. I would very much appreciate code examples and/or some tutorials or documentation for someone who has not had experience with SNMP. Thank you!!
