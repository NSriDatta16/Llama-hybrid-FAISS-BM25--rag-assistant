Classification of DNA Sequences

I have a database of 3190 instances of DNA consisting of 60 sequential DNA nucleotide positions classified according to 3 types: EI, IE, Other. I want to formulate a supervised classifier. My present approach is to formulate a 2nd order Markov Transition Matrix for each instance and apply the resulting data to a Neural Network. How best to approach this classification problem, given that the Sequence of the data should be relevant? Is there a better approach than the one I came up with?
