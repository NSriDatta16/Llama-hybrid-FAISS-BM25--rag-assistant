Given that you don't want a strongly typed data collection then I would have thought a HashTable would be suitable for your situation. You could create an Extention method for this also, like another poster suggested for the Dictionary implementation. E.g. public static class StorageExtentions { public static T Get (this Hashtable table, object key) { return (T) table[key]; } } Your code would then look like: int i = 12; string s = "test"; double x = 24.1; Hashtable Storage = new Hashtable(); Storage.Add("age", i); Storage.Add("name", s); Storage.Add("bmi", x); int a = Storage.Get ("age"); string b = Storage.Get ("name"); double c = Storage.Get ("bmi");
