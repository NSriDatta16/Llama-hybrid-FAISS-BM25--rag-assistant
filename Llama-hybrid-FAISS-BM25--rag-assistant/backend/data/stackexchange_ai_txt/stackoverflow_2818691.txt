magento - webserver question

I've uploaded the Magento installation file to my hosting and I've been told to go to the URL you uploaded it to using you browser, then the installation wizard will run you through the processes. I uploaded to /home/domain/public_html/magneto What URL should I use to access it? Thanks in advance
