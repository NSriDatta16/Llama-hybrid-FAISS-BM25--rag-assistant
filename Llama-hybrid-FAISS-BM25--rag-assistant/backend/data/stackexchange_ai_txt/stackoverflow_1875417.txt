This argument is getting a little daft... Nobody seems to be suggesting that tables are used for layout without semantic meaning, only that the example data provided is tabular and therefore should be displayed in a table. So I can't see the point of posting links about table layout when it is clear that everyone taking part in this debate moved past that years ago. As BalusC says, the data could quite correctly be displayed in a definition list. It certainly produces more elegant markup, but whether it is more semantically correct is (obviously, from this discussion) debatable. I know of no definition of tabular data that precludes this use, including the OED! Thus using a table for this data is, as prodigitalson says, also fully valid. Robert Grant - could you provide a link that defines a table as data that requires two labels to identify it? I'm not aware of this definition, but I am willing to learn. I am a little confused as to how using spans in a div is more semantically valid than a table though. Or how it is in any way semantic. Both are meaningless tags. The markup used must establish the relationship between the key-value pairs. Only a table or dl can do this. The example markup for the table is pretty sound (as there is no need for a thead btw, the tbody tag is not really necessary as there are no other elements of the table to differentiate). A scope="row" on the tags is necessary for screen readers though, in addition to the caption. Having said all this, the whole point here is to help someone solve a problem. The nature of that problem would tend to indicate that garj is not an advanced front end developer and that their css skills may not be at the highest standard yet. To me, this means that using a tabular solution is preferable. Styling a dl in a way which degrades gracefully in any browser with a substantial market share is not a trivial task by any means.
