Right now BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) and UML activity diagrams are the two most popular options for that. I think of BPMN as the right choice when you are modeling the business aspects of the organization and move to Activity Diagrams as soon as you drill down to the technical design of the software system (as a core component of the UML language, activity diagrams are a better fit when having to combine workflow information with other views of the system, expressed also as UML diagrams like class diagrams or sequence diagrams). Note that now a UML profile for BPMN is being created which means that you will be able to mix BPMN and UML diagrams in the same project
