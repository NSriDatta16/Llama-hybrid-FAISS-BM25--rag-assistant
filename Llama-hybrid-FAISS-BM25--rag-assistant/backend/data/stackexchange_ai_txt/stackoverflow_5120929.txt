I think this is due to the hash being used as the delimiter for the queries. http get queries are encoded using ? and & like so. http://mysite.com/Client/?entryPoint=start&paramater=1 The hash is reserved as the url fragment identifier. If, for some unknown reason you can't change the query delimitation then you could just use the first parameter and add your own delimitation syntax. For example. http://mysite.com/Client/?entryPoint=start_paramater=1_foo=bar_etc=0 You would then just split the single parameter on the chosen delimiter (in this case the underscrore _) then again in to variable/value pairs by splitting on the equals sign (=)
