I was actually working on this at the same time - the solution I came up with is pretty much identical to Anurag's. However I thought it might be worth sharing as I had a slightly different way of calculating the frequency of occurrences, using the ternary operator and checking if the value has been counted yet in a slightly different way. function sortByFrequencyAndFilter(myArray) { var newArray = []; var freq = {}; //Count Frequency of Occurances var i=myArray.length-1; for (var i;i>-1;i--) { var value = myArray[i]; freq[value]==null?freq[value]=1:freq[value]++; } //Create Array of Filtered Values for (var value in freq) { newArray.push(value); } //Define Sort Function and Return Sorted Results function compareFreq(a,b) { return freq[b]-freq[a]; } return newArray.sort(compareFreq); }
