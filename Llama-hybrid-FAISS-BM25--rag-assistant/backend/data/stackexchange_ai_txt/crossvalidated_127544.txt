I am less familiar with the Park test . The Wikipedia page only lists what you call the first form. What you are calling the second form is identical to the Breusch-Pagan test . It is very well established, for what that's worth. Regarding the distinction between using logged or non-logged predictors and response variables, it may help you to read this excellent CV thread: Interpretation of log transformed predictor . In general, the two-stage approach to modeling (i.e., test for assumptions, and fit standard model if non-significant or robust model if significant) is not recommended (see this excellent CV thread: A principled method for choosing between t test or non-parametric e.g. Wilcoxon in small samples ). If you are worried about the possibility of heteroscedasticity, you would be better off just using robust methods, such as the Huber-White heteroscedasticity consistent 'sandwich' standard errors, by default. For some examples of various strategies that can be used with heteroscedastistic data, it may help to read my answer here: Alternatives to one-way ANOVA for heteroscedastic data .
