Inherit from QDomNode to create PHP Code Fragments in a QDomDocument

I write a program which should output PHP code containing mainly basic HTML code but a few PHP commands. Therefore I wanted to use QDomDocument to write this file in an object oriented style. I created a class QDomPHPCode inheriting from QDomNode. I've overwritten save() which writes the PHP code including the to a QTextStream. The problem now is that to create such an element, I have to call one of the factory methods QDomDocument::create...() , but of course, there doesn't exist one for my own class. I thought about subclassing QDomDocument in order to implement such a method for my QDomPHPCode node and therefore watched the source code of QDomDocument. The functions create...() call the functions in QDomDocumentPrivate with the same name, so in order to implement an own create...() function implies the need to create one in QDomDocumentPrivate. The latter requires me to subclass QDomDocumentPrivate which isn't visible to #include and therefore can't be subclassed as far as I know. Is there any possibility to do what I want to do? Or is it definitely the better (or only) way to create a PHP file completely on my own? Thanks in advance!
