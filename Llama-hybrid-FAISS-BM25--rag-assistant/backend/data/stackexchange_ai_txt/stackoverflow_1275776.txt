Is there a CSS selector to select text (inline blocks) within a rectangular box?

Can a CSS rule select the portion of a box which contains text (or an inline block)? For example, an HTML fragment like The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog might be laid out like this: +--------------------------+ | The quick brown fox | | jumped over the | | lazy dog | +--------------------------| If I create a CSS rule like p { background: red } then the whole box/rectangle will have a red background, including the "whitespace" at the end of each line. Is there a way to specify a selector such that, on each line, only the actual text has a red background? I notice that by default the cursor changes from 'arrow' to 'i-beam' when it's actually over text; when it's elsewhere within the paragraph box, not over text, then it's an arrow not an i-beam. If I specify an explicit rule like p { cursor: crosshair } then it's effective everywhere within the rectangular box. Again, is it possible to have a rule that's selected only when the cursor is actually over text?
