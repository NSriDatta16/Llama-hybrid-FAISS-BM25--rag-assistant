It is wise to just refactor your main "huge blob" fields into a separate model (like BookBody) which is usually not needed when operating with models in bulk. Alternatively, you can use the :select option on finders BookWithHugeBlobOfText.find(:first, :select=>"only,small,columns") Records selected that way will be readonly since the Rails philosophy says (and rightfully so!) that you need to have all data on the model to validate it. Lazy loading would be a nice to have, but as it stands now I would discourage you from using monkeypatch plugins for this. Another option would be to create a SQL view which would only contain the lightweight fields and run your ops from there.
