Specify User Agent for WPF WebBrowser Control

I need to alter the default User Agent used by the WPF WebBrowser control. I have looked at the properties of the IWebBrowser2 object behind the control, and tried specifying the user agent by specifying it when calling "Navigate" as Suggested Here Is this possible?
