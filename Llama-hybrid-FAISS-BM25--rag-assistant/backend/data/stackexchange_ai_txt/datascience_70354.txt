Binary Classification of a ship Dataset

What are the best options for a big dataset classification? I am thinking of 2 solutions- 1. Autoencoders 2. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) I think the first approach is better.Does it works for my problem?Or maybe someother solution is better? Thank you
