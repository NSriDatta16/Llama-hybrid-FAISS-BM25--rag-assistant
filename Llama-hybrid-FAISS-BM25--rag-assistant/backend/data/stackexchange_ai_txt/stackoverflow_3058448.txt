Place Eclipse Project File in Separate Directory

I'm using a default Eclipse project file generated for my Android application, and I want to keep it in a targets/ directory (along with other eclipse-specific files) in order to better organize my project structure (I also plan on adding a target for NetBeans). Simple question, I suppose: Is this possible?
