Data science project examples based on Cookie Cutter Data science template

Interested by production ready data science project do you have any public github reference concrete implementation? As an example i found this project template structure https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/ but can't find any simple project (like titanic one or other) that could fit this structure on public github; meanwhile it would be wonderful to help newcomers as me!
