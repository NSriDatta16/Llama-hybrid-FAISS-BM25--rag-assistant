I don't know if you can create multiple sources for a single ParticleSystem , but your second solution (creating an array of ParticleSystem ) is a good general solution for solving this kind of problem. As long as you can reinitialise the ParticleSystem , you will avoid any other overhead such as instantiation costs and memory fragmentation.
