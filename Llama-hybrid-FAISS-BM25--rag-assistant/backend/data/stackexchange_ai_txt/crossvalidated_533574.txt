Are the outputs of generalized linear models no longer linear in the parameters?

I'm reading Mathematics for Machine learning , and I came across the following passage regarding Generalized Linear Models: "Note that although we are talking about “generalized linear models”, the outputs y are no longer linear in the parameters θ" I'm a little confused by this since for logistic regression (for example), the outputs do seem to be linear in the parameters. What am I missing?
