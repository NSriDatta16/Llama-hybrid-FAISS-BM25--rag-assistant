Multilevel Moderation with nested data and repeated measures

I am currently trying to test a moderated mediation model with nested data and repeated measures. My independent, moderator, mediator, and dependent variables are on the individual level. I used repeated measures and collected the data for all variables from individual respondents on 6 different points in time. These individual respondents were nested in groups. I had too few respondents to examine time series per individual and therefore decided to make a cross-sectional data file. This file is structured as following (considering two hypothetical respondents residing in different groups): Respondent# - Time - Group 1 - 1 - 1 1 - 2 - 1 1 - 3 - 1 1 - 4 - 1 1 - 5 - 1 1 - 6 - 1 2 - 1 - 2 2 - 2 - 2 2 - 3 - 2 2 - 4 - 2 2 - 5 - 2 I am wondering if it is statistically possible to conduct an individual-level moderated mediation that takes nesting in groups/time into account, using this data. I could not find any resources for this type of analysis (I did find a syntax for testing a multilevel moderated mediation with a level 2 moderator. However, my model includes a level 1 moderator). Also, if you have experience with this sort of analysis, I would greatly appreciate if you could share the syntax (e.g., for Mplus) you used. Your help is very welcome!
