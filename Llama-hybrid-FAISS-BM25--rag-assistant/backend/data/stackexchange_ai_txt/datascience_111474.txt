According to our comments, your objective is to "predict any issued according to the previous issues" The best way to include time series data in such a dataset is to include variable crawling through the past dates. For example : Value of the latest known records Value of the 7 latest known records Variance of the 7 latest known records Min, Max, etc Example : If you want to predict in 2022-06-01, you only know data before this date, so creating variables taking past information like that can be a good idea. The biggest problem will be adapting your period to your problem (is there any gain in information if you look a few years before ?) and to handle your first cases (what do you put in the variable "Value of the 7 latest known 'issues'" if you only know 2 past records for example).
