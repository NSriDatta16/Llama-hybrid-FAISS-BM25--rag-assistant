STArtThread

HI All i'm completing a sample Project(WPF) to show my boss but i need a feature to finish it. I have a Login Window to authenticate and access in the software now i wish put this LoginWindow as STArtThread so if the user can authenticate(with right password and username) automatically the LoginWindow disappear and can access to use the software. Do you have any idea how work out this feature? Thanks for your attention. Bye
