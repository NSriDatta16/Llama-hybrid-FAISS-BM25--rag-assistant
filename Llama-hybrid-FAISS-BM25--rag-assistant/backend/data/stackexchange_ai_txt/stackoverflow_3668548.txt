You can use the lib pragma to prepend directories to the path perl uses to find modules. So, if there is a module named Foo installed in the default directories and a different version installed in /home/cowens/perl5 you can say use lib "/home/cowens/perl5"; use Foo; and perl will find the version in /home/cowens/perl5 .
