Work with large number of features for machine learning with pandas and sklearn

I'm relatively new to data science and I'm working with a large dataset. It has lots of rows and around 270 features after removing features with a lot of nan valuew and encoding categorical features. And when I run logistic regression using sklearn, my computer runs out of ram and crashes. How do I handle huge datasets like these?
