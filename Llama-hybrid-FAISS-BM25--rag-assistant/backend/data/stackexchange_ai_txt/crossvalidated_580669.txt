Should I use ordered factor in glm model in R?

I want to fit a generalized linear model (logistic regression) to Titanic dataset . In EDA stage I transformed a variable ( Pclass ) to ordered factor. Before passing data to glm function should I: a. leave it as ordered factor b. transform it to unordered factor or c. transform it to integer?
