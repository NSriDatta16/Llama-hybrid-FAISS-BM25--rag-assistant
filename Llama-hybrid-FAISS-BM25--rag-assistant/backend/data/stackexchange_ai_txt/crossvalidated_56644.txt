Try removing the sqrt(n_sata_points) from the variance of the mu prior. The results are that the ratio in question is (approximately) 1. This suggests the error is in that term. Assume for the moment that the true std. deviation is known, call it $\sigma$. Also, define $\hat{\mu}$ as the empirical mean. You have assigned the prior $$ \mu \sim \text{Normal}\left( \hat{\mu}, \frac{ \sigma^2}{N} \right)$$ to the unknown $\mu$. The likelihood is Normal (Normally distributed data) as well. Hence, the posterior will also be Normal (by conjugancy, see here ). The standard deviation of the posterior Normal, according to the wiki page, is: $$\left( \frac{1}{ \frac{ \sigma^2 }{N} } + \frac{ N }{\sigma^2} \right)^{-1}$$ $$ = \frac{\sigma^2}{2N}$$ which I believe is where your sqrt 2 is coming from. (of course, this still assumes we know $\sigma$, but for large $N$ our estimate $\hat{\sigma} \approx \sigma$) There is something I don't like about using $\frac{\sigma^2}{N}$ as the prior variance. It feels like you are double-counting your sample size (hence the additional factor of 2 cropping up). I would suggest using $\hat{\sigma}$ or even better is a less subjective constant like 100 or something.
