I just ran Profiler to see how Visual Studio does this for the strongly typed dataset drag and drop. This is the code it sent. SET NO_BROWSETABLE ON; SET FMTONLY ON; exec dbo.aspnet_Roles_GetAllRoles @ApplicationName=NULL So I presume there might not be any "more official" way of doing it. Obviously you would need to bear in mind that a single stored procedure might return multiple result sets or different result sets dependant on the parameters passed. For people on 2012+ another approach might be to use sp_describe_first_result_set
