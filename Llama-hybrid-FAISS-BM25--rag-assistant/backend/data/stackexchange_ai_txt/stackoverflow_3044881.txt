javascript eval backslash in window NT path problem

I am experiencing a classic JS case (in my opinion) but after a lot of googling, still not able to find a solution. Backslash is considered as a escape character in JS but what you do when you need to pass windows path from the JS and print it? I am using eval because my java applet is executing the code and placing bits when it has a string to evaluate. That's why eval is necessary, however I have made an example which is below: var s = "document.getElementById('mainTabs').innerHTML='\\C\ganye\file.doc'"; eval(s); I tried double backslashes, not working, if anyone could help me get around this with as less hassle as possible, I will feel grateful.
