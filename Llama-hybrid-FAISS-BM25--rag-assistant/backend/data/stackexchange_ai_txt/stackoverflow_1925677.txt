How do you create a UserControl which has controls mapped to Database DataRow columns. C# Winforms

I have a C# winforms database application. I want to create a custom user control which will go on say an add new customer page. I have my database app all wired up. I have DataTables, and TableAdapters, and other stuff... but I don't see a way to create a custom UI which will bind the windows form controls to an object which I could then use to add to the database. I expected there to be some way that i could drag some table from my dataset onto my form which would add things like textbox's for each column. I know something like this must exists but I just don't know what to call it... things like DataBinding giving me a bunch of examples which show how you could update put like a phone number in a text box when the Custome row in a DataTable is selected. I want to avoid doing: public void button1_OnClick() { MyDatabase.OrganizationRow r = new MyDatabase.OrganizationRow(); r.ID = textbox1.Text; r.Name = textbox2.Text; r.ShortName = textbox3.Text; this.myDatabase.Organization.Rows.Add(o1); this.myDatabase.AcceptChanges(); } Thanks in advance. I'm using .NET 2.0 and VS 2005.
