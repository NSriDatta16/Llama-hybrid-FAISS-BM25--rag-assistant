I tried everything and I have to conclude than this is the product of a browser brainfart. jQuery tells the browser to show/hide the loading div jQuery tells the browser to add/remove the hidden class from the rows jQuery tells the browser to show/hide the loading div The browser does all the above steps in the wrong order (2 in first place) 'setTimeout' in my last update is forcing the browser tho execute all the steps in the correct order. It sucks, isn't elegant, but at least it works... Update: the setTimeout is necessary because jquery "simplifies" the chain of commands. If I tell it to hide one element and the show it again, it will simply ignore the command because the final result will be the same as do nothing...
