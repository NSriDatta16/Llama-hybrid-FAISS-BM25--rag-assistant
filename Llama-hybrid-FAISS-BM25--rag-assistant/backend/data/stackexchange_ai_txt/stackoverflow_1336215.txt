As others have mentioned, a static closeQuietly utility is the way to go. One thing to add - if you are in the world of java.io rather than java.sql then there is a useful interface for exactly this purpose - java.io.Closeable All the data sources and sinks in java.io implement this interface - all streams, channels, writers and readers. That way you can create a single utility to cope with the same "exception on close()" issue without requiring many overloaded versions. e.g. public class IoUtils { public static closeQuietly (Closeable closeable) { try { closeable.close(); } catch (IOException logAndContinue) { ... } } }
