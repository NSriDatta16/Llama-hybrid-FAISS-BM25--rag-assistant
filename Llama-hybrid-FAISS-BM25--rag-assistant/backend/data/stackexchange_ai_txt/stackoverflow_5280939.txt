DEV C ++ Error: expected declaration before '}' token

What does this mean? My program goes like this: (NOTE: The line that has the error was the line coming before case 2.) case 1: { cout > answer; if (answer == 'c') { cout > answer; if (answer == 'd') { cout > answer; if (answer == 'd') { cout The error, as noted in the title is expected declaration before '}' token at the line noted in my opening paragraph.
