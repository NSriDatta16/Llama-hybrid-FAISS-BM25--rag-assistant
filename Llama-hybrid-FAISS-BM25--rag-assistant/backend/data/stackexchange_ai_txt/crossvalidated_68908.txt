I don't think there is a statistic to prove exactly this (but you would have to be more precise about what "dominates" means). If you want to show that Google is different from all the others, you could do a t-test on 15,795/623,123 vs. (23,625-15,795)/(789,983-623,123). If you wanted to see which sites were different (not combining any) you could do a logistic regression with % as the DV and "site" as the IV. EDIT (per comments) OK, if you want to show that the distribution of visits across sites is not uniform, you can do a one sample chi-square test. In R : chisq.test(c(623123, 70941, 50821, 25818, 11742, 7538)) and the resulting p-value is $2.2*10^{-16}$. But that really is overkill.
