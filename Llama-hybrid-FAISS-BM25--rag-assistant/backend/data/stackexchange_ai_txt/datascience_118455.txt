Transpose Convolution Output Size

I have been learning GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) lately and having a hard time understanding the output size for transpose convolution. Let's say I am using a Tensor of [1, 64, 1, 1] as an input noise. How do I calculate the output of each layer until I construct a 28x28 image (let's say an MNIST digit)? What should be the kernel size, stride, and padding and assuming I use 3 or 4 layers to reconstruct the 28x28 image? Note: A handwritten example will be enough as well.
