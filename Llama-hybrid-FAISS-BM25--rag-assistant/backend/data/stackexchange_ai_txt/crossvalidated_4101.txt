Intervention analysis with multi-dimensional time-series

I would like to do an intervention analysis to quantify the results of a policy decision on the sales of alcohol over time. I am fairly new to time series analysis, however, so I have some beginners questions. An examination of the literature reveals that other researchers have used ARIMA to model the time-series sales of alcohol, with a dummy variables as regressor to model the effect of the intervention. While this seems like a reasonable approach, my data set is slightly richer than those I have encoutnered in the literature. Firstly, my data set is disaggregated by beverage type (i.e. beer, wine, spirits), and then further disaggregated by geographical zone. While I could create separate ARIMA analyses for each disagregated group and then compare the results, I suspect there is a better approach here. Could anyone more familiar with multi-dimensional time-series data provide some poitners or suggestions?
