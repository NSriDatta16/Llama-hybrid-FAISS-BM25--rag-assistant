What regression should I use to analyse these results and what conclusions can be drawn from the data?

I have used a number of indicators to get an understanding of the environmental and economic sustainability of crop farms in England. The environmental and economic indicators have been combined to create an overarching economic and environmental indicator for each farm in a database of 237 farms. The indicators where then averaged across farms in each county (23 counties represented in the data) to get the average economic and environmental sustainability of farms in an area of England. Agriculture is very complex with a significant number of interconnected variables impacting the condition on any given farm so I recognise that it is unrealistic to attempt to draw any relationship of causality from the results. The indicators used in this study were chosen specifically to be able to gather an understanding of sustainability for any farm in the UK as an initial high level baseline, potentially leading to further more detailed study. However, I would like to know what conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between environmental and economic sustainability based on these indicators. And, if any conclusions can be drawn, what sort of regression or analysis is most appropriate to lead to those conclusions? I initially tried a simple linear trend line - there was a weak negative correlation with an R^2 of 0.28 Is this the correct statistical analysis approach? How can I improve my analysis to draw more confident results and correctly identify the relationship (if any) between the economic and environmental indicators?
