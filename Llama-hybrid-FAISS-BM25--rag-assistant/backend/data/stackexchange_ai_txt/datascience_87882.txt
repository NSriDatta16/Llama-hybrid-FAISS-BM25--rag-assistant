Is it possible to change the input columns of a trained ML model while making predictions from it without affecting the accuracy?

Consider the following scenario. I have trained a K-Means model on some input features, say, (A, B, C, D and E). Now at the time of making predictions I want to make the model predict using only fewer number of features e.g. (A, D, E) as opposed to the number of features it was trained initially i.e. (A, B, C, D and E). With the understanding of above facts I have some questions which are as follows :- Is this approach a correct approach, or logical with respect to machine learning principles ? Will it affect the model accuracy and if yes then how ? If I have to provide features B and C, then can I populate them with zeros and then provide it to trained model for making predictions. Will the action taken in step 3) affect the model accuracy, if yes and then why and how ?
