"Enterprise Ready" for the most part means can we run it reliably and effectively within a large organisation. There are several factors involved: Is it reliable? Can our current staff support it, or do we need specialists? Can it fit in with our established security model? Can deployments be done with our automated tools? How easy is it to administer? Can the business users do it or do we need a specialist? If it uses a database, is it our standard DB, or do we need to train up more specialists? Depending on how important the system is to the business the following question might also apply: Can it be made highly available? Can it be load balanced? Is it secure enough? Open Source projects often do not pay enough attention to the difficulties of deploying and running software within a large organisation. e.g. Most OS projects default to MySql as the database, which is a good and sensible choice for most small projects, however, if your Enterprise has an ORACLE site license and a team of highly skilled ORACLE DBAs in place the MySql option looks distinctly unattractive.
