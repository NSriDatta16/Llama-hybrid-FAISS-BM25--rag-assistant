Is C# project file diarrhea the norm?

A C# programmer rewrote a Delphi 6 program (no GUI, just files-in-files-out grinding, about 50 procedures and functions totaling less than 1200 lines == 57kb keystrokes) that lives as a single .DPR file. He delivered a project containing 58 files (52 of them .CS files) in 13 folders nested to various degrees, totaling over 330kb. Is that typical of C# projects? What strategy do C# programmers typically use to decide how to chop up and organize their project?
