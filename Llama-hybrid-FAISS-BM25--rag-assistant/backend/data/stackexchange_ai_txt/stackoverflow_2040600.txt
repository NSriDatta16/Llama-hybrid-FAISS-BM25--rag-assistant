SharePoint as a content manager and business process automation engine

We are considering to re-implement or change our product (implemented in C#) to use SharePoint as a content manager and business process automation engine at the backend. This software mainly handles all the mailings, manages organization's various business specific worklfows and documents, and all these are connected (ie. from a mail a new workflow can be created etc.) in the organization hierarchy. We are using IBM content manager and IBM websphere process server at the moment. If decided, we are planning to make it happen this or next year, hence will be able to use sharepoint 2010. What are pros and cons of such a change? Do you have such experience? Please share your thoughts.
