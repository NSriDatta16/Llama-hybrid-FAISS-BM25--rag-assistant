Depending on your application and the use cases for it I would create a separate table in the database for your ArrayList data (with one-to-many or many-to-many relations), and query for them separately. Yes, it would most definitely add some complexity to your application but it would be a more robust and fault tolerant solution (not to speak of more elegant ;-) This is however hard to rectify for a very simple use case where duplicate ArrayList items don't occur...
