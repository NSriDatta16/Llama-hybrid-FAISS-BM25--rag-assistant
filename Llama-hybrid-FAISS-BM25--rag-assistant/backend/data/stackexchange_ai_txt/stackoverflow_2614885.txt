Has there really been a shift away from the old school way of declaring events inline Yes, definitely, especially with the rise of the JS Frameworks like jQuery, Prototype and so on, all of which encourage declaring events the "new school" way. and if so, what are the benefits of one of the other? One of the main reasons is the separation between the HTML structure and the JavaScript programming intelligence (which arguably do belong separated). It makes the markup much, much cleaner and easier to maintain, while all the programming logic is kept in separate files, which has loading performance advantages as well as better maintanability - you have proper libraries that contain the code, instead of fragments of JS code all over the place.
