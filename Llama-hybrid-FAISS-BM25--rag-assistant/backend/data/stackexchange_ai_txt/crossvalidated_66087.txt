I don't know about HMM, but I can see that in every loop of i you are defining State[j] . This is causing the error in WinBUGS as it can not sample from each node (such as State[2] ) more than once in each iteration in the MCMC. You need to either somehow define State[j] out of the i loop (as you did for State[1] ) in its own loop or switch to a [i,j] index for State . (Without knowing HMM, I am not sure which of these is the correct solution).
