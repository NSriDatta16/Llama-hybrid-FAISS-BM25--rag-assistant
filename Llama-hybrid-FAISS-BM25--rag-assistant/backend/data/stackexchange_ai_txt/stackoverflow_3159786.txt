From a purely technical point of view, this is a very interesting question. The first thing that comes to mind is by far not an elegant solution, but maybe a working solution - open the Start Menu: SendMessage(hAnyWnd, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_TASKLIST, 0) I will see if I can find another solution. (Well, the most obvious solution, of course, is to BringWindowToTop(hTaskBar) , but that appears not to work.)
