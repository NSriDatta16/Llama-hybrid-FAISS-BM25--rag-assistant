Can we calculate mean of absolute value of a random variable analytically?

Let's assume that we have a distribution with known statistical properties (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis). Let's also assume that mean is equal to zero. Is there an analytical expressions for the average value of the absolute values of the considered random variable? In other words can we say that: avg(abs(x)) = F(var(x), skew(x), kurt(x))
