With all due respect, I STRONGLY encourage you to sign-up for a Microsoft WinQual account, register your applications with Microsoft. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/maintain/StartWER.mspx This will allow you to not only take advantage of Microsoft's extensive crash collection and analysis services (for free!), but will also allow you to publish fixes and patches for your applications through Windows' built-in error reporting facilties. Further, by participating in the WinQual program, enterprises who deploy your app and who employ an in-house Windows Error Reporting system will be able to collect, report and receive patches for your app too. Another benefit is that employing WinQual, you're one step closer to getting your app logo certified! Every OEM & ISV I've worked with who uses WinQual saves an ENORMOUS amount of effort and expense compared to rolling their own crash collection and reporting system.
