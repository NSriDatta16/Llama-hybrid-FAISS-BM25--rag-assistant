Inverse Differencing and ARIMA Model Equivalence

I've developed a ARIMA model with exogenous variable. Before fitting the model, I made every time series stationary by differencing (each variable had a different order of integration). For simplicity, let's say there was only one exogenous variable. Finally I ended up with a model. Keeping in mind that all my data are stationary to create the model, I received the following coefficient estimates: ARIMA(1,0,0) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 X -0.6 -0.002 There were no MA terms. Note that Y was second-differenced, and X was first differenced. So, my formula is really like: $Y_t'' = -0.6 Y_{t-1}'' - 0.002 X'$ Where the primes ( $'$ ) represent the level of differencing. I'd like an equivalent representation of the model using the original non-differenced variables. So I perform the following: $(Y_t - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2}) = -0.6 [(Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2}) - (Y_{t-2} - Y_{t-3})] - 0.002(X_{t} - X_{t-1}) $ $Y_{t} - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2} = -0.6Y_{t-1} + 1.2Y_{t-2} - 0.6Y_{t-3} - 0.002X_{t} + 0.002X_{t-1}$ $Y_{t} = 1.4Y_{t-1} - 0.2Y_{t-2} - 0.6Y_{t-3} - 0.002X_{t} + 0.002X_{t-1}$ So, I have 2 questions. 1) Is my interpretation correct? Seems straight-forward, but I just want to double check. Is there a quicker way to perform these conversions, besides the tedious expanding & combining I performed above? Some of the models I'm working with are quite more complicated. Perhaps using the backshift operator would help? I don't have much practice with algebra involving the backshift operator, and am not sure whether it would help do what I'd like. 2) How do I perform a similar procedure when there are MA terms? I know that an MA term is equivalent to infinite AR terms. So, is it still be possible to get some representation like $Y_t = ...$? For example, suppose my fit produced ARIMA(1,0,1), with an MA coefficient estimate of 0.3. Thank you!
