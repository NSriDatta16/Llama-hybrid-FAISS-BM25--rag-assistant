How to analyze the evolution of a multilevel variable with an interaction?

I'm doing an analysis in a frequentist approach where the dependant variable X has 4 levels (say A, B, C, and D). This variable was studied in 4 timeframes: 2 years ( Y1 and Y2 ) and 2 calendar periods ( P1 and P2 ). Here is the repartition of X depending of Y and P : My alternative hypothesis is that this repartition is different during Y2-P2 only, independent of the year effect and the period effect. For instance, when X==C , there was an increase from P1 to P2 during Y1 but a decrease during Y2. On the other hand, when X==D , the decrease from P1 to P2 seems similar during Y1 and Y2. Therefore, I want to fit a model as X ~ Y + P + Y:P and interpret the interaction term only. In practice, I was planning to perform a loglikelihood ratio test between this model and the nested one without this interaction term, so I can test if the interaction is significant in explaining the repartition of X . However, as stated in my other question ( What is the difference between fitting multinomal logistic regression and fitting multiple logistic regressions? ), one could think of two ways to describe this: a multinomial logistic model, where I understand that an OR would represent (given all flaws in this representation) the relative risk of having a specific level instead of the reference level. 4 logistic models on dummy binary variables, where I understand that the 4 ORs would represent the relative risk of having a specific level instead of not. In my case as in many others, there is no reference value and expressing the risk of having D instead of A does not make any sense. I would like my conclusions to be something like: "there were a (likely) significant negative interaction in C and a non-significant interaction in B and D (and maybe A)". Of course, one is not supposed to aim for a specific conclusion, this is just for the example. The comments and answers to my other question showed that 4 logistic models would misestimate the probabilities. Therefore, is there a way I can express my results in the desired way using the multinomial model? NB: I'm using nnet::multinom function in R to fit the multinomial model, a solution that can work with this or at least with R would be more than welcome!
