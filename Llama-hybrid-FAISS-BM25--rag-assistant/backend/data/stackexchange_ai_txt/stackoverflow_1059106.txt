This might seem like a rudimentary approach, but it should work and it should be fast. You can just generate a huge textfile with a list of SQL statements and then run it from a command line. If I’m not mistaken it should be possible to batch commands using the GO statement. Alternatively, you can do it directly from you application concatenating several SQL commands as strings and execute them in batches. It seems that what you are trying to do is a onetime task and that the data does not come directly as auser input. So you should be able to handle escapign yourself. I’m sure there are more sophisticated ways to do that (the SqlBulkCopy looks like a good start), so please consider this as just a suggestion. I would spend some time investigating whether there are not more elegant ways better ways first. Also, I would make sure that the logic in the stored procedure is as simple as possible and that the table does not have any indexes. They should be added later.
