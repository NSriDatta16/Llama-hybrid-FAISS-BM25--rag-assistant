How to create a web based file manager that can read across different platforms?

I would like to try creating a PHP web file manager that could read on my machines. As I have a couple of PC and laptops, and I would like to create a central storage to store my files, documents, etc. Hence, I would like to create a web based file manager that can fulfill my need. I know there are a handful of free and opensource web file manager out there, but I would like to create my own so that I can tweak accordingly. Hence I have some questions regarding how can I go about creating a file manager for such a purpose: 1) As I have both mac and win machines, how can my file manager be able to access the different platforms, and reading shared or portable drives as well? 2) I have done up to generating the files/folders: // declare the folder $directory = "./"; // prepare to read directory contents $dir = @opendir($directory); // loop through the items while ($file = readdir($dir)) { // check if it is a dir if (is_dir($file)) { echo "dir: $file "; } else { echo "file: $file "; } } closedir($dir); How do I create the links for these files etc? Thank you very much.
