Doing this by hand is pretty courageous. Having a folder name with an extension .zip sounds wrong, I don't see a similar one in the existing templates. Watch out for the shell's habit of turning .zip archives into folders. Best thing to do is to use the documented procedure to create a project template and verify what effects it has so you can repro them accurately yourself. Create a new project, using one of the existing templates as a starter. You might as well make it look as close as possible to the ultimate template you want to end up with, add project items as desired. Then use File + Export Template. Next. Fill in the text boxes, note the Output location. Finish. Have a look-see at the generated .zip file.
