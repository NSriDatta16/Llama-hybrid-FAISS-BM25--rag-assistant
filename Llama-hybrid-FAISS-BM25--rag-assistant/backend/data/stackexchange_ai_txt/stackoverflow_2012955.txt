You can start with the newly released Flash Platform Game Technology Center on Adobe Devnet. There are quite a few books out there on as3 games, I'll try not to repeat the ones already mentioned: The Essential Guide to Flash Games: Building Interactive Entertainment with ActionScript (source: friendsofed.com ) This is a great book, tons of great examples, industry tips. This is pretty complete, as it starts with the basics and ends with promoting and obtaining revenue from games through systems such as MochiAds. Another book that is filled with tips earned through experience is Real-world Flash Game Development: How to Follow Best Practices and Keep your Sanity (source: safaribooksonline.com ) Foundation Game Design with Flash (source: friendsofed.com ) Nice and easy start for beginners. Flash Game University Flash Game University Cover|Size=200x260px http://66.79.179.141/screen/it-ebooks/que-actionscript-30-gameprogramming.jpg For Multiplayer I would recommend: ActionScript for Multiplayer Games and Virtual Worlds For 3D I would recommend Papervision Essentials (source: paultondeur.com ) Recently an Away3D book has been released: The Essential Guide to 3D in Flash (source: friendsofed.com ) If you're really into 3D and the web, I would recommend having a look at Unity Game Development Essentials (source: learnunity3d.com ) Not specifically games oriented, but very handy, are Keith Peter's books on animation: Foundation Actionscript 3.0 Animation: Making Things Move! (source: friendsofed.com ) and AdvancED ActionScript 3.0 Animation (source: friendsofed.com ) These would be the books. Of course there are lot of online learning resources out there. More Adobe propaganda, the video presentations from MAX 2009 are online now, you might want to check out: Building Great Games With Flash (skip to 14:45, they didn't chop the video) Flash Player Gaming Showcase MochiMedia Flash Gaming Summit 2010 Coverage
