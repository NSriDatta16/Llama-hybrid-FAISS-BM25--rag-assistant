I find that using both methods together can help the logical organisation of your CSS. Use the generic ".class" for properties that you want to apply to ALL items of that class and the more specific "p.class" for a specific type object of the class. For example: div.product { float: left; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid blue; } .price { color: #009900; } p.price { text-align: right; } Lorem ipsum &pound;8.99 dolor sit amet. &pound;5.99 The answer to your question is that neither way is better, they just do different things. By all means use both! Leveraging the power of different selector types is an important aspect of good CSS and a great way to keep redundancy at bay. Other useful memthods are the use of multiple classes on one object (e.g. ), combining class AND id on objects (they are not mutually exclusive) and using the parent/child relationship of your HTML to avoid "overclassing" (e.g. ul.someClass li {} instead of ul li.someClass {}) whenever possible. Happy coding!
