ordering of EnterFrame events

If I have added Event.ENTER_FRAME listeners to different components, how can I set or know the ordering of when these events will be fired on each enterFrame? Instead of adding enterFrame listeners to individual elements, is it better practice to have one element which listens for enterFrame events, and has an array of elements needing updating on enterFrames, thereby making it easy to organize and change the firing order of these events?
