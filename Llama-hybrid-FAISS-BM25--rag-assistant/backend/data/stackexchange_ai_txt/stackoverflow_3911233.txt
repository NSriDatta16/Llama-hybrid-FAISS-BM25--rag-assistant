You need DragDrop and DragOver in your RichTextBox. http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/C_Sharp/Q_26532918.html Set EnableAutoDragDrop=false or your user will have 2 entries(1 duplicate) rather than just one entry. Eg. user picks"cat5" and when dropped in RichTextBox "cat5" appears twice.
