How to correctly use temporary storage in Application

I'm in the need again to manage a temporary folder where parts of our application store documents, e.g. between printing and importing to a dms. Those files should be deleted on application shutdown and ideally on application start as well, just in case something went wrong. I just thought of a simple class implementing IDisposable that can be used inside Main() with a using()-statement, but somehow this feels dirty. Using Directory.Delete(path, true); inside a catch block that catches all IOException s didn't really worked reliably in past. Any opinions on how to implement such a feature the smart way? Any recommendendations? The actual path to use is not relevant to us, but we do use %AppData%\[Programname]\Temp now. Is it possible to create really temporary files on Windows which are deleted on shutdown? thx for your time.
