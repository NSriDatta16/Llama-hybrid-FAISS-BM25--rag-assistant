It looks as though you are interested in extracting (i.e., observing) latent variable scores for prediction purposes (i.e., not necessarily to make inferences). Given this, I would not rule out PCA either (while dually noting its similarity to EFA; see link below for more details). Also, since your goal prediction, I would not suggest using CFA, as the most interpretable model may not be the best for your purposes. Is there any good reason to use PCA instead of EFA? Also, can PCA be a substitute for factor analysis?
