Analysis of housing price data with strong trend and seasonality

I am new to time series. I have monthly Zillow data from Chicago. Trying to build three good models here. Tried to make it stationary, but failed. If I understand correctly, I need to remove the trend and seasonality here. Any recommendations about: which 3-4 modelling techniques would potentially work well here and why? which kind of transformation is appropriate here for these models? Among my options: Regression ARMA/ARIMA/sARIMA Exponential smoothing ARFIMA Regression with ARMA errors VAR and VARIMA I also took a look at Prophet, but they do not have good monthly approach and for RNN the dataset is too small. Appreciate any tips!
