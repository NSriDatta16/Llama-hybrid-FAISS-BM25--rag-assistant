Enumerate over a sequence in Clojure?

In Python I can do this: animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird'] for i, animal in enumerate(animals): print i, animal Which outputs: 0 dog 1 cat 2 bird How would I accomplish the same thing in Clojure? I considered using a list comprehension like this: (println (let [animals ["dog" "cat" "bird"]] (for [i (range (count animals)) animal animals] (format "%d %d\n" i animal)))) But this prints out every combination of number and animal. I'm guessing there is a simple and elegant way to do this but I'm not seeing it.
