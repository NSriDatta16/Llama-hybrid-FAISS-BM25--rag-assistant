In WPF/XAML how do I change the size of a paragraph of text using a scroll bar?

I'm new to WPF/XAML & I'm just doing a training exercise at the moment. I've got a noddy application and I want to change the size of the text in a tag based on the position of a scroll bar. The text is defined by this code: Text goes here I'm trying to define a Setter and I've got as far as this: But I can't find out what needs to go in place "???". I've tried Googling for the answer to this, but I think I must be using the wrong search terms because I haven't found the answer yet. I'm guessing that it's going to be really obvious, but I've got to admit I'm stumped.
