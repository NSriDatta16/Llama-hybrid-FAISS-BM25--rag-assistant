Compositional Data and Machine Learning

One of my features is compositional of nature, represented by a vector [p1, p2, p3] . Each vector represents an emotion and each vector sums up to unity. Eg: [anger=0.10, sad=0.10, happy=0.80] . 1) I read about natural constraints of compositional data. What are these? 2) These constraints force us to transform compositional data using isometric/additive/centered logratio before they become useable, why is this necessary? I know that for a lot of models, correlated features are ill-advised. Is this why we transform compositional data?
