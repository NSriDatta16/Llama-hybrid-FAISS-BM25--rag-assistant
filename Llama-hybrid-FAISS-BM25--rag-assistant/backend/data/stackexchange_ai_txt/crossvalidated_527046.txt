Plotting predicted common OR and 95% CI from an ordinal logistic regression model

I fitted an ordinal logistic regression model with a dependent variable of four ordered responses with one continuous predictor variable and 6 confounders, using the polr package in R. It looks like this; m After I get the common OR and 95% CI from the model, I wanted to draw a plot showing predicted cOR over the range of cont_predictor (13 - 167). I've applied predict to the model, like this; pred and cbind the cont_predictor here. test What data I have in the test matrix is like this; 1 2 3 4 x 1 0.3340795 0.2747667 0.2301364 0.1610175 62 2 0.2728124 0.2650788 0.2578796 0.2042293 36 3 0.2958057 0.2700358 0.2476891 0.1864694 33 4 0.3508921 0.2755857 0.2223387 0.1511836 45 5 0.2440494 0.2563633 0.2698620 0.2297253 60 6 0.2223108 0.2477265 0.2780087 0.2519541 76 7 0.2039479 0.2389167 0.2839792 0.2731561 40 8 0.2454748 0.2568656 0.2692959 0.2283637 70 9 0.2173119 0.2454709 0.2797295 0.2574877 40 10 0.3683285 0.2756930 0.2142581 0.1417204 36 Now, I don't know how to calculated the common OR from this matrix. Can anyone help me to draw a plot of common OR and 95% CI? Thank you.
