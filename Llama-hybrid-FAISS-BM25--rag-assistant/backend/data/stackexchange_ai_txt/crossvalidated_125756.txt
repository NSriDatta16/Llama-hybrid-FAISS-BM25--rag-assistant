Classification score for Random Forest

I'm learning about the Decision Tree and Random Forests. But there is something I don't really understand. I have a training set and a cross-validation set. I need to train different Random Forests, each with a different number of trees. For each forest, I need to plot the classification score for the training set and the cross-validation set (a validation curve). But what is the classification score for a Random Forest? Do I need to count the number of misclassifications? And how do I plot this? PS: I use the Python SciKit Learn package
