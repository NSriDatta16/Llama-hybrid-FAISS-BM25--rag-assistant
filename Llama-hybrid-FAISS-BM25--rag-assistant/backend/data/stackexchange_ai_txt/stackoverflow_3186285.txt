C# - Which is faster: String.Contains() or Regex.isMatch()?

Possible Duplicate: Regex.IsMatch vs string.Contains Which is faster, preferable and why? What the difference in mechanisms between two? I need to search for some values from UserAgent, most of values can be used without wildcards (e.g. if I want to catch cellular phones I search for iPhone instead of *iPhone* wildcards).
