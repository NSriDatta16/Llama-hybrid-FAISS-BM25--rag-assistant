Fractional epoch in deep learning using H2O

I understand the concept of epoch as epoch = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples, in the neural network terminology. So i assume it must be an integer, however why in some instances as the code below having a fractional epoch #? dlmodel The h2o document says epochs: The number of passes or over the training dataset (can be fractional). It is recommended to start with lower values for initial grid searches. The value can be modified during checkpoint restarts and allows continuation of selected models. Default is 10. But i still don't understand what fractional # can do here.
