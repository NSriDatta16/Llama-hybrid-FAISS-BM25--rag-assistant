How to convert vdproj file to WiX format?

I need to convert a vdproj file to WiX format so that I can get it building using msbuild. One solution was to call the devenv executable from msbuild and build the vdproj file from there but that's just nasty. I thought that I would try manually converting the file to WiX format but looking at its contents scared me quite a bit. Are there any tools or elegant solutions that could possibly help with this conversion?
