In what way does clustering help in classification?

I understand that with a K-means or DTW algorithm one can cluster time series using a distance criterion, i also understand that with a K-NN algorithm for example one can do pattern recognition and identify a trajectory knowing some of its observation by comparing it to a known trajectory...however i dont see how clustering before classifying help in the classification of future trajectories?
