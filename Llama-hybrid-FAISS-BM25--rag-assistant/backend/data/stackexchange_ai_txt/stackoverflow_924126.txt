You cannot set a filter to exclude extensions from file dialogs. You could however implement a delegate for the FileOk event on the dialog. This event fires just before the file the user selected will be accepted, and the event arguments provide a Cancel property that you can set to disallow selection. It is not as elegant as actually making the wrong files invisible, but it will allow you to disallow selection of the wrong kind of file. PS: Do not forget to give the user feedback why the file was not accepted, otherwise they may wonder why the dialog is not closing when they pick a 'txt' file.
