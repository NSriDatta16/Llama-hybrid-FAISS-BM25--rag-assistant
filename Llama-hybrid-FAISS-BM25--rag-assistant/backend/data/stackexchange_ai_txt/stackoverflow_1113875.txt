I don't think "Ruby has X and Python doesn't, while Python has Y and Ruby doesn't" is the most useful way to look at it. They're quite similar languages, with many shared abilities. To a large degree, the difference is what the language makes elegant and readable. To use an example you brought up, both do theoretically have lambdas, but Python programmers tend to avoid them, and constructs made using them do not look anywhere near as readable or idiomatic as in Ruby. So in Python, a good programmer will want to take a different route to solving the problem than he would in Ruby, just because it actually is the better way to do it.
