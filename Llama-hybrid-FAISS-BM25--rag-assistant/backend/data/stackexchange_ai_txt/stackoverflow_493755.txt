If you're creating a medium to large XML file, you will need a library to assist you. If you're creating a small to very small XML file, you might as well just stream the text into it. astream Tolkien " is about as easy as you can get for that size XML fragment, if your XML files are that size, you might as well just construct them in this way - don't try to overcomplicate matters just for some purist ideal that doesn't actually help you. Like optimisation, you should never change things without measuring what effect it'd have. Here, if your code is maintainable as is, keep with it. Only try to change it when it you've measured its maintainability (ie noticed its awkward to update the XMLs) and found that its taking too long for comfort.
