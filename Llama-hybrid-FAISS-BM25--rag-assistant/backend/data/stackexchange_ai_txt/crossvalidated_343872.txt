Logistic regression prediction out of boundaries in SAS

I have a big issue with my logistic regression in SAS. ods noproctitle; ods graphics / imagemap=on; proc logistic data=WORK.SEMEN; class Accident / param=glm; model Diagnosis(event='1')=Accident / link=logit stb corrb rsquare technique=fisher; run; Here you can see the summary statistics: As you may have already noticed, the intercept is too big to keep the prediction between 0 and 1
