Translation of a RoR view to Java

for some reasons I am trying to translate the following RoR view code to a GSP view: List objects contains the data I want to display in 3 columns " > This is what I got so far: #{extends 'main.html' /} %{ modulo_objects = objects.size() % 3 base = objects.size() / 3 base = Math.ceil(base) if(modulo_objects == 0) cols = [base, base, base] else if(modulo_objects == 1) cols = [base, base + 1, base] else if(modulo_objects == 2) cols = [base + 1, base, base + 1] endif counter = 0 }% #{list items:1..3, as:'i'} #{list items:cols[i]} ${objects.get(counter).name} %{ counter = counter + 1 }% #{/list} #{/list} The idea is to keep the items organised in 3 columns like 1|0|1 4|5|4 or 5|4|5 for example, I don't really understand if #{list items:cols[i]} will reproduce ruby's cols[i].times do . So far the Java view is does not display more than two elements.
