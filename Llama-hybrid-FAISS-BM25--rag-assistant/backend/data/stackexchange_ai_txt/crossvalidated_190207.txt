As sabalaba points out in his answer , this is not enforced in convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, in some applications you may want to enforce unit norm. When training with standard SGD backpropagation, the simplest way to obtain unit-energy filters is to perform a normalization operation after each SGD update.
