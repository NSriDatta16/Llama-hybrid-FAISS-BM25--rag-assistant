The L means that string is a string of wchar_t characters, rather than the normal string of char characters. I'm not sure where you got the bit about four bytes from. From the spec section 6.4.5 String literals , paragraph 2: A character string literal is a sequence of zero or more multibyte characters enclosed in double-quotes, as in "xyz" . A wide string literal is the same, except prefixed by the letter L . And an excerpt from paragraph 5: For character string literals, the array elements have type char , and are initialized with the individual bytes of the multibyte character sequence; for wide string literals, the array elements have type wchar_t , and are initialized with the sequence of wide characters corresponding to the multibyte character sequence, as defined by the mbstowcs function with an implementation-defined current locale.
