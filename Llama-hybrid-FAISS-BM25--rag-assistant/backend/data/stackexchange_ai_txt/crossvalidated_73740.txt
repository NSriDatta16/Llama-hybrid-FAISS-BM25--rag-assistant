How can I get the prior of a random variable that's a function of a random variable in Bayesian data analysis?

I have a model which includes the following priors: $\lambda_C \rightarrow \dfrac{1}{\sigma_C^2}$ and $\sigma \sim \text{uniform}(0,500)$ Where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $\lambda_C$ is the precision of a normal distribution. Being a beginner, I have problems conceptualizing the prior of $\lambda_C$. How would I even calculate the single values for the prior of $\lambda_C$?
