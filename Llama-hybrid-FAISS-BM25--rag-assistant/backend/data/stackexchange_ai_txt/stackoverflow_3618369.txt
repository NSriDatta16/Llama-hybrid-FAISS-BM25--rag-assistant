I would encourage you to look at SQLAlchemy like you discussed in your question. You can map tables in SQLite to Python objects. Using the SQLAlchemy session ( http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/session.html#what-does-the-session-do ) you can run queries, add objects to the tables and issue a session.commit command straight away in order to auto save data to SQLite. New data element: ed_user = User('ed', 'Ed Jones', 'edspassword') #user is the class you mapped the table to session.add(ed_user) session.commit() # basically auto saving here :) That's what I'd use. I'm using SQLAlchemy for a project now and like what I see. For more see here: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/ormtutorial.html#adding-new-objects
