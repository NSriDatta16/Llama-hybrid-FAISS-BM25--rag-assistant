Paginating the results of a Django forms POST request

I'm using Django Forms to do a filtered/faceted search via POST, and I would like to Django's paginator class to organize the results. How do I preserve the original request when passing the client between the various pages? In other words, it seems that I lose the POST data as soon as I pass the GET request for another page back to my views. I've seen some recommendations to use AJAX to refresh only the results block of the page, but I'm wondering if there is a Django-native mechanism for doing this. Thanks.
