Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE)

I seek to understand how to employ the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE), so I conducted a basic Bayesian analysis of disease incidence rates on a public data set. Is my rationale sound regarding the ROPE in my analysis? I have reproduced my process below and would greatly appreciate any feedback. This post also appears here . Data Preparation require(tidyverse) require(rstanarm) # Yearly counts for Hepatitis A, Measles, Mumps, Pertussis, Polio, Rubella, and # Smallpox for US states infect $disease disease) infect $state state) # Calculate cases per 100000 infect $incidence count / infect$population) * 100000 # Subset and return only measles data measles % filter(disease == "Measles") %>% select(-disease) # disease column no longer needed # View incidence distribution for measles measles %>% pull(incidence) %>% hist(., main = "Distribution of Mean Incidence of Measles") # Zoom into the lower end of the distribution measles %>% filter(incidence % pull(incidence) %>% hist(., main = "Distribution of Mean Incidence of Measles ( % group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean_incidence = mean(incidence, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ungroup() # Line plot using a GAM smoothing # Plot a vertical line at vaccine year (1963) measles_year %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_incidence)) + geom_smooth(se = TRUE, method = "gam") + # GAM smoothed line with standard error region geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(measles_year $year), max(measles_year$ year), by = 4)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1963, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 1) + # Adds a vertical line for 1963 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Annual Mean Incidence of Measles: United States", x = "Year", y = "Mean Incidence per 100,000") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # Rotate x labels for readability Set Up & Run a Bayesian Model From the histograms, incidence rates for measles seem to follow a gamma distribution. Set up a Bayesian model where: The likelihood for the data (incidence rates) is gamma distributed The priors for the regression coefficients are normally distributed H0: There is no difference in the incidence rates before and after vaccination HA: There is a difference in the incidence rates before and after vaccination # Create a binary variable 'vaccine_status' to indicate pre- and post-vaccination periods measles_year % mutate(vaccine_status = ifelse(year % # Insert a column named `vaccine_status` mutate(vaccine_status = factor(vaccine_status, # reclassify as a factor variable levels = c("pre", "post"))) # reorder factor levels to ensure the first level is "pre" # Reserve one core for the operating system. options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores() - 1) # Fit a Bayesian regression model with gamma likelihood bayesian_model Set the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) Here's where my understanding gets murky. Let's say the measles vaccination program was successful if we achieved at least a 50% reduction in the incidence rate. Our hypothesis: H0: We did not achieve at least 50% reduction in incidence HA: We did achieve at least 50% reduction in incidence If we set the ROPE at [40%, 60%], this interval falls far outside the credible interval [85.05%, 96.01]. Thus, we can reject H0 and assert that we exceeded our expectations of reducing the incidence of measles.
