SVN Doubt - VMWARE Image / Install / Hosted which would you pick?

I'm having some doubts on how to set up my SVN stuff. First my situation: Programmer working alone on most stuff, outside access not needed (yet). I want: A speedy SVN, preferably free. Private Backup friendly Somewhat hassle free A lot of storage. I don't want: To have problems transfering my data to another comp / svn install. I tried: Assembla free hosted solution and some other free hosted solutions, these won't work for me because of storage / project limitations. So now I have the options: Get a shared host with a large amount of space for SVN. Just install it on one of my comps (running windows) Install it on a vmware image which would make it easier to copy and maybe ease the backup process. What would you do in my situation and why? Edit: Or is GIT a better option in this situation, and if so why? (keeping in mind that I have no experience with this technology)
