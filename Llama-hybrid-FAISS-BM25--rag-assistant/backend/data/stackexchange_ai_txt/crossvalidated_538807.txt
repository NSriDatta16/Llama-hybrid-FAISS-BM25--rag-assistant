As mentioned in the comments, 5 million is not a large hurdle unless you have a very large quantity of covariates. I'll answer this question from the perspective of applied economics, my field of interest. For an econometric study on techniques in linear regression with an emphasis on causality, you may find useful any course that uses Angrist and Pishke Mostly Harmless Econometrics. This will skip a lot of the theory but still provide a robust understanding of what happens when you run a regression and how to interpret the results. The book is not technically difficult (maybe at the level of an intermediate undergrad stats course), though depending on your background it can be conceptually challenging. There are many classes that use this book. Here is one from MIT that focuses on big data, if that is your interest. Some of the lecture notes are online. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-387-applied-econometrics-mostly-harmless-big-data-fall-2014/syllabus/ If you are working with time series, you will need a course that specializes in this. Two resources to consider. First another MIT OCW class: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-384-time-series-analysis-fall-2013/syllabus/ Alternatively, if you prefer self-study, consider working through Cochrane's time series notes, which I found intuitive and accessible: https://www.johnhcochrane.com/research-all/time-series-for-macroeconomics-and-finance Hope this helps!
