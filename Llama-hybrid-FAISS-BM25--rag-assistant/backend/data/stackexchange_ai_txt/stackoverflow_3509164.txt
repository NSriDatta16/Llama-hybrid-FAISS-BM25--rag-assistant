difference between artificial neural network and Bayesian network

I am a student working on an internship project where in we are using Bayesian networks to predict a possible outcome from a given set of discrete parent variables.We now intend to use artificial neural network to do the task.So could any one please help me out with the similarities and differences between Bayesian networks and artificial neural network?Any suggestions as how to proceed with migration would be helpful. Thanks
