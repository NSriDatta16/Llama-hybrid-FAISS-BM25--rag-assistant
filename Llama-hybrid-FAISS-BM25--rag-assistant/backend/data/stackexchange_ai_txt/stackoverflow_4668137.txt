Google Maps Data API was deprecated in favour of Google Fusion Tables, and provides a means whereby you can store data in spreadsheet-like tables and do a lot of clever stuff such as geocode addresses, and export as kml, query the data etc. So, Google Fusion Tables provides storage for your data. Google Maps API provides you with online mapping tools which can be used to display or capture information - which you could then go on and store in Fusion Tables.
