Java development in Ubuntu

I'm a newbie to Linux systems and recently I started using Ubuntu 10.04. When I do java development in Windows, I usually keep my project files under some drive (D: for example) and under my development folder, such as D:\projects\myproj . But I'm bit confused with Ubuntu's folder structure. So, I just want to know how do you organize your projects in Ubuntu? Under which folder do we keep our projects file?
