Problem in using javascript childNodes.length property with elem

I have a treeview with drag and drop functionality. Upon completion of drag and drop I need to find the count of the child nodes of the new parent node. So for that I'm using the following lines var childnodelength=elem.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes.length; alert(childnodelength); But I always get the same value of 4 irrespective of the no. of childs, with the above alert. I've also tried in the following way. alert(elem.getElementsByTagName("A")[0].childNodes.length); Above line always gives me 1 irrespective of the no. of childs. I am not sure if I am referring correctly in both the ways. And hence I'm unable to find the no. of child nodes. Please could someone help me with this? Thanks
