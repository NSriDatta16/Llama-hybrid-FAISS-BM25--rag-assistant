Subversion is a nice tool, it is a File Versioning System that allow you to work with your team in the same project and keep track of every change you made to the files. subversion or other similar software (Git, Mercurial...) is necesary, but you are going to need something else. I recommend you to try Redmine is a free (written on rails) Project Management System , this allows you and your co-workers to keep the work organized, control times, discuss in the forums, create a wiki about the project and integrate with subversion, to review the code changes. Among this you will need some development tools for the technologies you choose. HTH!
