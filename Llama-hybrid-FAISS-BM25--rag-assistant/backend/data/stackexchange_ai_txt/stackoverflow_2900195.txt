How can my application submit salesforce case with custom fields?

I have an application that submits bugs for multiple customers to multiple destinations. I would like this application to include salesforce as a destination. I have web reference to the Enterprise WSDL and I am able to create cases for salesforce. This works great until I want to include user defined custom fields as part of the case. The custom fields are strongly typed with a __c prefix for my instance of salseforce. But I will not have the liberty of updating my web service with my customers instance of salesforce. How can I submit a salesforce case with custom fields that are not defined in the WSDL? Should I not be using the Enterprise WSDL?
