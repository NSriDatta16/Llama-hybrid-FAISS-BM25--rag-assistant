How to encode H3 geohash in regression model

I'm trying to train a random forest regression model based on a number of features, including location. I know that raw lat/long can't be used directly , so I've bucketed them using H3 . I'm struggling to figure out how to encode the hex grid IDs in the training data. The IDs are just 64bit integers, so can I just feed them directly into my model, or do I need to do another kind of encoding?
