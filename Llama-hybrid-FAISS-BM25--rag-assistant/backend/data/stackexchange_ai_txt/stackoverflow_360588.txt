A good chunk of your time will be spent in the strncmp. I suggest forcing that to be inlined , or rewriting it inline, to avoid the function call over head. If you are feeling brave it may be possible to unroll the loop once or twice and see a performance gain. If your string was actually a fixed length of array of char, you could make the length a multiple of 4 and and compare 4 bytes at a time with an unsigned int compare, instead of 1 byte at a time. If you don't have a profiler , you should get one. Profilers make it easy to see what the relative costs of various implementations are. Another option would be to pick a different way to organize your data. Check out AVL trees for inspiration. Choosing some sort of Hashing function, like the others mentioned, may be a viable option
