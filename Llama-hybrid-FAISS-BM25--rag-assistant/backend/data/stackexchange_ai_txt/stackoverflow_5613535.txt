Android SAX Parser with newline character sample?

I have a PHP webservice that returns an XML output, and one of the Tag contains a multiline "\n" String data. My problem is, all "\n" is being removed after I pass the XML data through the default SAX parser, but I really dont want this to happen! I want to retain all newline "\n" characters within the Tag so that I can extract it and display them in a simple TextView or EditText. I tried a couple of workarounds like substituting the "\n" with "&x#dA;" or something, but I cant get it to work properly with my PHP server, and I feel its not an elegant solution. Does anyone have a working example or tutorial you can point me to learn how to resolve this? I read in another post here that this is the "lmitation" of the implementation of thsi default SAX parser, but I dont mind using a third part parser if thats gonna solve it, but I will need some guidance... Thanks!
