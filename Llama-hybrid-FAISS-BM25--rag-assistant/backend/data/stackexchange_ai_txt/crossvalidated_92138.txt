Sample space for hypothseis, training data of bayes theorem

I am learning about Bayes theorem in machine learning . $p(h/D) = \frac{p(D/h)p(h)}{p(D)}$ $p(h) = $prior probability of hypothesis h $p(D)$ = prior probability of training data D $p(h/D)$ = probability of h given D $p(D/h)$ = probability of D given h I am from mathematical background , so generally I calculates probability by using sets or area . I mean $p(h)$ = cardinality of h / cardinality of sample space (or) $p(h)$ = area covered by h / total area But when comes to machine learning $h$ is hypothesis and $D$ is training data , how it has to be imagined as a set or area and what is sample space ? $D$ = Training Data = input to machine $h$ = hypothesis = output given by machine That is all i know . Another doubt is its stated prior probability of h , whats make difference between the "probability of hypothesis h " and "probability of getting hypothesis h" (Since h is hypothesis output given by machine)
