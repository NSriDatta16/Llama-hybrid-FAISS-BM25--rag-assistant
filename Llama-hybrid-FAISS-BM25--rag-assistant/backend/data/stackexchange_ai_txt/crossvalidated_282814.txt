You are correct, XGBoost ('eXtreme Gradient Boosting') and sklearn's GradientBoost are fundamentally the same as they are both gradient boosting implementations. However, there are very significant differences under the hood in a practical sense. XGBoost is a lot faster (see http://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-xgboost-applied-machine-learning/ ) than sklearn's. XGBoost is quite memory-efficient and can be parallelized (I think sklearn's cannot do so by default, I don't know exactly about sklearn's memory-efficiency but I am pretty confident it is below XGBoost's). Having used both, XGBoost's speed is quite impressive and its performance is superior to sklearn's GradientBoosting.
