Are there any objections to using the same (unlabelled) data for pre-training of a BERT-Based model and the downstream task?

I'm looking to train an Electra model using unlabelled data in a specific field. Are there any objections to using the same data for unsupervised learning and then using the same data downstream for the supervised learning task?
