Insights about W0rd2Vec

As per my knowledge, Word2Vec is belongs to non-contextual embedding technique. this have only semantic relationship between words. We can implement Word2Vec, either in CBoW or skip-gram model. but i confused with below statements: The CBOW model is designed to predict a target word based on its surrounding context words. Unlike the Skip-gram model, which predicts context words given a target word, CBOW focuses on predicting the target word itself. since word2vec is non-contextual. but in CBoW, it is considering the context to find the target. can you please give more insights about these two(CBoW, skip-gram).
