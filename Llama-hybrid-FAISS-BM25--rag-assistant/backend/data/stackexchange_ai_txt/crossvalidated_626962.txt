Specifying a mixed effects model with repeated constructs but cross-sectional observations (crossed vs. nested data at three levels)

I have a question about specifying a mixed model with crossed data across multiple levels. Consider the following situation: Let’s say I collected data on Americans’ perceptions about the importance of 85 discrete and well-validated managerial skills at four different points in time (Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3, Wave 4). In Wave 1, a batch of 200 respondents rated each of the 85 skills on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how important they thought that skill is for successful managers to possess. The same protocol was used in each of the following waves, but new respondents were recruited for each wave. An exogenous shock happened between Waves 1 and 2. The shock randomly assigned 10 of these skills to some treatment. I am attempting to measure whether the shock had a long-term effect on the mean ratings of the treated managerial skills. The unit of analysis related to my question is the managerial skill – which is repeatedly measured across four waves, but with a new cross-sectional sample of 200 respondents for each wave. Here are the first few observations of the analysis file (called anfile ) to show the structure of the data and the names of the variables. This version of the analysis file anfile is at the respondent-skill level (implicitly the respondent-skill-wave level because unique respondent ids will never appear in more than one wave). In my first attempt at analyzing the data, I computed mean ratings for each managerial skill in each wave, discarded the variance produced from individual respondents (I call this data frame anfile_means ). Then I estimate a simple linear mixed effects model in R using the lmerTest package (note: wave and treatment are formatted as factors): m1 The results are consistent with the hypothesis: the effect of Wave2 is large and positive, but there is a strong interaction between Wave2:treatment, Wave3:treatment, and Wave4:treatment. In other words, the shock induced a difference in mean importance rank for the treated cases that persists well after the shock’s occurrence. However, I am concerned that my results are artificially significant because I discard a large amount of noise in the estimate and only use the mean rating for each managerial skill. I suspect that the p-values associated with the interactions (currently .0000000001) would be far less significant if the estimation strategy incorporate uncertainty into each mean managerial skill. I am unsure how to decompose my data structure into a mixed modeling strategy. Here is my attempt to do so: I have three levels of data: Wave-Level, Skill-Level, and Respondent-Level. Wave and Skill are crossed (i.e., contain “multiple memberships”) Skill and Respondent are also crossed (i.e., each skill was rated by all 200 respondents in a wave) However, it seems like Waves and Respondents are nested (?) because respondents only appear in one wave. Below is a schematic of the nesting/crossing in the design. Note that i'’s are all unique, I just didn’t have room to provide them with unique identifiers in the illustration. I am not sure how to specify the model with the appropriate syntax given this crossed design. I am also unsure if my last bullet point about respondents nested within waves is correct – or if I should be thinking of respondents as the second level, and the skills as the third, which would allow me to draw the diagram as nested as Wave-Respondent, but crossed at Respondent-Skill. Here is my attempt, using the anfile data (i.e., respondent-skill level): m2 Which yields results equivalent to my hypothesis, but which I worry I have misspecified. How can I appropriately decompose the within-skill-by-wave variance in a mixed model syntax? And are my data crossed as I visualized them, or nested and crossed based on my alternate description in the paragraph above?
