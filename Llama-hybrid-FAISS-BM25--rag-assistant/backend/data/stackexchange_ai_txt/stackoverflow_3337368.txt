The relationship between the two is that the Mail gem is how Rails 3 implements mail ( replacing the previous TMail approach in earlier versions). In other words, ActionMailer is the Rails wrapper around the Mail gem's usage within the framework. From a post by the gem's author: The prior versions of ActionMailer used TMail for all its email delivery needs, and because certain functionality was missing in TMail (such as auto quoting and encoding of fields, handling multipart emails smoothly, etc.), ActionMailer had grown a set of fairly complex and fragile methods to shoehorn in the missing functionality.
