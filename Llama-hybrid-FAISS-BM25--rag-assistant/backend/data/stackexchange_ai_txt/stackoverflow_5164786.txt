Is GWT W3C compliant?

We are about to start some GWT project and I am investigating this technology a bit. One question that comes to my mind : is gwt generated page w3c compliant? I had a look at gwt showcase and surprisingly its not validating as proper HTML http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgwt.google.com%2Fsamples%2FShowcase%2FShowcase.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=HTML+4.01+Strict&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.2 Would anybody with GWT experience like to share his opinion? thx w
