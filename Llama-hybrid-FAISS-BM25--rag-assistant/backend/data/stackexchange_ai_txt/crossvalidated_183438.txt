What are the senones in a Deep Neural Network?

I am reading this paper: skype translator where they use CD-DNN-HMMs (Context dependent Deep neural Networks with Hidden Markov Models). I can understand the idea of the project and the architecture they've designed but I don't get what are the senones . I have been looking for a definition but I haven't found anything â€”We propose a novel context-dependent (CD) model for large-vocabulary speech recognition (LVSR) that leverages recent advances in using deep belief networks for phone recognition. We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output Please if you could give me an explanation about this I would really appreciate it. EDIT: I've found this definition in this paper : We propose to model subphonetic events with Markov states and treat the state in phonetic hidden Markov models as our basic subphonetic unit -- senone . A word model is a concatenation of state-dependent senones and senones can be shared across different word models. I guess they are used in the Hidden Markov Model part of the architecture in the first paper. Are they the states of the HMM? The outputs of the DNN?
