Use a NSPredicate and NSArray's -filteredArrayUsingPredicate: method to select the dictionaries in the array where the value for key 'name' matches whatever you're looking for. Then you can query the resulting dictionary or dictionaries the usual way, i.e. using objectForKey:. NSPredicate is very powerful and worth the time it'll take you to learn to use it, but it does require some study. If you want something that's simpler to implement but less elegant, simply iterate over the array yourself: NSMutableArray *matches = [NSMutableArray array]; for (NSDictionary *d in searchedData) { if ([name isEqualToString: [d objectForKey:@"name"]]) { [matches addObject:d]; } } Again, you end up with an array containing the dictionaries whose 'name' matches the name you're looking for, and you can get their other attributes the usual way.
