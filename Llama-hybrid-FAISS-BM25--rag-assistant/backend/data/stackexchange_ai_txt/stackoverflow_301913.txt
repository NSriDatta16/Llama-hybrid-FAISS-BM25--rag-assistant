Another option; rather than have a " short-fat " table with lots of columns, have a " tall-skinny " table with lots of rows: Short-fat: ID FirstName LastName ... Amount 1 Joe Smith ... $123 2 Bob Roberts ... $214 3 Jim Black ... $500 Tall-skinny: RecordID FieldNumber FieldName FieldValue 1 1 FirstName Joe 1 2 LastName Smith ... 1 n Amount $123 2 1 FirstName Bob 2 2 Lastname Roberts ... 2 n Amount $214 3 1 FirstName Jim 3 2 LastName Black ... 3 n Amount $500 This is good if you have a "stand alone" table that doesn't have to join with other tables, otherwise you're in for a world of pain.
