A working example of a video player built using Qt phonon: Dragon Player And here you find the Mplayer created with Phonen too, including all the sources: Phonon MPlayer . You need to login, then you can browse the source code by clicking on "Source" and then "Browse". EDIT: Oh, and of course the Media Player Example in the Qt Assistant, you should have a look at this, too. It plays both audio and video.
