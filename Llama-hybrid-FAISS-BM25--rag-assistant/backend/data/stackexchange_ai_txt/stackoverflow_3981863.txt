Are you sure the filename does not contain any garbage or bad character that would lead to this issue? If the error is file not found, that means the filename is wrong in some way. Could it come from a bad declaration of buffer ? We don't see it in your code. Another possibility is that you use strtok again in your initialization before opening the file. You must avoid using strtok that is based on global storage for recursive method like this. You should use strtok_r instead.
