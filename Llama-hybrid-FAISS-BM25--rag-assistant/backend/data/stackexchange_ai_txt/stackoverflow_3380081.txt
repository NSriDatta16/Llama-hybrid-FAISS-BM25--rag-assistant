Normally you would either: click on that bottom line (History Table View Controller, "HTVC") and in the inspector window specify a NIB Name - which means you would first have to make a new NIB. or doubleclick that bottom line (HTVC), so the 320x480 preview window pops up, and then drag in a UIView from the library. Using the first method, you tell the view controller to dynamically load the NIB as the view to connect, and using the second method you do this for the view controller using IB. The view you drag in will then show up as a child of that bottom line (HTVC). edit to actually load the nib file you created, do this to push the view controller: UIViewController *controller = [[UIViewController alloc] autorelease]; [controller initWithNibName:@"nibfilename" bundle:nil]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:controller animated:YES]; substituting UIViewController for your own view controller class (if needed) and nibfilename with the filename of the nib (minus the extension!)
