Set center point of UIView after CGAffineTransformMakeRotation

I have a UIView that I want the user to be able to drag around the screen. -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGPoint center = self.center; CGFloat adjustmentX = pt.x - startLocation.x; CGFloat adjustmentY = pt.y - startLocation.y; center.x += adjustmentX; center.y += adjustmentY; [self setCenter:center]; } works perfectly until I apply a transform to the view as follows: self.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(....); However, once the transform has been applied, dragging the UIView results in the view being moved in a exponential spiral effect. I'm assuming I have to make an correction for the rotation in the touchesMoved method, but so far all attempts have eluded me.
