RMS performance and implementation varies wildly between devices, so if platform portability is a problem, you may find that your code works well on some devices and not others. RMS is designed to store small amounts of data (High score tables, or whatever) not large amounts. You might find that some platforms are faster with files stored in multiple record stores. Some are faster with multiple records within one store. Many are ok for storage, but become unusably slow when deleting large amounts of data from the store. Your best bet is to use JSR-75 instead where available, and create your own file store interface that falls back to RMS if nothing better is supported. Unfortunately when it comes to JavaME, you are often drawn into writing device-specific variants of your code.
