Is there an elegant way to Invert a Bit value in an SQL insert Statement?

I'm converting some data in SQL Server: INSERT INTO MYTABLE (AllowEdit) (Select PreventEdit from SOURCETABLE) so I need to inverse the bit value from source table. I expected NOT to work, as this is how I would do it in code, but it doesn't. The most elegant way I can think of is: INSERT INTO MYTABLE (AllowEdit) (Select ABS(PreventEdit -1) from SOURCETABLE) Is there a more standard way to do it?
