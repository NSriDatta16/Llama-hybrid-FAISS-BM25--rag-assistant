Proper site structure using PHP, HTML, and CSS?

I know this questions probably been used and abused.... but i keep seeing conflicting arguments. So, what is the BEST way to structure a site using php, html, and css (+ minimum javascript). I've heard of people storing all of their files in a hidden directory above the root and including, I've heard of people using an include folder with subdirectories such as classes, functions, etc. I heard of people having an uploads folder in a separate directory on a separate server all together, like amazon... So what exactly is the BEST way to structure a website, and what should I place in each folder. side note: for user uploaded photos, if i were to assign a default photo for each user, where would I place the default photo (in the same directory?). Also, how should I represent that in the database (default photo name vs. NULL) keep in mind at the time, users can upload a maximum of 1 photo, and its set using their user id EDIT The site is fairly simple, nothing extravagant. As of now, I have a folder of classes, a folder of functions, a folder of forms, a folder of templates (with css), an includes folder with a configuration file, an uploads folder, and a captcha folder with fonts and stuff for captcha images. Everything is in public accessible folders, but I am running checks to prevent users from accessing private data.
