remove text in parentheses and the parentheses using .filter() or .slice()

i have a table with code like this: 5-17 23.6 (22.0-24.0) 18.0 (17-20.0) Total 0-17 20.6 (8-15.6) 16.1 (22.2-24.0) i am using the following function to find the contents of the table cells and bring it into an array: var l1 = $('#datatable td:nth-child(2)').map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get(); the table fragment's id is "datatable". this returns properly, however i am putting this array into jqPlot and it cant read the stuff between the parentheses or the parentheses themselves. i need the data to remain in the table however because we are displaying both the table and the chart. i cant reformat (add spans around the content i want to remove etc) because these tables are being generated by another piece of software. i think what i need to do is either slice off after the space or use a regex to find and remove. not sure how to proceed with either of these. thanks!
