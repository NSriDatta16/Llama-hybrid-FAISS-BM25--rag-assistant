You could do the entire graph with RaphaelJS rather than trying to just do the connections with it, that should be a lot simpler than trying to only use it for the connections. A couple of the demos are similar to what you describe (though, being demos, a lot simpler). This one shows dragging nodes around, with their connections staying attached. This one shows mouseover integration. Doesn't look like any of the main demos features showing a popup in response to a click, but the concept is there. The Raphael objects are DOM elements, so there's no problem with attaching handlers to them for your behaviors (e.g., having a click on one of the nodes bring up a menu, that kind of thing), and in fact Raphael provides some convenience functions for doing that cross-browser.
