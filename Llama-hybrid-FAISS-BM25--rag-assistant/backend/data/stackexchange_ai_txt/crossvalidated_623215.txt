Is the variance a suitable measure of variability in this context?

A rather basic question, prefaced by the fact that I know just enough about statistics to be dangerous. I work with Air Force Technical Training. I am trying to compare the ebb and flow of students in a particular course throughout the year with the average number of students in that course per day. Sometimes the actual number of students is above the average line, sometimes below. Is calculating the standard deviation an adequate way to measure the variability, or is there a better way? Google is my friend, so if anyone can point me to a better test to use I should be able to find it. However, note that I am limited to what I can do in Excel. Thanks for the help.
