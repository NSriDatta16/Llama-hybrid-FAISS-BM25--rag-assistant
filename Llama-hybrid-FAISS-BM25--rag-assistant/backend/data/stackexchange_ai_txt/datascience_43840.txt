How to classify images Neural Network didn't trained to Understand

Let's say I trained a Convolution neural network to Identify Cats , Dogs and wolves . But suddenly I feed it pictures of rabbits and Lions. so how can I classify those as pictures as "Other" I tried to do this by Adding "Sigmoid" activation functions and getting probabilities for each selection. I thought probabilities for each selection might be different. I thought If I feed a Rabbit picture to NN it will out 20% cat ,44% dog and 34% wolf. That way I can clearly figure NN is confused. But Unfortunately it gives me results like 70% cat , 10% Dog , 20% wolf. Can You suggest me a Way to fix this problem ?
