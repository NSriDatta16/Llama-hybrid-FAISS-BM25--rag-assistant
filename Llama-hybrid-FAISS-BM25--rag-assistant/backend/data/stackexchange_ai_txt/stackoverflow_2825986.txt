That code should not fire the click event, you have something else going on there or invalid HTML messing with things (invalid HTML has all sorts of crazy side-effects with random behavior sometimes). I would first check that your HTML is valid by going here: http://validator.w3.org/ Then check the following: Are you clicking something inside that div, and the event happens because of a bubble? Are you absolutely sure no other event handlers are attached to that element? Do you have multiple nested .copyFoodInstance ? If so you may want .closest() instead. Instead of .attr() setting an invalid attribute, I would use .data() for storage.
