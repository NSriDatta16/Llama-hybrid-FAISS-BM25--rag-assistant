Visio professional has a database reverse-engineering tool built into it. You should be able to use it with MySQL through an ODBC driver. It works best when you reverse engineer the database and then create the diagrams by dragging them off the tables and views panel. It will drag any foreign key objects and put them on the diagram as well.
