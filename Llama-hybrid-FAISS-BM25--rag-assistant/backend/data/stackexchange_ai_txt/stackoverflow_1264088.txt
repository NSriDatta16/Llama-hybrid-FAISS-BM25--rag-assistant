Can you consider this -> Instead of showing all the error messages on top, you can show the error message along with the input box which is related to this input box. The h:message have a attribute for which you can use. Other option would be developing custom renderer which will output onclick event for each error message. The error message have the component id so you can use that id to set the focus in javascript. This will be all dynamic. Here is some information about implementing custom renderer http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/reference/docs/customRenderKit.html
