You fundamentally can't have non-linearity for a binary predictor in a regression. With standard treatment coding, its reference level is subsumed in the intercept and its coefficient represents the difference in the linear-predictor value when it instead takes its non-reference level and all other predictors are held constant. That's just a single value. With a logistic regression, it's the difference in outcome log-odds between the two levels of the predictor. If you had a 3-level ordinal predictor and coded it as continuous you could have non-linearity, in that the effect of a change from the first, reference level to the third level might not be twice that of a change from the first to the second level. But there's no possibility of such non-linearity if there are only 2 levels to the predictor. There's just a single difference in linear-predictor values between its 2 levels. Without further information it's hard to know what's going on with your Box-Tidwell test . I'm not very familiar with it, and I'm not sure that it even is valid for binary predictors. Perhaps you are picking up a missing interaction term between the binary predictor and some continuous predictor? The Box-Tidwell test isn't the best way to evaluate and model non-linearity in any event. It seems designed to pick up a non-linearity that might be fixed with a power transformation of the predictor. What's better is to use flexible modeling of continuous predictors, as with splines, to handle non-linearity directly. That allows the data to tell you the shape of the association between outcome and predictor, beyond a simple power transformation, and to evaluate the significance of any non-linearity that you do find. You also might benefit from incorporating interactions among predictors, interactions whose absence might be masquerading as non-linearities.
