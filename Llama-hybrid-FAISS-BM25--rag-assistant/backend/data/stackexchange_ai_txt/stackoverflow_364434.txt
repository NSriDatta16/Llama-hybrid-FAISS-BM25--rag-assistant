Mostly a meta-table schema defeats the purpose of using a relational database in the first place. Aside from the basic transaction/ACID properties, a relational database is most useful in adding two big features to your system: a) sharing the data with applications like report generators, and b) allowing for ad-hoc queries. Some other data-persistence solution might be better if neither of the above two apply and you still want to be generic. You can roll your own solution in something like Berkley DB quite elegantly or try a variation on a generic schema: http://theprogrammersparadox.blogspot.com/2008/06/structuring-noun-verb-data.html Paul.
