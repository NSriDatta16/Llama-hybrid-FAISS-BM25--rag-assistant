URL Word-wrap Issue

Word-wrap issues seem to have been asked and answered loads of times but I can't find exactly what I want. Basically, I'm using word-wrap: break-word; to break a URL written into a DIV so it doesn't overflow. Works fine except visually it's very poor with certain URLs. For example, www.stackoverflow.com/questions/anotherbit/andabitmore it'll work fine and wrap at the end of a line. However, with, www.stackoverflow.com?fishingandthesomemore=someothertext it will break at the ? rather than the end of the line. Anyone got any clever ideas ?
