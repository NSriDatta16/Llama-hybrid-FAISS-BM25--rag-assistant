:hover pseudo class is only for a tags according to the CSS spec. User agents are not required to support :hover for non-anchor tags according to the spec . If you want to use CSS to make visible your spoiler text you will need to place tags around your spoiler content. This of course will mean that the mouse would turn into a pointer, but you can suppress this by adding cursor: none; .
