There's a wonderful library for handling command line options, called NDesk.Options . Being included in Mono, it is also known as Mono.Options . It doesn't provide any additional interaction capabilities, however this is the closest I found to elegantly dealing with console from .NET app. string data = null; bool help = false; int verbose = 0; var p = new OptionSet { { "file=", v => data = v }, { "v|verbose", v => { ++verbose } }, { "h|?|help", v => help = v != null }, }; List extra = p.Parse (args); As for libraries that encapsulate console UI programming, I didn't find any, although I'd like to hear about one.
