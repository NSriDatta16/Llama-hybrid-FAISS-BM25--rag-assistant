Just like in desktop world you can drag and drop and visually manage the layout of your ASP.NET form in Visual Studio. The difference however is that your ASP.NET form will look different in different browsers. In my opinion that is THE single worst way you can manage layouts in an ASP.NET site. I would strongly suggest learning the basics of CSS and HTML. I say this because in the longrun you will get a more maintainable, accessible and flexible site. There are plenty of questions on this site that will help you get started.
