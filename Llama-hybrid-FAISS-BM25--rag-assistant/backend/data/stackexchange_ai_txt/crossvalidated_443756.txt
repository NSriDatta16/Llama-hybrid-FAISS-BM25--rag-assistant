The table contains 3 methods of analysis: "Moving Average": Simply the mean of the closest 4 data values. Example : The first value is $290.75 = (207.5 + 265.5 + 401 + 289) / 4$ . This is called a moving average with centered window of size four; as for any point in time it takes the closest four datapoints to the left and the right of it and then moves in time. This smoothes the original data. "Centered Moving Average": This is a moving average of the moving average calculated above. Example : The first value is $296.4375 = (290.75 + 302.125)/2$ Trend Line: This is a linear regression. The slope is $15.5$ and the intercept $253.5$ . They have been calculated based on the moving average as it seems, or at least not on the data directly (as I get different values for slope and intercept on the data directly). It has supposedly been started to extract the "general trend" of the time series, as it seems. Probably for the purpose of predicting/forecasting the next values (looking at the second last column). There is no time-series decomposition, or any such thing (neither multiplicative nor additive, as it seems).
