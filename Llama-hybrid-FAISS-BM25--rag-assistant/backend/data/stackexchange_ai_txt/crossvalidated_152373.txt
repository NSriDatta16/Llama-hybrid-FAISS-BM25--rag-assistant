Specify fake-numerical categorical feature to Random Forest?

Suppose I have a mixture of some categorical features and numerically continuous features. I would like to train a classifier based on the features by RandomForestClassifier() in SciKi Learn. Random forest is said to handle both categorical features and numerically continuous features. But in my dataset, the categorical features' values are represented as numbers, such as id numbers, 1000, 1003, .... Will that be a problem to the random forest learning algorithm? Also does standardizing each feature so that its sample mean is zero and sample variance is one, make sense to categorical features which are faked as numbers, when using random forests? I saw someone did this, and I can't figure out if that make sense. Thanks.
