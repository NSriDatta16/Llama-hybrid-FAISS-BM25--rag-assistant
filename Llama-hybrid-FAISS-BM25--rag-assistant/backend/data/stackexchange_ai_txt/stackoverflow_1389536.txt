Visual Studio 2008 gives me the following output: Instance Albert of Foo created! Instance Bert of Foo created! Press any key to continue . . . Instance Albert of Foo copied! Press any key to continue . . . Instance Bert of Foo copied! Press any key to continue . . . Press any key to continue . . . Seems to be that std::vector implementation isn't very effective in VS2005.
