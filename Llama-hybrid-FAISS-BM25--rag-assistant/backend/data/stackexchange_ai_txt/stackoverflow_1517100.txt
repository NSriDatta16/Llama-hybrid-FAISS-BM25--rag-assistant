+1 for Tom - that's what I was going to write (just less clearly) before I saw his answer. Another thing to consider is latency needs vs. bandwidth needs scalability of a given solution. E.g. How difficult is it to upgrade the network speed (Do you need to replace NICs? wiring? routers?) vs. magnitude of possible scale (100Mb vs. 1Gb)? How difficult is it to upgrade the disk speed vs. speed increase payoff? E.g. faster disk, disk with bigger cache assuming your use case runs towards cache-able data, RAID or other data striping, local storage vs. network storage. In other words, your situation today may indicate that exact metrics point to disk as the best solution all things considered, but you can rarely up disk performance by 10x whereas you can plausibly do so with network if really needed.
