Optimal cut-off value for continuous covariate with binary outcome

Research question: What is the optimal cut-off value for a continuous covariate (age) with a binary outcome (suitable or not for a certain treatment). I realize that we lose information by dichotomizing the variable but we the aim is to use this cut-off value in clinic. I intended to use ROC curve analysis or logistic regression. What would you recommend or do you have any other suggestions? Thank you in advance.
