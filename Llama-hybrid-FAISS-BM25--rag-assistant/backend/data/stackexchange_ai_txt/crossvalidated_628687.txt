Combining the effects of regression coefficients

In a simple linear regression, if y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3....usually we interpret the beta regression coefficients individually. EX: if x1 is height and x3 is dollars ... we say that 1 unit increase in height has a b1 increase on the response y, and a 1 unit increase in dollars has a b3 increase on response y. As I understand, it is not correct to say that a 1 unit increase in height AND a 1 unit increase in dollars have a b1+b3 increase on the y variable. I think this is because of independence assumption of regression. To do this, you need an interaction term, ex: = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + b4x1x3. This is the same in logistic regression, is it possible to say the odds ratio of e^(b1+b3) ... or is this not correct? Can we do this? I am having a lot of trouble understanding how regression coeffecients can be understood together.
