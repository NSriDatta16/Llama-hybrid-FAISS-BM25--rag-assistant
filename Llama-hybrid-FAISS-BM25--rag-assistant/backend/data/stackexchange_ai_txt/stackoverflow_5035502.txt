I hope that I understand your problem. In one my applications where I used jqGrid I had once the problem with NULL values. At the time of development of the application I was not sure how to solve the problem and I placed on the server side the text value "(NULL)" instead of null value of one property. The grid was for advanced users who understand what "(NULL)" is. The value "(NULL)" has no sense in the field (one had no user account with the name) and inside of server code for the Edit operation I could distinguish "(NULL)" value from the real field value. In the way I could come over the problem. In your case you should solve at least two problems: You should decide how the null value should be displayed . The "undefined" text seems me not the best one. You can solve the problem with the "undefined" text either on the server side (like I did in my case) or with respect of custom formatter . The custom formatter is very simple thing. It define how a cell value should be displayed as a HTML fragment of the contain. You can for example include an additional hidden element or other HTML element or attribute which will save the information that the value was null . You should solve the problem with decoding of the null value on the server side during Edit operations. You can solve the problem very easy on the server side (like I do with compare of the corresponding field to the "(NULL)") or with respect of custom unformatter on the client side. The custom unformatter will get the information from the grid cell (from the hidden or other hidden HTML element or attribute) and place the information in the server request. You can look at the demo for the answer to see an example how one can use a hidden to save an additional information in the cell with respect of custom formatter and to read the information later with respect of custom unformatter .
