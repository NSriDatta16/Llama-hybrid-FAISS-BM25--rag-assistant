Google's My Track android app allows output of long/lat. However, I wrote my own client to capture the data every 5 minutes. Time dimension - depending on how you want to do it... I "normalize" the data upfront to do every hour, so the grouping makes more sense. For example 2 37.88 -122.22 11 37.88 -122.22 11 37.88 -122.22 11 37.88 -122.22 11 37.33 -122.50 12 37.33 -122.51 12 37.33 -122.52 12 The k-means algorithm, if implemented properly, can handle a matrix. Using the coursera's machine learning exercise #8, I modified it to handle/visualize 3 dimensional data. Not too bad. I don't think more than 3 dimensions can be visualized, though a vectorized implementation will still work. Cheers, Simon
