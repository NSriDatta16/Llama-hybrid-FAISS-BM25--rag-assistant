Well, you can usually obtain these statistics in the annual reports, which are available if you have a subscription to elsevier or otherwise. For statistics per se, it is difficult to find a comprised table, as it is usually applied in a interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary context. However, you fill easily find lists (google) on other disciplines that will encompass statistical journals. For example, in economic journal reviews, you will always find a sub section on econometrics and statistics journals. I found, however, a summary of annual reports where you can obtain a lot of data on actual rejection rates for most statistical journals (2010) [ here ], yet not "exactly" neatly organized in a table. However, a word of (kindly advised) warning. Rejection rates are essentially meaningless imho. You will find 4 star journals with 5% acceptance rate, but also as high as 30%. Note, that some high impact journals ask for more than 200 dollars submission fee + revision fee extra (if it gets to that stage), so that only "confident" researchers consider to submit in the first place. Other journals in the same league are essentially for free which attracts a lot of first timers and thus increases the rejection rate. This totally skews the sample. Moreover, some authors are in high impact journals were accepted by invitation, which biases further the results. Good luck!
