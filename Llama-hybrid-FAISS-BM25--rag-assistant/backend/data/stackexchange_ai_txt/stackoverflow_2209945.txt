C#'s regex not working like I want it too

I have an input string like this: \pard\nowidctlpar\qj\b0\scaps This Agreement\scaps0 is made and entered into this date, \{#DATEAGREEMENT#\} , by and between [removed] (\ldblquote [removed]\rdblquote ), and its successors and/or assigns, with address at [removed], and \{#TXTPLAINTIFF#\} , (\ldblquote Plaintiff\rdblquote ), Individually, of ___________________, and, \{#TXTPLAINTIFFATTORNEY#\} , (\ldblquote Plaintiff\rquote s Attorney\rdblquote ) of \{#TXTATTORNEYFIRM#\} .\par and I want to do some parsing with regex. This is the code I'm using: temp = Regex.Replace(temp, @"\\{#.*#\\}", "_____"); The only problem is it matches the widest set, i.e. it takes out the whole paragraph because the paragraph ends with "#\}", how can I get to match each group? I.E., this paragraph should match it 4 times instead of once.
