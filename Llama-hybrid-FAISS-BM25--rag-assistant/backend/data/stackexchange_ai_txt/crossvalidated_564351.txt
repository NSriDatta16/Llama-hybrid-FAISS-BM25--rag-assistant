Time series: predicting covariates for missing years from historical values

I'm working with a time-series dataset where my dependent variable is measured annually from 2018-2021 but my covariates are not all measured over the same period. For instance, $x_1$ is measured from 2010-2016, $x_2$ from 2010-2019, etc. I'd like to predict the value of $x_1$ for 2017-2021 and for $x_2$ for 2020 and 2021 while still propagating uncertainty in the predictions. What I've read about imputation seems geared to situations where there is missing data for some but not all observations and there isn't historical data. How is this issue typically addressed? Thanks!
