are many object instances an issue in android?

I plan to create a representation of a 2D (topographical) map in Android (3.0) in the following way a class MapCoordinate , which is just a 'struct' and consist of public attributes x,y of type int and represents a MapCoordinate a class MapPoint (not a good name probably), which encapsulates methods to access and alter data of a point in a map (for one map coordinate) a class Map , which has one instance / Map (there is only one in my app) and encapsulates a Map by having a HashMap : public class Map { HashMap mapPoint = new HashMap (); } So, my question would be: Is it performance-critical to have many (Java) object instances on Android (only tablet PCs are the target of my app). Of course this map is only a tiny fragment of my whole application. The map can get rather large. Thanks for your feedback.
