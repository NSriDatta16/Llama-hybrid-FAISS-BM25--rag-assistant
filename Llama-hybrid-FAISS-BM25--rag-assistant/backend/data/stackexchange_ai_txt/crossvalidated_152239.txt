QQ Plot question related to trading

I'm kicking the tires of DSP and don't fully understand the tools. I built an algorithmic trading system and decided to do a Q-Q plot of the signal to noise ratio against the average return for each bin to see if I could eliminate some losing trades. The conclusions that I drew from this are: The distribution is fat-tailed The x-intercept is SNR = 0.10. If I eliminate trades where the SNR = 0.1 is 0.0001. I would have expected the opposite based on the Q-Q plot. Since the distribution is fat tailed, is there any simple filter that I can add to focus on the profitable, right tail? What else is this plot saying?
