(I believe I should summarize the comments in an answer, lest this question go 'officially' unanswered.) It sounds like you have multiple dependent variables and you're checking all of them. This is likely to be a strategy that leads you into trouble. You will find something just by virtue of checking many things. On the other hand, with just three sets of paired data, you will have pretty severe issues with statistical power in general, and doubly so if you make any attempt to control for the possibility of inflated type I errors. My hunch is that normality is the least of your issues. If you had only one variable to test, the question is whether you are willing to make the theoretical assumption of normality. (This is purely an assumption because you do not have enough data to get any reasonable information about the shape of the distribution.) If you can assume this, however, you can use the t-test; there is certainly no problem with having only 3 data points (see: Is there a minimum sample size required for the t-test to be valid? , for a recent discussion of this issue). If you are not comfortable making the assumption of normality, then either the Wilcoxon or even the sign test will be acceptable. The Wilcoxon can actually be more powerful than the t-test when the data aren't normal, I believe, but you're still not likely to have much power with just three points per test. I recognize that you have already checked and found significance with the t-test but not with the Wilcoxon. However, a pretty basic logical principle is that we can't pick which test to use by checking first to see which one will give us the results we want. My suggestion would be to just drop any pretense to statistically testing your data and simply present them in total, and discuss them qualitatively. Another possibility that might be worthwhile, if you are sufficiently familiar with it, is to run Bayesian analyses starting from a couple of prior belief states that people might find reasonable. Then show what people with these beliefs ought to believe now given what you found. (To be honest, I think this is one of the prototypical situations when everyone, even diehard Frequentists, ought to find the Bayesian approach to be the most useful and practical option available.)
