Using a modern ver of mysql... Create table Tz_offsets: col Timezone, offset Data: ET, 0 CT, 1 Select EventName, LocalTime, Timezone From my_data_table JOIN Tz_offsets On Tz_offsets.Timeszone = my_data_table.Timeszone Where xxx Order By (LocalTime - offset) The key here is that Order By can take an expression. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/select.html Optimization In the above example, MySql will create a temp table. Depending on the size of your data, it might be much faster to pay a data insertion price vs a data retrieval price. To do so: add another column to the data table, "time_gmt" and then sort on the new column. But if you can't, the above will work. If you can't add the Tz_offsets table (if you can only use raw sql), then you have two choices: Add the Tz_offsets table as a temp table each time you run your sql. Your MySQL user will need temp table create permission. Do the tz offset lookups within the order by expression by using Case expression. Eg Select EventName, LocalTime, Timezone From my_data_table Where xxx Order By (LocalTime - (CASE Timezone WHEN 'ET' THEN 0 WHEN 'CT' THEN 1 WHEN 'PT' THEN 3 ELSE 0))
