In short, with the glossaries package, you can't get footnotes on the first use for non-acronym glossaries. However, you can redefine some commands in the preamble (after you \usepackage{glossaries} ) to get what you want: \makeatletter \renewcommand{\gls@main@displayfirst}[4]{ #1#4\protect\footnote{#2} } \makeatother But that will be really fragile.
