Now I have written this blind, but hopefully this will help, it seems, don't take offence, the code suppled in the question is a little over complex. void max_ave_val(int arrnum1[],double *average,int *maxval,int *position) { #define LIMIT 6 *maxval = 0; *average = 0.0f; for ( Int index = 0; index *maxval ) { *maxval = arrnum1[ index ]; *position = index; } } *average /= LIMIT; } Many thanks - Neil
