This question is testing you when to use neural network and when to use regression. Since it is a classification problem, the first you should know is that linear regression (not logistic) is a REGRESSION, not a classification algorithm. Then the answer should be obvious, Neural Network. BUT, there is a trap, you shouldn't use a linear activation function , the reason why the neural networks can have many layers is that they are using non-linear activation function. If using linear ones, the whole neural network will collapse into only a 'huge' linear function.
