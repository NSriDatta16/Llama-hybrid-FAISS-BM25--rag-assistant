To avoid coupling, in your example, I would create some kind of DataProvider that can fetch the data points to your graph. This way you can have several different types of datasources that you change depending on what you want kind of data you want to chart. E.g. interface DataProvider { double[] getDataPoints(); } class Chart { void setDataProvider(DataProvider provider) { this.provider = provider; } } And then I would skip the ChartCalculation class completely and just do the calculations in the chart class. If you feel the need to reuse the code for calculating stuff I would create a toolkit class(similar to the Math class in Java) that can calculate average, median, sums or whatever you need. This class would be general and it would know nothing about the chart or what last items means.
