I don't know what language you're using, but they all work mostly the same. In C# we would do something like the following: List files = new List () { "File.f", "File-1.f" }; Regex r = new Regex(@"^(? [^\.\-]+)"); foreach(string file in files) { Match m = r.Match(file); Console.WriteLine(m.Groups["name"]); } The named group allows you to easily extract the prefix that you are seeking. The above prints File File on the console. I strongly encourage you to pick up the book Mastering Regular Expressions . Every programmer should be comfortable with regular expressions and Friedl's book is by far the best on the subject. It has pertinent to Perl, Java, .NET and PHP depending on your language choice.
