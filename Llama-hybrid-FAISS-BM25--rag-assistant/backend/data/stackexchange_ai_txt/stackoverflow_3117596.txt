I just tested your code and it works fine on both simulator and on a development iPhone 3GS. Could it be something with the movie file itself (maybe too high resolution for iPhone?) or something with the server. Try to download the NSURL to a file on your device, then use Organizer to copy it to your computer and in iTunes, copy it back and see if it plays. If not, you know that the problem lies with the movie file itself.
