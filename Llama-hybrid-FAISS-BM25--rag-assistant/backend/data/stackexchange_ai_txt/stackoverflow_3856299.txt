The flexibility of the Worker role enables you to run almost anything, including IIS itself :) You can use a role to host your own instance of IIS Hostable Web Core, which can leverage a few more of the features of IIS (like multiple applications) and likely enable you to do what you are wanting with a single instance. I don't have a ton of experience doing this myself, just know its possible. The best example I've seen is at Steve Marx's blog http://blog.smarx.com/posts/build-your-own-web-role-running-hosted-web-core-in-windows-azure Beyond that, search around for "hostable web core on Azure" and you'll find some good resources.
