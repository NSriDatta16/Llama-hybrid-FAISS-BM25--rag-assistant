C# excel interop formula dragging

I'm using the C# excel interop framework to automating generate a bunch of reports for my company and I'm wondering if anyone knows how to do equation dragging with this. If I could do this with a named range this would be even better, but even if I have to hard code the rows so it's along the lines of drag A10:J10 down to A20:J20 this would probably be ok. Even any pointers to a webpage explaining how to do this would be much appreciated as I'm kind of stuck on this one. Thanks!
