Accepting drops of volumes on Dock icon

I'm writing a Cocoa application that needs to accept drops of mounted volumes on its Dock icon. It is not document-based; I intend to dispatch each volume to the appropriate handler in application:openFiles . I have gotten the Dock to light up my application's tile for the drag, but upon dropping, my application shows an alert: “The document [volume name] could not be opened. [My application] cannot open files of this type.” My application:openFiles: method never runs, even though the delegate is hooked up and is sent other delegate messages. So, what's the correct way to accept a drop of a volume onto my Dock tile?
