Likelihood Ratio as statistical test for Transfer Entropy with MatLab

I estimated a Transfer Entropy value TE(XY). Now I want to establish the statistical significance of the estimated value. Therefore I used the method of shuffled surrogates to estimate a shuffled surrogate TEss(XssYss) which should be close to zero because there should be no casual relationship between the shuffled time series. This is my null hypothesis. Now I want to test the null hypothesis (of zeros TEss) by using the log-likelihood ratio and compute it in MatLab. I know this is the code in Matlab I should use: [h,pValue,stat,cValue] = lratiotest(uLL,rLL,dof) But how do I get the unrestricted and restricted log likelihood maxima supposed TEss is my result vector of estimated TE using so shuffled time-series. And what are good model parameters? I appreciate any help:) Thank you in advance -klaus
