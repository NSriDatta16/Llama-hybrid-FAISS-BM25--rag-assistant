Apache ant deleting directories no matter what

How do I get Apache Ant to delete a directory no matter what. I want it to be deleted even if there are locks or usages of the directory on windows. I am using a continuous integration remote agent on a Windows box which fails to delete the build directory and as a result fails the build. This is extremely annoying and is disruptive to the statistics. There is nothing actively using the directory, and the antivirus is disabled. I just want to delete the directory no matter what. How can I achieve that on Windows with Apache Ant?
