How does SVD save space?

We start with an $m \times n$ matrix before SVD. After SVD, we have three matrices of sizes, $m \times m$, $n \times n$ and $m \times n$. How do we save space then if now we have three matrices instead of one and more numbers to store? Why are we talking here about dimensionality reduction? What are then the benefits of SVD?
