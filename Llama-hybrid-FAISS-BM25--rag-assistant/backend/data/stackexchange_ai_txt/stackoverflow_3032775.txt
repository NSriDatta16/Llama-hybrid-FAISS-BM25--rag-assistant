Large codebases can be schizophrenic , because there are often many contributors to the project. I would also say that contributors tend to want to add new features rather than re-write some code because it could be coded in a slightly more elegant way. Paul Graham is attributed with good coding style . The link points to pages where his coding style in ANSI Common Lisp is commented upon. Peter Norvig has also written about good Lisp coding style here .
