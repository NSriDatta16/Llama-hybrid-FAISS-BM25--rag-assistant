MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN over mx:TextInput

I'm working on a simple flex / AIR application with just a mx.TextInput control and some button. I'm not using the system chrome. less or more the mxml is this: To make the window draggable i've added a MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN listener to the TitleWIndow: win.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, function(e:MouseEvent):void { stage.nativeWindow.startMove();}); The problem now is that the inner textinput control seems to inherit the eventlistner, so you can type text, but you can't select it (Cause holding down the mouse trigger the NativeWindow.move() function). Am I missing something ? I want the window to be draggable only when i mousedown on the TitleWindow, not on other controls..
