How to check if two segments of an A/B test have significant difference in the treatment effect

I am planning to launch an A/B test and there's a concern about a possible primacy/novelty effect. I've decided to segment users into two segments (New Users, Returning Users) and estimate if the effect of the treatment significantly different between the segments. The logic is following: if I detect the difference between these two segments, this should alert me to the fact that returning users react differently to the treatment that the new users, hence, possible primacy/novelty effect. So far I've read about Conditional Average Treatment Effect and Heterogeneous Treatment Effect but it's just words for me and I can't figure out how to apply the respective methodology to my problem. Could anyone point me in the right direction?
