To predict $PTS$ for 2019, you first need to forecast the values of $W$, $GF$, $GA$, $S$, and $SA$, as $PTS = f(W, GF, GA, S,SA)$. Since you only have data from 2006, you can start with simple univariate time-series models like autoregressive $AR(p)$, moving-average $MA(q)$, and autoregressiveâ€“moving-average $ARMA(p, q)$ for each individual predictor. If you want to capture the interdependencies among those predictors over time, vector autoregression is a good option.
