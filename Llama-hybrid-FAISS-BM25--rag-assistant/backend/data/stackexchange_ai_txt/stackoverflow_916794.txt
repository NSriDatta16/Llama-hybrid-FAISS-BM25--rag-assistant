what is the sleakest way to proccess multiple files

I am trying to start a program by dragging multiple files on to the .exe and then have the exe send the files to diffrent folders based on rules and logic in the program itself. the problem i am running into is that i do this via a console application there is a limitation on how much information can be sent to the exe at a time. On computers running Microsoft Windows XP or later, the maximum length of the string that you can use at the command prompt is 8191 characters. On computers running Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, the maximum length of the string that you can use at the command prompt is 2047 characters. what would be the most minimalistic way around this issue? I would like to avoid having a program running in the background at all times if possible.
