Bayesian modelling a player's score for a game broken up into separate rounds

I am trying to model a player’s score in a game. The game is broken up into 5 rounds, and their final score (S) is the sum of their scores in each round. (S = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 + r5; all > 0). I’m trying to set up this scenario as a Bayesian modelling problem where initially we come up with an initial prediction S - a prediction from a regression model based on other variables which influence the score (lets call them V1, V2, V3). This part is fine - next is what I'm not so sure about: I want to be able to use some sort of Bayesian sequential updating to update my prediction for S after each round. So: Before the game, we use variables V1, V2, V3 to make a prediction for S After r1, we use the r1 score to update our prediction for S, also taking into account any changes in variables V1, V2, V3 Repeat after r2, r3, r4, r5 I’ve been reading about Gaussian processes, Kalman filters, MCMC and other processes using Bayesian logic which seem like they would be applicable to my problem, but I’m not sure where to start regarding coding this up in Python or R. I’d love some help with the any or all of following questions: Is there a name for the exact type of problem I’m trying to solve? How can I set up this problem using pymc3, Rstan or similar? Where can I find an example of a paper, blog post, whatever with somebody applying Bayesian modelling to a situation like this that will help me get started?
