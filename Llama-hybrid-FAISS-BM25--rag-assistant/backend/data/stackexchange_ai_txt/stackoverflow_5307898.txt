The easiest way to do this is to change your storage engine to InnoDB which supports the constraints. For old MyISAM tables, you will have to use triggers on BOTH sides to enforce an FK relationship Some links for self-help http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-enforcing-foreign-keys.html http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Triggers Create your tables like this > CREATE TABLE student( -> student_id INT(2) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -> first_name VARCHAR(10), -> last_name VARCHAR(10) -> ) ENGINE = INNODB; > CREATE TABLE course( -> course_id CHAR(5) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, -> course_name VARCHAR(50), -> student_id INT(2) NOT NULL, -> CONSTRAINT student_student_id_fk -> FOREIGN KEY (student_id) -> REFERENCES student(student_id) -> ) ENGINE = INNODB;
