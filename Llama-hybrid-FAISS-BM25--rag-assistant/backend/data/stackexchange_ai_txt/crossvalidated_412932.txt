Since SVM returns an essentially unbounded distance value it can be hard to quantify that in easy terms like one can with probability. Ideally if you could do some cross validation you could look at the average max distance value returned across the different hold out sets and use that as your boundary for saying you're unable to predict. If you can't do any hold out sets you could a similar thing with your training set but set the threshold based on some mis-classification rate. I would however be concerned with over-fitting if you went that route.
