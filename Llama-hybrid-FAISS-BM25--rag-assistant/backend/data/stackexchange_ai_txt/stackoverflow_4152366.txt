When I am running the application I am getting the following error. uninitialized constant Rexcel::Workbook::Builder I had added the following code, then this error hitting workbook = Rexcel::Workbook.new worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet("Customers") worksheet.add_line("name","test") headers['Content-Type'] = "application/vnd.ms-excel" headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="excel-export.xlsx"' headers['Cache-Control'] = 'max-age=0' headers['pragma']="public" workbook.build How to solve this?
