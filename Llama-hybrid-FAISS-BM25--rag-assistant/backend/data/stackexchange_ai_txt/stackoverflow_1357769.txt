Regular Expression Negative Lookbehind Alternative for VBScript

Since VBScript doesn't support lookbehinds, I'm looking for an alternative solution. I have the string '\E\F\'. I want to replace \F\ with '~', but ONLY if it is not preceded by a \E. After the substitution, I want '\E\F\' to be '\E\F\'. If the string was 'randomText\F\', I would want it to look like 'randomText~' after the substitution. Solution: I just decided to StrReverse it and do a negative forward lookahead. It's not the most elegant solution, but it seems to work in this case. Dim regEx, str1 str1 = StrReverse("The quick \F\ brown \E\F\ dog.") Set regEx = New RegExp regEx.IgnoreCase = True regEx.Pattern = "\\F\\(?!E\\)" regEx.Global = True ReplaceTest = regEx.Replace(str1, "%")
