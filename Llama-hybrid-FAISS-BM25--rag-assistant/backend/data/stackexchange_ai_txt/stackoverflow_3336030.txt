Ok, seems like Reapply Account in the TFS console does exactly what the command line does (+ checks application pools and TFSJobAgent), so at least I'm happy I'm performing the steps now. As to why they haven't mentioned this easier way to perform the sets in the documentation? Perhaps a last minute release feature? I guess as for my question 1, perhaps there are no windows services for TFS? Am I just getting mixed up with terminology? Hope this helps someone anyway! Andy.
