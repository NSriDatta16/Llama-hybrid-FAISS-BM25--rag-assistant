Using ifstream as fscanf

Assume that I have an input as follows: N (X_1,Y_1) (X_2,Y_2) .... (X_N, Y_N) where N, X_i and Y_i are integers. An example: 2 (55,1) (521,7) To read this, I can do something like this(assume all variables are defined, etc.): fscanf(fin,"%d ",&N); for (int i = 0; i The question is, how can I do this easily using ifstream. I can get string's, and then I can get rid of nondigits and using stringstream I can get two numbers but this seems a bit cumbersome. Is there an easier, more elegant way? Thanks
