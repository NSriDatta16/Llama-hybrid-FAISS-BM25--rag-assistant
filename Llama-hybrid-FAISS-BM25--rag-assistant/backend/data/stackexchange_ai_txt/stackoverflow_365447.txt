I will say that I look for code smells as well, but I would like to be more specific. I am using a framework of my design that is growing and evolving with each project. I will tend to heavily refactor and redesign (disciplining myself to keep these separate is something I'm still working on) early in a project and as I get closer to a deadline and closer to solving any issues or code smells I will ease off and focus on my specific implementation. As I do this, I will usually find (or create) a few more things that, while functional, I am not entirely happy with. I will log these and on my next iteration through the project I will address these issues. When I come back to the code, I will sometimes find that there is a more elegant way to handle the situation and kick myself for not seeing it sooner. Sometimes, I will find there is a better way, but it is not the way I had originally envisioned. Sometimes I find that it is good the way it is and that changing it would be over-designing. Other times I find that in fixing something else, my original issue has disappeared.
