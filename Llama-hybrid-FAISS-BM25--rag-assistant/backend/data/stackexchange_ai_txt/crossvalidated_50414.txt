The easiest way to imagine this is to think of the sample space as the Cartesian product $\Omega = \mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{H}$, with measure $\mathbb{P}(D, H) := \mathbb{P}(H) \mathbb{P}(D|H)$. In this way, each $D$ or $H$ correspond to subsets of pairs in $\Omega$ - both $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ partition the sample space differently . In this simple scheme, $\mathbb{P}(H)$ is the prior measure over the members of the partition $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathbb{P}(D|H)$ is measure of $D$ relative to the subset $H$. Note that a particular observation $D \in \mathcal{D}$ can be regarded as a subset $\{(D, H): H \in \mathcal{H} \}$ containing all the pairs consistent with $D$. This way of reasoning can easily be generalized to multiple observations. With this in mind, your answers are: 1) No, your hypotheses do not partition the set of observations. 2) Yes, the distribution of $D$ is independent of your model about the world represented by the sample space (, the $\sigma$-algebra) and the probability measure. Bayesian probability theory is just a model of how to systematically update your beliefs given your prior assumptions plus data.
