LSTM Regression - State of the Art

i'm trying to review the current state of the art architectures / models generally for Regression based on LSTM Networks (x-Sequence to y-Sequence / function approximation). Basically, what are the most used extensions, starting from the very basic lstm regression network (input layer, simple lstm layer, fully connected output layer) ? So far, I've seen many research papers with Convolutional Layers and Bi-directional layers, e.g. Novel Deep Learning Model with CNN and Bi-Directional LSTM for Improved Stock Market Index Prediction .
