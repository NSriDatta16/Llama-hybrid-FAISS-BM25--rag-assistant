Fast method for finding best metaparameters of SVM (that is faster than grid search)

I am using SVM models to do short term forecasting of air pollutants. To train a new model I need to find appropriate metaparameters for an SVM model (I mean C, gamma and so on). Libsvm documentation (and many other books I have read) suggests using grid search to find these parameters - so I basically train model for each combination of these parameters from a certain set and choose the best model. Is there any better way to find optimal (or near optimal) metaparameters? For me it is mainly a matter of computation time - one grid search of this problem takes about two hours (after I did some optimisations). Pros of grid search: It can be easily parallelized - if you have 20 CPUs it will run 20 times faster, parallelizing other methods is harder You check big parts of metaparameter space, so if there is a good solution you will find it.
