I agree with the answers from Jeremy and Kevin, but want to give another one. You can use views to create the block! All you have to do is create a new view display with a block display. Add the fields you want to show, add a link field for the node/add/foo link and give it a node id filter or default argument. Here you have to choose the node id of the node to display in the block. Done! What's nice with this solution? You can use almost every feature of views theming, drag and drop field ordering, adding new fields is cheap and no extra modules. ;) Regards Mike
