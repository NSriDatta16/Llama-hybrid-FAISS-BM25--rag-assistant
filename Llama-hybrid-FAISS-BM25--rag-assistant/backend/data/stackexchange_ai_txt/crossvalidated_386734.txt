Data augmentation methods for Raman Spectra

I'm building a CNN model based on Raman spectroscopy data and I wanted to experiment with data augmentation. What would be some reasonable techniques to try? I have found this paper which suggests these methods (in this case applied to NIR spectra): - Adding an offset to the spectra - Adding a slope to the spectra (kind of an "offset" slope) - Multiplying the spectra by a factor Would adding some form of noise also make sense? It would also make sense that the noise varies throughout the wavelengths, no?
