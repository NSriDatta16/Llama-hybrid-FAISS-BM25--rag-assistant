I'm skeptical about possibility to say anything meaningful in this situation without taking daytime into account. The reason is the process that generates your data. Blood sugar levels have a daily pattern (more erratic or less erratic, depending on the patient), partly related to carbohydrate consumption. In theory, after eating your sugar levels rise and then fall as insulin does its job. Blood sugar measurements also have a daily pattern : patients usually measure their blood before eating, as they need to know if they have to adjust the amount of insulin. This should be especially true, if patient is used to his/her therapy (that is, before switching to pump). If we agree that the true average blood sugar level is the area under curve which we could get if we measured blood glucose continuously, then it seems likely that average of measurements before switching to pump generate biased estimate of true average and unlikely that the average of more frequent measurements generate the estimate which is biased in the same way. Even if these statements are not true in your case, you'll have to convince everyone (at least me) that they indeed aren't. Now if you are willing to take daytime into account, then you can infer so called modal day before switch and after switch, or compare corresponding measurements, say before breakfast.
