You have an implied loss of $12+12+1 =25$ starting values. This is indeed a very unusual model and sets a red flag for me. Why don't you post your data in a column oriented csv file. All ARIMA model can be expressed as a weighted average of the past which goes a long way (pun) to "explain" the model and it's implications for the future.
