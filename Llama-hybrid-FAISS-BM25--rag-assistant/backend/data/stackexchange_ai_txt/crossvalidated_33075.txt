As Peter Ellis' comment/answer suggests you are talking about dimensionality reduction and not data reduction. You have changed the number of data points just the size of the space of covariates. Now Peter Flom is right that the PCA and FA methods can be tried with small sample sizes but it is not only the correlations that are likely to be poorly estimated but also that you could be fooled into dropping into too low dimensions because features may appear more highly correlated than they would have turn out to be with a larger sample. I would not recommend it.
