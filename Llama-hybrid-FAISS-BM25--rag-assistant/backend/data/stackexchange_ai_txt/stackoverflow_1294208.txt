Sorting a referenced list in grails

Lets say I have some simple classes for a twitter-like app: User Post A user hasMany posts, and a post belongsTo a user. Now, I'm trying to get a list of posts for a specific user in order of date . I know I can get a list of all posts (for all users) by: def posts = Post.list([sort: 'dateCreated', order: 'asc', max:10]) But to limit it to my particular user I need to reference the user I want and I am supposing that I need to switch from a static call to something like this where I reference the user first: def user = User.findByUserId(userId) def posts = user.posts So now that will return a list of all the posts for that user, but how do organise that list so that they are ordered such as [sort: 'dateCreated', order: 'asc', max:10] to retrieve the first 10 in the correct order? Or am I just going about this the wrong way?
