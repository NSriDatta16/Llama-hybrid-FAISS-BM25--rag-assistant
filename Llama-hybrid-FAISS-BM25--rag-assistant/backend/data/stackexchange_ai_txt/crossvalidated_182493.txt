I don't know why nobody has mentioned the very introductory book on Bayesian: There's a free PDF version for the book. The book offers enough material for anyone who has very little experience in bayesian. It introduces the concept of prior distribution, posterior distribution, beta distribution etc. Give it a go, it's free. http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/
