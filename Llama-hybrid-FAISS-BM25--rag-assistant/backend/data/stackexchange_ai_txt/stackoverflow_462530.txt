For the OO-RDF mapping in general, you might want to have a look at: OpenRDF Elmo http://www.openrdf.org/ (works only with sesame but designed to be extensible and extending sesame to work on top of allegrograph(look at the sail (Storage and inference Layer) architecture) Sommer https://sommer.dev.java.net/ with some explanation of how it works here http://blogs.oracle.com/bblfish/ There is also RDFReactor http://semanticweb.org/wiki/RDFReactor which works on top of RDF2go. RDF2go is an abstraction layer with implementation for jena or sesame. Again nothing about AllegroGraph so you would need an implementation of the binding. I don't know for RDFReactor but i know that sommer and elmo are both based on annotation of POJO and allows the updates via direct triple-based-API or the queries using SPARQL. As for AllegroGraph itself, I'm not aware of anything specific but they seems to support Sesame and to interface with it, so you might be able to work this way.
