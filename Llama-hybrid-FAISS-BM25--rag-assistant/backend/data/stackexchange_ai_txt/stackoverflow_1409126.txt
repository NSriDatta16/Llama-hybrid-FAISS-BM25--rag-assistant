How can I use TortoiseSVN on windows 7?

I am trying to setup an SVN for the first time, I chose tortoiseSVN because my IDE phpdesigner has built in support for tortoisesvn. SO far I have installed the program, installed it and tried to set it up following many tutorials and reading the help file I still get this error no matter what I try to do, I even searched SO and google for this same error and I found many results, I was unsuccessful in finding a solution though, does anyone have any ideas, this is very frustraing, maybe I was meant to never use SVN Import C:\webserver\htdocs\cache to file:///C:/webserver/SVMRepository Error : Unable to open an ra_local session to URL Error : Unable to open repository 'file:///C:/webserver/SVMRepository' I have tried things like this in the browser svn://C:/webserver/SVMRepository and all it does is open up the tortouse repository browser and then says "Unknown hostname C"
