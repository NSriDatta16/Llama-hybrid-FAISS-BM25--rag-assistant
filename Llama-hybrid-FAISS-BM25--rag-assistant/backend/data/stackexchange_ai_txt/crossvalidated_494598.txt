Interaction effect in logistic regression

I have applied logit model, where my dependent variable is Emp (Employment) 1 if employed otherwise 0, and used level of education and Health status as independent variables where: Education consist 6 categories i.e. 1=No Edu, 2= Primary or less Edu, 3=junior Secondary Edu, 4=Senior Secondary Edu, 5=college Edu, and 6=university or equal Edu. Similarly Health status consists 4 categories: Unhealthy=1, General=2, relatively healthy=3, and very healthy=4. As I ran logistic regression with no interaction terms I got the significant positive effect (positive coefficients) of both Education and Health on employment status. as I included interaction terms (interaction effect) in my model I found the following coefficients of main effect and interaction effect Main effect: Edu=1 (base), Edu=2 (-.0163406), Edu=3 (-.2675933**), Edu=4 (-.5218183**), Edu=5 (.4170227), Edu=6 (.0501755) unhealhy=1 (base), general=2 (.1313351), relatively health=3 (-.1436309), very health=4 (-.2062591) Interaction effect: Edu#Health Edu2#general =(-.0040633), Edu2#relatively healthy = (.5048051***), Edu2#very healthy = (.7818021***), Edu3#general = (.0475367), Edu3#relatively healthy= (.7332412***), Edu3#very healthy (=.9944945***), Edu4#general = (.5539992***), Edu4#relatively healthy = (1.023986***), Edu4#very healthy = (.9342315***), Edu5#general= (-.2833318), Edu5#relatively healthy = (.2789528), Edu5#very healthy= (.6588221), Edu6#general= (.6008378), Edu6#relatively healthy =(.9638944***), Edu6#very healthy = (.714199**) insignificant positive coefficients, significant positive coefficients, insignificant negative coefficients, and significant negative coefficients. Now I am confuse, how to interpret these results with strong arguments? Waiting of your valuable comments.
