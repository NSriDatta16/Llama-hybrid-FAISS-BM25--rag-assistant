What you need is just use the following localReader localReader: { repeatitems: true, cell: "", id: 0 } I made for you the demo which shows live how it works. UPDATED : How I could find out the reality is not so good as the documentation . The usage of localReader could help you to fill the grid contain with data from data parameter with the custom structure, but another parts of jqGrid: local sorting and searching don't work correct with this structure of data parameter. I interpret it as a bug. As a pragmatical solution I would recommend you to convert your custom data to array of named objects like [{id:48803,col2:"DSK1",col3:"",col4:"02200220",col5:"OPEN"}, {id:48769,col2:"APPR",col3:"",col4:"77733337",col5:"ENTERED"}] with the names corresponds to the column names in the colModel . If you will use data parameter in the form, everything will work perfect in jqGrid. UPDATED 2 : Look at the source of the fixed example and it will be clear what I mean. In your case conversion of the data can be about the following var myNewData = []; for (var i=0,l=mydata.length; i The solution is not so elegant like with localReader , but it work without any restrictions.
