Spreadsheet-like functionality in web app

I have a web app for commercial property management that needs spreadsheet-like functionality for doing budgets. I don't want to use Google Sheets because my users won't necessarily have a Google account. So is there anything out there that I could use? I looked and could only find SocialCalc which wasn't quite good enough for me.
