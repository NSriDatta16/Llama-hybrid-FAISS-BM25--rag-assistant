Bamboo provides automated building, testing, deploying, and releasing of software. It's one of the most famous tool for continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. Tech stack Bamboo is suitable for any language, and other popular technologies like aws-code-deploy , docker , and amazon-s3 . You can choose from a big variety of available tasks for both build and deployment projects, or search for free add-ons! Bamboo Specs Configuration as code, called Bamboo Specs, allows the entire configuration of Bamboo plans to be stored as source code. It moves the managing of plans from the Bamboo UI to the developer's integrated development environment (IDE). This approach brings a lot of benefits and works with YAML and Java. Deployment projects Bamboo gives deployments the first-class treatment with deployment projects and environments. A deployment project holds the software project you are deploying: releases that have been built and tested, and the environments to which releases are deployed. Dedicated agents With Bamboo's dedicate agents feature, you can run hot fixes and critical builds right away! When you dedicate an agent, no other activity will be able to use it, unless it is dedicated to that activity as well. This means no wait in the queue for free build agents when there are critical bugs to fix! Visibility Before deploying a new release, see the full roll-up of code changes and jira issues that have come in since the previous deploy. Ops teams can anticipate what they'll be responsible for deploying and supporting in production, and release managers get a clear view of what is going live. See the Bamboo website for further information.
