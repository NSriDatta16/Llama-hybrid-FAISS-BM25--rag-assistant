Can a regression coefficient be explained both ways in logistic regression?

In logistic regression, depending on the sign of the coefficient we can say, for example, that when predicting political interest, a coefficient of $1.226$ for following the news indicates that people are more likely to be interested in politics when they are following the news. However, can we say that based on this coefficient, the more people are political interested the more likely they are to follow the news? In other words, does it work both ways?
