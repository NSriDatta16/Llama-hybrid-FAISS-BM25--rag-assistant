First, I would vote for the rise of the Agile movement and TDD in particular. It isn't a technical development so much as a codification of processes. However, given that the history of software development has been riddled with failures of formalization (Waterfall method, anyone?) and that Agile and its spin-offs appear to be the first successful process discipline in our field, I'd vote for it first. Second, as a former ISAPI dll developer (a low-level tech for creating web applications) I think that we sometimes underestimate the importance of web development frameworks (everything from JQuery to ASP.NET). Where once web development was constrained by the limitations of building CGI apps and ISAPI dlls, we now have far more productive ways to create web applications. This has led to an explosion of quite sophisticated web apps. That story began a bit more than 10 years ago, though. Five to ten years is a bit difficult in general: several very important technologies came on the scene just over 10 years ago but have taken time to unwind and reach maturity. Update: Note that when I answered, the time frame was 5-10 years.
