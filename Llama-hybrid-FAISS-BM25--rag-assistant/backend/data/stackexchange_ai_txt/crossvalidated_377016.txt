Relation between Vector Auto-regressive models and correlation matrix

I am generating a multivariate time series using Vector Autoregressive Models- $$X(t) = AX(t-1) + \epsilon$$ where $X \in R^{n \times 1}$ , $A \in R^{n \times n}$ and $\epsilon \in R^{n \times 1}$ is a constant. Is there a relation between $A$ matrix and correlation matrix storing the correlation information between different variables of the multivariate time series? Correlation matrix can be defined as $$\rho _{i,j} = \text{Corr}(x_i,x_j) $$ where $\text{Corr}(x_i,x_j)$ is the correlation between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ variable of the time series and $\rho _{i,j}$ is the $i,j$ element in the correlation matrix. I have asked the same question here .
