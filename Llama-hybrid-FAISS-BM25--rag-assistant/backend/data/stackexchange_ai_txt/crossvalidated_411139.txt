Wald test standard error

I want to compute from scratch a Wald test to test significance of one coefficient in a logistic regression model. I've been to so many posts and blogs but couldn't find a clear explanation with sample calculation for a NON-EXPERT like me. My basic understanding says: 1) $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$ 2) $H_1: \theta \neq \theta_0$ 3) $W = \frac{(\hat{\theta}-\theta_0)^2}{var(\hat{\theta})}$ 1) $var(\hat{\theta})$ relates to the specific coefficient of the parameter that I am testing or it is computed on ALL $\theta$ s? If first case, should I train the model with different samples (e.g bootstrapping?) to gather enough values to compute a $var$ ? 2) Should I use $\theta_0=0$ or $\theta_0=mean($ all $\theta$ s $)$ ? 3) The $var(\hat{\theta})$ should reflect the $L(y|\theta)$ or likelihood of the data given the parameter(s?) $\theta$ . Then $var(\theta)$ should be calculated from the performance of the model (otherwise how do I calculate the likelihood of observing that data)? I apologize for my probable bad use of proper terms here and will greatly appreciate a detailed/clear explanation. If an example calculation of p_values and confidence intervals could be added is a plus!
