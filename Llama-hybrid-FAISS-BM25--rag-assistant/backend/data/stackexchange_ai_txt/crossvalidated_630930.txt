Bonferroni Post-hoc after normality test following a glm()

Experiment Design Mice belonging to knock-out ( $n=7$ ) and wild-type ( $n=6$ ) had their food intake recorded per hour across a 24 hour period. Within this 24 hour period, the first 12 hours is labelled as "light phase" while the remainder 12 hours is labelled as the "dark phase". Food-intake is considered a continuous data type. My research question is to see within each dark and light phases whether there is a significant difference between knock-out and wild-type mice? R code I want to see if there is a difference between groups (i.e. knock-out vs wild-type) on the average food intake per hour (i.e. g/hour) within phases (i.e. light phase vs dark phase). I am graphing this as a cluster bar graph where phase type is on the x-axis and groups are the bar graphs. model $p.value>=0.05){#if normal distribution stats coefficients em I want to ask whether this code is correct when conducting a post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni tests after testing for normality? From the pairwise comparison, I then use the p-values to show significance, if any, on a cluster bar graph (code not shown).
