Another source I would like to recommend on this topic which I find particularly instructive is David Robinson's Introduction to Empirical Bayes . His running example is that of whether a baseball player will manage to hit the next ball thrown at him. The key idea is that if a player has been around for years, one has a pretty clear picture of how capable he is and in particular, one can use his observed batting average as a pretty good estimate of the success probability in the next pitch. Conversely, a player who has just started playing in a league hasn't revealed much of his actual talent yet. So it seems like a wise choice to adjust the estimate of his success probability towards some overall mean if he has been particularly successful or unsuccessful in his first few games, as that likely is, at least to some extent, due to good or bad luck. As a minor point, the term "borrowing" certainly does not seem to be used in the sense that something that has been borrowed would need to be returned at some point ;-).
