In order to tune hyperparameters, you'll need an evaluation metric. One evaluation metric for embeddings is performance on analogies (e.g., man is to king as woman is to _____). There is an analogy test set created by Google . You can adjust embedding hyperparameter values and see which ones perform better on that collection of analogies.
