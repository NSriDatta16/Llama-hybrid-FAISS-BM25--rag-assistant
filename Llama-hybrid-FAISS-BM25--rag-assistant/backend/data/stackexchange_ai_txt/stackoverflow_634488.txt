Echo Mirage is a greater starter on Thick Clients. Introduced to this by the (smart) bloke who wrote it. It works around dll injection. What's the context? It becomes extremely useful on a Thick Client which is leaking info it shouldn't (and using logic built into the client side). This was then used to own a Database /App.
