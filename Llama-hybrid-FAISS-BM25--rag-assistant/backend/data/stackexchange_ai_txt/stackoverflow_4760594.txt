Embedding controls in controls with MVVM

I am building my WPF app with MVVM and am running into a little design stumbling point. I have a top level window that has some properties that I pass down to my first level of viewmodels and I accomplish that easily enough with the viewmodel constructors. But if I want to have some usercontrols inside of that level how do I pass information down to them into their view models? thanks for your help
