A return code doesn't affect the flow of execution. You're at liberty to ignore a return code, whereas an exception has to be actively caught and disregarded. I would make use of exceptions where something sufficiently bad has happened such that you can't carry on using that component (or sub-component etc.) without some remedial action - in this case plugging a USB stick in. Is this controlling program flow ? Obviously yes (as is any exception). But a valid question is how exceptional is this ?
