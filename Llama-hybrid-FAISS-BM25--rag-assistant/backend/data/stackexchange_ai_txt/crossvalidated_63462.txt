ANOSIM was designed for multivariate responses, Kruskal-Wallis for a univariate response. ANOSIM converts the response to distances/dissimilarities and computes rank from those whereas Kruskal-Wallis ranks the observations themselves. Unless you have multivariate responses (i.e. a matrix for $y$) then I would probably avoid ANOSIM. If you do then I would probably direct you to the adonis() function in the vegan R package as it does a multivariate form of ANOVA but using dissimilarities; it is generally considered a more robust approach than ANOSIM. You will need to explain more about your specific data and hypothesis for us to be able to comment more.
