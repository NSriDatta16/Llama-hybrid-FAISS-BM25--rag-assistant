Yes, you are correct. Random Forest is more generic and involves regression as well as classification tasks. (It can also be applied to other work like survival analysis or ranking) Regression forest is a shorter way of saying " random forests for regression ", Breiman himself does use that term in his 2001 original paper on "Random Forests" so it is, by definition, correct. The earliest use of the term " regression forest " outside Breiman's work seems to be in "Using protein expressions to predict survival in clear cell renal carcinoma" (2004) by Kim et al.
