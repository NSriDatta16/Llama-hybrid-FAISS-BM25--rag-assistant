Yes, it is slightly more expensive than plain ol' require(). I think the point is if you can keep your code organized enough to not duplicate includes, don't use the *_once() functions, as it will save you some cycles. But using the _once() functions isn't going to kill your application. Basically, just don't use it as an excuse to not have to organize your includes . In some cases, using it is still unavoidable, and it's not a big deal.
