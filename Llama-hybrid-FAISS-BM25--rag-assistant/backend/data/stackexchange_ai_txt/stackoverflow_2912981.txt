Since - as you indicate in your comment to him - that .childNodes only goes one 'layer' deep, you need to define a recursive function to find the comment nodes: (I'm naming mine document.getCommentNodes() ) document.getCommentNodes = function() { function traverseDom(curr_element) { // this is the recursive function var comments = new Array(); // base case: node is a comment node if (curr_element.nodeName == "#comment" || curr_element.nodeType == 8) { // You need this OR because some browsers won't support either nodType or nodeName... I think... comments[comments.length] = curr_element; } // recursive case: node is not a comment node else if(curr_element.childNodes.length>0) { for (var i = 0; i
