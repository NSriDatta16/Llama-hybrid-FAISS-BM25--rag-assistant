There is no single exact confidence interval for the ratio of two proportions. Generally speaking, an exact 95% confidence interval is any interval-generating procedure that guarantees at least 95% coverage of the true ratio, irrespective of the values of the underlying proportions. An interval formed by the Fisher Exact Test is probably overly conservative -- in that it has MORE than 95% coverage for most values of the parameters. It's not wrong but it's also wider than it has to be. The interval used by the StatXact software with the default settings would be a better choice here -- I believe it uses some variety of Chan interval (i.e. an extremum-searching interval using the Berger-Boos procedure and a standardized statistic), but would need to check the manual to be sure. When you ask for the "how and why" -- does this answer your question? I think we could certainly expound further about the definition of confidence intervals and how to construct one from scratch if that's what you were looking for. Or does it do the trick just to say that this is a Fisher Exact Test-based interval, one (but not the only and not the most powerful) of the confidence intervals that guarantees its coverage unconditionally? (Footnote: Some authors reserve the word "exact" to apply only to intervals and tests where false-positives are controlled at exactly alpha, instead of merely bounded by alpha. Taken in this sense, there simply isn't a deterministic exact confidence interval for the ratio of two proportions, period. All of the deterministic intervals are necessarily approximate. Of course, even so some intervals and tests do unconditionally control Type I error and some don't.)
