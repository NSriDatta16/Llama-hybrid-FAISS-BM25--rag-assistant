Logistic regression and confounders or mediators

For a researchproject I would like to use the logistic regression model. I look at the relationship between SES (categorial) and participation in training (dichotomous). Now there are several variables (e.g. age and sex) that can affect the correlation. How do I best approach this (in SPSS)? Statistical analyzes are quite new to me, so please clarify. Thank you very much!
