Add a after the end of the right_content div (inside #content). When you float elements inside a container the elements can extend outside the bound of the box - it "floats" above the box. In order to respect the boundaries you have to "clear" the floated elements by adding a clearing element (in this case a br) as a child to the container. IE also has funky requirements a lot of the times so do a search for "ie clearfix" to find styles that make it behave like a normal browser :) To clarify, any non-floated element in the container div will affect the height of the container. So if you had a few paragraph elements with text the container div would only be as high as that content since it is inline and not floated. Think of a clearing element as a reset for boundaeries. After it, everything is back to normal and will continue to expand the container div's height.
