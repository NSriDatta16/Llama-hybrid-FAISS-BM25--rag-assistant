testing objects using DAO

Continuing another but similar question about testing ( see here ). I'll use a similare example (pseudocode) class LinkDisplayer method constructor(LinkStorage) method displayLatestLinksByCategory(number_of_them) class LinkStorage method saveLink(Link) method retrieveLatestLinksByCategory(category, number_of_them) class Link method getUrl() method getDescription() method getCategory() So the linkDisplayer uses the LinkStorage to get Link(s). The behavior I want to test is 'shouldDisplayLatestLinks'. In my test, do I need to mock LinkStorage, and let it return mocked Link objects with mocked getUrl() etc behavior? Testing 'leaf' classes is easy enough but I still find it very difficult to find my way in testing the other ones.
