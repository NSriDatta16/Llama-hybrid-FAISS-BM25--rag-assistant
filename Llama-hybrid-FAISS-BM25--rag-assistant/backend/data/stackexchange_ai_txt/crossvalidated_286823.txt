Based on what you've said in your comment, it would be hard to justify using ANOVA with percentages given you have a lot of values at the extremes (close to 0% or 100% within different groups). Instead, I would encourage you to model the data with binary logistic regression, where each conversion is coded 1 and each non-conversion is coded 0. You can then specify apriori contrasts that you would want to test for each of your treatment groups (it may be for example that comparing certain treatments against one another offers little or no value). Of course, this presupposes that you have the raw data (i.e. for each visitor you know the treatment(s) he received and whether or not he converted).
