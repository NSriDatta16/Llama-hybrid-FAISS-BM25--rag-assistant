Does your article state what $i$ is here? I'm assuming $i$ index the features. In that case, if you look at the last sentence, assuming each feature is its own column (as is standard) and indexed by $i$ , $\mu_i$ is the mean for feature $i$ (i.e. averaging over all the data for that feature). So for example if you had two features, say, income and housing price, you'd simply compute the mean and standard deviation separately for income an then for housing price. Next you subtract each income data point from the mean income and divide by the standard deviation for the income. You'd then do the same for housing price, only using the housing price data. I think part of the confusion here is that $x_i$ is really a vector of your data points, and not a single value, in which case it would probably be best represented by double-subscripts like $x_{ij}$ , where $i$ is the feature, and $j$ is an individual measurement of element of feature $i$ .
