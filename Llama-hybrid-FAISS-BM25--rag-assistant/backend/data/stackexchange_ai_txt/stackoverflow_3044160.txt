Guidance on creating a drawing / diagramming application in Silverlight

I need help on creating an application like Visio in Silverlight, of course a much more simpler one. Just dragging and dropping shapes and connecting them is enough at this time. Can someone direct me to some resources about this? Algorithms / implementations don't need to be in C# / Silverlight. It may be enough to start with the logic behind such an application. Thanks.
