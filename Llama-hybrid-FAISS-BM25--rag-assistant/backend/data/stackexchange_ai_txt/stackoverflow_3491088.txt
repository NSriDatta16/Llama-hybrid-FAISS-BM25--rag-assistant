Magento: Move product group info to the bottom in the product view

I'm trying without success to move a block with is referenced in the catalog.xml file: Catalog Product View (Grouped) I want to move the "product.info.grouped" block to the bottom of the product view page (only for grouped products). I have tried adding after="-" to the block, but nothing happens. This block shows a table of related products, which would like to appear below the media section and additional info.
