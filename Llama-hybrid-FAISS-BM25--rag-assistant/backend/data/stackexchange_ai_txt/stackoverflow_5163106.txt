Change/remove '--Please Select--' message from Custom Option dropdown on Magento Product page

I want to change the dropdown message or remove it all together. I've searched for instances of --Please Select-- but I cannot find the one that controls the Custom Option dropdowns. Searched high and low but I cannot find where this code lives in Magento, any help will be greatly appreciated!
