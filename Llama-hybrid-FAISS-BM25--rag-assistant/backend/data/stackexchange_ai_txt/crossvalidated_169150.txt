Variance and autocorrelation with missing and/or unevenly spaced data in time series

This question concerns the general problem of working with data that might have missing and/or unevenly spaced values. Letâ€™s call this real data. Specifically I am calculating rolling variance and autocorrelation of time series obtained from geological processes. The most direct approach I have come up with so far: Re-calculate the size (in points) of moving windows as you move along the data to always have the same sized window (measured in time), For every window that contains at least one NaN (missing data point), return a NaN for the entire window. Questions: Does the varying window size (measured in points) adversely affect these statistics somehow? Say your data is missing every 20th point or so; linearly interpolating these points will bias your ACF towards higher values since the interpolated points trivially depend on their neighbors. Any ideas for filling in the gaps without causing this problem?
