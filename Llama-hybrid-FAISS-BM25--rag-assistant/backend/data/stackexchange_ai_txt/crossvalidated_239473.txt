Is it valid to run pearson correlation between number of invited and attended?

Suppose we have some seasons, and the number of invitations and a count of attendances for each user. So the data look like this: user 1, number of inv 100, number of att 50 user 2, number of inv 70, number of att 50 user 3, number of inv 5, number of att 3 ... Is it valid to run a Pearson correlation between number of invited and attended, and use that number to measure how active the users are? My concerns are: both variables are counts and the number of attended is always smaller than or equal to number of invited. If a correlation is not valid, besides getting the "average attended ratio", what else can I do?
