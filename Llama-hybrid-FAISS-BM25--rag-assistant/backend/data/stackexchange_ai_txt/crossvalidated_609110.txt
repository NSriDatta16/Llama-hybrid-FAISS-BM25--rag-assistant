Why do we use moving averages in evaluation process for Batch Normalization layer?

I have seen many links about MA for batch normalization but nothing answered my question. In Batch normalization, you get means and variance for each mini-batches in the training process. And the default process, you calculate through the moving average. Those mini-batches are chosen randomly so there is no higher priority for the recent mini-batch. But why should we calculate the mean and variance for the evaluation process with MA and not just the normal average?
