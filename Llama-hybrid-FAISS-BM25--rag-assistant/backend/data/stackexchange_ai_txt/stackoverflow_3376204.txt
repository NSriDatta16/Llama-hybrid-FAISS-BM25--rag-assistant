Maybe I didn't quite understand your problem completely, but: " I need to test websites in IE " you don't need to setup a Web server to do that... Keep using Apache on your Mac host and point IE from your Windows VM to the host machine IP, as peterjmag suggested. Also, wasn't there a Mac version of IE? Again, my apologies if i misunderstood you - I don't want to sound arrogant;) " Z:\www ... a shared folder between MAC and Windows " What's this - a network share? Do you get the same error if you use a local folder in your VM (eg: C:\www )? Try mounting /www from your VM - go to it's settings > options tab > shared folders . Select Always Enabled . Click Add and browse to your /www host folder. This should make /www accessible in your VM Windows. Finally, just in case: check Windows permissions on the www folder. Hope that helps!
