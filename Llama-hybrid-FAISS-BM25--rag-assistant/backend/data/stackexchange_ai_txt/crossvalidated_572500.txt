It's not the best example to understand both approaches. In your example, you know all the probabilities and the answer can be given directly from this knowledge, there's nothing Bayesian or frequentist about it. Using Bayes theorem for calculation doesn't make it Bayesian, as it is a general theorem about probabilities. Bayesians vs frequentists differ in how they learn from the data. What Bayesians do differently is they assume priors for the distributions of the unknown parameters and use the Bayes theorem to update the priors using the data. Frequentists consider only the data. The other difference is how they think of probabilities, as a subjective measure of belief in something vs a statement about long run frequencies. So they would differ in estimating the probability from the data and interpreting it.
