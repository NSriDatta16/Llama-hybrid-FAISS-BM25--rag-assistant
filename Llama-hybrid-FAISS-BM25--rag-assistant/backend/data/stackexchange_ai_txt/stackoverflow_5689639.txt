How to average multiple images in matlab?

I am trying to get the average image from 1000 frames. Each image is 512 by 512 pixel size.The file I got from the experiments is a tiff unit 16 data. the tiff file contains 1000 frames of the same spot. I was thinking writing a m file where I read out 1000 frames from the tiff file then average them but it seems will eat up the memory very fast. What is the better way to get the average image of these 1000 frames. If the only way is to average them after load all the frames into matlab, how should I average over 1000 frames? Thanks.
