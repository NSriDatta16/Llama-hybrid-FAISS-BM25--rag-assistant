How to carry out multiple post-hoc chi-square tests on a 2 X 3 table?

My data set is comprised of either total mortality or survival of an organism at three site types, inshore, midchannel and offshore. The numbers in the table below represent the number of sites. 100% Mortality 100% Survival Inshore 30 31 Midchannel 10 20 Offshore 1 10 I would like to know if the # of sites where 100% mortality occurred is significant based on site type. If I run a 2 x 3 chi-square, I get a significant result. Is there a post-hoc pairwise comparison that I can run or should I actually be using a logistical ANOVA or regression with binomial distribution? Thanks!
