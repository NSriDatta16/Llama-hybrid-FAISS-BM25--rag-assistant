Server hardware requirements for SSRS

As the title says, i'm trying to figure out how much RAM is needed to generate and export to excel a large report using SQL Server Reporting Services on Windows Server 2003. It is not an option to upgrade it to SS2008 and also not an option to export to CSV. Strictly from a hardware point of view what is a good configuration for a high load server? (CPU's, RAM, Storage)
