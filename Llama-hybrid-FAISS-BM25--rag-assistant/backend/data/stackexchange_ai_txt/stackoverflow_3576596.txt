Is it a good idea to using class as a namespace in Python

I am putting a bunch of related stuff into a class. The main purpose is to organize them into a namespace. class Direction: north = 0 east = 1 south = 2 west = 3 @staticmethod def turn_right(d): return turn_to_the_right @staticmethod def turn_left(d): return turn_to_the_left # defined a short alias because direction will be used a lot D = Direction d0 = D.north d1 = D.turn_right(d) There is not much object concept involved. In C++, I will be using the actual language keyword namespace . There is no such thing in Python. So I am trying to use class for this purpose. Is this a good idea? Any pitfall with this approach? I've just answer a related question yesterday. This question is asked in a different way. It is an actual decision I need to make for myself.
