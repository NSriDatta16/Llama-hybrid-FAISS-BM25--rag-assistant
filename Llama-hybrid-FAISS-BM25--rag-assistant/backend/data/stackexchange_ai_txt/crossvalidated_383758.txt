For the ARIMA(0,1,1) model in part (b), since you only know $r_{49}$ and $r_{50}$ you need to do finite history forecasting, that is, you want the expectation and variance of $r_{51},\dots, r_{54}$ conditional on $r_{49}$ and $r_{50}$ only. This differs form the infinite history forecast which depends on all the past for models with a moving average part. The most efficient way is to compute this is usually via Kalman filtering and forecasting. Using functions for this in the stats R-package, we find # construct state space representation mod KalmanForecast(4,mod) $pred [1] 33.71854 33.71854 33.71854 33.71854 $var [1] 1.028853 1.353753 1.678653 2.003553 From this you can easily get 90% forecast limits. Note that the 1-step ahead forecast variance is larger than the white noise variance $\sigma_a^2=1$ (it would be equal to $\sigma_a^2$ only for an infinite history forecast).
