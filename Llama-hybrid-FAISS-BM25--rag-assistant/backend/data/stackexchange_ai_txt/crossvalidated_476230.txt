Are predictions generated from bootstrap resampling normally distributed?

If I resample a dataset hundreds of times with replacement (bootstrap replications), fit some Model A on each bootstrap sample, and generate predictions (time series) from each fitted model, can I expect the aggregate of the predictions (bagging) to collectively have a normal distribution? I ask because there are many instances in statistics where if the number of observations goes up, the more random samples will collectively appear normally distributed.
