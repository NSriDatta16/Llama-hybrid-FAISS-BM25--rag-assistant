Yes, that's acceptable. It will certainly compile. But also, if it makes the code organization cleaner, then that can be good. Most template definitions are already like this out of necessity, so you aren't doing anything unheard of. There can be some drawbacks of that class relies on other classes though. If you end up having to include the whole definition in other files that use the class, it may incur additional compile time compared to only having a brief class declaration. You can measure your compilation times if this seems to be a real concern. If you can get a copy, The c++ Programming Language (and many other books) have a detailed section about source code organization and the specific benefits of separating code into .h and .cpp files.
