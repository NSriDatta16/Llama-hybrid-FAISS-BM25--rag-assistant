Drag and Drop with NSStatusItem

I'm trying to write an application that allows the user to drag files from the Finder and drop them onto an NSStatusItem . So far, I've created a custom view that implements the drag and drop interface. When I add this view as a subview of an NSWindow it all works correctly -- the mouse cursor gives appropriate feedback, and when dropped my code gets executed. However, when I use the same view as an NSStatusItem's view it doesn't behave correctly. The mouse cursor gives appropriate feedback indicating that the file can be dropped, but when I drop the file my drop code never gets executed. Is there something special I need to do to enable drag and drop with an NSStatusItem ?
