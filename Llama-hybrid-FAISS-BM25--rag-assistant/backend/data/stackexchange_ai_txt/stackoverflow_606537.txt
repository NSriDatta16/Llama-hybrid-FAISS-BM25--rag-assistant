Making Word document embedded in a web page editable or read-only

I'm embedding some Word documents into our web page using iframe like this: Alternative The problem is that the embedded Word control allows the user to edit the documents and shows an icon to save them, but doesn't actually save anything. Is it possible to setup Word to save edits back to the FTP server? If not, is there someway we can make the document read-only so the user doesn't get the idea that they can make changes? We're using IE7 and Word 2003. (I just asked a related question about getting Word to save to a FTP server: Possible for Word to edit documents directly off an web server without Sharepoint? )
