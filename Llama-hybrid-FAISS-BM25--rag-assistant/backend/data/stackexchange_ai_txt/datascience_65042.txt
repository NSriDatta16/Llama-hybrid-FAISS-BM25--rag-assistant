Not sure. I think LSTM dont need the stationarity assumption as traditional stat method. I have tried to use it to predict on a dataset with complex temporal and spatial correlation and it works fine. But you should consider normalize the data, such as MaxMinNormalization. Not sure whether the diff will improve the results. Not sure what you are asking. Do you want to use PCA for preprocessing? PCA itself doesn't need normal distribution assumption. But I dont think using PCA then make prediction would be a good idea. No. If you have a few gaps, you can impute them as many papers do. But if there are a very large amount of missing timestamps, drop them.
