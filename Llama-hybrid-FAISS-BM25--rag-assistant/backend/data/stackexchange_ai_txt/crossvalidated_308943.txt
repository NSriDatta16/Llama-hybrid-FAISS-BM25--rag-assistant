It depends on your target audience. As Tim said, statisticians call it dummy coding, and that's what I would expect to see when describing something like a regression model. "Dummy coded variables were included to adjust for the store's location." I think calling it a one-hot encoding would seem slightly strange here. However, as another Tim also said, one-hot encoding is fairly common in the machine learning literature. It faintly implies the existence of nodes (as in a neural network), physical wires (in a device), or something like that, at least to me. Formally, I guess you are applying a set of indicator functions $\mathbb{I}_X$, but that's probably way too formal outside of a proof.
