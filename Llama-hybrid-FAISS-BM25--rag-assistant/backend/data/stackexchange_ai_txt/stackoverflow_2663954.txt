Top comment has a broken link to the console.log documentation for Firebug, so here is a link to the wiki article about Console . I started using it and am quite satisfied with it as an alternative to PHP's print_r(). Also of note is that Firebug gives you access to returned JSON objects even without you manually logging them: In the console you can see the url of the AJAX response. Click the triangle to expand the response and see details. Click the JSON tab in the details. You will see the response data organized with expansion triangles. This method take a couple more clicks to get at the data but doesn't require any additions in your actual javascript and doesn't shift your focus in Firebug out of the console (using console.log creates a link to the DOM section of firebug, forcing you to click back to console after). For my money I'd rather click a couple more times when I want to inspect rather than mess around with the log, especially since keeps the console neat by not adding any additional cruft.
