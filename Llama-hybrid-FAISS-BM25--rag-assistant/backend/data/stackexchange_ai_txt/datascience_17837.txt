Ensemble modelling using model's probabilities

In a classification project, on the training sets, I ran a selection of classifiers. These give me about 20-30% accuracy at best. For each sample, I generate probabilities of each class. I want to make a new model which takes these probabilities and gives a weighted average of the probabilities which is accurate. For this, I tried averaging probabilities. I also tried taking the best probabilities from each model (For instance, assuming Class A has better precision/recall for model1 output, I take model1's outputs for class A and so on). This also hasn't improved the accuracy much. Can you suggest some ensembling techniques?
