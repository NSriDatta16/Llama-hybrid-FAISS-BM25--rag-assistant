You have to check either it is database or code. I agree with robert and suspect this is due to database. you can use sql profiler to find out what is going wrong. If database is not the culprit then You have to use some kind of profiling tools to check what is going wrong. As frogbot suggested asp.net trace is one way. you can also use FireBug , YSLOW , Pagespeed as firfox plugin to help you. RedGate's Ant Profiler is very good but it is not free.
