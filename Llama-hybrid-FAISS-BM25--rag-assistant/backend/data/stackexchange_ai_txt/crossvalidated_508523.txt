A more complete description of your data and objectives would be required for a full discussion of your question. (Above, @RichardHardy has mentioned that your samples seem to overlap. In a comment on this Answer, @whuber has mentioned that independence cannot be assumed among observations in a time series. You would need to address both of these issues.) However, even in many situations with disjoint, independent random samples, I would use the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test only if no other appropriate tests are available. In particular, I would not use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in preference to a Welch t test to look for a difference in means. In many situations, the K-S test is too reluctant to declare differences. between two normal samples. Differences in means, significance level: For example if I have independent, random samples of sizes 100 and 50 from the same normal population, the K-S test rejects a test at the nominal 5% level more like 4% of the time. By contrast, a Welch two-sample t test rejects very nearly the anticipated 5% of the time. In the simulations below with 100,000 tests of each type, one can expect about two place accuracy for rejection probabilities. set.seed(2021) pv.ks = replicate(10^5, ks.test(rnorm(100),rnorm(50)) $p.val) mean(pv.ks p.val) mean(pv.wt Differences in means, power. Even worse, for the same sample sizes as before, the K-S test has power only about 67% to detect a difference between sampling from $\mathsf{Norm}(0,1)$ for the larger sample and from $\mathsf{Norm}(.5,1)$ for the smaller sample. By contrast, the Welch t test has power about 81% for the same task. set.seed(207) pv.ks = replicate(10^5, ks.test(rnorm(100),rnorm(50,.5,1)) $p.val) mean(pv.ks p.val) mean(pv.wt Difference in variances, power. If we are looking at two normal samples of size 20 to detect a difference between variances $\sigma^2=1$ and $\sigma^2=4.$ then the usual F-test, implemented in R as var.test --hardly known for its good power--finds a difference with probability about 84%, but the K-S test is much worse with power below 12%. set.seed(1234) pv.ks = replicate(10^5, ks.test(rnorm(20),rnorm(20,0,2)) $p.val) mean(pv.ks p.val) mean(pv.f
