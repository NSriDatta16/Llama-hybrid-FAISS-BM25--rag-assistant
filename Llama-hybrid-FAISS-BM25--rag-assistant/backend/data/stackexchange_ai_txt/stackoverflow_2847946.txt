HTML Tags for email and link to other sections on page

I am writing a HTML page and my requirements are as follows: HTML Page contains some email ID's and when clicked on those EmailID's... it should open new page of the outlook. Page has certains sections and when clicked on that.. it should reach out to the respected paragraph/section. Ex: click to Link to go to the .... section Thanks in advance...
