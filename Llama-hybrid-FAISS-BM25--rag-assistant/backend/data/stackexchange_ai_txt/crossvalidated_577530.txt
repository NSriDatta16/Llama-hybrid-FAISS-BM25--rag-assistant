group differences in proportions

Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 conditions. Each participant is presented with 10 candidates and asked to select 3 candidates from this pool. Across conditions, the 10 candidates always consist of 7 right-handed and 3 left-handed candidates. Of the 3 candidates selected by each participant, I want to know how many of those candidates are left-handed. Therefore, values can be 0, 1, 2, 3. Or: 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1. My main question is whether the average proportion of left-handed candidates differs between the two conditions. What is the appropriate test for this? Can I use a Mann-Whitney U test?
