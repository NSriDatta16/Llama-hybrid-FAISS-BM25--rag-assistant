Before claiming it's a compiler bug or asking for help, I would seriously try to organize and clean my code. I would create dedicated routines to be called for each part in FormCreate instead of this massive bag of yours. - SQLParseInit - cppParseInit - pasParseInit - CodeOutPutInit And see if 1 in particular is causing problems. And it would be not bad to build a minimal case, with as few 3rd party dependencies as possible, to allow others to reproduce it, and see if it is indeed a bug or just bad code. And also remove those $IFDEF... Just provide the actual code that causes this behavior without all the clutter. Added: As it works in D2007, but not in D2009, I would also double check that all the libraries/3rd party components that you include in your code are correctly migrated to D2009. (drill down that cppParser)
