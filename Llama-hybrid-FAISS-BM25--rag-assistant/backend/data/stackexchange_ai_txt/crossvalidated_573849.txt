Should I transform numerical variables to categorical variables in GLM?

I'm building a GLM with couple of variables and I have a problem with how to organize my data. I have both numerical and categorical data and I'm struggling as to how should I structure 3 variables. I build a model to see if a toxin in fish is influenced by environmental and biological data. All biological variables such as sex, growth, condition etc. are measured per sample. However, I want to include in the model environmental variables that have the same values for all individuals (samples) in each population. Here I give an example: Lake toxin V1 V2 V3 V7 PC1 PC2 PC3 Lake1 6.642662 -24.40677 8.175274 6.626065 2 -4.391045706 -0.709131522 1.115037248 Lake1 6.237877 -23.35143 7.214446 7.598336 2 -4.391045706 -0.709131522 1.115037248 Lake2 7.131938 -25.206 9.587 4.296624 1 -3.052061784 -0.634795567 0.615332691 Lake2 7.106172 -24.677 9.998 6.047108 2 -3.052061784 -0.634795567 0.615332691 Lake2 7.634661 -25.758 10.095 8.383605 1 -3.052061784 -0.634795567 0.615332691 Lake3 8.066581 -26.906 10.433 3.988736 2 -3.104092579 0.303914076 0.271016783 Lake4 6.217926 -29.099 6.499 5.39643 2 -2.723297999 -0.068871926 -1.89359307 The table presents 7 samples from 4 lakes. I want to test if the toxin can be influenced by all factors included in the table (from column V1 to column PC3). Variables V1, V2 and V3 are numerical (i.e. growth, condition). Variable V7 (i.e. sex) is categorical. All 4 biological factors are unique to each sample. Now, I have PCA values that describe environmental variables. PC1 describes climatic gradient, PC2 - catchment properties and PC3 - lake characteristics. These variables are unique per lake, so the values repeat for all samples in each population (lake). The numbers themselves don't matter, what's important is the distance between numbers, that describes i.e. how much warmer and more productive is Lake1 from Lake2 on a scale of all lakes. The question is, can I use PC1, PC2 and PC3 as.numeric() in the GLM model? Even though the variables are not continuous, but rather have class / are grouped? Or should I use PC1, PC2 and PC3 as.factor() ? If I use all PCA as a factor then the order is important because the lowest value of PC1 is in Lake1, but the lowest PC2 value has Lake4. Or perhaps both are wrong and there is a different approach? I'd appreciate any help.
