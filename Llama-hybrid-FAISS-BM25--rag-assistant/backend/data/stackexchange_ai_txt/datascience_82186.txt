What library to choose for machine learning on swift?

I have to do a ML project for university and I’ve chosen to do something similar as this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aut32pR5PQA , since I have most experience with swift language, I would like to use some ML library for swift. I’ve googled and found this https://medium.com/@ricardocastellanos_13596/ios-machine-learning-libraries-and-frameworks-e458f18e5a18 but i have no experience with ML so I don’t know what to choose, what would be good option? Or should I start using python anyway?
