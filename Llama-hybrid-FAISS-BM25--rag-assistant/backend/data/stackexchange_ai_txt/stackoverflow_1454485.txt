$save_path is passed a value of session.save_path configuration directive. Different session storage engines may treat this value differently. For example, if you install Memcache extension, it adds memcached session storage capability. And this parameter should be set to a server/port of memcached server. As you are developing your custom session storage mechanism, you can safely ignore this.
