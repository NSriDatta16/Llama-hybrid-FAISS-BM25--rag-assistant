First, different approaches clearly exist (for example, for post-hoc comparisons there is also Dunett's test, Scheffe's test, LSD and many others; there are non-parametric approaches; more complex modelling; bootstrapping and randomization techniques; maybe you can even drop the frequentist approach altogether and move to Bayesian factors). Whether they are better or worse depends on the context. Some will be better for some applications, some will be better for other, depending on your data and the assumptions you are willing to accept. Some will have the tendency to be underpowered, some others will do dubious assumptions. Arguably ANOVA has been shown, through simulations mostly, to be robust and to have a large power (low type II error rates). So yes, there are objective criteria to compare one approach or statistical test with another. Notably, ANOVA is a just an instance of general linear models (GLM) really, and often other related variants of GLM might be more suitable for a particular case than ANOVA.
