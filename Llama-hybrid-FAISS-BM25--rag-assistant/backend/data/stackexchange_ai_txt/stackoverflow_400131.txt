Edit: Read the error message. "Unable to create a constant value of type 'Closure type'. Only primitive types ('such as Int32, String, and Guid') are supported in this context." One of these comparisions is with a type that is not int, string or guid. I'm guessing the Category. r.Machine.IdMachine == pIdMachine && r.Category == pCategory Interestingly, LinqToSql will allow this construction. Don't know why LinqToEntities does not support this.
