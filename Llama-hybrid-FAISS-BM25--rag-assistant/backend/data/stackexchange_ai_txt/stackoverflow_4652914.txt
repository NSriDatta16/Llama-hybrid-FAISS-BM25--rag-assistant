Add upload feature to Magento CMS

Iâ€™d like to add a custom field to my CMS pages which allows someone using the admin panel to upload and specify an image of their choice to appear as a banner on the page. I would set where this image appears in the template. Has anyone come across this functionality or have any recommendations on where to begin? I am running 1.3.x and I have read that 1.4 has nicer tinyMCE features, so I imagine this will be easier with an upgrade, is that true? Anyone have any experience with richer CMS like this for Magento? I am hoping to find a solution similar to the way Custom Fields and Write Panels work in Wordpress.
