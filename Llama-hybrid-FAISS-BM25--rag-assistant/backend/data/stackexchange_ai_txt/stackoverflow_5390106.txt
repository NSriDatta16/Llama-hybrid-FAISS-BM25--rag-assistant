"When I type it in it says that it is not intended to be there." Hang on, isn't it the case that this is because: it is not intended to be there ..!? There were many heinous problems in the ancient XCodes that could lead to a mess, XCode4 fortunately prevents said issues. Just to be clear, FirstViewController is a subclass of what? There must be some problem, because it works fine. We have had utterly no problem whatsoever dragging custom classes, into an xib, to have them instantiated, I just did a couple this minute to triple-check - no problem!!
