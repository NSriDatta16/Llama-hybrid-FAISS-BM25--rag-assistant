Batch differences in biochemical measurements - statistical solutions?

I'm working with inflammatory markers from human participants in a current study and have been stumped by between-batch differences. One third of the participants had their inflammatory markers measured in one batch, the next third in a second batch etc etc. Non-parametric tests tell me there are substantial differences in mean ranks between the batches. This could be due to measurement factors (length of time in storage/time of day assessed/different technician) or it could be due to real differences in the participants that make up the sample. These differences remain after controlling obvious confounders (e.g. BMI). Rsquared values tell me that 10% of variance in inflammatory markers is due to batch differences. I imagine this is quite a common problem in this field - however, being new to it, I can't seem to figure out how to deal with it. I don't want these batch differences to confound results when later running a regression analysis. Is there a statistical method or some kind of technique that could help me address this issue (or normalise these batch differences)?? Could anyone suggest a paper to read? The worst case scenario I see is that I have to analyse each batch independently (thus losing a heap of power). Thanks!
