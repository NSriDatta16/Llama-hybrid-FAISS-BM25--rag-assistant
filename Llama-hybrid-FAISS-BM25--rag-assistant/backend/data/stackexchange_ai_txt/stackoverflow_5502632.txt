How do I connect the NetBeans profiler to a specic remote instance

I have a remote GlassFish server that has a node agent configured. The instance I want to start in profiling mode is controlled by the node agent. I've installed and calibrated the remote pack and I've modified my domain.xml for the specific instance as follows: -agentpath:/home/glassfish/glassfish/profiler-server-6.0rc1-linux/lib/deployed/jdk16/linux/libprofilerinterface.so=/home/glassfish/glassfish/profiler-server-6.0rc1-linux/lib,5140 Now at this point NetBeans tells you to start the domain with the --verbose command but in my case I'm trying to start an instance and "asadmin start-instance" doesn't support --verbose. I've checked the server.log but I'm not seeing any error nor any language that says it's waiting when I try to start the instances. However, I think GlassFish is properly configured and my NetBeans setup is the issue. Where I think the issue might be is trying to specify the port. If I leave the port off, it just tries to connect forever. If I put the port on it just closes the dialog and the status shows "Inactive". UPDATE: It seems there might be a bug with GF2. After verifying everything and getting the server so that it was listening, the following exception is thrown Could not load Logmanager "com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.ServerLogManager" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.ServerLogManager at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:200) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:307) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:252) at java.util.logging.LogManager$1.run(LogManager.java:166) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.util.logging.LogManager.(LogManager.java:156) According to this URL, http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-3256 it's a known issue and won't be fixed until GF3. Anyway, my question was about how to connect to a specific instance and I think that was answered.
