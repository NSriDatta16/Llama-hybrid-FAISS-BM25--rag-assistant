I hate to state the obvious, but you could always store the data you want to plot until the end. Now, you're going to tell me that some of that data is subroutines and doesn't get passed back to the main routine. OK. So, the solution to that would be to write a " Store_Plot_Data " class with a method that would write into memory the data, the @plot_function_name (for 3D, scatter, etc.), the axis label strings, etc. Then you would create one instance of this class in your main routine and to ensure visibility of this one instance to all subroutines you could do any of the following: use a global variable as your single instance ... OK, not so elegant, implement the Singleton pattern , or pass all subroutines the handle to that one instance of the " Store_Plot_Data " class.
