You can directly model the standard deviation of the time series with Generalized Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( GARCH ) model. This models the residuals obtained from the point forecasting model (SARIMA for example). After ensuring that your in-sample residuals are not correlated, you can fit an $GARCH(1,1)$ model. For python you can use this package , but it does only a few GARCH-type models are included. The Econometric Toolbox in MATLAB offers a more comprehensive collection of models. You mention that the series is temporally aggregated (averaged). This is typical in many applications, such as electricity load forecasting. I would differentiate between forecast error, $ie$ error in the prediction of averaged values, and variability, $ie$ the deviation within each time period. In the simplest case, you only care about the averaged values and ignore the variability. It is reasonable that the averaged values will have significant less deviation than the raw data, since variability is mitigated through temporal aggregation.
