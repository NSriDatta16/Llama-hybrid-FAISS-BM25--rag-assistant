I use LWP::UserAgent for most of my screen scraping needs. You can also Couple that with HTTP::Cookies if you need Cookies support. Here's a simple example on how to get source. use LWP; use HTTP::Cookies; my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies->new; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; $browser->cookie_jar($cookie_jar); $resp = $browser->get("https://www.stackoverflow.com"); if($resp->is_success) { # Play with your source here $source = $resp->content; $source =~ s/^.* / /i; # this is just an example print $source; # not a solution to your problem. }
