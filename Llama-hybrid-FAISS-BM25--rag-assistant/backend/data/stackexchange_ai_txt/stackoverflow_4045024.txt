I'd store the complete user object in the session. http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getSession () You can gain access to the session through this method. If you store the whole user in the session (or the user-id from your database), you can implement a more refined, role-based access later on as your application grows. greetings
