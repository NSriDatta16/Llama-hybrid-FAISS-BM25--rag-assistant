Poisson regression on time series

I have collected a value of incoming 'results' every day over a period of 4 months. I want to check if the amount of 'results' coming in every day becomes less over time. This works well with a normal regression but in three of my datasets the 'amount of results' is not normally distributed. When i Perform a poisson log regression my parameter estimates table looks weird. It has a parameter value for every day. (one sample K-S test is non significant so the data is poisson distributed) Could you guys help me find out what i do wrong? i have the feeling its due to the fact that the date is not categorical?
