If the data is clustered in the way you describe in your comment, then for the two-class problem you are likely to have a non-linear decision boundary. As linear models can't model non-linear decision boundaries, they are unlikely to perform well here. However, an appropriately sized non-linear model such as a neural network should be able to model this (for more on linear vs non-linear models see Paul Fornia's answer to "Linear vs Nonlinear Machine Learning Algorithms" ). If the NN is wide and/or deep enough it will effectively learn the cluster groupings during training. Correction (in response to @kjetil's comment): You could still use a linear model if the features can be transformed to a higher-dimensional space in which the decision boundary is linear (e.g. by using feature interactions or squaring, cubing etc features). Transforming your data to a multi-class problem may give you multiple linear decision boundaries, which should help improve a linear model, if for some reason you are restricted to using linear models. Your point on class imbalances prompted another thought. By separating the classes into sub-classes you may lose information that is common between the subclasses. For instance, consider classes of 'hard plastic' and 'soft plastic', which probably have similar values for some attributes. If they are separate classes the model may treat these shared attributes as "not useful" and ignore them. Conversely the model may place too much importance on differences between 'hard plastic' and 'soft plastic' which are not useful for bio/non-bio classification.
