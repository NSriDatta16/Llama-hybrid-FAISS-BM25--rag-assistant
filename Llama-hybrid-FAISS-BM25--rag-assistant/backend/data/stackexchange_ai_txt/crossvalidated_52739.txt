You have a very short data series which drops off a cliff in August of 2012, so I doubt that you'll find any ARIMA fit that works well. Sorry. Your ARIMA(1,0,1) "works" only in that it creates an asymptotic curve approaching the mean of your series. I wouldn't count on it actually predicting anything. You need more data: probably three years minimum for monthly data, but more like 5+ years. EDIT: It's not just ARIMA, doing any forecasting with such a short time series is problematic, and especially one that has such a huge and unexplained shift. If that's all the data you have, I'd say you're stuck. It'd be helpful to know more about the data: what kind of data is it, what related data could you obtain, what additional things do you know about the data?
