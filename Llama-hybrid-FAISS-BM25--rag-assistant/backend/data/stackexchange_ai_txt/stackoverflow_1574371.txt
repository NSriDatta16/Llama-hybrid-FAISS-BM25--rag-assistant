Empty repository after subversion -> mercurial conversion

I've used the 'hg convert' command to try to move my SVN repository to hg, and it seems to work (takes a while and prints out all the commit messages as it goes), but at the end the resulting Mercurial directory is empty. It has the .hg hidden subdirectory in it, and it's about 200 MB so SOMETHING happened, but none of the files are there. Any thoughts? The only thing I can think of as being involved is that instead of having top-level trunk, brankes, tags directories, we have many projects, each with their own trunk, branches, tags: svn-repository/ Project1/ trunk/ branches/ tags/ Project2/ trunk/ branches/ tags/ etc... Could that be causing the problem? My understanding is that SVN doesn't really care how you organize the repository, but does Mercurial?
