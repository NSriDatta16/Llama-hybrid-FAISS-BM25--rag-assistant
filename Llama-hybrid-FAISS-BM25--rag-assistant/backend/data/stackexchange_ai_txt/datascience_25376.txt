Better input for Doc2Vec

I want to perform Doc2Vec on a twitter dataset. As each tweet consists of a nummber of special characters ,numbers, urls, mentions and hashtags, non-english words, what should be my input for Doc2Vec? How should i approach for initial tweet pre-processing? I saw many tutorials but all of them used plain texts. I am a newbie in data science.
