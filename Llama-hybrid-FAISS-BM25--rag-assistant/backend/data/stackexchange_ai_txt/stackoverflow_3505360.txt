Same question , i was asking when i were just starting my career but i understood Object Orientation as i progress in my career. but for very basic startng point in oop. 1- think about object just try to relate your daily household things like ( your laptop, your ipad, your Mobile, your pet) Step 2- Try to relate objects like ( Your TV an your remote ) this gives you the basic idea how object should relate to each other. Step 3- Try to visulize how things compose to create a full feature like your Body compose of (Heart, Lungs and many other organs) Step 4- Try to think about object lifetime ( Like as a example a car enigne is less useful outside Car , so if car is a object than this object must contain a engine and when actual car object destroys engine is also destroyed) Step 5- Try to learn about a polymorphism ( Like a ScrewDriver can take may shapes according to your need then map to your objects if your using c# than try to leran about ToString() method overriding) Step 6 - Try to create a real life boundry to your real life object ( Like your House ; You secure your house by various means ) this is the initial learning .. read as much as text as you find and try to learn by your own examples in the last ; oop is an art first , try to visulize it.
