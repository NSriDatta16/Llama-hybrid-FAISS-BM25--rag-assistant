Has the Random Forest algorithm ever been used in Reinforcement Learning applications?

I've seen a research paper describing a "Reinforcement Learning Tree" , which the authors say that it has a better convergence than random forests. However, I couldn't find anything related to utilizing random forests for a table in Reinforcement Learning. Have tests ever been conducted on using random forests in reinforcement learning?
