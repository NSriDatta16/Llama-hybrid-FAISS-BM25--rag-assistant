There's two ways of doing it that depends on what you're trying to do. You can impute the missing values using the proximity matrix (the rfImpute function in the randomForest package). If you're only interested in computing variable importance , you can use the cforest function in the party package then compute variable importance via the varimp() function. This approach is based on this article , which suggests a very clever way of bypassing the missing data (and handling it in an elegant way) in order to compute variable importance.
