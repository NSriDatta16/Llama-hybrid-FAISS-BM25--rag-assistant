Interpreting fraction of zero weights in TensorFlow

I am using the TensorFlow to do a simple linear classification using logistic regression. The graph included from the TensorBoard displays what they call the fraction of zero weights. How do I interpret this in terms of model evaluation? I am assuming this is good since I got the good results in terms of loss, precision, recall, etc but not sure. Thank you.
