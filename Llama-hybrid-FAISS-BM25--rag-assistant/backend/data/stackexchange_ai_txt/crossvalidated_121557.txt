"Vanilla" neural network model (Hastie et al.)

Hastie et al. ( The elements of statistical learning ) discuss "vanilla" neural network model on page 392. They describe the model as: Derived features $Z_m$ are created from linear combinations of the inputs, and then the target $Y_k$ is modeled as a function of linear combinations of the $Z_m$: \begin{align} Z_m &= \sigma (\alpha_{0m} + \alpha_m^T X), \quad m = 1, \dotsc, M \\ T_k &= \beta_{0k} + \beta_k^T Z, \quad k = 1, \dotsc, K \\ f_k (X) &= g_k (T), \quad k = 1, \dotsc, K \end{align} where $Z = (Z_1, \dotsc, Z_M)$ and $T = (T_1, \dotsc, T_K)$ My questions What is $T_k$? What is the proper name for functions $f_k$ and $g_k$
