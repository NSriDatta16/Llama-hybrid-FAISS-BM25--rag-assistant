How to apply a seasonal index into an eCDF?

I am doing a Before/After analysis, which is aiming at evaluating the effect of a change . Assume I have made a change at the beginning of June-2022 , and I want to evaluate the effect of the change based on a one-month interval. This results in two time series, related to two distinct months, i.e., the first one is for May-2022 (before the change was performed), and the second one is for June-2022 (After the change was performed). I am evaluating the effect of the change based on the eCDFs of the two periods, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The issue in my evaluation is that even without any change, June would have been different from May, i.e., there is seasonality in my data. Suppose I can capture that seasonality by using historical data from 2021. My question is how to apply this seasonality in the eCDFs. What I have in mind is to (1) use the eCDFs of May-2021 and June-2021 , and find the difference between them using the Wasserstein distance (which as far as I understand, since my data is one-dimensional, the distance is the signed area between the two eCDFs), and then, (2) finding a seasonal index based on the Wasserstein distance, and applying that index to May-2022 (I am not sure how to do this part). So, my goal is compare eCDF of June-2022 with a shifted eCDF of May-2022 to have a fairer comparison. Any help is appreciated. Particularly, how to calculate an index based on the Wasserstein distance, and how to use that index to shift the eCDF of May-2022 (a multiplicative index? can I multiply all May-2022 data points by that index?).
