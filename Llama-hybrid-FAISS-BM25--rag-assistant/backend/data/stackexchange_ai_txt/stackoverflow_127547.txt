count isn't a variable. It has no storage allocated to it and no entry in the symbol table. It's a macro that gets replaced by the preprocessor before passing the source code to the compiler. On the off chance that you aren't asking quite the right question, there is a way to get the name using macros: #define SHOW(sym) (printf(#sym " = %d\n", sym)) #define count 1 SHOW(count); // prints "count = 1" The # operator converts a macro argument to a string literal.
