On question (ii), there is much more to be said. Indeed, there are other kinds of "Bayesian" GOF p-values that have uniform distribution when the model used for inference was used to generate the data -which means that such p-values should not be compared to 0.5 but to 0 and 1. The simplest of these is the sampled posterio GOF p-value. See the following refernces: Robins JM, van der Vaart A, Ventura V (2000) Asymptotic distribution of P values in composite null models.
