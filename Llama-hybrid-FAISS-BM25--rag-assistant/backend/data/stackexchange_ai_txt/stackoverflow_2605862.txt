NoSQL and meteorological data

So there's this new cool thing, these NoSQL-databases. And so there's my data: Rows of rows of rows of meteorological data: Values, representing certain measurements at a certain station (Identified by a WMO number, not coordinates), at a certain time. Not every station measures every parameter, not every parameter is measured all the time. I store this data (30 years worth of hourly values, resulting in ~1 billion values) currently in MySQL. The continous growth and the forseeable addition of even more data give me a little headache. Reading about the document based NoSQL systems which seem to scale rather easily, I was wondering if NoSQL is a viable data storage concept for meteorological data too. Do you have any experience with this? Update: Forgot about typical queries: Most of the queries need data in the temporal axis: I.e. give me the temperatures of station 066310 from 01.01.2010 00:00 to 01.03.2010 00:00. Or: give me the most recent values of all parameters of a particular station.
