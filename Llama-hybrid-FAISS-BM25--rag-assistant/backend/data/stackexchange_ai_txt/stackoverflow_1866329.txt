How should I organise my functions with pyparsing?

I am parsing a file with python and pyparsing (it's the report file for PSAT in Matlab but that isn't important). here is what I have so far. I think it's a mess and would like some advice on how to improve it. Specifically, how should I organise my grammar definitions with pyparsing? Should I have all my grammar definitions in one function? If so, it's going to be one huge function. If not, then how do I break it up. At the moment I have split it at the sections of the file. Is it worth making loads of functions that only ever get called once from one place. Neither really feels right to me. Should I place all my input and output code in a separate file to the other class functions? It would make the purpose of the class much clearer. I'm also interested to know if there is an easier way to parse a file, do some sanity checks and store the data in a class. I seem to spend a lot of my time doing this. (I will accept answers of it's good enough or use X rather than pyparsing if people agree)
