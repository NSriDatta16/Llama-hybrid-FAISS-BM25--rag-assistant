I'd abandon the chaining stuff. For one, it can't actually be done without doing some relatively nasty hacks. But, the biggest problem is that it makes it harder to read and maintain code and you will most likely end up with people abusing it, creating one giant line of code to do multiple things (think back to high-school algebra and those gigantic lines of additions, subtractions and multiplications you always seem to end up with at some point, that is what people will do if you let them). Another problem is that because most of your functions in the system are going to be returning a reference to itself, its going to be logical that all of them should. When ( not if ) you finally do start implementing functions that should return values as well (not just accessors, but some mutators will as well, and other generic functions), you will be faced with a dilemma, either break your convention (which will snowball, making it unclear as to how things should be implemented for other future functions) or be forced to start returning values via parameters (which I'm sure you would loathe, as most other programmers I know do as well).
