Dependency Parser If you're interested in extracting grammatical relations such as what word or phrase is the subject of a sentence, you should really use a dependency parser . While OpenNLP does support phrase structure parsing, I don't think it does dependency parsing yet. Opensource Software Packages written in Java that support dependency parsing include: MaltParser MSTParser Stanford Parser ( demo , see typed dependencies section) RelEx Of these, the Stanford Parser is the most accurate. However, some configurations of the MaltParser can be insanely fast ( Cer et al. 2010 ).
