In anomaly detection (one sort of STL application), it's easier to see outliers if you can normalize the original time series to a residual series (called "remainder" in R's STL package). That involves identifying components that you can subtract from the original series. In STL, the components are the seasonal series and the trend. If there is a regular, recurring pattern in the data (i.e., a seasonality), then you don't want the expected ups/downs of that pattern to drive the anomaly detector. Instead you want to be able to say "are we higher or lower than expected, factoring out the regular ups/downs that happen over the course of the day (or week, or month, etc.)". Identifying and removing the seasonal series allows you to ask that question. The decomposition you generated does not look right: the seasonal pattern doesn't seem to have captured much structure, the trend overfits the data, and the residuals have a regular structure that the seasonal series ought to have captured. I don't know whether this is because the dataset itself doesn't lend itself to an STL decomposition (the series tail appears qualitatively different than the initial part) or if it's because the parameters are wrong. Figure 6.10 on this page shows a more prototypical case.
