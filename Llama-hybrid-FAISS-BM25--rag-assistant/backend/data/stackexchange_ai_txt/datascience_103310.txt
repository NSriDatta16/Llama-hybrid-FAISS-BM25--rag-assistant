Why do you want to remove outliers? Do you think these are wrong data? Do you think they have outsized impact on the model? Are these rows the model should get right or wrong and you move to the validation set? Other reasons? Know why you want to identify outliers then choose the appropriate method. I think it is better to find what may be outliers then examine these to understand the appropriate treatment. I also plot the data to get a visual view of these outliers. Just because a row has large values, does not mean it is "wrong". Here is a thread that discusses. Just because you can remove outliers does not mean you should. Know your reason for removal. If I remove rows, I move them to their own validation set so I can test with my trained model. But to answer the question - one way to identify multi-dimension outliers is using random forests and proximity matrices . Random forests can be used as exploratory data analysis. In this case, fit a random forest, build a proximity matrix, then analyze which records are often by themselves in the leaf nodes or with different partners all of the time. This shows which records are different enough that a model thinks they are different. A search on cross validated shows many other outlier detection methods.
