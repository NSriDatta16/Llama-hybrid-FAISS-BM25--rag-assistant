In this case, the expected behaviour is that the variance of the random intercepts will be unchanged after adding the predictor. In reality, it will change, but the expected change is still zero. If we modify your simulation slightly, we can see that it can decrease slightly: > dat$region lmer(y~1+(1|region),data=dat) %>% VarCorr() ## Groups Name Std.Dev. ## region (Intercept) 3.0721 ## Residual 2.7386 > lmer(y~sex+(1|region),data=dat) %>% VarCorr() ## Groups Name Std.Dev. ## region (Intercept) 3.0236 ## Residual 2.8577 If we were to repeat this, with different data, we would find that, on average the difference will be zero. We can do a simple simulation to show this: > N n.sim rints_dif for(i in 1:n.sim) { + set.seed(i) + + X hist(rints_dif) > mean(rints_dif) [1] -0.0002529647
