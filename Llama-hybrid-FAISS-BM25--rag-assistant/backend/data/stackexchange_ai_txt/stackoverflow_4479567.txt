You must pass the file streams by non-const references: void extern openFiles(ifstream&, ofstream&); sumGrades and printResults don't care that these streams are files, so you can pass just streams, still these must be references: void extern sumGrades(istream&, ostream&, char, float, int&, int&, float&, float&); void extern printResults (float, float, ostream&); averageGrade is missing extern . void extern averageGrade (float&, float&, float, int, float, int); openFiles does nothing useful. It opens files and closes them... You shouldn't close them: void openFiles(ifstream& inData, ofstream& outData) { inData.open("./Ch7_Ex4Data.txt"); outData.open("./Ch7_Ex4Dataout.txt"); outData The point is that you should call these function to open the files from main : // in main(): ifstream inData; ofstream outData; openFiles(inData, outData); // call other functions to do the task. // pass inData and outData as above, where stream arguments are expected. // ...
