I came from a Perforce shop into a Subversion shop and missed the great branching and merging support that Perforce has. So, Perforce would be my first recommendation but then it costs money :). Subversion 1.5 looks promising for it's merge tracking support but it is marked as foundational and doesn't look like it will have a minimal of merge support that I am willing to accept (i.e. Perforce-like) any time soon. So, I'm leaning towards a distributed VCS, specifically Bazaar: Branching and merging work real well and in the ways I expect It can be used with a centralized workflow Supports Subversion branches, working copies, and repositories . This means my team can use Bazaar within a larger organization that uses Subversion and still share code with them.
