Its not possible for 'result' to have two distinct values, which is what your code fragment suggests is happening. You haven't shown enough code to debug this, but at a guess what you actually have is not a set of if's and more like the case statement shown here: http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FucBYCoIuWAC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=MFMailComposeResultSent&source=bl&ots=z6UhJWpeTB&sig=zT5omjvETWzdMBm0OeSb5Cbic_k&hl=en&ei=38yXTN3mFcODcOOStd8J&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=MFMailComposeResultSent&f=false and you have omitted a break statement.
