You could try one of the following... Create a bounding box smaller than the absolute extents of the sprite image. Yes it will be smaller than the sprite. This will eliminate the dead space click detection of the sprite the trade off being parts of your sprite which look selectable won't be Use a circular bounding area to detect if the user has clicked on your sprite. Again you will have the dead space problem in my first suggestion but the sphere may give you some better coverage area over the sprite giving you better results on touch detection This is a standard problem in physics collision detection systems which often end up using circles or rectangles as their collision bodies. I would go with the either a circle or rectangle smaller than the size of your sprite as your bounding area. Going finer detail than that you could generate bounding area polygons. This would however introduce a whole bunch of new issues and concerns.
