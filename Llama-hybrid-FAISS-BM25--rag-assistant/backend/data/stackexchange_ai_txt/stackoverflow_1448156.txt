Open up IB, select the UIBarButtonItem and in the Inspector, go to the Connections tab. Drag from the dot at the right of selector to your AppDelegate / File's Owner (the one where the action has been defined) and select the action. I suppose you've already tried that, but just in case. When the action does not show up, try adjusting your action definition to be something like: - (IBAction)btnInfoClick:(id)sender; and try the process again. I know you don't really have to specify the sender (at least programmatically, the way I always use) but I had the same problem and after adding the sender param it worked correctly. Good luck and let me know whether this works!
