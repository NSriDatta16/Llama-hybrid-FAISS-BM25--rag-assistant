Does GWT serialize java.lang.Longs efficiently?

I'm sending object IDs back and forth from client to server through the GWT RPC mechanism. The ids are coming out of the datastore as Longs (8 bytes). I think all of my ids will only need 4 bytes, but something random could happen that gives me a 5-byte (or whatever) value. Is GWT going to be smart about packing these values in some variable-length encoding that will save space on average? Can I specify that it do so somewhere? Or should I write my own code to copy the Longs to ints and watch out for those exceptional situations? Thanks~
