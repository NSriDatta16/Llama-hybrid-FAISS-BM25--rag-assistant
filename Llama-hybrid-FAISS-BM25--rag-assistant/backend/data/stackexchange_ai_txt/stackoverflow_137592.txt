Properties are also useful in the case you need to do something funky with the data as it comes in and out of persistant storage. This should generally be avoided, but some rare business cases or legacy support sometimes calls for this. (Just remember that if you somehow transform the data when it comes back out with the getter, NHibernate will (by default) use the return from the getter and save it that way back to the database when the Session is flushed/closed. Make sure that is what you want.)
