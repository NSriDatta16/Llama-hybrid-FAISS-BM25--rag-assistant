ADF regression in r statistical package

Please how do i conduct adf regression in r. to be precise i need the codes used in conducting adf regression in r. I am working on time series data and i need to determine how many lags to include in the adf unit roots test.I have tried to perform the unit root tests with a random selection of lags but i am not convinced its the correct thing to do. I will appreciate a prompt response as i have to hand in the paper by Friday. Many thanks Funmi
