Dzien Dobry, First.... Why dont you put an OBJECT into the combobox that has the string and the ID value? There is always Selecteditem to get it (not SelectedIndex)... saves you a second combobox. Second... get proper tools. Infragistics, Devexpress - the Microsoft internal UI elements are SERIOUSLY limited in Winforms. Gets better with WPF, but Windowms it just is really primitive. And it wont change - MS relies on the ecosystem to provide proper tooling here. I never touch any of the Winform integrated controls - totally on Infragistics, and that for a reason.
