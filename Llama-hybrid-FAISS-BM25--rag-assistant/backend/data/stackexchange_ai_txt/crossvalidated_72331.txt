It is quite surprising to see that none of the answers mention the Rabiner tutorial paper on HMMs. While the practical implementation (the latter part of the paper) is focused on speech recognition, this paper is probably the most commonly cited one in the HMM literature, thanks to its clear and well-presented nature. It starts by introducing markov chains and then moves on to HMMs.
