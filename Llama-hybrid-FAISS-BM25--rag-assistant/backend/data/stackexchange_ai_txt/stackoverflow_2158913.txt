In C#, when you have a method void M(ref int f) { } and you call it int x = 123; M(ref int x): how does this work? Logically , this means "x and f refer to the same storage location". The way we actually implement that in the CLR is f is of type "managed reference to variable that can contain an integer". We pass the managed address of local variable x to M. The analog of that in C++ would be a method that takes an &int -- a reference to a variable that can contain an int. Is that clear?
