PHP web app + web site same database but 2 users kinds

Im writting a RH system witch consist in two "services": Web App - For RH recruiting management companies Web site - For people and companies to seek/register CV The two things use the same databases for all data... my question is about the users... im the WebApp, the user HAVE to be attached in a Company (my clients).. .but in the website... dont... just regular users registering CV and searching for a job! How can i manage this two kinds of users?? I thinking in use two separate tables for each kind of user... this is a good aproach?? Tkz Roberto
