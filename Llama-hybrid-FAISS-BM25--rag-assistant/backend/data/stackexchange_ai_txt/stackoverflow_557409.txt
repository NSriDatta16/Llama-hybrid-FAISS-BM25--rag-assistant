If a project has 100% unit test coverage, are integration tests still needed?

If a project has 100% unit test coverage, are integration tests still needed? I have never worked on a project with 100% unit test coverage, but I'm wondering if your project obtains this (or in the 90%), was your experience that you still needed integration tests? (did you need less?) I ask because integration tests seem to suck. They are often slow, fragile (break easily), opaque (when broken someone has to dive through all the layers to find out what is wrong) and are causing our project to slow way down... I'm beginning to think that having only unit tests (and perhaps a small handful of smoke tests) is the way to go. In the long run, it seems like integration tests (in my experience) cost more than they save. Thanks for your consideration.
