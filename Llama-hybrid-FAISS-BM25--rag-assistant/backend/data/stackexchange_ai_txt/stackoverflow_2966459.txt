parallel sorting methods

in book algorithm in c++ by robert sedgewick there is such kind of problem how many parallel steps would be required to sort n records that are distributed on some k disks(let say k=1000 or any value ) and using some m processors the same m can be 100 or arbitrary number i have questions what we should do in such case? what are methods to solve such kind of problems? and what is answer in this case?
