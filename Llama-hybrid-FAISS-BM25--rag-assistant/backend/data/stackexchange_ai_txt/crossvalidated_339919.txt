What does it mean that AUC is a semi-proper scoring rule?

A proper scoring rule is a rule that is maximized by a 'true' model and it doesn't allow 'hedging' or gaming the system (deliberately reporting different results as is the true belief of the model to improve the score). Brier score is proper, accuracy (proportion classified correctly) is improper and often discouraged. Sometimes I see that AUC is called a semi-proper scoring rule which makes it not completely bogus as accuracy, but less sensitive than proper rules (for example here https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/90705/53084 ). What does semi-proper scoring rule mean? Is it defined somewhere?
