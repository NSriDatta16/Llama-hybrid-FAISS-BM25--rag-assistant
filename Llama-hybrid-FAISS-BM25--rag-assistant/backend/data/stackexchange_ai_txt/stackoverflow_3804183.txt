How to nicely output a list of separated strings?

Usually, when I had to display a list of separated strings, I was doing something like: using namespace std; vector mylist; // Lets consider it has 3 elements : apple, banana and orange. for (vector ::iterator item = mylist.begin(); item != mylist.end(); ++item) { if (item == mylist.begin()) { cout Which outputs: apple, banana, orange I recently discovered std::ostream_iterator which if found really nice to use. However with the following code: copy(mylist.begin(), mylist.end(), ostream_iterator (cout, ", ")); If get: apple, banana, orange, Almost perfect, except for the extra , . Is there an elegant way to handle the special "first (or last) element case" and to have the same output than the first code, without its "complexity" ?
