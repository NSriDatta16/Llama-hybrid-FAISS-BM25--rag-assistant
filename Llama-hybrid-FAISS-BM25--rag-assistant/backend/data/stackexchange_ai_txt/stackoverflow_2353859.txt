Integrating Open ID and also leveraging Microsoft HealthVault

I've seen several articles/questions regarding Open ID integration but I'm curious if I integrate this into my site and then try to integrate with Microsoft HealthVault which accepts live id or open id, how smooth that is or if there is a potential of multiple login actions (obviously undesired). Ideally I would love to do something like, register for my site, if you would like to use Microsoft health vault to store health information, tether an account and subsequently you wouldn't have to do anything assuming you logged into your account within my site. Anyone have any idea if that is possible?
