It's actually not, and here is why: no community at all (if to disregard paid support ^^) heavyweight slow (though, CPU usage is outrageous) contains a lot of redundant architectural approaches (this covers all layers) includes numerous self-implemented tiers (i.e. ORM) in stead of which open source ones could have been used more efficiently complex: learning curve is enormous From a developer perspective: java code is being written quite rarely (even for core development, though it depends) doesn't have much to learn (no technologies, no complex architectural approaches except for those, caused by previous redundant development)
