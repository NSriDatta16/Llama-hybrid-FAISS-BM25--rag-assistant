Questions about controlling WCF PeerChannel connections

I've been studying the PeerChannel in WCF. The docs indicate that a peer will automatically try to get between 3 and 7 connected neighbors. My scenario is a couple of systems on one side of an expensive, high-latency connection; and one or more on the other side. Since the connection has limited bandwidth, I'd really like to keep control of how many connections are made across this precious resource. The topology is something like this: (c) a (precious bandwidth connection) | | d b (high latency) | (e) 1. Is there really nothing I can do to keep the links across the precious link at one or two? 2. Will the PeerChannel consider the latency when choosing which neighbors it allows? 3. Is there anything I can do to encourage the WCF PeerChannel to keep the neighbors across the precious link to a minimum?
