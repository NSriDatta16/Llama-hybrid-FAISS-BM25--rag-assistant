Question about application of GLMM with Poisson

I'm working on revising stats for a manuscript involving male reproductive success of deer. We measured three variables ( body size , antler size , and age ) of male deer in a captive population on an annual basis over a 6 year period, and goal was to determine the relative influence of each variable on annual reproductive success (i.e., number of fawns produced each year / not lifetime reproductive success). I understand that my predictors are collinear and the issues created; however, there really is no way around including collinear predictors in our model as PCA's, etc. would essentially destroy the core question of our research. We plan to use model averaging to evaluate predictors in the end so ran global model first. Here is current code: global.model = glmer(Fawn ~ Age + I(Age^2) + Age*AvgAge + BodySize + I(BodySize^2) + BodySize*AvgAge + SSCM + I(SSCM^2) + SSCM*AvgAge + AvgAge + (1|Sire) + (1|Year), data=datum, family=poisson, na.action="na.fail") Quadratic effects were included for predictors due to expected non-linearities. Two random terms were included to account for the individual potential sires being sampled multiple times during the study and year (input as a factor) effects. AvgAge is a term related to population demographics, and interactions with predictors are included. So here are my questions: A reviewer suggested that there is temporal correlation in my data (e.g. male age at year one is correlated with male age at year two) that needs to be addressed. He suggested including a temporal autocorrelation structure, or including Year as a numeric predictor to deal with this. Am I missing something here or isn't this correlation the whole purpose of including the random effect for each male, coded as (1|Sire) in this case? Also, including year as a numeric predictor really mucks things up because: I'm not interested in the specific effect of Year , there was a good bit of variability in the number of males we measured each year, and it makes an already complex model more complex. Is the following code sufficient to use to screen for overdispersion? So I assume here that if the ratio is overdisp.glmer(test) # Residual deviance: 84.153 on 105 degrees of freedom (ratio: 0.801)
