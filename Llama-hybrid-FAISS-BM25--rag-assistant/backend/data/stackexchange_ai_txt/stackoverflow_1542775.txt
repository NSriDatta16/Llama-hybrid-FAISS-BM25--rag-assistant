how to merge element using xslt?

I have an reference type of paragraph with element. Example Input file: Antony , R. and Micheal , V. reference title Output received now: Antony , R. and Micheal , V. reference title> Required output file: Antony, R. and Micheal, V. reference title My xslt scripts: What needs to be corrected in xslt to get the element single time like the required output file? Please advice anyone.. By, Antny.
