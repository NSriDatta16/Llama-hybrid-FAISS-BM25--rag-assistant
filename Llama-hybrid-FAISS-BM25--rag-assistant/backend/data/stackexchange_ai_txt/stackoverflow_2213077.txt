This page has some details which I think explain the difference quite nicely. Firstly: The final rendering destination of the OpenGL pipeline is called [the] framebuffer . Whereas: Renderbuffer Object In addition, renderbuffer object is newly introduced for offscreen rendering. It allows to render a scene directly to a renderbuffer object, instead of rendering to a texture object. Renderbuffer is simply a data storage object containing a single image of a renderable internal format. It is used to store OpenGL logical buffers that do not have corresponding texture format, such as stencil or depth buffer.
