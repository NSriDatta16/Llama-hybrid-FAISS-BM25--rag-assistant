How to model and generate forecasts for time series with missing observations?

I am trying to model some historical variables which are discontinuous. I am working with monthly observations so I have 12 observations per year. However, there are cases in which, for example, I have data for January-2000, February-2000, and then the data jumps to May-2000, and so on. I am using R to perform the time series and forecasting analysis. Is there a way to cope with this kind of irregular time series in R?
