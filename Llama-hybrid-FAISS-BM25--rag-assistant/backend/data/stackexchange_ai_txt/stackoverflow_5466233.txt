I don't really see anything wrong with this approach but it is difficult to say without seeing a bit more code. The important thing is not to over-think backbone too much. There are only a few things that backbone is designed to do and beyond that it's up to you to leverage that functionality as you see fit. As for this particular issue I don't see any reason why you shouldn't do what you are doing here. I would definitely make sure that you aren't loading/fetching any data or templates before you need them. I would also make sure that you wait until you have all the data you need from the server before rendering a view (so the view doesn't load choppily). These last points are only guidelines and don't really have anything to do with backbone. But honestly that's one of the features of backbone: it does a few things well and then gets out of your way.
