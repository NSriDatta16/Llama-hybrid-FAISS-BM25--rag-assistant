Besides the obvious ideas regarding machine learning methods such as tree based approaches (e.g. xgboost), I would note that logistic regression is not limited to linear effects. For example, spline based methods can be applied quite easily (see e.g. Frank Harrell's "Regression Modeling Strategies - With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic and Ordinal Regression, and Survival Analysis" for more details). There are also generalized additive models, that may be yet another option. In such models it may be slightly easier to interpret the contribution of different variables than in tree based methods, where this can be a bit harder.
