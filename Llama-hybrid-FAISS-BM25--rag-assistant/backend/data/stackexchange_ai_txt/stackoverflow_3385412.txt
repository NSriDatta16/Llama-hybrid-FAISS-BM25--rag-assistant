Controllers should be grouped by functionality. You could also have a controller per resource (REST). You could have an AuthenticationController which handles authentication and PostsController which will handle the posts retrieval and adding a new post. As far as the views are concerned assuming you will have a single page that will list posts and add new posts you could have a single view but maybe with multiple partial views/editor/display templates.
