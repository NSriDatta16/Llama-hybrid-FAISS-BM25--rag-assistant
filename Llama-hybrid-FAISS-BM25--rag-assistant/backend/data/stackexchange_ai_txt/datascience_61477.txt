XGBoost implementation is buggy. Crashed silently when training on GPU on v 082 . It happened to me as well on v 0.90 , so the issue has not been addressed so far, and the "fix" provided in GitHub didn't work for me. LGBM 2.3.1 works like a charm out of the box, though installing it requires a little more effort. So far no issues training on GPU. About XGBoost being " so fast ", you should take a look at these benchmarks .
