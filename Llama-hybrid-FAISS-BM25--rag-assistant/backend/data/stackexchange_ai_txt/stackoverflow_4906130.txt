It's true that all Jackrabbit cluster nodes need access to the same persistent storage (persistence manager, data store, and repository file system). However, each cluster node needs its own (private) repository directory, including repository.xml file, workspace FileSystem and Search index. It looks like you try to use the same repository directory. I updated the Jackrabbit cluster wiki page accordingly. Should I be using a DB persistence manager for both the PersistenceManager and Journal? Yes, that's a good solution. By the way, you could check how clustering is configured in the commercial Day CRX (which is based on Jackrabbit). There is more documentation about clustering , a lot of it applies to Jackrabbit as well. Disclaimer: I work for Day (now part of Adobe).
