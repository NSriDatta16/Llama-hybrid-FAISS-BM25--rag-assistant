Suppose $n = 100, k = 80.$ Then it makes a difference whether sampling is with or without replacement. set.seed(2020) x = rnorm(100, 50, 8) a = mean(x); a [1] 50.87113 sd(x); sd(x)/sqrt(100) [1] 8.954334 [1] 0.8954334 # aprx SE mean The population SD is $\sigma = 8.$ The reference sample of 100 has $S = 8.954,$ so the SE mean estimated from the reference sample is $S/\sqrt{n} = 0.8954.$ a.wo = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x,80)) ) sd(a.wo) [1] 0.4467356 # aprx SE mean w/o replacement a.wr = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x,80, rep=T)) ) sd(a.wr) [1] 0.99378 # aprx SE mean with replacement Means of subsamples taken without replacement are less variable than means of subsamples taken with replacement. As the available pool of values decreases so does the variability. Also, means of subsamples taken with with replacement get more variable as the size of the subsample decreases (as for $k=50$ below). a.wr.50 = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x,50, rep=T)) ) sd(a.wr.50) [1] 1.262685 Now for a second vector of $100\,000$ such averages of subsamples of size $k=80.$ a.wr2 = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x,80,rep=T))) sd(a.wr2) mean(abs(a.wr - awr2)) a.wr2 = replicate(10^5, mean(sample(x,80,rep=T))) sd(a.wr2) [1] 0.9945862 mean(abs(a.wr - a.wr2)) [1] 1.121448 As I interpret your question, the last result above approximates the answer to your question for $n = 100, k = 80$ and sampling with replacement for two independent samples. If that is correct, it seems worthwhile to try to get an analytic solution for $Var(\frac{1}{k}\sum_i X_i)$ and from there the variance of the absolute difference of two such averages.
