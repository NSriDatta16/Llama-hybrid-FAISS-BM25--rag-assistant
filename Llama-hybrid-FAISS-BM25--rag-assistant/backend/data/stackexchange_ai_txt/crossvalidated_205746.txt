dmvnorm produce 0 likelihood

I am implementing an MCMC algorithm in R using the "mvtnorm" package. The data is about 150 dimensions so the likelihood produced by dmvnorm is usually zero (or -inf if "log=TRUE" is set), which make it impossible to compute rejection rate. Could anyone give me some suggestions to handle it? Thanks in advance!
