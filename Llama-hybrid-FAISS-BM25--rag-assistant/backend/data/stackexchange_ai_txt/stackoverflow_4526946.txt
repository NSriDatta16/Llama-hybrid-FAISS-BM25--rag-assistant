You're missing the service layer. The controller is just an agent to control objects (models) and variables running around. In my opinion the model classes just needs to be self representing models, and not aware of the entity manager. I think you need to create a service layer in between. When saving/modifying a model, the controller calls a service object to do such. It's just saying "modify object $id with data $data" and the service layer performs this action. The result (success/failure) is passed back to the controller to act on this result.
