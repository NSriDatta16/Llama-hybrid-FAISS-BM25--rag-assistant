How to make inference on cluster-specific parameters in a Bayesian mixture model

Suppose I have a mixture model, for example of the kind $$ y_i \mid w, \{\theta_h\}, H \sim \sum_{h=1}^H w_h f(y_i \mid \theta_h) \\ P(H=h) = q_h \\ w \mid H \sim Dirichlet(\alpha) \\ \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_h \mid H=h \sim \prod_{j=1}^h P_0(\theta_j) $$ After running an MCMC simulation, we can get a point estimate the number of clusters, but also the latent partition of the data for example minimizing the Binder loss function, suppose that we obtain a partition estimate $\hat C_1, \ldots \hat C_K$ with $K$ clusters. In order to report the results, one may be interested also in obtaining a point estimate for the cluster-specific parameters $\hat \theta_1, \ldots, \hat \theta_K$ . What are some possible ways to do so? For instance, would it be ok to estimate $\hat \theta_1$ as the mode of the distribution $P_0(\theta) \times \prod_{i \in \hat C_1} f(y_i \mid \theta)$ ? What happens if instead of assuming the $\theta$ s independent, we assume a joint distribution on them (non independent)?
