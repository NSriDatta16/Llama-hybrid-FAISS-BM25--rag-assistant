If you can characterize your current workload in terms of hits to pages, then you can then: 1) calculate the typical type of query that will be done for each page 2) using the above 2 pieces of information, estimate the workload on the database server You also need to determine your performance requirements - what is the max and average response time you want for your website? Given the workload, and performance requirements, you can then calculate capacity. The best way to make this estimate is to use some existing hardware, run a simulated database workload on a database on that hardware, and then extrapolate your hardware requirements based on your data from the first steps.
