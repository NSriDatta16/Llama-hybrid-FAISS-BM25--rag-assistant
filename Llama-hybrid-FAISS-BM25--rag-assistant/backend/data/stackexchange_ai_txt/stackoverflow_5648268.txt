Why is it such an effort to setup code coverage in TeamCity?

I'm using Teamcity 6.0 and want to add code coverage to our NUnit tests. PartCover has been a massive issue due to it not running on x64 server and so now I have to go and git it and build it myself :( Also, jetBrains, if you know the xslt is broken, make it easier for me to fix it. Does anyone else have PartCover working?. Maybe this might help : http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/07/23/using-teamcity-with-partcover-4/
