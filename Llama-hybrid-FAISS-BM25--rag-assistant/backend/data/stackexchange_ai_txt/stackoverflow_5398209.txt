Scaling Node.JS across multiple cores / servers

Ok so I have an idea I want to peruse but before I do I need to understand a few things fully. Firstly the way I think im going to go ahead with this system is to have 3 Server which are described below: The First Server will be my web Front End , this is the server that will be listening for connection and responding to clients, this server will have 8 cores and 16GB Ram. The Second Server will be the Database Server , pretty self explanatory really, connect to the host and set / get data. The Third Server will be my storage server, this will be where downloadable files are stored. My first questions is: On my front end server, I have 8 cores, what's the best way to scale node so that the load is distributed across the cores? My second question is: Is there a system out there I can drop into my application framework that will allow me to talk to the other cores and pass messages around to save I/O. and final question: Is there any system I can use to help move the content from my storage server to the request on the front-end server with as little overhead as possible, speed is a concern here as we would have 500+ clients downloading and uploading concurrently at peak times. I have finally convinced my employer that node.js is extremely fast and its the latest in programming technology, and we should invest in a platform for our Intranet system, but he has requested detailed documentation on how this could be scaled across the current hardware we have available.
