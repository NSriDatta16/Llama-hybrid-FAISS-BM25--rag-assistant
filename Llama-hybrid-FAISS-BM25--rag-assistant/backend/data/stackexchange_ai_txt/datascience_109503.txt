I'm not very knowledgeable about the formal distinction between loss and cost. As far as I know, there's not a lot of different between the two: in the context of NNs, loss is used specifically as a measure of the difference between the predicted and true value, typically on a validation set. Cost is more general, a cost function describes any way to measure performance with a "lower is better" value. Note that these terms are used in many different contexts so the specific way they are defined for a specific setting is not very important. In the multiple-regression problem described in the question, I would say that the most important point is not use mean MAE across different target variables: unless there's information that these variables have exactly the same range, their MAE values are not comparable and therefore cannot be averaged. In general multiple regression correspond to multiple problems which should be evaluated independently. But if the specific context justifies it, it might make sense to average or calculate some ad-hoc cost function.
