No machine learning method can (reliably) separate classes that are inseparable. Let’s consider two example. In this first case, we have data generated by $N(0,1)$ with label $0$ and data generated by $N(2,1)$ with label $1$ . You might be out of luck when it comes to predicting the label for an observed value of $1$ (equally likely to have come from either distribution), but for something like $4$ or $-2$ , you have a pretty good chance of classifying those correctly. Now consider data generated from $N(0,1)$ with label $0$ and more data generated from $N(0,1)$ with label $1$ . Given an observation, do you have any chance of identifying the correct label? It turns out that you don’t have different classes. Separation is impossible.
