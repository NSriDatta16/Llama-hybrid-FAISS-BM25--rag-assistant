If I'm not mistaken, you are dancing around the conditional expectation, though it's not quite what you're looking for. I wanted to make this a comment but it came in a bit too long. Recall $\mathbb{E}X = \int_\Omega X d\mathbb{P}$. Let $\mathscr{A}\subseteq \mathscr{F}$ be a sub $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathscr{F}$ and let $A \in \mathscr{A}$. We know the following, \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}(X\mid A) &= \frac{ \int_A X d\mathbb{P}}{\int_\Omega 1_Ad\mathbb{P}} \\ &= \frac{ \int_\Omega X1_A d\mathbb{P}}{\int_\Omega 1_Ad\mathbb{P}} \\ &= \frac{\mathbb{E}X1_A}{\mathbb{P}A} \end{align*} So that your quantity of interest is $\mathbb{E}X1_A = \mathbb{E}(X\mid A) {\mathbb{P}A} $. I suppose this doesn't answer your question as I don't provide a name for it, but hopefully searching down the path of conditional expectations, or the law of total expectations might come up with something. I believe I have seen it referred to as the local average ,but I can't seem to remember where.
