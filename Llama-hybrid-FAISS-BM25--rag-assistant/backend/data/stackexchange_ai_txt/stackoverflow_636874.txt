How can the friction drag be calculated for a moving and spinning disk on a 2D surface?

Let's consider a disk with mass m and radius R on a surface where friction u also involved. When we give this disk a starting velocity v in a direction, the disk will go towards that direction and slow down and stop. In case the disk has a rotation (or spin with the rotational line perpendicular on the surface) w beside the speed then the disk won't move on a line, instead bend. Both the linear and angular velocity would be 0 at the end. How can this banding/curving/dragging be calculated? Is it possible to give analytical solution for the X(v,w,t) function, where X would give the position of the disk according to it's initial v w at a given t? Any simulation hint would be also fine. I imagine, depending on w and m and u there would be an additional velocity which is perpendicular to the linear velocity and so the disk's path would bend from the linear path.
