Some http and https URL handlers use the http.agent to set the User-Agent header. The correct way to handle this would be to make a copy of this particular system property available whether the permission is granted or not (as with a number of others). However, what has been done is to add it on to the permissions give to applets and JNLP apps. This means that if any code is loaded through another mechanism (say a call from JavaScript over LiveConnect), it wont have the permissions and there might be a failure. If the item is already cached, then there wont be a need to write a HTTP header, and therefore the property need not be read.
