This is a good question. But what you are really asking should not be how the statistic is interpreted but what assumptions underlie each of your respective models (hazard or logistic). A logistic model is a static model which effectively predicts the likelihood of an event occurring at a particular time given observable information. However, a hazard model or Cox model is a duration model which models survival rates over time. You might ask a question like "what is the likelihood of a cigarette user surviving to the age of 75 relative to that of a nonuser with your logistic regression" (given that you have information about mortality for a cohort up to 75 years of age). But if instead you want to take advantage of the fullness of the time dimension of your data then using a hazard model will be more appropriate. Ultimately though it really comes down to what you want to model. Do you believe what you are modelling is a one time event? Use logistic. If you believe your event has fixed or proportional chance of occurring each period over an observable time spectrum? Use a hazard model. Choosing methods should not be based on how you interpret the statistic. If this were the case then there would be no difference between OLS, LAD, Tobit, Heckit, IV, 2SLS, or a host of other regression methods. It should instead be based on what form you believe the underlying model you are trying to estimate takes.
