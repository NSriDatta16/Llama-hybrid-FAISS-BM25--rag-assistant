Override Bundle classloader in OSGi?

Is this possible somehow? I mean for my own bundle? Thank you Misha p.s. More specifically, I am interesting in having a class within my bundle (well, within a fragment) return my custom classloader from a call to MyClass.class.getClassLoader() rather than the bundle's??? Thank you very much Yours Misha p.s. Some helpful links I've found that don't seem to answer this question :( http://shylendrabhat.com/blog/2009/11/21/class-loader-architecture-comparison-java-j2ee-and-osgi/ http://codescale.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/basics-about-osgi-classloading/
