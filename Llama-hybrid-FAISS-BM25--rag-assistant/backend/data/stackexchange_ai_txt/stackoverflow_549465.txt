Neural networks are more than 50 years old, see e.g. the Perceptron . Genetic programming is more than 40 years old. Now the original question got edited, so age is no longer relevant ... BTW, object-oriented programming originated in simulation, more than 40 years ago (Simula 67). Most other programming languages are either derived bottom-up from what a machine can do (imperative languages starting with FORTRAN in 1954) or from some mathematical notion of computation (e.g. lambda calculus inspired Lisp in 1957 and later other functional languages. Prolog is another example derived from mathematical logic). The relation of programming languages to calculus that you see is mostly accidental, because numerical computations were the major use of computers in the early days and are still important today.
