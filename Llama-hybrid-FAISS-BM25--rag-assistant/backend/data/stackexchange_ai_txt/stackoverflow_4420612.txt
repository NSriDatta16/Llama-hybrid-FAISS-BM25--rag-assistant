Have you considered using the built-in Windows Error Reporting ? You can use the Winqual website to view driver-specific, application-specific, or operating system-specific errors associated with your organization. Each error report provides details related to that bucket, and you can then request a file of the associated data. To view error reports: Establish a Winqual account. To protect companies from impersonation and to ensure that the error reports go to a representative from the correct company, the Winqual Web site requires your company to have a valid VeriSign ID. • Check with your Legal Department; your company might already have a VeriSign ID (also called a Software Publisher's Digital ID for Authenticode). • Check on Winqual to see if your company already has an account. Accept the Windows Error Reporting Agreement. Sign in to the Winqual site. Click Windows Error Reports. This old article may be of interest: A Simple Class to Catch Unhandled Exceptions in WinForms
