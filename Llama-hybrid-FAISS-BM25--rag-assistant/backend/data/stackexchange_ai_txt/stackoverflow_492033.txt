My product, WindowTabs.com , kind of does this. You need to use Win32 - I suggest you avoid using SetParent because you end up attaching the thread input. Instead, draw the tabs above the windows and use SetWindowPos to move the windows as a group. Also, some third party controls like Infragistic don't function correctly if you parent the form at a Win32 level.
