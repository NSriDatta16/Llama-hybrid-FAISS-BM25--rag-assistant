Time series forecasting $y_t$ with other features $X_t$ and all past information

I meet a time series problem. For machine learning problem, with data set $\{(X_i, y_i) | i = 1, \cdots, n\}$ , we want to predict y given some X. There are many ML model to do such kind fitting, e.g. linear regression, CNN, etc. For time series problem, with $\{Y_t | t = 1, \cdots, k\}$ , we want to predict $Y_n$ for $n > k$ . There are also lots of time series model, e.g. ARIMA, etc. Right now, I meet a problem, with time series dataset $\{(X^1_t, X^2_t, \cdots, X^m_t, y_t) | t = 1, \cdots ,k\}$ where $X^k_t$ is feature $X^k$ at time t. We want to predict $y_n (n > t)$ given previous dataset and $\{X^1_n, \cdots, X^m_n\}$ . My questions: What's terminology for this kind of problem? Has this problem been systematically studied? Could you give some reference or literature? What are the famous models for this problem?
