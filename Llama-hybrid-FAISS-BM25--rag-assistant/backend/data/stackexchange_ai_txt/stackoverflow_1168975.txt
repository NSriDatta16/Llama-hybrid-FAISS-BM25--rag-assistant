It's sorta like the database normalization debate. It's cleaner and more elegant to do everything in pure XML (or normalize your database schema), that way you're not unnecessarily coupled to your particular implementation. But if you have to then convert the XML to JavaScript objects (or join 5 tables for every damned SELECT ), you may end up writing lots of extra code and incur unnecessary performance hits. It all depends on how you balance convenience with formal correctness. If this is an XML interchange format that will be standardized by the W3C and used by millions then dear God, do not use JSON. If this is for an in-house app that'll only be processed by code you yourself have written then screw it, just throw the JSON in there and move on!
