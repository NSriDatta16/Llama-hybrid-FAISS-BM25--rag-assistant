How much statistics knowledge is enough for studying time series?

I am interested in studying time series (both theoretical and applied), my background is in mathematics and my probability knowledge is well enough but I haven't studied stats deeply (only one course in inference); what is the minimum prerequisite in stats for a good grasp of time series? And generally what mathematics is needed for it?
