My question is whether your test setup represents the reality of your application or not. In short, are you testing the right thing? Is your app going to be appending large numbers of records one at a time? Or is it going to be appending batches of records based on a SQL SELECT? If the latter, you might look at trying to do it all server-side, particularly if the source table(s) in the SELECT are on the server. It's important to realize that with ODBC, a batch append is going to be sent to the SQL Server as a single insert for every single row (every similar to the recordset-based approach in your test code). If you move the same process entirely server-side, it can be done as a batch operation. Also, you should test again using ADO instead of DAO. It may optimize the operation completely differently. Last of all, someone brought to my attention just this past week this fascinating article by Andy Baron: Optimizing Microsoft Office Access Applications Linked to SQL Server I'm still absorbing the contents of that very useful article, and it discusses several issues in regard to non-GUID-specific topics that may help you optimize your process for maximum efficiency.
