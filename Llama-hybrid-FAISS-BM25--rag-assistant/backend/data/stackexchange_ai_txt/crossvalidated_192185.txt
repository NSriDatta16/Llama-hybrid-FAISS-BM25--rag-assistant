I suggest using a cumulative-link regression that predicts the education level with one binary study status factor (dropped out/stayed in); see ordinal package in R . If your stats package doesn't have an ordinal regression function like this, you could use a series of logistic regressions, e.g., no education (0) vs primary education (1) predicted by study status primary education (0) vs secondary + education (1) predicted by study status It's not appropriate to use a t -test (or non-parametric t -test like wilcoxon) with the ordinal data you have because the difference between the levels in your dependent variable is not reflected in the value-assignment that is being discussed in this post.
