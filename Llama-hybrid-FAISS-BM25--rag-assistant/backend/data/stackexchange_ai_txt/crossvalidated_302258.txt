Fisher z test to compare correlations in a time series

I am running an analysis (in SAS, using proc corr fisher). http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/docs30/CompareCorrCoeff.pdf I basically want to know how different the correlations are on a daily basis for two groups with different variables. I have several variables on a daily basis for a variety of stocks (I compute pooled, time series and cross sectional correlations over 5 years) which are classified into two groups. Basically it will end in an event study and I want to know if the correlations of two samples diverge in strengths before and after an event (t-5 to t+5). Is the Fisher z test appropriate and how can I interpret figures? Regards M
