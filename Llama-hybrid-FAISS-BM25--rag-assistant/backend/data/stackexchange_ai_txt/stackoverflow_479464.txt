How to configure the limit of concurrent requests to a remoting server with TcpChannel

I have a standard Remoting server with an underlying TcpChannel: IDictionary props = new Hashtable(); props["port"] = portnumber; TcpChannel channel = new TcpChannel(props, null, provider); ChannelServices.RegisterChannel(channel, false); string url = string.Format("AgentHost", portnumber); RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownServiceType( typeof(RemotingAgentHostEndPoint), url, WellKnownObjectMode.SingleCall); It works fine but when at 200 parallel calls the clients receive a "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.1:33333" exception. I cannot find anywhere to override this limit - do any of you have a clue ? Kind regards Carsten Hess
