Which machine learning methods can I use to study/analyze this ordinal data? (generated by a hypothetical turing machine)

I have a set of ordinal data, generated by a hypothetical turing machine. The data consists of a sequence of symbols such as: LB1, LB2, UU, UB1 ... The labels have a natural ordering, and the machine "prints" out the symbols at an irregular pace. I would like to analyze, for the purposes of determining (with a degree of certainty), given the history of printed symbols: How long before the next symbol is printed by the machine. The most likely next symbol to be generated by the machine.
