If you're going to be redirecting users to the registration page, I'd strongly consider using something like logintoboggan to make the registration > node-creation process smooth. Otherwise, registration is a multi-step process and I'd imagine it being easy for users to lose their way back to the Add a Plan form in the process. For the "show links or show the form" direction, there are at least two ways of approaching that: 1) create a custom page where you "import" the add_plan form (or show the links). 2) modify the node/add/plan page itself, either through themeing or the fapi (the forms api). Here's a promising looking post for the first method: http://drupal.org/node/357895 . Here's a place to start with FAPI http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--topics--forms_api.html/6 Here's a post about theming the node form: http://11heavens.com/theming-the-node-form-in-Drupal-6 Without having tried this, I'd probably lean toward method one. Update : just had another thought: you could also add the plan form to the registration form so they'd fill them out in one shot. I'm not sure of how to do that in general, but the node profile would work if they're only ever going to make one plan, and if not, you can look at how that's put together.
