MySQL data modeling: Multiple user types / Activity / Following

I have a project in which there is a site with multiple user types. And I am having trouble wrapping my head around the best practice for this. I want to be able to get activity from (nodes) you follow regardless of node type. Pretend the node types are: User: Organization: An organization will be an entity that can act as a user. Write comments, send messages. But an organization is made up of users who can edit the orgs information. Organizations can also follow, and be followed. A) Should Users and Organizations be separate tables? B) Generally speaking how should this be stored. C) If they are in fact 2 tables, how does a join work when getting activity from those you follow?
