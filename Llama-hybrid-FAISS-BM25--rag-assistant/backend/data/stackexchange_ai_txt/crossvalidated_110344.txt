Intervention With Differencing

When conducting an intervention analysis with time series data (aka Interrupted Time series) as discussed here for example one requirement I have is to estimate the total gain (or loss) due to the intervention - i.e. number of units gained or lost (the Y variable). Not entirely understanding how to estimate the intervention function using a filter function within R, I went about it in a brute force manner, hoping this is general enough to work in any situation. Lets say that given the data cds we decide that the best fitting model is as follows, with the intervention function as $m_t= \frac{\omega_0}{(1-\delta B)}X_t$ where $X_t$ is a pulse at October 2013. fit4 I have two questions: 1) Even though we have differenced the ARIMA errors , to assess the intervention function which was then technically fit using the differenced series $\bigtriangledown X_t $ is there anything we need to do in order to "change back" the estimate of $\omega_0$ or $\delta$ from using $\bigtriangledown X_t $ to $ X_t $? 2) Is this correct: In order to determine the gain of the intervention, I constructed the intervention $m_t$ from the parameters. Once I have $m_t$ then I compare the fitted values from the model fit4 (exp() to reverse the log) to exp( fitted values minus $m_t$ ) and determine that over the observed period, the intervention resulted in 3342.37 extra units. Is this process the correct one to determine the gain generally from an intervention analysis? int_vect1 1) { mt[i]
