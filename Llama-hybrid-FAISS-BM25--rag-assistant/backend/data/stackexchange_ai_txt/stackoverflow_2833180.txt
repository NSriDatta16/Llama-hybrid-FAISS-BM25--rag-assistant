I would say it is worth having properties like this if you are dealing with expensive data retrieval e.g. database queries. However, there is a flaw in your code. SomeIntsExist will only ever really give you the correct answer if the property has been accessed beforehand, if the property is lazy loaded then there may indeed be integers but they just haven't been loaded yet. It should be renamed to something like IsInitialised . I know it's an example but it's probably still worth pointing out :)
