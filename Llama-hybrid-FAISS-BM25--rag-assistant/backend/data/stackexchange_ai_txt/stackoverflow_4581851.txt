When you use quotation to create a literal list, the quotation extends down to inhibit evaluation of all the members of the list. You can see how username got upcased by the time it got printed out, which is the default for reading symbols. You have to build up the list structure using LIST and CONS forms as necessary, or use the backquote which allows you to selectively evaluate pieces, i.e. (list (cons "username" username) (cons "password" password)) or `(("username" . ,username) ("password" . ,password))
