To speed up, don't use Select *. Try also Left Join instead on Join (only if produce the same result) Choose the one that is faster on your production server (depending on the data volume, index fragmentation and index selectivity the query optimizer can choose a different plan on production compared with the test server). When you test don't forget to empty the cache between runs. Test on real amount of data because the plan can change in time. In real life ( if is fast enough ) I will go always for the second solution because is more readable and maintainable.
