"It depends" In this case, char(4) captures the data stored correctly with no storage overhead (4 bytes each). And 0001 is not the same as 1 of course. You do have some overhead for processing collation etc if you have non-numeric digits, but it shouldn't matter for reasonably sized databases. And with a 4 digit code you do have an upper bound for number of rows especially if numeric (10k). If your new codes are not strictly increasing, then you get the page split issue associated with GUID clustered keys If they are strictly increasing, then use int and add a computed column to add leading zeros
