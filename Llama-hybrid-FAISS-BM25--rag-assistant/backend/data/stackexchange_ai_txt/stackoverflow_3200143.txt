Well, I don't have enough rep to comment on mangst's solution, but wanted to add that with your usage of the words elegant and efficient, this seemed like a prime opportunity for some design patterns. What mangst has described is an implementation of the Observer pattern ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_design_pattern ). I would, however, suggest having a collection of objects implementing the interface as suggested by mangst. This way, upon a given update you are able to iterate through many observers to perform some action in each, whether that is changing data, presentation, etc. Should multiple windows ever need to receive the data/action from your child window it's simple to just add another to the list of Observers you already have. There is also the Mediator pattern ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern ) which could accomplish similar results. There are a lot of cookie cutter approaches for very common computing problems, and by familiarizing yourself with the lexicon, you can easily implement tried and true approaches.
