Drag WPF Popup control

the WPF Popup control is nice, but somewhat limited in my opinion. is there a way to "drag" a popup around when it is opened (like with the DragMove() method of windows)? can this be done without big problems or do i have to write a substitute for the popup class myself? thanks
