The CSS for the cursor was higher up: #hplogo.drag-active #verne-drag, #hplogo.drag-active #verne-drag * { cursor:move !important; cursor:none !important; } Not many browsers support the none though and the multiple !importants doesn't work - in Chrome and IE I see the default pointer when I drag. cursor: none works in Firefox 3.
