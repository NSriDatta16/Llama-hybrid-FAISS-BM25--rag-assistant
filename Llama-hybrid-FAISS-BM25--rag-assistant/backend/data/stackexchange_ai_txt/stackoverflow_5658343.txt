Not knowing the size of your project, storing multiple ID's in one column is usually discouraged because of the processing power required to filter by each ID. I would suggest creating a table called "MessageReceivers" or something like that. It would contain the messageID and a userID for the person receiving the message. You would create one row per recipient. Then with indexes, you can quickly grab all the messages for that user with a simple join.
