Joint evolution using VAR model and pairwise correlation plot in R

I have data for three commodities for which I conducted a time series analysis using VARselect and VAR functions in "vars" package in R. How do I describe their joint evolution using the VAR model? Also, I know how to generate scatter plots for pairwise correlation but would like to know how to create pair-wise correlation plots using a three-month window for the data?
