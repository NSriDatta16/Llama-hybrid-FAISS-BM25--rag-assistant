Although not required, it is extremely common to use some approximation scheme once you start working with larger problems. If you are thinking of value-based model-free RL, a typical problem is that the state-space if huge. Using some approximation scheme is necessary not only to store but also useful if you can generalise and take advantage some structure in your data. It is then any function approximation method (regression, neural networks, etc.) can be beneficial. For model-based approaches something different happens. You need to build up a model of the environment based on data. Using sampled data, you try to approximate your transition and reward functions so you can later use planning methods. Again, supervised learning is applicable.
