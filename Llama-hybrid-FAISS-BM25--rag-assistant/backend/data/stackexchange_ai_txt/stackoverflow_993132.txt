I' not sure about this, but AFAIK you could get thrown a kind of "Concurent Modification Exception" if you have code, iterating over the "fullMap". This must not be in your code, but could happen in the library routines for SoftMap. This might lead to your code breaking at runtime every now and then for no obvious reason, and without a good way for you handle the situation. Just a complicated way of saying: "if in doubt, be carefull". BTW: don't think about performance first with todays computers. Happy Hacking Huibert Gill
