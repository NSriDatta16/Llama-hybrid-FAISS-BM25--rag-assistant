I tend to ask myself at what point is the data incorrect? Is is incorrect to say the TypeId is null (unknown, not assigned) when it should specifically be assigned '' (empty string)? In this case I would guess not, what is incorrect it the way the presentation displays "null", you want simply an empty textbox or some such thing. In this case its the presentations problem to convert the data to a view that is acceptable, thats its job. Hence your use of "coalescence" seems correct to me. Of course thats perhaps an overly strict interpretation and may not be as pragmatic as you would like. In the long run though (I mean over the code's lifetime) it usually best to keep things as correct as they can pratically be.
