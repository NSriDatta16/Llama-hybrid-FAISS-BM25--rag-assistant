TortoiseSVN offers a "copy and add these files here" feature, but as of SVN 1.5.5, this feature was not supported. I have not yet tested it with 1.6.0 right-drag (not a normal left-drag) your files from repo A into a directory within repo B and release the mouse. A menu will appear asking what you want to do. There are, I think, 4 options to choose from (other than the normal OS options). Choose the one that is most appropriate.
