If I have a table with thousands of rows added monthly, is this potentially a drag on resources? If so, what is the best way to partition this table, since the above is verboten? Of course it uses resources because you adding data/information to the database. It is not a bigger drag on resources than having it different tables -- it should be less -- since every table has the overhead associated with maintaining the table. Partition Issues I don't think of it as "partitioning" but it totally depends on your data and how you use the data. In any SQL system you can pre-index based on columns or combination of columns. When you pre-index you are basically "partitioning". So if you know you are going to be looking at data most of the time based on dates (eg month/year) then you add an index on the date field. From an abstract perspective this is partitioning your data on date. What indexes you create depends on how you are going to use the data -- the more you create the more time/space is used to maintain the index(s) but the faster the performance for statements that use the index.
