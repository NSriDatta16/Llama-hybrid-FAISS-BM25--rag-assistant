If you assume the process is completely linear, with no stops, then you can write down a system of equations and solve it. Suppose the linear equation for the hour is $y = mx + b$ where $y$ is the readout, $x \in [0,1]$ is the fraction of the way through the hour, and $b$ is the readout at the beginning of the hour. Suppose it resets at time $t$. We now have three unknowns--$m$, $b$, and $t$--and three algebraically independent variables that are functions of these unknowns--maximum, average, and standard deviation. (Variance is the square of standard deviation so it's not independent of the other three.) Explicitly, your equations are: $$\mathrm{maximum} = mt + b$$ $$\mathrm{average} = E(y) = \int_0^t mx + b\, dx + \int_t^1 mx\,dx$$ $$\mathrm{variance} = E(y^2) - E(y)^2 = \int_0^t (mx + b)^2\, dx + \int_t^1 (mx)^2\,dx - (\mathrm{average})^2$$ Hopefully you can solve these for $m,x,b$ relatively easily. The wrinkle comes in when your trend is not completely linear, in which case this solution is only approximate. If you have an explicit model for how it deviates from linearity, you could try to solve that model, although it might get annoying. Another approach is to take your data (you said you had some sample data but it didn't include any resets), modify it by inserting fake resets at random points, and see how close the approximate solution above is to the true solution. If it's close enough, you can use it, and if it's not, then you should look for another solution, like using the numbers from the next period like I described above.
