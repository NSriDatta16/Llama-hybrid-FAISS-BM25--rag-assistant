No, it is not. In fact, §7.1.6.​4/3 gives the following example: auto x = 5; // OK: x has type int const auto *v = &x, u = 6; // OK: v has type const int*, u has type const int static auto y = 0.0; // OK: y has type double auto int r; // error: auto is not a storage-class-specifier As you can see, it results in an error. §7.1.6.​5 pretty much seals the deal with: A program that uses auto in a context not explicitly allowed in this section is ill-formed.
