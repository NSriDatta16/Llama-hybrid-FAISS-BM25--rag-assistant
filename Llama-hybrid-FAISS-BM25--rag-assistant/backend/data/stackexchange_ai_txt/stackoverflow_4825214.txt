Optimal use of BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize for speed

Thanks to Schermvlieger for asking this question on anddev.org , I'm just copying his question to SO as nobody replied on the other site and I'm also facing the same problem. I was wondering what would be the optimal use of BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize with regards to speed of displaying the image. The documentation mentions using values that are a power of 2, so I am working with 2, 4, 8, 16 etc. The things I am wondering about are: Should I resample down to the smallest size that is still larger than the screen resolution, or should I sample down to the size just enough to avoid an OutOfMemoryError ? How would one calculate the maximum size of an image that could still be displayed without running out of memory? Does the color-depth of the image play a role as well, and the depth of the display? Is it efficient to display images via two mechanisms ( BitmapFactory for large files, setImageURI() for smaller ones) I am using an ImageSwitcher by the way. Would it help creating the Bitmap , BitmapFactory.Options and inTempStorage in the beginning of the application or creating them only on the fly, when needed?
