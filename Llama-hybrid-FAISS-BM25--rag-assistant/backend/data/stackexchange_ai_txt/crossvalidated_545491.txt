Regression stats question

I am currently focusing on developing a way to predict the onset of sexual maturity in lake sturgeon by using the elemental composition in the fin ray. Lake sturgeon spawn later in life (females around age 15-25 and males age 12-20). I have run Wilcoxon signed ranked tests on elemental levels before/after age 20 in females and before/after age 15 in males (Table 1.) and have found that most divalent ion levels are significantly higher after age 20 or 15. I believe that these ions are being taken up at a greater rate (after onset of sexual maturity) because they are being used in development of gametes (and therefore are needed more) or because they are replacing calcium at a higher rate because Ca is being used for gametes (or a mixture of the two). I have attached a plot that shows Mg, Mn, and Ba across the fin ray of a female lake sturgeon. The dotted line is age 20 and the blue dots are where I believe she became sexually mature. Is there a way to run some type of regression to indicate/prove that is when those elements began to increase? I would appreciate any suggestions or advice that you have.
