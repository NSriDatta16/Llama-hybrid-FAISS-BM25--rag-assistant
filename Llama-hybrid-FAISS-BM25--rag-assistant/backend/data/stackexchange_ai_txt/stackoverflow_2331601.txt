Unusual high cpu utilization in ntkrnlpa:FsRtlAreNamesEqual and ntkrnlpa:RtlUpcaseUnicodeString

I am profiling a networking workload application on Windows XP. The VTune profiling result shows unusual high utilization on ntkrnlpa:FsRtlAreNamesEqual and ntkrnlpa:RtlUpcaseUnicodeString functions. From the module level, the workload spends 73% cpu time in ntkrnlpa.exe. In ntkrnlpa.exe module, 42% time is spent in FsRtlAreNamesEqual function and 36% time is spent in RtlUpcaseUnicodeString function. Apparently these two functions are kernel functions, so they must be triggered by some system call or device driver activites. Please help me identify the possible cause of the high utilization of these functions, thanks!
