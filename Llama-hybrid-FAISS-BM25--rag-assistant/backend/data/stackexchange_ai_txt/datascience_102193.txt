Having issues with DataSet

I just started learning data science and am having a problem when generating a dataset. Dataset: covid_data=pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Test\OneDrive\Desktop\Project_test\data.csv") For some reason when I try to create a new dataset it creates an additional column "cases)" and adds NaN values automatically. It happens randomly, it works for a while and when I restarted my jupyter notebook then it happened again. Any idea how to prevent this issue? I obtain the dataset from https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/nationalcasedeath_eueea_daily_ei/csv/data.csv Screenshot of the data.csv file:
