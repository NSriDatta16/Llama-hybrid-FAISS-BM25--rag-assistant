Using straightforward quadrature sum, the standard deviation (error) for the average, $\bar{x}$ , of your 10, 12, 7, and 8 would be \begin{equation} \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{0.8^2 + 1.2^2 + 0.5^2 + 1.5^2}, \end{equation} so the result is $\bar{x} \pm \sigma_{\bar{x}}$ . Calculating this out, the result is (7.1,11.4). Another approach for propagation, called weighted means, would suggest that the weights are the inverse squares of the corresponding uncertainties, $w_j=1/\sigma_j^2$ , and the best estimate, $x_{best}$ , is \begin{equation} x_{best} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^p w_jx_j}{\sum_{j=1}^p w_j}, \end{equation} and the overall uncertainty is \begin{equation} \sigma_{x,best} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^p w_j \right) ^{-1/2}. \end{equation} Upon substitution with results for $p=4$ measurements, we get \begin{align} x_{best} &= \frac{1.56*10 + 0.694*12 + 4*7 + 0.444*8}{1.56 + 0.694 + 4 + 0.444} \\ &= 8.28,\\ \end{align} and the uncertainty is \begin{align} \sigma_{x,best} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.56 + 0.694 + 4 + 0.444}}\\ &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6.7}}\\ &=0.386, \end{align} yielding a result of 8.3(7.9,8.7). For Monte Carlo simulation, since no distributional information is available, I would employ triangle ("lack-of-knowledge") distributions (5000 realizations, zero correlation). The resulting mean $y$ is normally distributed, and the sigma (0.217) is smaller leading to (9,9.5), while normal distributions resulted in (8.7,9.8), where sigma was 0.531. Below are the histograms for the triangle distribution and the normally-distributed mean distribution (Shapiro-Wilk $P$ =0.2382).
