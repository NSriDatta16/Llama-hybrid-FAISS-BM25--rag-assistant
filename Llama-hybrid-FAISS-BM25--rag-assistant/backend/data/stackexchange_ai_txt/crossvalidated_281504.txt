Is there a relationship between serial dependence and the distribution of time series data?

Two well-documented "empirical regularities" of asset return series are Serial dependence: (i) Linear autocorrelation in $x$ (up to 20 minutes); (ii) Autocorrelation of non-linear functions of the series (e.g., $x^2$, $|x|$, $\cos(x)$; up to several weeks) Non-gaussianity: (i) Leptokurtosis; (ii) Positive skewness. A possible reference is Cont (2000) . I can see how (1.) (especially for $x^2$) can be evidence of volatility clustering, which makes the series non-stationary, but would this impact Gaussianity of the series across the entire sample? Are extreme values somehow made more likely by property (1.)? Is there a plausible mechanism that relates (1.) and (2.) or are they two distinct statistical features of the data?
