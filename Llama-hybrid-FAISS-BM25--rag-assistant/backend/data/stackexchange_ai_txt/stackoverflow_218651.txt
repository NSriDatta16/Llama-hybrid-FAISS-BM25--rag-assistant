Because of "Program to an 'interface', not an 'implementation'." (Gang of Four 1995:18) ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Introduction.2C_Chapter_1 ), some people prefer to declare instance variables at the bottom of the class. the theory being that the user of a class is more interested in what they can do with the class(methods) as opposed to how something is done(variables). Placing the methods at the top of the class exposes them first to the user when they look at the code.
