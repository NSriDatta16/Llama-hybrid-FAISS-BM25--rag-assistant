Stack allocations are cheaper than heap allocations. Allocation and deallocation from stack is just simple counter increments and decrements on function (or to be more exact: scope) entry/exit. Heap allocations means finding a large enough memory block in a possibly fragmented address space. Because of that stack allocations are almost always preferable. The main reasons for not using the stack are: The size needed is not known until runtime. A lot of memory (Megabytes) is needed; which can cause problems on systems where stack sizes typically are limited to two-digit numbers of Megabytes.
