mysql_real_escape_string is used to escape characters in the string to add backslashes to characters such as ' , which prevents an attacker from embedding additional SQL statements into the string. If the string is not escaped, additional SQL can be appended. For example, something along the lines of this might be executed: SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ' test' ; DELETE * FROM tbl ; SELECT 'owned ' magic_quotes does escaping of its own, although if I remember correctly its use is now discouraged. Besides, the MySQL function will do all the escaping you need to prevent SQL injection attacks.
