If you have data with a good score system, I would start with something simple, because using a neural network like Bert might be complex to set up. Something simple is to take the scores and build a phrase with meaning, for instance: "solar panel" + "rooftop" + "environment-friendly" = "Rooftop solar panel, with a low environmental impact (less than 8g of carbon/year)". You can achieve this using if/then rules and some basic equations if there is numerical values. For example, 0.2 for the environmental impact would be something like (1-0.2)*10 = 8g. Then you can improve results with a neural network like Bert, but you would need enough data to train it, using different inputs ("0.2,0.6,0.1") and their associated outputs (-> "Rooftop solar panel, with a low environmental impact (less than 8g of carbon/year)") and this train data should be representative enough of most common use cases.
