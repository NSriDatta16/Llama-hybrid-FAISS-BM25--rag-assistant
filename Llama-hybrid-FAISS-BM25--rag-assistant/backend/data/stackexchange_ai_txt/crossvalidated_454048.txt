Predicting house prices with machine learning. Problem with time-varying variables

I'm currently trying to cross-sectionally predict house prices using statistical learning methods. I have collected prices from 2009 until 2020. I have loads of time-invariant variables on the individual houses such as distance to the sea, number of rooms, etc. It is, however, also known that macroeconomic factors affect prices, why I would like to include variables such as unemployment, where if the house is sold in, lets say, 2012 I then write the unemployment for that year. I am having a hard time figuring out if this makes sense? This is first and foremost a cross-sectional study, so can I also include variables where the variation is in the time-series dimension?
