Okay, this is probably not an ideal solution, but something you could consider: if you set your value transformers from your code (and not in IB), you could instantiate 3 different transformers of the same class. You could give your value transformer an ivar NSString *unit (and add something like [[MyValueTransformer alloc] initWithUnit:] ) to allow each to return their own string, but you still have to write the value transformer's code only once. (Also, if you're ever going to consider making your application localizable, simply appending an "s" to create the plurals is not going to work. You could of course add ivars for both NSString *singular and NSString *plural to do that.) Edit: Wait, I just realized you can register value transformers! If you register them as MyValueTransformerHours and MyValueTransformerMinutes (by manually alloc ating and init ializing them in your code), you can use them from Interface Builder.
