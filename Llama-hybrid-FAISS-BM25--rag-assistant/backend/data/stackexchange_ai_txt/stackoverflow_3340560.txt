All databases require non-volatile storage to ensure durability. The memory image does not provide a durable storage medium. Very shortly after you loose power your memory image becomes invalid. Likewise, as soon as the database process terminates, the operating system will release the memory containing the in-memory image. In either case, you loose your database contents. Until any changes have been written to non-volatile memory, they are not truely durable. This may consist of either writing all the data changes to disk, or writing a journal of the change being done. In space or size critical instances non-volatile memory such as flash could be substituted for a HDD. However, flash is reported to have issues with the number of write cycles that can be written. Having reviewed your previous post, multi-server replication would work as long as you can keep that last server running. As soon as it goes down, you loose your queue. However, there are a number of alternatives to Oracle which could be considered. PDAs often use battery backed up memory to store their databases. These databases are non-durable once the battery runs down. Backups are important.
