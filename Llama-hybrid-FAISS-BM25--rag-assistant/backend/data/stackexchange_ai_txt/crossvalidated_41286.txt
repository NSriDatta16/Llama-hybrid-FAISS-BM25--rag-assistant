Model for predicting number of Youtube views of Gangnam Style

PSY's music video "Gangnam style" is popular, after a little more than 2 months it has about 540 million viewers. I learned this from my preteen children at dinner last week and soon the discussion went in the direction of if it was possible to do some kind of prediction of how many viewers there will be in 10-12 days and when(/if) the song will pass 800 million viewers or 1 billion viewers. Here is the picture from number of viewers since it was posted: Here are the picture from number of viewers of the No1 "Justin Biever-Baby"and No2 "Eminem - Love the way you lie" music videos that both have been around for a much longer time My first attempt to reason about the model was that is should be a S-curve but this doesn't seem to fit the the No1 and No2 songs and also doesn't fit that there are no limit on how many views that the music video can have, only a slower growth. So my question is: what kind of model should I use to predict number of viewers of the music video?
