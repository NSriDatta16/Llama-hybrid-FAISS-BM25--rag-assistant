I don't know if this is the most elegant way to do it, but your grading program could use reflection to load the student class and look for methods with a given name - if it doesn't have such a method, you can deduct whatever points you want. If the method does exist, then you can invoke it using reflection as well, passing in whatever parameters you like. Sun has a pretty decent tutorial trail here: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/reflect/member/index.html See the section on obtaining method information and invoking methods. Marked community - others please feel free to provide corrections, etc.
