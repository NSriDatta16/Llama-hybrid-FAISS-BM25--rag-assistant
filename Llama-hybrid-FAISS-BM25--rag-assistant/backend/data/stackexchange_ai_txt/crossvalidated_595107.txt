The third statement is wrong. In a random forest, the bias of a random forest is approximately equal to the bias of any of the individual sampled trees that constitute the forest (but not any large unpruned tree using all the covariates available trained outside the forest, such a tree can indeed have lower bias than the RF). Please see the thread here at: Why does a bagged tree / random forest tree have higher bias than a single decision tree? for more details.
