How to specify Extended Permissions in the JS SDK Auth request

UPDATED TO BE MORE CLEAR (hopefully :)): Related to this page, specifically the SSO section: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ You've got the option Facebook says to use either that facebook connect button (whatever connect means nowdays with Facebook is a grey fog to me now) or just roll your own image as a button and on click call FB.Login(). So I tried the facebook button route which lead me to a complete brick wall. I mean I can get it working, auth, login, all that but I have no clue how to pass extended permissions through this entire process with the button: window.fbAsyncInit = function () { FB.init({ appId: facebookApplicationID, status: true, cookie: true, xfbml: true }); FB.Event.subscribe('auth.sessionChange', function (response) { ...rest of code Ok, how do I attach extended permissions to this call? Of course you can do it easily if using Login() but why doesn't facebook show any examples or state whether the perms parameter exists in terms of placing it somewhere in this process of using that button! related links: http://forum.developers.facebook.com/viewtopic.php?pid=248096#p248096 I don't even know why they have that button in here when it looks to me like most everyone is just simply calling Login() inside the Init. I assume then calling Login() still manages the SSO in terms of cookie, etc.? Is anyone using this button or are you just going with FB.Login() ? I'm running this in an iframe on our own hosted website...not embedding code into the facebook site itself (which I believe is called canvas right?).
