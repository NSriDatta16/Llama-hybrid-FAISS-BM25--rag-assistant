You need to build your libraries as universal static libraries. The process varies from library to library but it generally goes something like this. build the library as a static lib for the different platforms (armv6 and i386 at the least) use lipo to create a universal library from the individual static libraries built above drag and drop the universal lib into your xcode project drag and drop the header files into your xcode project Step 1 is generally the trickiest since many libraries have different build procedures. It is usually done by setting the proper compiler flags to use the iphone sdk instead of the system wide compiler.
