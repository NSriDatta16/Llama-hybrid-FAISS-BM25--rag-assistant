Audio/MIDI C++ library for a real-time application

As I've already said in another thread , I'm working on a project related to real-time graphical programming for audio (something like Pure Data, Max/MSP, Reaktor). I did a day of research on Internet, looking for a good (maintained, well documented and highly portable) C++ library for low level interaction with audio and MIDI, but I still can not make up my mind about a library. I'm considering PortAudio + PortMIDI (PortMedia), but they lack of documentation (especially PortMIDI) and there is no official community, just a mail list (and I think forum communities are very important!), same (or worst) situation with RTAudio and RTMidi libraries. I also give a try to: STK , I dodn't like its file organization. Juce , I think it does too much for me, I need only an easy hardware integration OpenAL , I didn't understand its architecture, it relies on ASIO/ALSA/CoreAudio...? Can I access to MIDI port? So... My question is: have you any experience with real-time audio/MIDI? Which library do you recommend me? Thanks
