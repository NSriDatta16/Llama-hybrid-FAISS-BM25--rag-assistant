Here is a simple solution that you can compute yourself. It is trivial to solve your equation for $γ$ as a function of the other values. We get $$ γ = \sqrt{(\biggr( \frac{C}{v(ω)} \biggl) ^2 - {(ω^2-ω_0^2)^2}) / {ω^2}} $$ It is almost true that you can substitute in your values and get several estimates for $γ$ , which you can simply average to get a good estimate. I say almost true because as $ω$ approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator go to zero, so the calculation becomes unstable. As long as you stay away from $ω=0$ , this should give good results. @Esmailian provided some nice data in his answer. Using his data I get the following estimates of $γ$ . 6.012568 5.999664 5.994524 5.991173 6.009153 5.996748 6.019433 5.998072 6.001754 5.993656 6.002409 5.985938 5.996226 5.998363 6.474674 6.525602 14.140690 5.999124 6.000368 5.998427 Three of his $ω$ 's are less than 1. These are the ones that give the estimates of $γ$ 6.474674 6.525602 14.140690 The mean of the remaining estimates is 5.999859. As long as you have enough $ω$ 's that are not near zero, this should provide a good estimate of $γ$ .
