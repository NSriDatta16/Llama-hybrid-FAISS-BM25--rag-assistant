For our own application, we do drag and drop for FireFox only. We revert to the traditional iframe upload for others. In order to detect that drag and drop is supported, we run this code: if (typeof(window.File) == 'object' && typeof(window.FileReader) == 'function' && typeof(window.FileList) == 'object') { // DnD is supported! } Hope this is helpful to some.
