Is a disk drive considered a database?

Is it a "legit" programming practice to consider directory structure as a database? A hierarchical database. User has access to the database through Windows explorer. Would it be reasonable to tell a user that he should "give" data to the program by organizing his folders in "x" fashion? Are there examples of software that do this effectively or particularly well? Is this a bad idea?
