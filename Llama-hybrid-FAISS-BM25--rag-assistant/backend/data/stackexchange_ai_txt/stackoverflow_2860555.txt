What makes sense to you and your team? What folder the code is in means nothing ( besides minor namespace generation ) and can be easily changed by dragging and dropping. Right now organization barely matters, you have so little files its easy to browse around the slution. Once your 6 months in and you have 1000s of files thats when you'll need to start thinking about organisation. With my own personal projects I dump everything into a single project, at work I have a 17 project solution and 50 folders. Code is code.
