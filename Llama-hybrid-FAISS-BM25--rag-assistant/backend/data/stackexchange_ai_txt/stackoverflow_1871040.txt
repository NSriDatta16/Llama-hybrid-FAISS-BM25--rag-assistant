AS3 is as previously mentioned, faster, thanks to the AVM2 it runs on. AS3 requires less hacks. Remember being forced to use delegates in AS2 to overcome scoping issues? AS3 is object orientated. This makes coding more clean and therefore improves efficiancy. AS3 has bigger libraries AS3 has improved compile time error checking AS3 gives you greater control over sound AS3 improves any 3D (due to the various engines which are only possible due to the speed increases) Subjectively AS2 was painful to work on. It required many hacks, errors were hard to track down, the langauge lacked any elegance, it was slow, and its design taught people how to write hack code.
