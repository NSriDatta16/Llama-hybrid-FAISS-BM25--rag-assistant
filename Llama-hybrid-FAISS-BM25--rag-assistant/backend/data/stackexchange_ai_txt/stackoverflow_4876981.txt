multiple image preloader in javascript, code needs reordering...help

I came across a tutorial to load an image into the cache then on completion redirect to another page. I would like to do this with an array of images then when they are all loaded redirect to a new page. It mentions this in the tutorial as well but not in completion. I have tried reorganizing this code to do it but as I am a complete javascript noob I cannot combine the two and get it to work. Here is the website http://www.techrepublic.com/article/preloading-and-the-javascript-image-object/5214317 If someone could post the code up I would be very thankful. Also I reckon a lot of people would find it useful to use it as a preloader for sites with large background images. Cheers UPDATE Thanks Luke, I tried the code below, but still no joy unfortunately.....any ideas??? function preloader() { var loadedCount = 0; var myImagesToPreload = ["images/threewheelerback.jpg", "images/grunge.png", "images/smalllogo2.jpg"]; function loaded() { loadedCount++; if (loadedCount == myImagesToPreload) { location.href="history.html"; } } function preloader() { for(i=0, imageObj; i Untitled Document Loading....
