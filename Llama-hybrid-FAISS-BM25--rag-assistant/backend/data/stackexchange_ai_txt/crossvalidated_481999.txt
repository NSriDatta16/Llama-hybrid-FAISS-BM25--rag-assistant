Which Nonparametric Model to use for Small Time Series?

I have the following data: Date Accumulated 1 2016-10-01 6902000 2 2016-11-01 9033000 3 2017-06-01 15033000 4 2017-11-01 24033000 5 2019-05-01 24533000 6 2019-08-01 25033000 7 2019-11-01 27533000 8 2020-06-01 29033000 After reading some papers and other information, I managed to fill in the missing months with a linear interpolation in R. To produce these final data with a total of 45 observations, I used the following code: for(i in 1:length(df $Date)) { df[i,1] Date, df $Accumulated) d Date), max(df$Date), by = "month") df My main interest is forecasting. I tried using ARIMA models with auto.arima() but it seems this is not the most appropriate choice, since the observations do not follow a stochastic process (actually, the observations correspond to an already-established business schedule, but it almost always presents delays), and ARIMA makes assumptions about the underlying population distribution and the sample size, as most parametric models. Because of this, I'm trying to find a nonparametric model instead that could be useful in this situation. I was thinking about Exponential Smoothing (specifically Holt-Winters) since it is considered nonparametric, but I cannot find any information on the internet/literature on whether this is appropriate or not. Probably the best alternatives would be something like decision tree regressions, support vector regressions, or other machine learning nonparametric models. But there are two problems here: 1) I'm technically dealing with time series, and 2) I have a really, really small sample. From what I've seen, for most nonparametric models to work properly, they require lots of observations, when I only have 45. What do you think I could do? I must note that I'm not interested in just fitting a curve. I would like to use a rigorous nonparametric time series model if possible. Also, it needs to be a naive forecasting method/model, since I'm only interested in using the lagged values of my "dependent" variable to explain future values in "Accumulated". Maybe I could transform the data and use "Date" in other formats as the independent variable... What do you guys think? Thank you so much.
