How to test a hypothesis about the mean based on an assumed normal distribution?

The entrance onto a major bridge in New York City was engineered to accommodate an average of $3800$ vehicles per hour. However, a random sample of nine observations gives an average of $4045.9$ vehicles per hour with a standard deviation of $201.3$ vehicles. Use a $5\%$ significance level to test the claim that the true average number of vehicles per hour is more than $3800$. Assume that the number of vehicles per hour is normally distributed. I'm not sure on how to start. Can you please help?
