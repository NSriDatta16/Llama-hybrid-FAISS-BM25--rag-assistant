Questions 1-2, 4: in frequentist analysis, the true mean is not a random variable, thus thes probabilities are not defined, whereas in Bayesian analysis the probabilities would depend on the prior. Question 3: For example, consider a case where we know for sure It would still be possible to get these results, but rather unreasonable to say that the null hypothesis is 'unlikely' to be true. We obtained data that is unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true, but this does not imply that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. Question 5: This is a bit questionable as this depends on the definition of "we can be p % confident." If we define the statement to mean the thing that is inferred from p % confidence intervals, the statement is by definition correct. The typical pro-Bayesian argument states that people tend to interpret these statements intuitively to mean "the probability is p %", which would be false (compare answers to 1-2,4). Question 6: Your explanation "it implies that the true mean is changing from experiment to experiment" is exactly correct. The article was recently discussed in Andrew Gelman's blog ( http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/15/problematic-interpretations-confidence-intervals/ ). For example, the issue regarding the interpretation of the statement in question 5 is discussed in the comments.
