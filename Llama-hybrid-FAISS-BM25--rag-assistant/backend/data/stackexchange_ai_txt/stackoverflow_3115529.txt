How do I capture images in OpenCV and saving in pgm format?

I am brand new to programming in general, and am working on a project for which I need to capture images from my webcam (possibly using OpenCV), and save the images as pgm files. What's the simplest way to do this? Willow Garage provides this code for image capturing: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/CameraCapture Using this code as a base, how might I modify it to: capture an image from the live cam every 2 seconds save the images to a folder in pgm format Thanks so much for any help you can provide!
