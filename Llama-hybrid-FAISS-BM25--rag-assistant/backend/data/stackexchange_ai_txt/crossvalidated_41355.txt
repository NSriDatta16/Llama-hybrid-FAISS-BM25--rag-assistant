I think you need to separate phenomena like Gangnam Style, which owes much of it's views to being a meme/viral thing, from Justin Bieber and Eminem, who are big artists in their own right and who also would spread widely in a traditional setting - JB or Eminem would sell a lot of singles too, I'm not sure that PSY would.
