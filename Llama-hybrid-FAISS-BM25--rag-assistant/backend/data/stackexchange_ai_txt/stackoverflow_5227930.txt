Are there any FOSS libraries that are the result of ripping bits out of Android for plain Java?

Before you jump, yes i have heard of the recent project to make Android proper run on a plain JRE. This question is not about Android the platform but rather about leveraging the great stuff thats in there, and may be useful in parts, eg the bitmap/graphics stuff. PS Yes lets ignore the obvious bits that dont make sense such as telephony etc.
