Obviously I have no idea about your dataset, but a learning rate of 0.9 seems exceptionally large for MLP. Whitening makes the data more Gaussian which MLP and GLM need (I have no experience on SVM). I have never tried whitening with X and Y together though, maybe you can try whitening on X and Y separately. Also, it seems you have both continuous and categorical variables, you might want to treat them differently. You normally won't be able to (and so shouldn't) fit another whitening procedure on your test data. Just record what you have done to in-sample X and in-sample Y, and transform the same on out-of-sample X, and the predicted values.
