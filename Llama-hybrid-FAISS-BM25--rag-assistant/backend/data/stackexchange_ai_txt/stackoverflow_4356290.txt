It look like that you want an ad-hoc reporting tool like this demo of i-net Clear Reports (used to be called i-net Crystal-Clear). With this tool you have the option to create completely reports where the user can only change minimal things like the filter. Or the user can create the reports self via drag & drop like you can see in the demo . You can define it in the layout template what the user can do.
