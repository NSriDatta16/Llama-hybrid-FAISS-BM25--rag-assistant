SVG get text element width

I'm working on some ECMAScript/JavaScript for an SVG file and need to get the width and height of a text element so I can resize a rectangle that surrounds it. In HTML I would be able to use the offsetWidth and offsetHeight attributes on the element but it appears that those properties are unavailable. Here's a fragment that I need to work with. I need to change the width of the rectangle whenever I change the text but I don't know how to get the actual width (in pixels) of the text element. Some Text Any ideas?
