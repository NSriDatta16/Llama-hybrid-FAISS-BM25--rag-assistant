Model averaging

We have the equation: $P(C|X)=\sum_{i}P(C|X,M_{i})P(M_{i}|X)$ I should technically be able to prove that it works even when the total number of models is 1, so I go from the right hand side of the equation $P(C|X,M_{1})P(M_{1}|X)=\frac{P(C,X,M_{1})P(X,M_{1})}{P(X,M_{1})P(X)}=P(C,M_{1}|X)$ But I should be able to get P(C|X). Am I missing something?
