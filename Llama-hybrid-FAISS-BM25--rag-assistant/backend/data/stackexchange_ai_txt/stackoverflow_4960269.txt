There are two possibilities: 1 - Open your xib-file inside Xcode. Show the right sidebar (Navigator | Utility). At the bottom of this bar should be all Interface Builder objects (i.e. UITabBarItem, UILabel, ...). Now drag a UITabBarItem to your View. If you don't see these objects: At the bottom is a small cube. press it and you'll see it. 2 - Right-click on your file and open in external editor. This opens Interface Builder. If it won't work you can open your file directly with the Interface Builder.
