// Set the cookie here, and then set the Can1Set variable to true document.CookieTest.CookieButton1 = "CookieButton1"; You aren't setting the cookie here. You are attempting to change the button element with the name CookieButton1 of the form with the name CookieTest to a String value "CookieButton1" . This would have shown a JavaScript error in the average webbrowser. To set a real cookie, you need document.cookie . You can find a little tutorial at w3schools .
