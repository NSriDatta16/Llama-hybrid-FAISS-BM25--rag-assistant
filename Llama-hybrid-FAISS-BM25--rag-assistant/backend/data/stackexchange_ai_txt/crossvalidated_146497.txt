Multiple Independent Variables, Multiple Dependent Variables and Time Series Data

I am conducting a research on stock market. My Independent variables are Oil prices, Exchange rate, Interest rate, GDP & Inflation. And Dependent variables are Market return, and Sector wise returns of eleven sectors (industries) i.e. energy sector, oil and gas sector etc. My research time period is Jan 2005 to Dec 2014, with monthly observations. So which model should I apply to analyze the outcome? Is there any model which needed to run just one time to analyze all the data?
