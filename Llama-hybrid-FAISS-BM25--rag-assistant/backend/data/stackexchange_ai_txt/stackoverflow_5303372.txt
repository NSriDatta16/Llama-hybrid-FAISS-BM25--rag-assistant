How would you normalize a histogram so the sum of each bin is 1?

How would you normalize a histogram A so the sum of each bin is 1 Dividing the histogram by the width of the bin, how do you draw it I have this dist = rand(50) average = mean(dist, 1); [c,x] = hist(average, 15); normalized = c/sum(c); bar(x, normalized, 1) In this case, n = 50 , What is it the formula to get values of mean and variance^2? We write N(mean, (variance^2) / 50) , but how? How do you plot both uniform distribution and normal distribution?. The histogram must be close to the normal distribution.
