Ok, here's what was going on: perl itself was a red herring entirely. The script was executing in a child shell which, when created, was re-loading rc files. Those rc files were blowing away the environment variables I had manually added during the parent shell with reference copies. I was able to demonstrate this with a simple csh script that just echoed just echoed the environment. De-wonkifying my rc files (which were overwrought with wonkitude) cleared up the mystical replacement. UPDATE: The test that proved this was a "test.sh" that had a simple "set" command. It proved that the sub-shell wasn't inheriting the parent environment correctly. Oddly, when I switched my parent interactive shell to ksh, the environment began inheriting correctly.
