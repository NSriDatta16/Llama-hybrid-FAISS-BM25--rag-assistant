sample size in r for random forest

For sample size, in r, samplesize = if replace, nrow(x) else ceiling(0.632*nrow(x)) What I know is random forest constructs a large number of trees with random bootstrap samples from the training data. But, in r, if we have a sample size of replacement, we use all the observations. Then, it's not random. Can you please explain what you mean by random bootstrap samples if "replace"?
