Gelman Hill textbook- question about linear transformation

I am currently attempting to work my way through Gelman and Hill's textbook on regression. I am stuck at the very first exercise. The text reads as follows: A test is graded from 0 to 50, with an average score of 35 and a standard deviation of 10. For comparison to other tests, it would be convenient to rescale to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. (a) How can the scores be linearly transformed to have this new mean and standard deviation? (b) There is another linear transformation that also rescales the scores to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. What is it, and why would you not want to use it for this purpose? I can answer question (a) by either using basic algebra and Y=a+bx to convert the scores directly to what is required. Alternatively, I suppose I could convert the data to Z scores and then transform them to the required values. Question (b) is where I am stuck. I think I might have two different ways to perform linear transformation, as noted above. But I can't for the life of me figure out why I would not want to use one of these methods.
