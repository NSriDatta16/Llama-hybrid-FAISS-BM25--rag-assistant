Cake requires a specific table layout for the automation to work. Rob explained how to get around it. But if you want to avoid writing the extra lines of code, you should consider organizing your tables accordingly. CREATE TABLE `cities` ( `id` int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL, `name` varchar(25) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) When you bake this model, Cake will automatically use name as the display name. This will apply to every table you create. In addition, if you use id for the table, it will automatically know how to reference it as a foreign key from other tables as city_id .
