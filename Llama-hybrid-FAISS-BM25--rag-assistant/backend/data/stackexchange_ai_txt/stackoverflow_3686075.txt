Run time - using apply functions

I have two apply functions excecuting the average and standard deviation across the first two dimensions on a large three dimentional array (437216,8,3). It takes 16 minutes to complete on Rx32. It's the first of many large arrays in a database we are applying this script on a regular basis. Any thoughts on how to speed up runtime?
