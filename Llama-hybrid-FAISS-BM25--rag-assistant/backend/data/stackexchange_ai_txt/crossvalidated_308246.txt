Logistic regression with small number of cases

The project I'm working on attempts to explain why an NGO is present (1=present,0=not present) in some countries (15) but not others. As I'm working with country-level data, my sample size is naturally limited to the number of existing countries (193). Moreover, many countries criminalize the existence of the NGO in question (meaning the non-existence of the NGO in those countries requires no explanation), which further reduces the sample size to around 60-70 countries. Will this be enough for conducting a logistic regression? There are around 10 predictor variables I'd like to test, but I'm not sure whether any of the predictions will be meaningful. If not logistic regression, what methodology, if any, can I use to demonstrate significant relationships (given my small N)? Thanks in advance!
