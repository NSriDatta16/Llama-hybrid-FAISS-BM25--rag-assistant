R - estimating probability from predictive model

I'm interested in finding out the probability distribution of a variable which I model based on a set of (normally distributed) predictors. First, assume a linear model (two variables for simplicity): $$Y \sim aX_1+bX_2$$ This means that $Y$ is also normally distributed. Now, I'm interested in calculating estimates for probabilities like $P(0 . I have the mean/std estimates for $X_1, X_2$ , along with $a,b$ from the model. So in theory, I can integrate the normal pdf with the appropriate coefficients to get these probabilities right? Here are my questions: Can I estimate such probabilities directly from a model object once it has been fitted in R? What if the relationship is nonlinear and I use something like xgboost to fit. Now there is no 'theoretical' distribution for $Y$ . Can I still calculate these probabilities? Again, can I get my answer directly from the fitted model somehow? Would be grateful for any pointers.
