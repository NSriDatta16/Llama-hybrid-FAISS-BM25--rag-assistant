A huge data storage problem

I'm starting to design a new application that will be used by about 50000 devices. Each device generates about 1440 registries a day, this means that will be stored over 72 million of registries per day. These registries keep coming every minute, and I must be able to query this data by a Java application (J2EE). So it need to be fast to write, fast to read and indexed to allow report generation. Devices only insert data and the J2EE application will need to read then occasionally. Now I'm looking to software alternatives to support this kind of operation. Putting this data on a single table would lead to a catastrophic condition, because I won't be able to use this data due to its amount of data stored over a year. I'm using Postgres, and database partitioning seems not to be a answer, since I'd need to partition tables by month, or may be more granular approach, days for example. I was thinking on a solution using SQLite. Each device would have its own SQLite database, than the information would be granular enough for good maintenance and fast insertions and queries. What do you think?
