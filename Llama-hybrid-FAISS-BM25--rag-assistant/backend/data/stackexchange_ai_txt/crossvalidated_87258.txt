Data organized into discrete categories or classes may present problems for certain analyses if the number of observations ($n$) belonging to each class is not constant across classes. Classes with unequal $n$ are unbalanced . This tag should be used for questions about datasets with subsamples of unequal size where imbalanced distributions across categorical factors is of concern. Analyses with known, non-negligible sensitivity to unbalanced classes include (but are not limited to): Student's $t$-test Analysis of variance (see also Howell, 2009 ) Some $\chi^2$ tests Tukey's range test and the Newmanâ€“Keuls method Analysis of differential item functioning using item response theory Reference Howell, D.
