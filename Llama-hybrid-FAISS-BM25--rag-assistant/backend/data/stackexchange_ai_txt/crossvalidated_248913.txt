@gung had a good answer. Logistic regression is a linear model, so it may not work well on non-linear cases. But as I mentioned in the comment, it might be some ways to transform data into another space, where logistic regression will be good again, but finding the basis expansion / feature transformation may be not trivial. Essentially, certain model will work well when the data satisfy the assumption of the model, e.g., if the decision boundary is linear, then logistic regression will work well. On the other hand, I would strongly recommend you to review bias variance trade off . In terms of model complexity, logistic regression has high bias and low variance. And random forest is opposite. Which means, in general, logistic regression will preform with "less accurate" but "more stable", and random forest is opposite.
