It appears that you are computing descriptive statistics on the observed data which is probably ( nearly definitely ! ) non-stationary. The overall mean of a time series is not descriptive in the classical sense as being the expected value. What comes to mind is the Phd orals question that goes like this .... "When is the mean of a series equal to it's expected value ?" . Please post your data and perhaps we can provide some inferential statistics.
