What is the best column for storing XML in an Oracle database?

I'm looking for the best way to store XMLs in a Oracle Database. Currently we use a BLOB type column but I'm pushing to move this column to a XMLType or an XMLType schema based column. I've just found this article XML: To CLOB or Object? from Oracle and read it but I haven't made up my mind yet. So has anybody experienced this same question before? Also the idea is that the XML will be fetched completely into a Flash client through a Red5 server, so what I'm looking for here is the best throughput. From what I see in the data they provide CLOB loads faster into the database but the XMLSchema based is faster for retrieval. Thanks, Joaqu√≠n.
