Why C++ does not move to a 'unversioned model' like HTML/HTML5?

First, i must say that i write this from the bottom of my dark, envious heart: After reading this: http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5 i wonder, what is up that C++ has become so fosilized that they will take 10 years to get a new standard. I mean, embedded/ancient platforms don't even notice when a new release of the C++ standard come up because guess what? they are constrained by the platform and compiler vendors, so they for the most part, won't be able to take advantage of the new features anyway. So all this weight dragging seems more self-immolation than desire or respect for backward compatibility and such and such
