How to find out the regions a classifier performs well in machine learning?

I need to find out the regions (could be more than 1) where a classifier performs well on training data. I need to somehow store those regions and for two or more classifiers find out the overlaps of regions of different classifiers. How can I implement this in R or any other libraries? The dataset will definitely be multidimensional.
