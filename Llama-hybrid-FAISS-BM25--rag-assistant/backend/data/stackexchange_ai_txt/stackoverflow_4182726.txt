getURL in RCurl problem behind firewall R

I'm behind hospital firewalls and usually have to use setInternet2(T) for R to access the net properly. However running my code (that works perfectly at home) results in curlPerform(curl = curl, .opts = opts, .encoding = .encoding) : Could not resolve host: www.cnn.com; Host not found Is it at all possible to work around this? regards, //M
