Amazon charges for EC2 instances by uptime, not CPU time. The cheapest Linux instance type costs 8.5c / hour, or about $37 / month. You can reduce this by either signing up for a reserved instance that you plan to run for an extended period, or by using a spot priced instance where you bid the price you're prepared to pay. You will also incur bandwidth charges for data transfer in and out of the EC2 network, and storage charges if you store any data permanently on AWS. These should be small compared with the cost of running the instance.
