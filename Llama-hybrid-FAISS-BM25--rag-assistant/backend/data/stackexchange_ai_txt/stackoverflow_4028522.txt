Naive pseudocode alogrithm: int minMatchLen = 3; // The minimum length of string match required string stringArray[] = {"person", "twolegperson", "animal", "animalgold"} for (i = 0; i This basically goes through each string in the array, extracts all possible substrings over a specified minimum length, and then search the strings in the remainder of the array for those substrings. I'm sure there are more elegant and efficient solutions, but this will get the job done. It'll probably be slow for a large array, though.
