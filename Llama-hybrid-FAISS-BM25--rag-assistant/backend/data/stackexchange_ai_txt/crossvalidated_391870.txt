Looking at the overall pattern you describe: yes this could be reasonable (or, it's not obviously unreasonable). Why? The starting position for MCMC can be arbitrarily chosen. So long as the chain is run to stationarity. Choosing a reasonable starting position will reduce compute time. You do have to look out for some problems though. In the case of a multimodal distribution, starting multiple chains at the same mode could fool you into believing you've sampled the whole space when you have not (but this is a special problem). Using the data to form a prior is a conceptually separate issue, which sometimes goes under the name of empirical Bayes. Empirical Bayes is neither wrong nor right. In my opinion it's often safe to extract some extremely general information from a dataset using empirical Bayes. E.g. extract the range of possible values |max - min| of the data in order to calibrate, say, a prior on the variance of some parameter - is it 10^1 or 10^6? But not, e.g. what was the value of unit $i$ at time $t$ ?
