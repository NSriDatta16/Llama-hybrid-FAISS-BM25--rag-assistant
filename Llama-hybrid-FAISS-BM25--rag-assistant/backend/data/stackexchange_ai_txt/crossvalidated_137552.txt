Features Vectors to build classifier to detect subjectivity

I am trying to build a classifier to detect subjectivity. I have text files tagged with subjective and objective . I am little lost with the concept of features creation from this data. I have found the lexicon of the subjective and objective tag. One thing that I can do is to create a feature of having words present in respective dictionary. Maybe the count of words present in subjective and objective dictionary. After that I intend to use naive bayes or SVM to develop the model My problem is as follow Is my approach correct ? Can I create more features ? If possible suggest some or point me to some paper or link Can I do some test like chi -sq etc to identify effective words from the dictionary ?
