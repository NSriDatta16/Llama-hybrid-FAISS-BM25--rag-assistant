Checkbox values and useBean tag

I'm a jstl newbie so probably this question will sound to you funny. Anyway, I have a model with a List as property and I'd like to fill this with a list of values (chosen from a list of checkboxes). I'm using the useBean tag in the form-processing jstl page, but doing this: Where the property priviledge is a List and $param.priviledge the values of a series of checkboxes, I get a javax.servlet.jsp.el.ELException: Attempt to convert String "ads" to type "[Ljava.lang.String;", but there is no PropertyEditor for that type "ads" is one of the values I have selected. I thought the values of the priviledge field was already a List but it seems it works in a different way. I tried to iterate through the $param.priviledge object and I get all the values with no problem. How can I use this list to fill a List? Thanks for any help. Roberto
