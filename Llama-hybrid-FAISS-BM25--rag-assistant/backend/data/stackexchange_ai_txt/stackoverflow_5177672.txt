Using Hypen (or dash) is OK I too is currently studying JavaScript, and as far as I read David Flanagan's book (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition) — I suggest you read it. It doesn't warn me anything about the use of hypen or dash (-) in IDs and Classes (even the Name attribute) in an HTML document. Just as what Parrots already said, hypens are not allowed in variables, because the JavaScript interpreter will treat it as a minus and/or a negative sign; but to use it on strings, is pretty much ok. Like what Parrots and Guffa said, you can use the following ... [ ] (square brackets) '' (single quotation marks or single quotes) "" (double quotation marks or double quotes) to tell the JavaScript interpreter that your are declaring strings (the id/class/name of your elements for instance) . Use Hyphen (or dash) — for 'Consistency' @KP, that would be ok if he is using HTML 4.1 or earlier, but if he is using any versions of XHTML (.e.g., XHTML 1.0), then that cannot be possible, because XHTML syntax prohibits uppercase (except the !DOCTYPE, which is the only thing that needs to declared in uppercase). @Choy, if you're using HTML 4.1 or earlier, going to either camelCase or PascalCase will not be a problem. Although, for consistency's sake as to how CSS use separators (it uses hypen or dash) , I suggest following its rule. It will be much more convinient for you to code your HTML and CSS alike. And moreoever, you don't even have to worry if you're using XHTML or HTML.
