Strange thing happened again, this time good. I had a backup DVD, from a few weeks ago, I copied the project back, now it's compiling fine again, seems to me the project somehow got corrupted, I did a C: drive defragmentation last week, could it somehow moved some files around and messed up a bit ? Anyhow, not a problem now.
