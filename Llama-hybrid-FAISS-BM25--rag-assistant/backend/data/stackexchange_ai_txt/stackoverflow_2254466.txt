You cannot prevent phishing per-se but you can take several steps each of which do a little bit to mitigate the problem. 1) If you have something like site-key or a sign-in seal, please ensure that these cannot be iframed on a malicious website. Just javascript framebusting may not be enough as IE has security="restricted". 2) Be very consistent about how you ask for user credentials - serve the login form over SSL (not just post-back over SSL). Do not ask for login on several places or sites. Encourage third parties who want to work with user data stored on your site to use OAuth (instead of taking your user's password). 3) You should never ask for information via email (with or without link). 4) Have a security page where you talk about these issues. 5) Send notification on changes to registered phone, email, etc. Apart from above, monitor user account activity - such as changes to contact information, security Q&A, access, etc (noting time, ip, and there are several subtle techniques).
