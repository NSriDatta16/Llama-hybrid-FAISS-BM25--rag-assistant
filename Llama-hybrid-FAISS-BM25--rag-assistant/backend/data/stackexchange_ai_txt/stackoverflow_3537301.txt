If your aim is to be independent of third-party CSS and JS, you must indeed use a separate document such as an iframe. The customer's code doesn't have to be ‘bad’ for you to get unexpected interactions between the content you're using and the stylesheet rules and actions they're working with. Anyhow it would be rude for you as a guest script of someone else's page to be dragging an large, intrusive framework like jQuery into their window. Even if you used noConflict there are still many possible interactions if the script on their page doesn't expect to see it there.
