How do I get a symmetric key in Windows Phone 7?

I'm working on a Windows Phone 7 app that requires some data encryption. I'm having a hard time finding any documentation about a key ring or DPAPI for Windows Phone 7. I've come up with a few ways, but they all have downsides. Generate a random encryption key and store it to IsolatedStorage. The pros of this is that it is simple, and it "just works". The cons are that this key will likely show up in backup files, etc. Generate a random key and use the device ID to encrypt that key. The pros are that it offers SOME better protection. It isn't hard to figure out the device ID. The Cons are that if they back it up and restore it to another phone, the key will be invalid. User input cannot be required (i.e. I can't derive the key from user input) I don't like either of the two. There must be something like DPAPI or a key ring in Windows Phone 7. Or is it lacking that?
