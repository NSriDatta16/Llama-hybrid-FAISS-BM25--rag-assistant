It seems the user entered " Hello " (due to pressing Enter?) into the edit control, and it is displaying correct in the HTML as you have done an Html.Encode. E.g. the paragrahs are not rendered, they are outputted as " .. " as the string is HTML encoded into something like "&lt;p&gt; Hello &lt;p&gt;" . If you do not want tags, I would suggest searching the text string for tags (things with ) and removing them from the inputted text. Do this before HTML.Encode. ...or am I missing something?
