Char to Enum in Index View in MVC

I have HelpBoxes in my DB. those are messages people get on the site. each message has a receiver. either it's an organisation or a user, or both. I have this Enum public enum Ontvangers { All = 'A', Organisation = 'I', User = 'D' } now in my index view public ActionResult Index(string schooljaarparam) { var boxes = _db.HelpBoxes.Where(q => q.Schooljaar.Sch_Schooljaar == schooljaarparam); return View(boxes); } and | | I get only to see the A, I or D. now I want to show User, Organisation or All How do I get that value there? I probably need to use an extension but I am not very familiar with Enum's. Some advice would be appreciated. edit: it works, but it aint pretty :) I would like to put it in a helper, but how...
