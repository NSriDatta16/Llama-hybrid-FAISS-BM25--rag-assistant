Using Z-score can be ok if you're sure about what you're looking for. It can also be just a way to transform your data before using some ML on it. Be aware that Z-score applies to normally distributed data (which you say is not the case). Be also aware that looking for outliers in 3 dimensions is not as simple as looking 3 times for outliers in 1 dimension. You should plot your data in 3D, and try to find where might be the outliers. Otherwise, one-class SVMs are pretty good at anomaly/outliers detection. Take a look at the introduction here . Also, any clustering algorithm might be helpful to get a better insight. DBSCAN , for example, helps you to find clusters based on the density of the data.
