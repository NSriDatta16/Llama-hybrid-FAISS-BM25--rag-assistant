Question about Html Encoding

I am using jquery datatables and MS XSS library. I did this AntiXss.HtmlEncode(MyDate.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy h:mm tt")))); this renders this 07&#47;22&#47;2010 4&#58;04 PM So its all encoded. Now for whatever reason this messes datatables up. It can't figure out how to sort anymore. So why is it encoding the slashes and dots? what is so bad about them? when it is displayed in the browser is looks like 07/22/2010 4:04 PM So I am guessing that datatables just takes in the encoded version and doesnot know what to do with it. What should I do. I want to encode the data but if it messed up my sorting thats not good too. Should I use safe html fragments instead?
