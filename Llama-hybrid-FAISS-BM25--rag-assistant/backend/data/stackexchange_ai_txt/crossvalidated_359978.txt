Seems there is a similar case here . The answer's author seems to have a very similar proposal to yours. And I would probably do this the same way as well. The key takeaway is to make sure you don't zero out everything on some row or column. You correctly identified this caveat already, at least for the rows. Make sure your columns also have at least some values (perhaps 10 is enough to get a feeling for someone's movie taste). If you don't know anything about a movie or a user, you can't expect the autoencoder to know the user's tastes (though it might predict the general population's taste). Best of luck with your algorithm!
