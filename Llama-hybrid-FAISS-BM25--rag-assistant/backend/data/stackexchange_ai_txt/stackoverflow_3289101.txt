How to elegantly access Android Views from other thread?

I'm using Twitter4j in asynchronous mode. When I get response in Listener I want to be able to change some Views in my Activity but it results in CalledFromWrongThreadException . I know that I can use runOnUiThread method, but what is the most elegant solution for this apart from inlining Runnable Classes? Part of my Activity: TwitterListener listener = new TwitterAdapter() { @Override public void gotUserDetail(User user) { super.gotUserDetail(user); fillInUserProfileDetails(user);
