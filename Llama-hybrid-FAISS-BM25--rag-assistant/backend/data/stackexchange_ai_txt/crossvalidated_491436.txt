What does "Parameters are fixed and data vary" in frequentists' term and "Parameters vary and data are fixed" in Bayesians' term exactly mean?

I hear the sentence in my question a lot, I kind of understand what it means but never have a clear picture of it. Hope to get the clear picture of what the sentence exactly mean.
