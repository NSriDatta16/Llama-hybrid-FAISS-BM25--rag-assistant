There isn't an universal "commit on save" feature (at least one integrated with all the editors associated with the document types you mention) The easiest way would be a background job which would commit (or ' git add -A && git commit -m "xxx" in the case of Git) every 5 minutes for instance. Actually, Mark Longair comments: flashbake is designed to be run from cron to do what you describe in the second paragraph with some kind of reasonable commit message. I'm not sure that that's what the original poster is after, though. Original project here : Automated backup is nice unless you have files for which you want to view an incremental history. Source control is great for that history but most tools expect the author to manually commit their changes along the way. => A seamless source control solution combines the convenience of automated back up with the power of source version control.
