I can't provide a solution but only offer general advice. My advice to you is to open a PDF document in Notepad or another Plain Text editor and study the formatting codes. They're very easy to understand. For example, //par is a Paragraph and //tab is a Tab. Once you know the formatting codes for table layouts, it'll be very easy for you to come up with your own solution to extract anything from a PDF document.
