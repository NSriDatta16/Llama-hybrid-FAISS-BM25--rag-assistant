I am developing app which bust run on both Android 1.5 and Andoroid 2.x platforms. When I install it on Android 2.2 all is OK, but on emulator with Android 1.5 I get an error: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_DEXOPT] What is the problem may be? UPD That is Logcat output: 09-26 07:12:22.484: INFO/PackageManager(579): /data/app/vmdl23706.tmp changed; unpacking 09-26 07:12:22.494: DEBUG/installd(557): DexInv: --- BEGIN '/data/app/vmdl23706.tmp' --- 09-26 07:12:36.114: ERROR/dalvikvm(1362): LinearAlloc exceeded capacity, last=336 09-26 07:12:36.114: ERROR/dalvikvm(1362): VM aborting 09-26 07:12:36.265: INFO/DEBUG(551): *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 09-26 07:12:36.265: INFO/DEBUG(551): Build fingerprint: 'generic/sdk/generic/:1.5/CUPCAKE/150240:eng/test-keys' 09-26 07:12:36.265: INFO/DEBUG(551): pid: 1362, tid: 1362 >>> /system/bin/dexopt It seems that memory was not enough...
