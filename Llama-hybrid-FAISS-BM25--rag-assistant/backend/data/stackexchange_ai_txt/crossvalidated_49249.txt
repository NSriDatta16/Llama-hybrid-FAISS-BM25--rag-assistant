The fact that you group your rolls into 15 trials of 20 rolls each is not relevant to estimating averages and standard errors. It is much more straightforward to treat this just as 300 rolls of each die. The result of a n rolls of a die is a random variable with multinomial distribution . The variance of the number of times the i th face comes up is $np_i(1-p_i)$. You don't know the real value of $p_i$ but can estimate it from your data or just use $1/6$ - for these purposes you will get similar (not identical) results. As you are interested in scale-free proportions, not the number of times out of 300, you need to divide the number of occurences by n (in this case 300); and to get the variance of that estimated proportion you divide by $n^2$ (because if you multiply a random variable by a constant like $1/n$, its variance increases by the constant squared). To convert the variance of that proportion into a standard error you take its square root, hence $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}n}$ as suggested by mark999. It looks like you were using the wrong value of n.
