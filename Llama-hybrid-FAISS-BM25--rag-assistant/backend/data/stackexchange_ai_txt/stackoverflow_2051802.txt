I think you'll struggle like hell, even if you do manage it. Frameworks are tools that encourage good programming standards and give you access to libraries for which you can call functions into your applications (to avoid writing everything or hard coding). If something breaks you may have to manually fix something, what are you going to do if you can't program to fix problems that occur within the framework (hire someone?)? I suggest you go to the php website and buy a book on the language to get your feet wet. I suggest starting with the essentials of any language: variables, arrays, functions, methods, object oriented programming, libraries, etc. At least study those topics (especially OOP and write a small project with them) before messing with frameworks. Many use OOP and you will struggle if you don't even know how to program in the language, although if you knew how to program it would be less of a struggle than if you didn't know either OOP/Programming in general. It's not a skill you develop over night, write code, read code, debug code, and repeat until you're familiar with the general concepts.
