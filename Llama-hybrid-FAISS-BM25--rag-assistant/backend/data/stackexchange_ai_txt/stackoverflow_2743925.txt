Open Word Document with WPF without open dialog

I have the path to a Word document saved in an SQL Database. I am able to retrieve the path but I cannot work out the best approach to open the Word document from WPF without using the OpenFileDialog . I've given up any thoughts of embedding Word in WPF as it has too many gotchas. I just want to be able to click a button or hyperlink and using the retrieved document path, open Word.
