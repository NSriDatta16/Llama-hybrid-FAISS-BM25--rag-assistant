How does the F1 score equation contribute to its intended effect?

I am aware of this post and it gives me a great intuition on the difference between IoU and F1 score but I don't quite understand how the equation differences creates that differences. F1 / Dice: $$\frac{2TP}{2TP+FP+FN}$$ IoU / Jaccard: $$\frac{TP}{TP+FP+FN}$$ Copying and pasting from that post, the possible differences between the two methods could be: In general, the IoU metric tends to penalize single instances of bad classification more than the F score quantitatively even when they can both agree that this one instance is bad. Similarly to how L2 can penalize the largest mistakes more than L1, the IoU metric tends to have a "squaring" effect on the errors relative to the F score. So the F score tends to measure something closer to average performance, while the IoU score measures something closer to the worst case performance. Now, how does multiplying the true positives by 2 in the numerator and denominator create the intended effect, especially with regards to something like image segmentation? I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around this.
