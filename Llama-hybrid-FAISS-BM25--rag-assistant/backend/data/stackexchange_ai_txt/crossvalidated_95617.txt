The null hypothesis for the Ljung–Box test is that the residuals from a stationary ARMA($p$,$q$) process are independent & identically distributed normal deviates—Gaussian white noise. The test statistic over $m$ lags then has an asymptotically $\chi2_{m-p-q}$ distribution. Carrying out the test on the mean-centred ranks of the residuals is a straightforward way to increase its robustness.
