James's direction is helpful, but bear in mind , what type of application? there are differences between web apps and windows apps. Look at cookies, session state appropriate for web apps. A useful way is to extend the profile provider http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/taab950e.aspx The profile provider remembers info after session has ended. Alternatively, sql server provides great permanent storage for creating your own state handler
