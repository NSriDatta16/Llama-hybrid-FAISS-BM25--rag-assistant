Subgroups Cochran's Q test

I'm actually doing a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of an instructional method on learners' performance. I have calculated coehen's d and Hedges' g, the average global size, W (weight) for each study and cochran's Q test using : Q=wi(teta(i) - teta (average))2. I performed a grouping (moderators) and I have to calculate Q for each group. Anyone knows PLZ how to do it ? which formulate to use ?? P.S: I'm a computer science phd student, it's the first time I deal with such studies and I'm really lost.
