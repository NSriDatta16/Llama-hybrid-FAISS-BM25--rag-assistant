You're probably going to have to write some custom code here. If you want to auto-paginate, then you'll have to index into the string and grab a fixed number of characters, words, paragraphs, or whatever makes sense. If you don't need to auto-paginate, then you can embed pagination information in the text string. Either way you'll have to expose a page number field in the view, then use that to page into the text based on what the user provided. Sorry I don't have a more elegant solution.
