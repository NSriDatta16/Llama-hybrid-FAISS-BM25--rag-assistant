Seam is not aimed to do that. CDI (Weld) is, however. With CDI you can @Inject an EJB in a JSF bean. (As arjan noted - you can do this without CDI as well, and since CDI is JavaEE6, you can try using @EJB private RemoteInterface bean ) But this is not about JPA entities. Although JPA considered part of EJB, and its predecessors were "Entity beans", a special type of EJBs, it is best not to think of EJB and JPA as one think. JPA is an ORM standard. EJB is a service/component model. @Entity objects are managed by an EntityManager . They are not managed by an ejb container, nor by seam, nor by CDI even. This is because they don't fit the component model these three employ. Entities are usually instantiated by the developer. With CDI/EJB/Seam it is the framework that instantiates the components, manages them and performs injection.
