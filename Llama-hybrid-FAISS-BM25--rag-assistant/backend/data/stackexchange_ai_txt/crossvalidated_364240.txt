Exact MCMC Logistic Regression Output

I am having trouble interpreting the output of an MCMC Logistic Regression run using R from the MCMCpack. Unfortunately I have had very little luck in finding sources on the web. I am assuming that the means (below in Output ) are mean estimates of the coefficients / intercept. How do I verify the significance of each? Do I take the mean value from the sample and compare it? Is there an R^2 equivalent? How do I compute it / obtain it? How do I verify that the model is significant (typically this is done with chi-square in "normal" logistic regression)? Code Base logfun=TRUE) head(Base) Output Iterations = 1001:11000 Thinning interval = 1 Number of chains = 1 Sample size per chain = 10000 1.
