Here's an answer, but it makes naive assumptions about the data generating process, it is mathematically incorrect, and it only works with a very simple estimand (group average expression). Throughout this answer, $i$ indexes a cell and $j$ a gene. Model Suppose the cells come from a homogeneous population, with mRNA counts varying due to natural stochasticity . (Link is to a tutorial that derives a stochastic model for gene expression from first principles). Suppose the molecule counts for cell $i$, call them $x_i$, have approximately mean $\vec\mu$, variance $\delta \vec\mu$, and zero covariance (each like an overdispersed Poisson). We can sample $y_{ij} \approx Poisson(0.01*x_{ij})$ for $i \in 1 ... 10k$ via shallow sequencing or $z_{ij} \approx Poisson(0.025*x_{ij})$ for $i \in 1 ... 4k$. Variance decomposition We know that, for the measurement of mRNA species $j$, $$\begin{align}Var(y_{ij}) =& Var[E[y_{ij}|x_{ij}]] + E[Var[y_{ij}|x_{ij}]] \\ =& Var[0.01x_{ij}] + E[0.01 x_{ij}] \\ =& 0.01^2\delta\mu_{j} + 0.01\mu_j\\ \end{align}$$. For $z$, the analogous result is $0.025^2\delta\mu_{j} + 0.025\mu_j$. The first summand can be regarded as biological variance and the second as technical. Estimation When we go to estimate $\mu$, it's typically done using "normalized" data: we do the bulk of the exploratory analysis on $\tilde{z_j} = 10,000*z_{i}/\sum_jz_{ij}$ or $\tilde{y_i} = 10,000*y_{i}/\sum_jy_{ij}$. This is not optimal, because deeper-sequenced cells should be given more weight, but I am answering within this framework because this is how most people get things done with single cell data. Derivation of consequences Suppose we ignore the variability in $\sum_j y_{ij}$ and $\sum_jz_{ij}$. For all $i$, $\sum_jz_{ij} = 5000$ and $\sum_jy_{ij} = 2000$. (If you can do better than this, I'm interested! Please write your comment or answer below.) To simply estimate mean expression, the technical variances will be equal across strategies . If $\bar z\equiv \sum_i\tilde z_i / 4000$ and $\bar y\equiv \sum_i\tilde y_i / 10000$: Z: $Var[\bar z_j] = (1/4000)*Var[\tilde z_{ij}]$ $Var[\tilde z_{ij}] = Var[2*z_{ij}] = 4*Var[z_{ij}]$ $Var[z_{ij}] = 0.025\mu_{j}$ (technical component only) $Var[\bar z_j] = (1/4000)*0.025*4\mu_j = 2.5\times 10^{-5}\mu_j$ (technical component only) Y: $Var[\bar y_j] = (1/10000)*Var[\tilde y_{ij}]$ $Var[\tilde y_{ij}] = Var[5*z_{ij}] = 25*Var[y_{ij}]$ $Var[y_{ij}] = 0.01\mu_{j}$ (technical component only) $Var[\bar y_j] = (1/10000)*0.01*25\mu_j = 2.5\times 10^{-5}\mu_j$ (technical component only) The biological component of the variability is lower in the shallow sample : the multiplier over the technical variance is $0.01\delta$, rather than $0.025\delta$. Summary This answer indicates that technical variation is equal across samples, but the biological component of the variability is lower in the shallow sample.
