onMouseDown and onMouseUp are general events that anything can listen to via Mouse.addListener(). They get triggered no matter where the mouse is clicked. onPress and onRelease are specific to a particular MovieClip. They only get triggered if the mouse is pressed or released while on top of that MovieClip. Also important is onReleaseOutside...for the case where you click down on a MovieClip, then drag the mouse outside, then release the mouse. In that case there will be no onRelease event, only an onReleaseOutside event, so if you're not listening to the latter, your program will think the mouse button got stuck.
