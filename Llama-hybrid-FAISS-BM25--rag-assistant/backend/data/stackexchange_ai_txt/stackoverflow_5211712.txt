At first glance nothing seems wrong with the code, so it might just be a random result. But your "Print it and check" method is very unreliable. Just use something like this: final int N = 10000; // test 10.000 times HashTable count = new HashTable(N); for(int i=0;i map : count.entrySet()){ System.out.println(String.format("%s: %d", map.getKey().toString(), map.getValue())); } This will print on average something like: 2: 1429 1: 2857 c: 2143 a: 2857 Only if the numbers differ creatly you should be concerned. Also make sure that you use the new Random() constructor, not new Random(somenumber). If you use the latter you will get the same number sequence every time.
