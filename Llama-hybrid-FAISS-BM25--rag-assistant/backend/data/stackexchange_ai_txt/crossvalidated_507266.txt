Experimental proof of the benefit of regularization?

Did somebody prove experimentally that linear regression with regularization is better for prediction than the same type of regression without regularization? I would be particularly interested to know if somebody did these real data experiments with linear SVM with and without regularization (the $w^2$ part). I can find neither experimental, nor theoretical proof. My suspicion is that overfitting of linear regression may be caused by over-counting outliers, rather than by the flatness of the slop of the regression. Did somebody prove me wrong?
