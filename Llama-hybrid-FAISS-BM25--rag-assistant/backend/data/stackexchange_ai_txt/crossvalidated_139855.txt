High dimensional sampling with low measurement noise

Assume that you have a model $$ Y = G(\Theta) + \varepsilon,$$ where $\Theta$ is a parameter vector with $\sim 8$ dimensions, $G$ is a highly nonlinear function of the parameters, $Y$ is observed measurements and $\varepsilon$ is a multivariate normal measurement noise with low variance (which is known). You are interested in the posterior $$ p(\Theta | Y), $$ which can potentially be multimodal. What type of algorithm would you use? I have thought about using MCMC, but I run into numerical problems since most proposed $\Theta^*$ will essentially give densities $p(G(\Theta^*) | Y)$ which are $0$.
