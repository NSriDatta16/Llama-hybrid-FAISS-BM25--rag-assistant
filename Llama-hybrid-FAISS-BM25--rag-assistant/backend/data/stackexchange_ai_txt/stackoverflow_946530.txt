Whatever you do probably involves embedding somehow the Flash player in your app. See these two: Embedding flash within a custom desktop application, using NPAPI? Embedding Flash Player in a C++ or Java application? Be aware of licensing issues if you plan to redistribute the player. Take a look to the Open Screen Project . Good luck
