Equivalent of LaTeX's \label and \ref in HTML

I have an FAQ in HTML ( example ) in which the questions refer to each other a lot. That means whenever we insert/delete/rearrange the questions, the numbering changes. LaTeX solves this very elegantly with \label and \ref -- you give items simple tags and LaTeX worries about converting to numbers in the final document. How do people deal with that in HTML? ADDED: Note that this is no problem if you don't have to actually refer to items by number, in which case you can set a tag with and then link to it with some non-numerical way to refer to foo . But I'm assuming "foo" has some auto-generated number, say from an list, and I want to use that number to refer to and link to it.
