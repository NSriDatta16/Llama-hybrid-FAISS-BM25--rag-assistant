How to include a pattern for'unknown' for an SVM classifier?

I am doing a classification of heart beat with SVM. There are five kinds of beats in my training data. I plan to add a new kind of data named 'unknown' beat. If there is no unknown beat, one to-be-test beat will always be classified into one of the five beats even though it is far from these five beats. That's why I want to have a sixth beat called 'unknown'. Then I found posterior probability seems to help me with it. But When working into it, I didn't find a good way to deal with posterior probability. Hope some one could give me some hints to solve this problem. edit: Actually there are over sixteen kinds of heart beats in all. But there are five main kinds of beats which occupy nearly 90% of all the beats. My work is to classify the heart beats, and if some abnormal beats or some beats related to some disease is found, there beats will be sent to the doctor for further work. The 'unknown' beat is a set of the remaining 11 kinds of beat(except the five main kinds of beats).
