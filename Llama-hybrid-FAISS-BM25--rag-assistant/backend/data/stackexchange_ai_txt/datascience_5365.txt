I would be keen to understand why you would need another language (apart form Python) if your goal is " but what about advanced regression, Machine Learning, text mining and other more advanced statistical operations". For that kind of thing, C is a waste of time. It's a good tool to have but in the ~20 years since Java came out, I've rarely coded C. If you prefer the more functional-programming side of R, learn Scala before you get into too many procedural bad habits coding with C. Lastly learn to use Hadley Wickham's libraries - they'll save you a lot of time doing data manipulation.
