When does XGBoost start (and stop) to create a new tree?

I am learning XGBoost these days. I read a lot of slides/tutorials. However, most of them focus on how a tree grows internally, e.g., how the split is made. I couldn't figure out how the 'forest' grows in xgboost --- in the end, it is a forest-based algorithm. My guess is that, XGBoost relies completely on hyper parameters to control the growth of forest. When max_depth is reached or split cannot be made due to too small gain, a new tree will be initiated. When the max number of trees is reached, the forest will stop growing. Is my understanding correct? thanks
