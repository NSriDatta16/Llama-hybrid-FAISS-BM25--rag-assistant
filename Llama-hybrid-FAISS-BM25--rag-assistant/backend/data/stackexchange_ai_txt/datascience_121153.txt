How to make a prediction if training time series have different lengths?

Description : I have 100 products. For each item I have the number of hours it has been used for each quarter of multiple years. Item 2020_Q1 2020_Q2 2020_Q3 2020_Q4 2021_Q1 2021_Q2 2021_Q3 2021_Q4 Sold A 50 80 75 90 60 70 85 95 No B 30 50 45 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Yes C 70 85 80 90 75 80 90 100 No D 20 70 40 45 30 NaN NaN NaN Yes E 60 75 70 80 55 45 40 30 Yes If the item has been used less or equal to 50 hours in three consecutive quarters, the item is sold. Question : Would you be able to suggest a smart and elegant way to predict if an item will be sold in the next quarter (2022_Q1) if a new time series is passed as an input? Note : I would be able to achieve my goal if the series had the same the same lengths but in this case I am totally lost.
