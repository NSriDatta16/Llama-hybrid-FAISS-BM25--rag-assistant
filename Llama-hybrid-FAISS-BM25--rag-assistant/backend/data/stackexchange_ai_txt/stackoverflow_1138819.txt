From the javadoc of cloneable. * By convention, classes that implement this interface (cloneable) should override * Object.clone (which is protected) with a public method. * See {@link java.lang.Object#clone()} for details on overriding this * method. * Note that this interface does not contain the clone method. * Therefore, it is not possible to clone an object merely by virtue of the * fact that it implements this interface. Even if the clone method is invoked * reflectively, there is no guarantee that it will succeed. So you could call clone on every object but this would give you most of the time not the results you want or an exception. But is only encouraged if you implement cloneable.
