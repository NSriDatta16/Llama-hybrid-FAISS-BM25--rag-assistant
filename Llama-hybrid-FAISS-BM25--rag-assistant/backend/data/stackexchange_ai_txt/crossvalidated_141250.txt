Constructing a data set for visualization

I am enrolled in a data analysis course and part of a course, I need to find a time series data set and generate visualizations and predictions based on my understanding of the findings. Instead of searching online, I took my electricity usage for the past 8 months, and generated a data set. Sample is shown below. There would be more columns for Days until day 31. My intention is to compare my residence consumption with utility average and neighborhood average. I need suggestions on best way to arrange the data in the data set. Does the format I posted here look good? Would this kind of column/row arrangements give good visualizations? I will be using Tableau for generating visualizations. Thanks.
