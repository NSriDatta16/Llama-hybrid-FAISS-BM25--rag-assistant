This is known as generative models, they basically infer the probability of the data based on the training examples. Algorithms usually are discriminative, i.e they perform prediction by estimating: $$ p(Y|X) $$ so given your data they are able to predict a label. Generative models are interested in $p(X)$ i.e. how is the data generated. Once the model learns this, it can produce "fake" images that look like your inputs. You can look at: Generative Adversarial Nets (which have had a lot of attention lately) Variational Autoencoders (were in vogue before GANS were introduced)
