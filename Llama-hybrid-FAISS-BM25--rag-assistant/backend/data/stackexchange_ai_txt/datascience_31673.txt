With weighted linear regression, it is exactly the same, as the expression for the loss function is a sum of weights multiplied by errors in the prediction. This works, of course, for other methods with loss functions, such as logistic regression and neural networks. This is due to the fact that the loss function is linear with respect to the weights. As you save memory, it is totally recommendable. With other methods, you should check if the criteria for choosing parameters or method is linear or not with respect to the weights. If not, you should not do it (to me it doesn't make sense that methods are not linear with respect to weights, but there might be a case where this happens).
