Variational inference is a method to approximate the posterior, without calculating the evidence term (i.e. the denominator) explicitly. If it were simple to calculate, we would just want to calculate the posterior term exactly, not approximate it. The proportionality argument is used in several places such as MCMC methods, MAP estimation, Bayesian analyses that use conjugate priors etc. to get round of explicitly calculating the integral factor.
