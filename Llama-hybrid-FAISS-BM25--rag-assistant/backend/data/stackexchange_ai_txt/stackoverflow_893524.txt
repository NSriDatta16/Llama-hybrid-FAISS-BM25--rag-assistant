LINQ for beginners

I love C#, I love the framework, and I also love to learn as much as possible. Today I began to read articles about LINQ in C# and I couldn't find anything good for a beginner that never worked with SQL in his life. I found this article very helpful and I understood small parts of it, but I'd like to get more examples. After reading it couple of times, I tried to use LINQ in a function of mine, but I failed. private void Filter(string filename) { using (TextWriter writer = File.CreateText(Application.StartupPath + "\\temp\\test.txt")) { using(TextReader reader = File.OpenText(filename)) { string line; while((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null) { string[] items = line.Split('\t'); int myInteger = int.Parse(items[1]); if (myInteger == 24809) writer.WriteLine(line); } } } } This is what I did and it did not work, the result was always false. private void Filter(string filename) { using (TextWriter writer = File.CreateText(Application.StartupPath + "\\temp\\test.txt")) { using(TextReader reader = File.OpenText(filename)) { string line; while((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null) { string[] items = line.Split('\t'); var Linqi = from item in items where int.Parse(items[1]) == 24809 select true; if (Linqi == true) writer.WriteLine(line); } } } } I'm asking for two things: How would the function look like using as much Linq as possible? A website/book/article about Linq,but please note I'm a decent beginner in sql/linq. Thank you in advance!
