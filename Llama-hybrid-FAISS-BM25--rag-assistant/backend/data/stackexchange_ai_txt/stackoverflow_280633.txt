If you convert the user supplied string to a date before you feed it to the DB, then the Session.LCID of the thread executing your ASP page is responsible for how dates are interpreted. If you feed the date as a string to SQL Server and let the conversion happen there, it will be useful to look into the SET DATEFORMAT and the SET LANGUAGE statements. So here is my idea: Either stop using (encouraging your users to use) ambiguous date formats, and this problem will disappear, or make sure all links of the processing chain have a clear understanding on what format to expect.
