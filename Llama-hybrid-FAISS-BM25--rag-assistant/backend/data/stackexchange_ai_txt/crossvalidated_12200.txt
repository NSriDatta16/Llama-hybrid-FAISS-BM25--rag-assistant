"Normalizing" variables for SVD / PCA

Suppose we have $N$ measurable variables, $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N)$, we do a number $M > N$ of measurements, and then wish to perform singular value decomposition on the results to find the axes of highest variance for the $M$ points in $N$-dimensional space. ( Note: assume that the means of $a_i$ have already been subtracted, so $\langle a_i \rangle = 0$ for all $i$.) Now suppose that one (or more) of the variables has significantly different characteristic magnitude than the rest. E.g. $a_1$ could have values in the range $10-100$ while the rest could be around $0.1-1$. This will skew the axis of highest variance towards $a_1$'s axis very much. The difference in magnitudes might simply be because of an unfortunate choice of unit of measurement (if we're talking about physical data, e.g. kilometres vs metres), but actually the different variables might have totally different dimensions (e.g. weight vs volume), so there might not be any obvious way to choose "comparable" units for them. Question: I would like to know if there exist any standard / common ways to normalize the data to avoid this problem. I am more interested in standard techniques that produce comparable magnitudes for $a_1 - a_N$ for this purpose rather than coming up with something new. EDIT: One possibility is to normalize each variable by its standard deviation or something similar. However, the following issue appears then: let's interpret the data as a point cloud in $N$-dimensional space. This point cloud can be rotated, and this type of normalization will give different final results (after the SVD) depending on the rotation. (E.g. in the most extreme case imagine rotating the data precisely to align the principal axes with the main axes.) I expect there won't be any rotation-invariant way to do this, but I'd appreciate if someone could point me to some discussion of this issue in the literature, especially regarding caveats in the interpretation of the results.
