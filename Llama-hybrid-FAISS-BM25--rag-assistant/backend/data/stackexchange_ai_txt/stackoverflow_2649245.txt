what's the C# equivalent of string$ from basic

And is there an elegant linqy way to do it? What I want to do is create string of given length with made of up multiples of another string up to that length So for length - 9 and input string "xxx" I get "xxxxxxxxx" (ie length 9) for a non integral multiple then I'd like to truncate the line. I can do this using loops and a StringBuilder easily but I'm looking to see if the language can express this idea easily. (FYI I'm making easter maths homework for my son)
