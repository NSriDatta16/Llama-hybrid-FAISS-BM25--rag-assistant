Why would restarting MySQL make my site faster?

my site started dragging lately, the queries taking exceptionally longer than I would expect with properly tuned indexes. I just restarted the mysql server after 31 days uptime and every query is now substantially faster and the whole site renders 3-4 times faster. Would there be anything that jumps out at you as to why this may have been? Improper settings on my.cnf perhaps? Any ideas as to what I can start looking at to try and pinpoint why? thanks updated note: I have a 16GB dedicated db box and mysql runs at about 71% of memory after a week or so.
