Convergence of GANs

My understanding of convergence of GANs (at least in theory) is that when the discriminator can no longer distinguish between real and fake examples the GANs have converged. Given a real example the discriminator is only 50% sure whether it is real or fake (same for when it is given a fake) i.e. it is resorting to a coin toss! That means that the generator has successfully "learnt" the density function so that anything it creates looks like a real example. Is that correct? Thx.
