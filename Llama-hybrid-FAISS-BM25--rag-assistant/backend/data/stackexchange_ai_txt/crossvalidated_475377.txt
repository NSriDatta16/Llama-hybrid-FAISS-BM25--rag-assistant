Although adding interaction terms to a regression model can change coefficient estimates and p-values from those estimated without interactions for several reasons, the spectacular increase in the standard errors suggests that your data suffer from the phenomenon of perfect separation that can occur in logistic regression. That is, your combination of predictors completely predicts the binary outcome. Then the maximum-likelihood method for fitting the model runs into problems and standard errors of coefficient estimates can be enormous. It might seem that perfect prediction is a modeling success, but typically results from such a model don't work well on a new data sample. This discussion goes into more detail and suggests ways to deal with perfect separation.
