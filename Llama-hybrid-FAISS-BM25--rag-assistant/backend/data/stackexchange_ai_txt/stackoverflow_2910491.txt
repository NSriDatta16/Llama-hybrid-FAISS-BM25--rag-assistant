Typically you'll need cookies to log into a site, which means cookielib, urllib and urllib2. Here's a class which I wrote back when I was playing Facebook web games: import cookielib import urllib import urllib2 # set these to whatever your fb account is fb_username = "your@facebook.login" fb_password = "secretpassword" class WebGamePlayer(object): def __init__(self, login, password): """ Start up... """ self.login = login self.password = password self.cj = cookielib.CookieJar() self.opener = urllib2.build_opener( urllib2.HTTPRedirectHandler(), urllib2.HTTPHandler(debuglevel=0), urllib2.HTTPSHandler(debuglevel=0), urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(self.cj) ) self.opener.addheaders = [ ('User-agent', ('Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; ' 'Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)')) ] # need this twice - once to set cookies, once to log in... self.loginToFacebook() self.loginToFacebook() def loginToFacebook(self): """ Handle login. This should populate our cookie jar. """ login_data = urllib.urlencode({ 'email' : self.login, 'pass' : self.password, }) response = self.opener.open("https://login.facebook.com/login.php", login_data) return ''.join(response.readlines()) You won't necessarily need the HTTPS or Redirect handlers, but they don't hurt, and it makes the opener much more robust. You also might not need cookies, but it's hard to tell just from the form that you've posted. I suspect that you might, purely from the 'Remember me' input that's been commented out.
