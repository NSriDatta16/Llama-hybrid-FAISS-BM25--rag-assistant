I'd like to add one thing to give greater detail on something that was only mentioned in the other answers. Having taken classes in both areas, one of the main differences between the two is that statistics tends to stress the rigidity of the assumptions for regression models. The regression course I took in the statistics department focused a great deal of time pounding into our heads regression assumptions and taught techniques to check and those assumptions. However, what the stats department course lacked was a focus on what to do if the assumptions are not met. In the real world, data does not always fit all required assumptions. Econometrics tends to be more real world driven in the sense that economic data is typically only observable and cannot be generated by an experiment, which is where idea that $X$ is fixed in statistics vs. not fixed in econometrics comes in. Consider macro economic data. It is very difficult to perform an experiment on an entire economy and observe the results. As such, economists are at the mercy of what data is observed and reported by the government, not what they can perform in a lab by changing the dose of a medication to see what happens to their dependent variable. That is why econometrics spends a significant amount of time focusing on what to do when the assumptions are not met. Is a model still useful if assumptions are not met and can we correct for issues? An econometrician would say yes. Some examples of topics that are more heavy in econometrics are how to deal with heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Econometrics also focuses more on time series. Although there is a decent amount of overlap, I would be hesitant to say the the the concepts are the same. Statistics is the foundation from where all ideas in econometrics come from, but economists focus on finding ways to apply those ideas in the real world and have their own techniques and even some different models for solving difficult problems that may not be possible from a statistician's point of view.
