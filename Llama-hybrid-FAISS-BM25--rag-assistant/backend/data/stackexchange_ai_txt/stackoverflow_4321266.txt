Last time I checked, you can't specify UUID() as the default constraint for a column in MySQL. That means using a trigger: CREATE TRIGGER newid BEFORE INSERT ON your_table_name FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.id = UUID() I know there are ways around that, but I figure the string based id would be better I understand you're after the security by obscurity, but be aware that CHAR/VARCHAR columns larger than 4 characters take more space than INT does (1 byte). This will impact performance in retrieval and JOINs.
