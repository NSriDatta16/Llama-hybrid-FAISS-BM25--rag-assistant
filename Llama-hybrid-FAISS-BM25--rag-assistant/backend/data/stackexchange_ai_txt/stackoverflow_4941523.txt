If I'm not wrong you want to add a button dynamically in your view pragmatically? If you have to get the parent view in which you want to add button, then create a button and add. For example you have a LinearLayout already defined. LinearLayout controls = (android.widget.LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.id_of_your_layout); Button button = new Button(context); controls.add(button); that's it.
