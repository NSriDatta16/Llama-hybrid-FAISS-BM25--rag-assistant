How to verify multicollinearity for categorial variables?

I want to verify for multicollinearity between independent categorial variables. Which test I should use? First, I want to examine the relationship between the willingness to participate in medical decision making (dependent variabele - 2 categories) and education (independent variable). Later, I would do a multiple binary logistic regression (adjusted). I have education (5 categories), paid work (2 or 3 categories) and household income (2 categories). Income was questioned using a 5-point likert scale.
