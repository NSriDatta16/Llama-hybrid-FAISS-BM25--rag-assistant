Iterate over a list, returning the current, next and the element before current

I have problems with writing an specific application in a scala-esque and elegant way. I tried this for some time now, but I cannot find a "good" solution to this Problem: Given that I have the following List: List("foo", "bar", "baz", "blah") I want to Iterate over this list, not only giving me the current element for each Iteration but also the element before and after the current element. This might be a Tuple3 but is not required to. This could be the Tuple signature: (Option[T], T, Option[T]) To clarify what i mean, this is the proposed Tuple for each iteration over a List[String] , ending after the fourth. Iteration 1: (None, "foo", Some("bar")) Iteration 2: (Some("foo"), "bar", Some("baz")) Iteration 3: (Some("bar"), "baz", Some("blah")) Iteration 4: (Some("baz"), "blah", None) How could I achieve such a result? Again: I am not bound to the Tuple3, any other solution is also very appreciated! Thanks!
