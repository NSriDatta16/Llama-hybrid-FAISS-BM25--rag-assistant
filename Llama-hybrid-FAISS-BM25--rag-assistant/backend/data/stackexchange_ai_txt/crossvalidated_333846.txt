Logistic Regression Models Without Main Effects?

I am building logistic regression models measuring human behaviour, which consist of categorical variables: demographics, conditions, and interactions between the demographics and the condition variable. The big issue is that as per my theory tested I am not interested at all in the main effects of demographics but only in the interactions with the condition variable. Moreover, there are extreme collinearity forces among the demographics e.g. income and education etc. Hence, I would intend to present log models without main effects in my thesis. Do you think this can be defended? If so, could you please give me ideas or statistical arguments of how to argue in favour of that?
