Hand Detection results in jerky cursor

I've written a program that uses the Depth data from a Kinect, and does blob detection to find a user's hand. However, when using the user's hand to control the mouse, it becomes very jerky, probably because people aren't very good at holding body parts completely still. I've tried averaging the position based on the last ten positioning's, but that just resulted in lag time without actually preventing jerkiness. The best solution so far that I've used is to not move the cursor if the pixel change is less than 10 in both directions (i.e., a 10 pixel change in either direction results in movement). This is okay, but it's still kinda jerky, and results in a clunky interface because you don't have fine precision. How can I compensate for the lack of steadiness in the human form so that the mouse isn't so jerky?
