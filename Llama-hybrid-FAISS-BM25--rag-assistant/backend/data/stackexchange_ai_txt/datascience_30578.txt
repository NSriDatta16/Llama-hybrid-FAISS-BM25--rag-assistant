What can functional programming be used for in data science?

In my next academic year at university, I have the option to take a course in Advanced Functional Programming. A basic description of the course is this: "Youâ€™ll focus on a number of more advanced functional programming topics such as: programming with effects; reasoning about programs; control flow; advanced libraries; improving efficiency; type systems; and functional pearls." Therefore I'd like to know if functional programming is useful in Data Science. If so, why it is useful, and by extension, whether this course will ultimately be useful in the pursuit of becoming a Data Scientist.
