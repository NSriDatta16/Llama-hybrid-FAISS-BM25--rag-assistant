How to calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) over multiple time points

Here's my query. I have 6 participants, where glucose readings are being taken at 30 mins, 60.. up to 150 minutes. Therefore in total I have 30 data points For each time slot I have calculated an average glucose reading for all 6 participants e.g. 1. average of participants at 30 mins is 7.96, SD is 0.92, SEM is 0.38 2. average of participants at 60 mins is 7.68, SD is 0.93, SEM is 0.38 The other SEM values are 0.27, 0.35, 0.25. Now, for a statistical calculation I need to calculate the average±SEM over all data points.. The average is easy - just average all 30. But for the SEM, if I try to calculate it via the normal excel method I end up with a value of 0.089.. which when reporting gives me 7.79±0.08. Which is obviously too small for this as the values range from 6.69-9.17. Is there a calculation that i'm missing? Should I be just summing/averaging the SEM for the time points? Thanks in advance! Managed to upload a picture of the data table:
