Root words The problem here is that language has many different ways of distorting words to give slightly more information without changing the root of the word. Your database which contains the needed courses for a specific profession should ideally be tokenized into a numerical value. Or if that is not possible you can get the stem of a word as follows from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer stemmer = SnowballStemmer("english") print(stemmer.stem("Accountant")) print(stemmer.stem("Accounting")) account account Recommendations There's a lot of resources on how to do this, especially using deep learning in recen tyears. You can look at some of the publications from Netflix, Amazon, SoundCloud. All these groups have very powerful recommendation systems. In essence what you want to do is determine some user metrics such as click through sequence, search history. Then build a database with these features and a target such as the next item that is played. From this you can train your model to predict a set of items the user is likely to click on next given his feature set.
