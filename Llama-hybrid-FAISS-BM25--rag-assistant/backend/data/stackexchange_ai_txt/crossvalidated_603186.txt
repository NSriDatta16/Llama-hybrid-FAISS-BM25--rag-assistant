PCA with non-Euclidean norm?

I have a dataset $X$ which I want to perform PCA on- however, I don't care so much about explaining the variance of certain features. So instead of using the "normal" definition of reconstruction loss: $$L(w)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}||x-(x\cdot{}w)w||^{2}$$ I want to use a modified norm: $$L_{A}(w)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}||x-(x\cdot{}w)w||_{A}^{2}$$ where for some $v$ , $$||v||_{A}=v^{T}Av$$ with $A$ a diagonal matrix whose elements can be thought of as feature "weights". So the new PCA problem is: $$\min_{w}L_{A}(w)$$ Is there a closed-form solution to this, in the same way that one can derive that the solution to standard PCA is the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $X^{T}X$ ?
