Determine If a User Is Idented On IRC

In my IRC Bot, there are some commands that I want to only be usable by me, and I want to check to make sure that anyone using my name is identified with nickserv (idented). I couldn't, however, find an easy way to determine this, which is why I'm here. Freenode and Rizon are the primary target networks, if that matters. Edit: I was actually aware of the various usermodes for idented users (although I didn't pay enough attention to realize that they differ!); sorry for not mentioning that before. The raw response that I get from a user, however, doesn't include their usermodes; it looks something like this: :liam_neeson!n=pearson@71-9-55-124.dhcp.snlo.ca.charter.com PRIVMSG #erasmus-testing :foo I suppose, then, that I'm trying to find a way (with various ircds, grr) to get those flags. If, as someone mentioned, Rizon returns whether or not someone is idented in a WHOIS query, then that's the sort of thing I'm looking for.
