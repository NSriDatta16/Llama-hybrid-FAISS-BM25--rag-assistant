I'd encourage you to not try to test the database access code using SimpleTest. Instead, create a functional test for your app using, for example, Selenium: record a test case when you start from a known state of a database; then add a comment and check (using Selenium's asserts) that the content indeed is there. This way it is: - easier to set up and maintain - you verify not just the DB layer, but the presentation layer, too That said, if you have stored procedures in your DB, do use SimpleTest - I've done it myself successfully. Basically, create SimpleTests that start from a known DB state, then perform a few INSERTS/UPDATES, then run the stored proc and make sure the state of the DB is what you'd expect.
