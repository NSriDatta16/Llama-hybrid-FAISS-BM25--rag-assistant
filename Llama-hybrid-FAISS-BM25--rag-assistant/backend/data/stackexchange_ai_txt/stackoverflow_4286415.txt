Good idea to resolve XAML in Silverlight 4 with WIndsor container?

Currently, I am resolving xamls from the container so that i can make use of dependency injection much more easily and ellegantly. It's a web application all written in Silverlight 4 with windsor castle container. I have a 2007 office ribbon and when an menu item is clicked, and the content control below the ribbon is replaced with the relevant xaml. But is it a good idea to resolve xaml from the container? I am worried about perfomance issue. Can someone please show me a proper of doing masterpages like in ASP.NET ? I would only like to resolve the xaml when an menu item is clicked. How can i do that? Currently, i resolved every XAML from the constructor before the menu is clicked! So very inefficient! Any better suggestions?
