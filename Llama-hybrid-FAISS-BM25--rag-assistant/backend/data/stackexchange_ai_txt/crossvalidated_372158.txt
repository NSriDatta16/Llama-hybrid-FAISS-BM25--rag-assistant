calculating mean and variance of non-stationary time dependent samples

I know normal procedure for calculating mean and variance which assumes that samples are iid.. I first want to know, how to calculate these two parameters if samples are time dependent but time series is stationary. Then what changes occur if time series is non-stationary. Finally how to calculate mean and variance for non-stationary time series.
