So if I can just summarize before giving my answer: Each subject is observed 24 times The location of the stimulus can change but we observe the same location several times within subjects. Your goal is to estimate the probability that the subject selects the correct location of the stimulus Have I understood that correctly? Because you are modelling a binary variable (correct or incorrect) as a function of location of the stimulus location, and because you observe the same person multiple times, I'm thinking a mixed effects logistic regression might be appropriate.
