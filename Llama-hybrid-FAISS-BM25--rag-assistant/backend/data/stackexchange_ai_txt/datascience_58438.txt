Which classifier performs better when using 'class_weight'?

I have used the 'class_weight' method to balance my multi-class classification problem, using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Among these three methods, logistic regression's performance for the minority classes is substantially higher than the other two models. Could someone please explain why does LR beat decision-tree-based classifiers in this scenario? Thank you.
