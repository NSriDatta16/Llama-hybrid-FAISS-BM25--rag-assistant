Nested dropdown

I'm building a form with php/mysql. I've got a table with a list of locations and sublocations. Each sublocation has a parent location. A column "parentid" references another locationid in the same table. I now want to load these values into a dropdown in the following manner: --Location 1 ----Sublocation 1 ----Sublocation 2 ----Sublocation 3 --Location 2 ----Sublocation 4 ----Sublocation 5 etc. etc. Did anyone get an elegant solution for doing this?
