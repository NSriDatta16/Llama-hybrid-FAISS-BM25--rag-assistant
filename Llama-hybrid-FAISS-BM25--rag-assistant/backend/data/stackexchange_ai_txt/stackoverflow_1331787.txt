Obtain updated annotation coordinate (lat/lng) from callout after drag event objective-c

Does anyone know how I can get the latest coordinated of my annotation after I've dragged a map annotation from a callout of the annotation? How can I access that info? Any code samples would be appreciated. Thanks, Zap
