You initialise vStatus to OK, then you immediately assign a new value. Instead of doing that you should initalise vStatus with a value that you're going to use. Try doing the following instead: int TMyClass::GetValue() { // A function returns a value int vStatus = DoSomeThingAndReturnErrorCode(); if(!vStatus) //Do something else return(vStatus); } Edit: Some clarification. Initialising a variable, only to never use that value, and then to assign another value to the variable is inefficient. In your case, where you're just using int's it's not really a problem. However, if there's a large overhead in creating / copying / assignment for your types then the overhead can be a performance drain, especially if you do it a lot. Basically, the compiler is trying to help you out and point out areas in your program where improvements can be made to your code
