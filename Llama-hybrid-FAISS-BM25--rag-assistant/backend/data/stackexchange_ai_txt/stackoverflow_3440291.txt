I would hesitate to provide any arguments for such a change unless you had a good reason to make that change. i.e. you have to balance the cost of a change to what you would personally of done / prefer, vs the cost of actually implementing it and the benefits. Have you checked whether the use of nchar(1) is hurting performance, or are you falling into the trap of premature-optimization? You are only talking about 1 million records here. For the minor storage / IO cost you think you are incurring, consider the total man hours to change, retest and upgrade the system * hourly rate vs cost of just buying a faster disk. I suspect the disk will be far cheaper - as well as benefit every aspect of the system.
