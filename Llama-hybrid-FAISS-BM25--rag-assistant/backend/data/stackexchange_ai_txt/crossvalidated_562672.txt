Effect of missing segments on outcome variable in time series

Intuitively this is the case of something that exists but I don't know what it is called and so can't google it. I have time series data in which some data are randomly missing. I suspect that, due to the nature of the data collected, segments directly after missing data will differ from the mean. I want to include this in my analysis. I use Generalised Additive Modelling. (I have pupil dilation data from babies watching one of two videos. Video A contains information that is harder to process than Video B. You expect, for various neurophysiological reasons, a more dilated pupil for Video A than for Video B. However, Video B is more boring (for practically unrelated reasons). Since you can't tell babies what to do, they will get bored and look outside the screen more often. Outside the screen is black, so their pupils will dilate. This is a confound.) Currently I use a total tally of % data missing in each time series. But this is a grossly simplifying measure.
