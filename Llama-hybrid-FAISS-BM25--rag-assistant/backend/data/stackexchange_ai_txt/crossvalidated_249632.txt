Having difficulty with model selection from a real data set

I am having some issues trying to find the best models to explain some data. I have a large set of data, containing more then 20 predictors, and a response variable, some of the predictors are factors, some are continuous, the response is continuous. The sample size is very large ( several thousand). My goal is to use R and methods of regression to come to some conclusions of what the best model would be. I am not sure the best ways to do this, at first, I have been trying to brute force look at the predictors, but I am also interested in possibly using stepAIC or some variant of that to help. More information: The data is from the NHANES health and nutrional study, which can be recieved in R by install.packages('NHANES') , library(NHANES). What I am focusing on is a subset of this data, all from the 2011-12 year, on 21 seperate variables, How I began: I started off by fitting the model that included all predictors as a main effect, through R and use of drop1, this allowed me to drop the main effects of 7 predictors. Also using R , I was able to conclude that the model with these predictors removed was an adequate simplification. Now I decided I could maybe begin to look at first order interactions, through R I eventually came up with the first order interactions deemed relevant, I added these into the model that included the relevant main effects. ( I only looked at interactions between factor predictors with continuous predictors, does it make sense to also look at interactions between factor and factor /continuous and continuous?) Eventually, I get a model with $R^2=0.354$ , which is as high as I had managed to get it so far. ( without interactions it was in the 0.2 range) However, $0.354$ still seems quite low to me, so I thought maybe I would need to include higher order interactions, but by this point I am very confused on where to begin because there are so many different possible combinations. So I am thinking that there must be a more simple way I can go about this model selection. In regard to stepAIC, I am unsure how to interpret it. For example, I can try it with the model that uses say $x1$ as a factor and test $y~x1*(x3+...+)$ but how do I know that this is preferred over say $x2$ as a factor and test $y~x2*(x3+...)$? Also what R commands can I use to see comparisons of things like BIC and mallow CP? So I am looking for any and all help/advice on this topic.
