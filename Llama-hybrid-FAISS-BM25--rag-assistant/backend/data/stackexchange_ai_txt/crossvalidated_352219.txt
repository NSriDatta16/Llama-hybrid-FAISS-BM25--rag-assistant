For clinical prediction, Jimeng Sun's lab at Georgia Tech ( http://sunlab.org/publication ) is a good example. They were pretty much the first to use RNNs for predicting, for example, heart failure. Also, there are other good examples like Joseph Futoma, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05894.pdf . For phenotyping, researchers such as Lipton have applied various deep learning algorithms. For both, see conferences like http://mucmd.org . Other researchers include Michaela Van Der Shaar or P. Svolovitz for example. For imaging, the radiology/ pathology/ dermatology/ ophthalmology communities have become very interested in CNNs. Generally many large imaging conferences (CVPR) have a few papers on medical image processing applications. Some like MICCAI are specialized for it, and now conferences like RNSA have entire section devoted to AI.
