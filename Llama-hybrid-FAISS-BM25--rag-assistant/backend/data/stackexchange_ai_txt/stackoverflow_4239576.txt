Columnar storage is a physical layout optimization where data is stored by columns, and not rows. In some use cases, the advantages here are many: 1) less read time - need to compute an aggregate on a value - no need to read the rest of the row - so less read time 2) data compression - as the column data is likely similar, you can get greater compression ratios 3) ordinal indexing (sometimes) this approach falls apart when data is inserted and updated, but for read-only and append use-cases the performance benefits can be astounding.
