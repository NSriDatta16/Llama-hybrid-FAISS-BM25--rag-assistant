Found the module implementation: http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,31852 In combination with a couple of other modules made by agentzh (detailed at: agentzh.org/misc/slides/nginx-conf-scripting/nginx-conf-scripting.html), it's possible to manipulate arrays and include sha1 and md5 encoding while modifying rewrite rules through nginx's rewrite module. Didn't find an official release of the sha1-md5 implementation, but comments I found online suggest that the module above works as expected.
