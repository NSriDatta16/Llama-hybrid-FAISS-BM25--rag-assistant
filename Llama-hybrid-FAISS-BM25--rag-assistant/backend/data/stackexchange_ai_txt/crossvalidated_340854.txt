random forest for imbalanced data?

I have a dataset where yes=77 and no=16000, a highly imbalanced dataset. My plan was to identify the most important variables influencing the response variable using random forest and then develop a logistic regression model using the selected variable. I am planning to use random forest package and resampling technique. I know it will reduce the type II error but increase the type I error. Is Random forest a reasonable technique for analyzing this data? Is there any other machine learning technique which would be more suitable for my case.
