Just pass a null pointer for data. This is how it's specified in OpenGL since version 1. From the OpenGL 1.2 specification, section 3.8.1, page 118, last paragraph: If the data argument of TexImage1D, TexImage2D, or TexImage3D is a null pointer (a zero-valued pointer in the C implementation), a one-, two-, or three-dimensional texture array is created with the specified target, level, internalformat, width, height, and depth, but with unspecified image contents. In this case no pixel values are accessed in client memory, and no pixel processing is performed. Errors are generated, however, exactly as though the data pointer were valid.
