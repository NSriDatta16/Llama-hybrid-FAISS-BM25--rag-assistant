Machine learning methods which takes time-to-event into account?

My vague understanding is that machine learning methods are based on classification labels. How about a survival type of problem? That is to say, not only "have event" or "have no event", but also "time to event". In statistics, we can perform e.g. Cox PH regression, but we can then only combine the multiple baseline characteristics in a linear manner (multivariable Cox analysis). If we want to look at a more advanced way to combine them, such as nonlinear, kernel-based, etc., is there corresponding machine learning methods which takes time-to-event into account? Thanks for any comments.
