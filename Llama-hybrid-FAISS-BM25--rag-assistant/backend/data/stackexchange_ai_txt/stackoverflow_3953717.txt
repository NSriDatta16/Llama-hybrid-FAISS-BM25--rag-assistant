Where should I perform a Reachability check?

I want to check for a valid network connection. I followed Apple's Reachability example and put my check in applicationDidFinishLaunching #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { if(getenv("NSZombieEnabled") || getenv("NSAutoreleaseFreedObjectCheckEnabled")) { NSLog(@"NSZombieEnabled/NSAutoreleaseFreedObjectCheckEnabled enabled!"); } // Override point for customization after application launch. [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver: self selector: @selector(reachabilityChanged:) name: kReachabilityChangedNotification object: nil]; //Check for connectivity internetReach = [[Reachability reachabilityForInternetConnection] retain]; [internetReach startNotifer]; [self updateInterfaceWithReachability: internetReach]; [window addSubview:navigationController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } However, my app will crash sometimes with the error Application Failed to Launch in Time I have posted my crash as an SO question here: Application Failed to Launch in Time I'm not sure where I should perform the reachability check?
