Neither of these changes have any effect on the logical meaning of the query (i.e., they are "no ops") The only physical effect that the COALESCE on the ON clause would be to prevent the optimizer from trying to use an index for ARI.FCINVOICE. Likewise, the only physical effect that the ">= CHAR(0)" could have on the optimizer might be to prod it to consider using a indexed range scan (or also a seek) on an index that had ARI.[fpartno] in it. So my conclusion would be that TOAD is trying to manipulate the optimizer into using a particular index without actually forcing it to use that index with an explicit HINT. Actually, that's kind of clever as the real problem with the T-SQL optimizer hints is their dependencies and fragility.
