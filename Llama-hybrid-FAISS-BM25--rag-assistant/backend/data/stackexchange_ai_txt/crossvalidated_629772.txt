"Unbalanced" data are not an inherent problem, but they turn into a bit of a challenge if you cast your problem as one of maximizing accuracy. Especially if the signal in your dataset is weak, maximizing accuracy will incentivize you or your model to pretty much classify every instance as belonging to the majority class . If you want to optimize accuracy, you shouldn't be surprised if your model or pipeline optimizes accuracy. If the results are not to your liking, that may well not be due to the model, but to accuracy as a KPI. As an aside: no, switching to precision, recall or an average of the two (like the F1 or any other F-beta score) will not address the problem on a fundamental level. All of these suffer from the exact same issues. You indicate that you actually want to predict. That is different from maximizing accuracy! I would recommend that you move from hard 0-1 predictions to probabilistic predictions/classifications . If a predictor allows you to reliably distinguish between a 0.01 probability for a goaround and a 0.1 probability, then this predictor carries a lot of information - even if it is still more probable that there will be no goaround for either value of the predictor (so you would still say "no goaround" if you just want to maximize accuracy). Once you have well-calibrated probabilistic predictions (take a look at proper scoring rules to assess the quality of probabilistic predictions), you can turn these into actions or decisions by tuning one or more thresholds . An approach with a 0.01 probability of a goaround can probably proceed without any intervention. A different one with a 0.1 probability may require explicit increased monitoring by a flight controller. And one with a 0.8 probability may require that flight control proactively contacts the pilot to discuss their options. (So even if there are only two possible outcomes - "goaround" vs. "no goaround" - there may be more than two possible actions based on the classification, a point I expound on elsewhere.)
