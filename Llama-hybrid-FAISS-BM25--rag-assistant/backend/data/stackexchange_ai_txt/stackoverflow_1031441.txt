Ordering items inside a table based on user preferences, what is the correct way?

After seeing joomla's way of having arrows to order items (articles, menu entries and the likes), I was wondering what is considered best practice to shift elements inside a table. You obviously must have a field inside a table that hold numbers, letters, or anything you may want to use to define an order, then you have to change this order, I can't think on any elegant way to achieve this, can you help me? Thank you very much EDIT: Reading the answer I realize that i may not have been clear, I don't need to order items based on standard parameters (like I don't know, date, id, etc). I need to decide an order myself. Like this: id - name - order 1 one 2 2 two 1 3 three 3 I want to know the correct way to change the order of the items (like if I want to have one go into the first position I would need to change the order value of two to '2' and the value of one to '1'. Hope I explained myself correctly
