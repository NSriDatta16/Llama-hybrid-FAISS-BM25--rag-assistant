Getting _MailItem interface from IRDOMail

I've an Outlook plug-in. I'm using Redemption. Specifically, I'm using IRDOMail::Move in order to move an email item from one folder to another (redemption is the only method I've found that work with all storages). I now have a need to get back a hold to the Outlook's _MailItem interface, while I only have a pointer to the redemption object. It appears Redemption works with MAPI (it is derived from), and what I need is the Outlook interface. Thanks.
