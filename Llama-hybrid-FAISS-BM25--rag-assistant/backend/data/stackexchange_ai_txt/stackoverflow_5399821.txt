What is the best way to store global/static variables in an advanced java game?

I am a self-taught java programmer, so i don't know the proper way to do a great deal of things. I have written a few simple games (such as Asteroids, Snake, ect.) so i know how to do the basics. Now i am working on a more complicated game, a role-playing game with zombies. I started writing it without putting much thought into how i will structure it. First, I made an 'item' class to hold the data for a simple item (value, weight, damage). Then I made a class to hold the variables for the player (Health, armor, items). I eventually made the menu, which on it's own needed variables to hold what menu item is currently being selected. I soon realized that i have a great deal of global variables that i would need to store somehow. I would need to use the variables in separate classes (such as the class that prints to the screen must know the locations of everything). So what would be the best way to write a big amount of global variables? Like i said, i do not know the proper way to do things, and i cannot find a good site that explains variable declaration on a large scale. Would i make a class that holds all the variables, and make the 'Main' class have a static declaration of that 'VariableStorage' class? Thanks in advance! P.S. Please supply links if you can! :D
