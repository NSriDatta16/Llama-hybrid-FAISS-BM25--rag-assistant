@Robert's answer is valid. However if you are using strongly typed ViewModels and this is a readonly view then I would suggest property be a string and setting format before view is bound. If it is an editable form then a DateTime property would probably be more appropriate. I use AutoMapper to flatten my domain entities in different views and make use of the following DateTime converter (which makes it consistant for all english speaking cultures, you might have to consider culture more if your audience is wider) public class DateTimeTypeConverter : ITypeConverter { public string Convert(DateTime source) { return source.ToString("dd-MMM-yyyy"); } }
