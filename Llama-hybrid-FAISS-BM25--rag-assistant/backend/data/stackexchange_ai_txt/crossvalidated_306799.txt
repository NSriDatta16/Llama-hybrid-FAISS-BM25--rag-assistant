How can I do a t-test on 2D data?

How can I do a t-test on 2D data with latitude and longitude attributes? I have 2 clusters of similar coordinates but in different time, I want to do a t-test to see if they are statistically different. Can I do t-test? And if I can do, how can I apply t-test on 2 variables? Should I do a PCA or something?
