AFAIK there is no one transformation of data from an unknown distribution which will always redistribute into a normally distributed variable. Log-transformation might help for variables with considerable right skew, but would not work (i.e. 'normalize') on continuous variables with negative values (e.g. differences) or those with left skew or other non-normal distribution. Additionally, assuming log-transformation is applicable, you might wonder if your test for normality isn't driven by your sample size (which you have not described, so could be relatively large), and the test has given you a rejection of the null-hypothesis which is based on only a small deviation of normality. Finally, I'm really curious why you'd want normally distributed variables for your entire dataset. I can understand transforming specific variables based on the desired modelling assumptions (such as transforming of a specific variable with an obvious non-linear association with another variable studied). But normalizing (so not standardizing or mean-centring) everything might not be what you need. Also, PCA assumes multivariate normality, which is explained quite well here . So normalising for that reason is not really necessary.
