How to properly train CNN on Full Digital Mammography

I am trying to train my Convolutional Neural Network on full digital mammography images. Here are example dimensions from a random sample: (5832, 4104, 3) . Which method for loading images and training the model is recommended in this case? I guess I would need to load only certain amount of images in memory so that it does not overflow. Should I use Keras ImageDataGenerator or TensorFlow's TFRecords ?
