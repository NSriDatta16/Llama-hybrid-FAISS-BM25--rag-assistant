In a project I was working in, some specific usages of Boost Lambda expressions could make the Visual C++ compiler crash. (We were using Visual Studio 2003) The compiler would only crash during the release build, a debug build would work fine. There had been a religious war raging through the team about the appropriate usage of the lambda libraries, I was almost grateful that the compiler settled it for us. :-)
