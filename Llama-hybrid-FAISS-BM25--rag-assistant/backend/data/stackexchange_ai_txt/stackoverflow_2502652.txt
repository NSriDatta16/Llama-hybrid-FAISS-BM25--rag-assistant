If you create a Fruit, it isn't an Apple. You can't upcast it, because it probably won't have all of the attributes that it'll need. If you want an Apple, create an Apple. You don't need to pass anything to anything. I suspect the following will work: Fruit a = new Apple(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Apple name: " + a.Name); ...but I'm not a Java programmer. That's basically what you'd do in C++ though. (Be sure to read the Abstract Factory Pattern link given in another answer, especially if you need to instantiate a bunch of different subtypes of Fruit.)
