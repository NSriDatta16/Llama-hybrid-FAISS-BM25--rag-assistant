How do I use qmake to build multiple binaries in a single project?

I'm writing a small qt app suite that consists of a set of small programs that work on the same set of files. They are organized like this: / app1/ main.cpp app2/ main.cpp app3/ main.cpp common/ project.h project.cpp somemore.h somemore.cpp appsuite.pro When I do qmake && make , I want the following binaries to be built: app1/app1 app2/app2 app3/app3 How do I write appsuite.pro to work like this? I have heard something about .pri files, but I could not figure out how to use them in my "situation". Help appreciated, jrh
