Yes . The only requirement of __hash__ is that it be unique. In fact, this is quite an elegant and Pythonic way of solving the problem! EDIT: It has been pointed out to me that __hash__ need not even be unique! Instead, one simply requires equal objects to have the same hash. Unequal ones may also have the same hash; in fact, everything could hash to 0 and this would be (technically) fine.
