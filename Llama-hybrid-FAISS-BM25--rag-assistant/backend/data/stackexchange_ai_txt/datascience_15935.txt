Data Science Groups on Linked In

I am interested in joining some Data Science Groups on Linked In. The relevant list is long. I don't think it is to my advantage to join all, but I am not sure how to evaluate the individual group's potential to elevate my career. Is there some clear criteria for which I can evaluate potential groups?
