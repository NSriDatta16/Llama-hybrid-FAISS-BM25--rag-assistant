I use the following code to attach a contextmenu to a listview gricolumn header: In the codebehind i set the ContextMenu property of the list on the mouse up event, in order to show the context menu: private void ListView_MouseUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { DependencyObject depObj = e.OriginalSource as DependencyObject; while (depObj != null && (!(depObj is GridViewColumnHeader))) { depObj = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(depObj); } if (depObj is GridViewColumnHeader && e.ChangedButton == MouseButton.Left) { ((GridViewColumnHeader)depObj).ContextMenu = ContextMenu; } } The variable ContextMenu refers to a contextmenu instance that i created bfeorehand, you could also create the ContextMenu in the Mouse event handler. I'm not sure if this helps as I dont know how you do the drag/drop, but it is worth a try
