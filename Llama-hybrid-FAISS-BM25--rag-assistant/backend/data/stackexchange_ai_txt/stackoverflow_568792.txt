What are some online solutions for easily accessing my source code from anywhere?

I'm a college student and at any given time I have 4-5 programs I'm writing in various languages for various classes/projects. At any given hour of the day I might be in the library, at home, in any of our different computer lab classrooms, etc. Right now my current modus operandi is at the end of each class period or coding session, I gmail myself the current state of whatever I'm working on with an appropriate subject line (ie, "MIPS Assembly Lab 2, Revision #3"). However, this is becoming cumbersome and I'm looking for other solutions. Restrictions: No Thumbdrive . I'm about as absent minded as possible while still somehow managing to function. I'll lose it. Portable or Web Apps only . I can't install non-portable executables. So, if a tool requires an installation wizard or administration privileges, I can't use it. I can use portable executables however, stored in our network drive space given to each student. So, that might open some possibilities. I'm looking for some kind of online storage that I can easily download the latest files for my project or update those in the online storage, with as little friction as possible. I've considered using some free version control repository and trying to find a portable executable or web-tool I can use to integrate with it, but I wonder if it might be overkill. I'm not really looking for keeping a revision history. I've seen videos of things like dropbox and it seems like it is a step in the right direction. Any suggestions?
