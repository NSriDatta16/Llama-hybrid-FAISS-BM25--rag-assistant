Where are you logging the events? The onTouch() handler should be called whenever the user touches the screen. You can do a switch case on the event to determine what the user is doing: switch(event) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: // When user first touches screen break; case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: // When user is dragging, or continuous touch break; case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: // When user stops touching break; }
