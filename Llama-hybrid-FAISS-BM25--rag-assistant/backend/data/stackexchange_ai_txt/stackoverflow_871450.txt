I wrote the chapter for this in 'Deploying Rails Applications'. http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_deploy/deploying-rails-applications Basically, you want mongrel, mongrel_service, and apache 2.2 with mod_proxy_balancer for windows. You install 2 or more instances of your app with Mongrel running on separate ports. You set the services to autostart. Then you set up apache to balance to them. This is all outlined in the book, and I have some older articles on my website too - if you search for "deloying rails on windows" you'll find some pretty out of date stuff. The apache+mongrel way is the best way for Windows right now, and if you need additional help, feel free to let me know. I'd be glad to help.
