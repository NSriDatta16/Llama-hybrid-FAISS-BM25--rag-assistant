If each 12.5% sample is without replacement, then the proportion sampled is $1-(1-1/8)^8$: The first sampling omits $0.875$ of the total The second sampling omits $0.875$ of the remainder The third sampling omits $0.875$ of the remainder and so on. The proportion not covered in 8 samplings will be on average $0.875^8$. Hence the proportion covered will be on average $1-0.875^8=0.6564$. In general, if you do $k$ samplings of size $n/k$, then as long as $k$ is not too small, the coverage will be close to $1-1/e \approx 0.632$
