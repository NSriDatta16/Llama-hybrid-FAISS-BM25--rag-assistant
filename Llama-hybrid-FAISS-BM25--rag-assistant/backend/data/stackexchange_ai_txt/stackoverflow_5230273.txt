An open-source CodeIgniter based e-commerce app that I can contribute to?

I'd like to get involved in open source projects to try and get rid of the n00b-hood which seems to cling to me like a gecko to flypaper. It seems that there are no open source e-commerce solutions built on codeigniter - a search on Google, a search on Github, and a search on Stackoverflow all brought out 0 coherent results. If anybody knows of such a project, please let me know, so I can start contributing my part to the development - that is the only way i'll ever improve, and i'm sure any mentor would like a little help on their pet project... Besides, I think Oscommerce (and any of it's numerous cousins) seems a bit immature in it's approach even to a non-ninja like me, and magento is totally undemocratic with it's insistence of innoDB requirement and the impossible complexity of the code architecture.
