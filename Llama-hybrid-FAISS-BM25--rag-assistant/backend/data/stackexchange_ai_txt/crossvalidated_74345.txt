Moving average filter for outlier removal

I am using a moving average filter to smooth data for outlier removal. By changing the number of average points, I am getting different result. My data are multi-dimensional feature vectors. I applied the moving average to the entire matrix and then on individual variables. They give different results. So, how to choose/guess the number of points to average over and should it be applied on the entire matrix or on a one by one basis?
