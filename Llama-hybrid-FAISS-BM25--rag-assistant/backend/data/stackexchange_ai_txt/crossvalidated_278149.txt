I'm not sure exactly what test Kahneman uses, but it seems to me this is basically just an ANOVA test. When we refer to an agent's "skill" we are referring to his expected performance, and when we talk about the amount of "luck" involve we are referring the variance about an agent's performance. We want to test whether there is an identifiable deviation in skill between agents, thus we want to test if at least one agent has a different mean, thus we should use an ANOVA. I think Kahneman might be treating the agents as random rather than fixed effects, hence his discussion of "correlations" (inter-class v. intra-class correlations) rather than means. (This interpretation suggests we shouldn't say that a game like this is either a game of luck OR a game of skill, but rather that there are components of skill (mean) and luck (variance) as in almost all games. Of course, if there can exist no difference in skill between players, then the game can be called exclusively luck-based).
