Beta regression coefficient interpretation

I'm trying to use beta regression on a data set where the response variable is in percentage (i.e. between 0 and 1), so let's say it's the unemployment rate. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the coefficients of the model summary. If I had predictor A which has a coefficient of -0.5, should I take a similar approach to what I would do for linear regression, so something like "an increase in A reduces the unemployment rate by 0.5"? Or should I say "decrease the odd ratio by exp(0.5)" like logistic regression? I'm attaching a screenshot, in case this helps.
