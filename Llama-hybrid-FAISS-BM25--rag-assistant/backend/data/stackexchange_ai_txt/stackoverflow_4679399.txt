You can call Named data macros passing parameters from a UI macro but data macro can’t open a form or invoke a message box. They return errors that UI macros can catch and display to the user. These errors are also logged to the UsysApplicationLog table. This is a special table that keeps a history of data macro failures and other useful debug information you choose to write to it. -- http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-access/archive/2009/08/13/access-2010-data-macros-similar-to-triggers.aspx
