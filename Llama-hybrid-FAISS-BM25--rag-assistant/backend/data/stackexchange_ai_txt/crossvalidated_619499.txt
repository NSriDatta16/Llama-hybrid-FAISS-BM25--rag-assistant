The first plot you present is a bivariate summary using a logistic curve. I can see plainly that the odds ratio, which is the slope of the S curve, is a sound finite value. The number of cases to non-cases overlap over a suitable region of the "X" values. A multivariate logistic regression is another story. After more and more variables are added, it is hard to visualize the changes to the OR. A fininte OR becomes subject to separation. Separation means your OR = $\infty$ . Of course, the estimate comes from a numerical solver so they just stop at a "big value", but it might not be as unreasonable as you say. OR= $\infty$ means the S shaped curve becomes a step function, with 0% probability of event prior to the step and 100% probability of the event after the step. But it can be a spurious finding as well. The most likely cause of a spurious infinite odds ratio is a crazy approach to OR adjustment, either the wrong variables or too many of them. The wrong variables, like colliders - things that are caused by the outcome, can induce a relationship with the exposure. I would suggest to build the multivariate model one variable at a time, and look closely at the number of parameters reported as a fraction of the sample size.
