My first thought is to use JavaScript's eval() operator, though I understand this is a less than elegant solution. (Soemthing like this: var animationClass = eval("new "+build.effect+"(el, build)"); although I'm not sure that's correct as I haven't used eval() like this before.). Ayman's answer is a much better variation on this idea. My second thought is that MarioKartMenu isn't suitably abstracted. So I'd build a simple class around it that takes the effect name as a third parameter and uses a switch() statement to select amongst all the available effects, instantiates the correct one and returns it.
