RNN's with multiple features

I have a bit of self taught knowledge working with Machine Learning algorithms (the basic Random Forest and Linear Regression type stuff). I decided to branch out and begin learning RNN's with Keras. When looking at most of the examples, which usually involve stock predictions, I haven't been able to find any basic examples of multiple features being implemented other than 1 column being the feature date and the other being the output. Is there a key fundamental thing I'm missing or something? If anyone has an example I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
