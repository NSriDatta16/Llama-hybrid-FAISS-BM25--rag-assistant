I understand volatility as a measure of average squared deviation from the mean over a certain period. This sounds like conditional variance averaged over the chosen time period. Meanwhile, a GARCH model considers the conditional variance at a given time point (a period of one). You can take the squared residual from your conditional mean model as an estimator of the conditional variance. Aside from any imprecisions of the conditional mean model, it will be an unbiased although noisy (high-variance) estimator of the true underlying conditional variance. (There is no point in talking about consistency of such an estimator, as the estimator uses a fixed sample size of one.) What the other studies might be doing is using intraday data to produce realized volatility to which the fitted or predicted volatility from a GARCH model is compared.
