Training an autoencoder with the MSE loss is particularly tricky because it is highly likely that reconstructions will collapse to simple statistics, such as the sample mean. Tips on training the autoencoder I would suggest you turn off any biases in your linear and convolutional layers, as this will avoid collapsing your reconstructions to the mean value of the input images. This is discussed in footnote 1 in section 3.3 (page 5) in the paper titled Deep One-Class Classification by Lukas Ruff et al. Also, consider keeping your batch size small at the beginning of training, to around 8 images per batch. I've observed that a smaller batch size greatly helps training.
