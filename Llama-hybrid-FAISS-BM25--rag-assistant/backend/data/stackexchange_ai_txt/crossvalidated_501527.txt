You might be thinking of Online Inference . Usually behind these analytics are predictive models. And nowadays these models are built using machine learning. I think it helps to separate the training of the model (where it learns from historical data) and inference (when you ask the model to give you a prediction). Both training and inference can be either offline or online . (I prefer the term Batch instead of offline) Even if the term you're looking for is online , there's still a difference between whether you care about training or inference. The most common scenario is Batch Training, Online Inference . That means someone took a lot of historical data and built a predictive model using machine learning. No matter what fancy terms you use to describe it, that model is basically just a function. It takes inputs and spits out a result (aka a decision). In order to actually use that function, a computer is sitting somewhere waiting for it to be sent a row of data, so it can respond what the decision is. So when you log into an app, or visit a website, it is asking the server to calculate the decision in real-time. That's online. There is also Online Training which is much more complicated and less often used in the real world. This is when a model is already built and working exactly as I described above, except as time goes on it takes new data and relearns some of the model. It might help to think of it like Batch-Training just repeating itself many times per day. Batch Training, Batch Inference - most common method Batch Training, Online Inference - useful for apps, websites, code running in devices Online Training, Online Inference - the holy grail Online Training, Batch Inference - I don't think this would ever happen
