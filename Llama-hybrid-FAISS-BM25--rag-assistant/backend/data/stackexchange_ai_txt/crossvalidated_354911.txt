Would a genetic algorithm be used for this type of scheduling optimization?

Let me preface this by saying I'm not an experienced data scientist/statistician so I apologize if this is trivial. My problem statement is as follows: There are N events that happen from time A to time B Each event takes some time X. Each event is ranked by priority. I'd like to organize these events based on time and priority. I have seen genetic algorithms used for school schedule optimization but i'm not sure if I can adapt that to this problem. Also, I'm struggling to figure out how I will incorporate the priority since that is dynamic.
