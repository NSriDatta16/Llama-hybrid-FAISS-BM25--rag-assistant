Overflowing int's in OpenMP

I'm trying my hand at writing a naive indexOf function. It currently works and gets the right position. However it overflows when counting the number of comparisons. I've tried converting them all to long long ints but it doesnt seem to be making any difference. What can I do to fix this? int hostMatch(long long int *comparisons) { long int i,j,k, lastI; i=0; j=0; k=0; lastI = textLength-patternLength; *comparisons=0; int lastIi = lastI+1; int position = -1; int numberThreads = 1; int totalCom = 0; #pragma omp parallel for default(none) num_threads(numberThreads) \ shared(totalCom, position) \ private(i,j,k) \ firstprivate(lastIi,patternLength, textData, patternData) for (i=0;i
