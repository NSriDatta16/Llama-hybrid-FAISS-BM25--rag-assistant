If you're doing classification, this should be fairly straight forward. Just select some aggregate measure of performance (e.g. accuracy), and plot a distribution of that measure for different random initializations of k-means. This gives you some information about how well the algorithm would perform on average. If you're doing clustering (i.e. unsupervised clustering), then you can make a pretty picture of the clusters using a vector compression technique. A simple technique might be to pick a point in space, and plot each point in your dataset with its euclidean distance from that point and its category. You could also use more advanced techniques like PCA . If you're interested in finding out which features are good predictors, I suggest running something like a maximum entropy classifier on it, or one of many feature selection algorithms. These techniques will provide you with a weight for each feature indicating its importance in predicting the groupings.
