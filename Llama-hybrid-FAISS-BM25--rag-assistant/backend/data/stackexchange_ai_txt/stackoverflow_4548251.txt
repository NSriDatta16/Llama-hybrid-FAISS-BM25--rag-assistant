touchesBegan and touchesEnded on a UIWindow

My iPhone game's appDelegate has a "UIWindow window" member variable. I add UIImageViews to the window and move them around during game play. I'd like to handle touches on the UIWindow. How can I do this? Do I have to subclass UIWindow? I tried adding the touchesBegan:withEvent and touchesEnded:withEvent methods to the window but they are not called (possibly due to the window being covered by UIImageViews... for example the game background is a UIImageView and it covers the entire screen). Cheers!
