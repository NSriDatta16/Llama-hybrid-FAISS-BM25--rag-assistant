asp.net: deploying local resources - is embedding possible?

I have an asp.net app with some local resources. These resources are used in the aspx and code-behind files: aspx: " /> .vb: TextBox1.Text = GetLocalResourceObject("testTag").ToString If I deploy the .resx files with the app, there are no problems. However, if I change the build action on the resx file to "Embedded Resource", the resources aren't available, even though they're in the DLL that gets built. Is it possible to deploy resources in a DLL, or am I stuck with managing & deploying resx files on the server?
