How to interpret logistic regression coefficient

How do I interpret a regression coefficient in a logistic regression with two predictors? $\hat{L} = -14.27+3.32(3)+0.88(7)$ My understanding is to take the anti-log of the coefficient, like $e^{3.32}$, and use that to interpret the percentage increase of odds ratio. But when I do $e^{3.32}$, I get $27.66$, so does that mean that the increase is by $2666\%$ or only $66\%$?
