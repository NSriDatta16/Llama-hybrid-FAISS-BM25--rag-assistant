Ok, so as I said in the comment, the integral from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ doesn't really make sense, so I'm going to work with $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-n}^n$. Taking $y = -x$ we have: $$ \int_{-n}^n (2 - 2F(x))^2 - 1 dx = \int_{-n}^n 4F(y)^2 - 1 dy $$ Now renaming $y$ on the right hand side of the equation as $x$, and avaraging those two things together we get: $$ \int_{-n}^n ((2 - 2F(x))^2 - 1) dx = \int_{-n}^n 2(1 - F(x))^2 + 2F(x)^2 - 1 dx $$ And now from $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \geq (\frac{a+b}{2})^2$ we get : $$ 2 (1-F(x))^2 + 2F(x)^2 \geq 4 \left(\frac{(1 - F(x)) + F(x)}{2}\right)^2 = 1 $$ So the integral is positive for all $n$.
