Marginal effects of exposure variable in logistic regression with matched dataset

I have a question related to the estimation of effects of a certain binary exposure variable on a binary outcome via logistic regression after an exact matching procedure. Originally, I followed recommendations in the literature and in the MatchIt library documentation to include as controls the variables I used for matching, in order to obtain more precise estimates of my X of interest. I derived odds ratios for a series of specification models, and that was fine (and this was the ATT). Yet, I also wanted to derive the marginal effect for my X or, more generally, the difference in the predicted probability of having 1 as outcome across the two levels of my X (X=0 not treated, X=1 treated). When I use the margins library (as well as the ggpredict function), after fitting the logistic regression model with control variables, I obtain a very narrow difference in probability, and in general a tiny marginal effect. When using ggpredict, I see that all control variables are adjusted by setting them as fixed on some categories (please consider that most of my matching/control variables are categorical). Yet, I feel this is not what I want, I do not care about the marginal effect computed when fixing values to particular categories. So I tried to avoid controls in regression: I only estimated the effect of X on Y using weights after matching. When I do this, the odds ratios are fairly the same as the ones in the first model with controls, but the difference in predicted probabilities as well as the marginal effects increase. What do you think is the best approach? I know this might depend on several aspects I haven't detailed here, but the main point here is that while ORs do not change across the two main specifications (with and without controls), the marginal effects seem to change. In the case with controls, the predicted probabilities as well as marginal effects are too small to make sense theoretically. Not only odds ratios were pretty large and significant (although I am aware of the problems of interpreting odds ratios in terms of magnitude across different models), but also the difference in means for the treated and non treated groups are quite considerable, so why this tiny marginal effects? Any advice on how to proceed? Please again consider that I used exact matching on 10/12 variables, with 8/10 of these being categorical, only 2 being continuous. Hence, I obtained perfect balance across the two groups. Thank you for any input/suggestion! Here are some details on the models, as requested by Noah. The variables are anonymized, X is the treatment variable, and coefficients minimally changed (due to privacy restrictions on the project I am working on). In the case with controls, after exact matching, this is the code I used: model_matched2 And these are the results -obtained through the "summ" function, with robust standard errors - for the odds ratios (I only report the X one): X OR: 0.815 95% CI: [0.806-0.825] z value: -34.091 p- value: 0.000 Then I calculate the predicted probabilities, via ggpredict(model_matched2, variables="X") And I get 0.50 for non-treated, 0.53 for treated, of course adjusted for the various controls in the estimated equation. When I estimate the marginal effect, via margins(model_matched2u, variables="X") the estimated marginal effect is 2.11. When avoiding controls, I use the following code: model_matched2u At this point, the results in OR form, again with robust st. errors, are: OR: 0.871 95% CI: [0.862-0.879] z value: -28.060 p-value: 0.000 Marginal effect is -0.07749, estimated via: margins(model_matched2u) Predicted probabilities are 0.66 for treated, 0.74 for non-treated, estimated via: ggpredict(model_matched2u) This is an example, I have different models, different specifications, but this kind of pattern (similarity in OR, difference in margins, with models with controls having seemingly unreasonable small marginal effects) keeps popping up. Any hint would be fantastic! Thanks
