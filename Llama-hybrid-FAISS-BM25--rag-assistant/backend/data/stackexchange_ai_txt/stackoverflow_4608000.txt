GWT: how to have different styles for splitters in different SplitLayoutPanels?

I know you can change the styles of the splitters with the defaults styles listed in the docs: .gwt-SplitLayoutPanel .gwt-SplitLayoutPanel-HDragger { horizontal dragger } .gwt-SplitLayoutPanel .gwt-SplitLayoutPanel-VDragger { vertical dragger } and we've done that in earlier development. However, now I'm developing new stuff and would like to use a different style for the splitters in a new SplitLayoutPanel. Unfortunately, we haven't or can't split the app into different modules, which might make this easier. I tried creating a new style and applying it to my new SplitLayoutPanel, but it didn't appear to have any effect on the splitters. I thought there might be a method to get a handle on the splitters in order to apply the new style to only them, but I didn't find any such method.
