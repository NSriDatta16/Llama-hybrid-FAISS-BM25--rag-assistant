This is something I'm faced with as well on a current project. Some good answers here . I'm personally using option #1, adding a version column to the pkey of each "versioned" table. FKeys use the version column as well. My main consideration was ease of querying, with a consequence of high storage requirements. I have the leeway to strictly limit the number of versions kept around, which mitigates that issue.
