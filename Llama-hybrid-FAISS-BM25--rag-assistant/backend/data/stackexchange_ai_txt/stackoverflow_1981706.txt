For completeness, also look into the local storage capabilities & sessionStorage of HTML5. These are supported in the latest versions of all modern browsers, and are much easier to use and less fiddly than cookies. http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webstorage-20091222/ https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/ . (second edition) Here are some sample code for setting and getting the values using sessionStorage and localStorage : // HTML5 session Storage sessionStorage.setItem("variableName","test"); sessionStorage.getItem("variableName"); //HTML5 local storage localStorage.setItem("variableName","Text"); // Receiving the data: localStorage.getItem("variableName");
