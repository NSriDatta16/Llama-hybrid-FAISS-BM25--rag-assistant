In a time-to-event model it's typical to have imbalance at late times. If at most 1 event is possible, many in higher-risk groups necessarily have had the event and have already left the cohort before the later times. With a proportional hazard model you're assuming that the relative hazards associated with your covariates are constant over time, so time per se isn't an issue. The coefficients are estimated from whatever information is available at all event times. It's just that late times have fewer cases available to provide information. A point to remember in a model with time-varying covariates, however, is that it's the covariate values at each event time that are used in the estimates. Some types of covariates might better be modeled as cumulative or average values of some sort rather than their values at particular times. Apply your knowledge of the subject matter carefully to the data setup and modeling.
