Yes, the perplexity is always equal to two to the power of the entropy. It doesn't matter what type of model you have, n-gram, unigram, or neural network. There are a few reasons why language modeling people like perplexity instead of just using entropy. One is that, because of the exponent, improvements in perplexity "feel" like they are more substantial than the equivalent improvement in entropy. Another is that before they started using perplexity, the complexity of a language model was reported using a simplistic branching factor measurement that is more similar to perplexity than it is to entropy.
