I'm not sure how well MDI would work in terms of usability in a Sivlerlight app. You might find that the blacklight dragdrop panel dashboard (under interactive controls) would be much more suitable for a silverlight app. It should give you some MDI style features, you could also have multiple tabs with the dashboards in.
