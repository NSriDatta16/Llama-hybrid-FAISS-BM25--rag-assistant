Check if a certain procedure is random or not

I am not a statistician, but I have a personal project and I need a help. I will simplify the project a lot to make it more clear and easier to understand. Then in base of your answers, I can fit it to my real project. Let's say that I have a pot with many balls inside with a number on the balls. For a week, every half an hour, I choose a few balls (each time a different number of them) and note down the number on them. Then I repeat the same procedure for many weeks. I will end up with a dataset like this: Monday 00:00 - [15,45,24,57,437,23,89,2,42,.....] Monday 00:30 - [12,345,643,64,23,4,64,754,......] .... Tuesday 00:00 - [24,2,57,865,3,6,8,655,86,.....] .... Sunday 23:30 - [14,543,64,32,57,43,768,.....] The higher the number on the ball, the better one. So, I want to check if there is a certain datetime in the week that may have the higher numbers or it is a totally random procedure. As I said, it is a simplified version. Picking a ball from a pot is certainly random. Maybe a Chi-square is right choice? But can I fit my data to this option? My first thought was to create a graph (bar graph maybe) where the x-axis would be the datetime of the week and the y-axis the sum or the average of the numbers. But this will end up to another problem. If one day has only mid numbers and another days has a lot of high and low numbers, will end up the same bar. Obviously, it isn't. May I have your ideas here?
