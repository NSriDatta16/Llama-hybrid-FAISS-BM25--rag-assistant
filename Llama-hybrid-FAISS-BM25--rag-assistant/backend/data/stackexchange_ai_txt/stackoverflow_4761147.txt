Is there a more elegant way to change Unicode to Ascii?

I seen the problem a lot where you have some obscure unicode character which is somewhat like a certain ascii character and needs to be converted at run time for whatever reason. In this case I am trying to export to csv. Having already used a nasty fix for dash, emdash, endash and hbar I have just recieved a new request for ' ` '. Aside from another nasty fix is there another better way to do this? Heres what I have at the moment... formattedString = formattedString.Replace(char.ConvertFromUtf32(8211), "-"); formattedString = formattedString.Replace(char.ConvertFromUtf32(8212), "-"); formattedString = formattedString.Replace(char.ConvertFromUtf32(8213), "-"); Any Ideas?
