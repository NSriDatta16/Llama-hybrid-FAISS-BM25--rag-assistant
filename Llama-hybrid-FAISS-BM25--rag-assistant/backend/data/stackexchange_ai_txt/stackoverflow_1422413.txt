One thing I've always loved to do is to use the Description attribute on my enums so I can store 3 values of my enum easily Public Enum States { [Description("Florida")] FL = 124 } And then I had a class that easily reads to/from the description attribute so I could store a whole database code table in an enum file. Aside from all the posters bringing up extension methods you could use attributes to drive log with your enum classes. You would still need to leverage another class to actually do something with the enum but you could use attributes to add more depth to your enum instead of just having the key/value pair that it basically is.
