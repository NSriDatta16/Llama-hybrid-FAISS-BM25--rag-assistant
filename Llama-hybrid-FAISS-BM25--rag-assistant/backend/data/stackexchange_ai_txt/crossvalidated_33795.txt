Average weighted to exclude a predictor variable?

I have over 200 datapoints in my set and I have related my predictors (mostly categorical) to a single continuous response variable in a multiple regression model. The model is to my satisfaction, and now I need help in analyzing one aspect of it. In my case, each datapoint represents an event, and my response variable is the number of attendees for that event. Increasing event frequency seems to decrease the number of attendees per event. However, so far increases in frequency have increased the OVERALL event attendance. So what I'd like to do is project the number of attendees for an entire week given various numbers for the total event count that week. Basically, I want to make a table with a column for the number of events that week, and another for number of total attendees for that week in order to select the optimal event frequency. I have a variable in my model for number of events held that week. I know that I can use its coefficient to determine the negative impact of holding one additional event in a given week, but that data isn't useful to me without a starting point to subtract it from. I'm looking for a way to predict the number of attendees for a given weekly frequency ignoring all other variables. Is there some kind of weighted average that will help me find this number?
