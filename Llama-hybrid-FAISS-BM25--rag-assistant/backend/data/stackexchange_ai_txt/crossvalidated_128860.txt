Your question has nothing to do with mixed models, or even with the binary outcome models, as you are asking about the fixed part of the model, and the way the main effects are coded. Everything in your model is significant, so you have to maintain the full interaction. The coefficient for item=0 in the first piece of output shows how the response changes, on average, when you switch from item=1 to item=0 , holding other stuff constant, just as you would in any regression interpretation. The coefficient for [item=0]*[warning=0] shows by how much the outcome changes for that combination, from the baseline of [item=1]*[warning=1] , on top of what is being described by the main effects. It is true that the values of the coefficients may be changing depending on how you code these main effects, but the significance will stay. Moreover, the estimates (and tests) for any particular contrast are invariant with respect to how the main effect are coded.
