Can you float Visual Studio 2008 Tabs?

I have not been able to figure this out, but I was curious if you can float VS 2008 document tabs. Often times, I want to look at 2 documents, maybe the aspx file and the cs file on two different screens, but I can't drag one to the other screen, so I have to just switch back and forth. Is this possible?
