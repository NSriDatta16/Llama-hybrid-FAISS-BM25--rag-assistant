Take a look at syncolor.vim . You'll find it in /usr/share/vim/vim{version}/syntax/ . Excerpt: " There are two sets of defaults: for a dark and a light background. if &background == "dark" SynColor Comment term=bold cterm=NONE ctermfg=Cyan ctermbg=NONE gui=NONE guifg=#80a0ff guibg=NONE SynColor Constant term=underline cterm=NONE ctermfg=Magenta ctermbg=NONE gui=NONE guifg=#ffa0a0 guibg=NONE SynColor Special term=bold cterm=NONE ctermfg=LightRed ctermbg=NONE gui=NONE guifg=Orange guibg=NONE So the first SynColor line looks of interest. I confess I don't know if you can override this, as opposed to changing this file.
