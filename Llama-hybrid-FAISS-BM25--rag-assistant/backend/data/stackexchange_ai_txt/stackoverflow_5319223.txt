FileHelpers Nonstandard Embedded Quotes in CSV

We are using FileHelpers to parse a CSV file. Unfortunately, we've run into an issue with data being read into unexpected columns, since the CSV file does not escape embedded quotes: 1,"SURNAME, FIRSTNAME "NICKNAME"",2 instead of doubling them as is usual: 1,"SURNAME, FIRSTNAME ""NICKNAME""",2 We are not at liberty to change the CSV file, so it is necessary to use the file as-is. Is it possible to do this with with a stock build of FileHelpers? If not, is there another .NET CSV library that supports this format out of the box?
