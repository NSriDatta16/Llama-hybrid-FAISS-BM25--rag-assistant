Tracking Conversion Rates

My company just completed a major website redesign and launched it a month ago. We're seeing some changes in daily visitors and new signups from the original website (comparing month over month), and we're wondering if there's a statistically significant change in traffic and conversions. I've run some t-tests and chi-squared tests over the average daily visitors and conversions, and they point to insignificant changes. Even if I can find statistical measures that show significant changes in our traffic, I'm skeptical of the any of those findings since there are a number of confounding variables (seasonality, holidays, external marketing campaigns) at play. Outside of going back in time and performing an A/B Test with the new site and the old site, are there any methods I can use to understand whether or not the traffic after the redesign is different from the original?
