I have been having this problem off and on for a few weeks. I finally resolved it today. The source (nice pun) of the problem was source control. I am currently using Visual Source Safe 2005 (I know, I'm dumping it soon), but I think it could be an issue with any source control package. I first suspected VSS when I was able to edit ASPX pages in the design view without issue using a machine that was not connected to VSS. If I removed source control from the project, everything worked fine. I then discovered that somehow my VSS connection settings got changed from using a folder connection to a web connection. I'm not sure how this could have happened since I am the only one that uses VSS and I certainly didn't change it. Anyway, I reset it back and everything began to work normally again.
