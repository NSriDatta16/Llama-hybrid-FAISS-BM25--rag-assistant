Remembering a jQuery draggable tool palette position between page refreshes

I have a tool palette which shows up when an admin user is logged in to a site. The palette is draggable (via jQueryUI.draggable) and I would like it to remember the position between pages/refreshes... Is there a standard way of doing this, or a plug-in I should be using, or do I need to roll my own (via cookies or something)?
