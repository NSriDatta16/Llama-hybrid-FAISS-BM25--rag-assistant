ColdFusion scheduled tasks pass in certain data in the CGI information including: HTTP_USER_AGENT=CFSCHEDULE Now HTTP_USER_AGENT is fakeable so the next question is to determine how secure you need access to the folder. Do you only want CF to run these tasks? Or do you want to run them from outside as well? Just your computer? Etc. Once that is determined you can code for it and rip747's solution is a good one so I'm not going to suggest anything else! ;)
