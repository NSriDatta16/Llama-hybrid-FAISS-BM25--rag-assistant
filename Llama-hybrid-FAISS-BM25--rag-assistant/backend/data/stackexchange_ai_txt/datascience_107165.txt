MODNet, based on the paper , is a network that removes the background entirely just as if the person is standing in front of a green screen. And I assume that is why you are left only with the player and not the rest of the sticker. I think you would find more use in a Region Proposal Network, such as that used in Faster R-CNN (sec. 3.1). Here is an example of the PyTorch (torchvision) implementation of such a network. Notice how the network outputs boxes (in the forward() method) which is a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2) . From these four coordinates, you can get the four corners of the player sticker and crop it with a simple function.
