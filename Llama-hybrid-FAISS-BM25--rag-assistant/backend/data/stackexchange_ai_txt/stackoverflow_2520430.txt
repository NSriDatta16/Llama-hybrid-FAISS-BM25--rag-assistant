In general... Read a lot of other people's code. Open source projects are great for that. Respect their licenses though. You'll never get it perfect. It's an iterative process. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right. Practice. Practice. Practice. Research often. Keep tackling more and more challenging projects / designs. Even if there are easy ones around. There is no magic bullet, or algorithm for good design. Nowadays I jump in with a design I believe is decent and work from that. When the time is right I'll implement understanding the result will have to refactored ( rewritten ) sooner rather than later. Give this project your best shot, keep an eye out for your mistakes and how things should've been done after you get back your results. Keep doing this, and you'll be fine.
