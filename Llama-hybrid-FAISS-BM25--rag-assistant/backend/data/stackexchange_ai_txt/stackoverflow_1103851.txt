What are the best practices/tools for a team of 7 developers working in Visual Studio Proffessional?

What are you guys using, what has worked for you? I'm talking about, version control, testing, automated build, code coverage, basically all things ALM. The cheaper the tools, the better. We are not looking for VSTS. For profit, commercial application and custom software development in C#. Programming is primary skill.
