One of the methods proposed in Hani M. Samawi & Robert Vogel (Journal of Applied Statistics , 2013) consists of a weighted combination of T-scores from independent and dependent samples in such a way that the new T score is equal to $T_o = \sqrt\gamma ( \frac {\mu_Y - \mu_X} {S_x^2/n_X + S_y^2/n_Y}) + \sqrt {(1-\gamma)} \frac {\mu_D} {S_D^2/n_D}$ where $D$ represents the samples of paired differences taken from the correlated data. Basically the new T score is a weighted combination of the unpaired T-score with the new correction term. $\gamma$ represents the proportion of independent samples. When $\gamma$ is equal to 1 the test is equivalent to two sample t-test, whereas if equal to zero, it is a paired t-test.
