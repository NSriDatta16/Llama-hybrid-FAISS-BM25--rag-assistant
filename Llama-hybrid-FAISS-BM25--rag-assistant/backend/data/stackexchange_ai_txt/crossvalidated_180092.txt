Is population homogeneity applicable to binomial parameters?

Are there assumptions regarding homogeneity in power calculations and significance tests when it comes to binomial parameters? Binomial variance is estimated by np(1-p). It doesn't take any other information into account other than sample size and rate p. In contrast, the variance in a continuous parameter is based on more information, so you can have two equal populations with same average but different variance (so sample from one population will be less reliable than the other). I assume this is why np(1-p) is called an "estimate" of binomial variance. What if I do have more information in a binomial case? Say it's a stack of warped coins instead of visually identical coins? It's not clear if that information is statistically important and, if so, how to incorporate it. Who knows what bunch of coins will come next from the bag of warped coins... Any thoughts? In Frequentist thinking specifically, can the estimate of binomial variance ever be imprecise and need to be corrected in some way?
