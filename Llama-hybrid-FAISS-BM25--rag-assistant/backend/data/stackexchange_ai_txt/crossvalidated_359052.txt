Negative Binomial Regression Equation

I know that for a univariate linear regression the predictions are generated like: $$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ And for a univariate logistic regression the predictions are generated like: $$\hat{y} = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}}$$ So my question is, what is the equation for a univariate negative binomial regression, specifically one fitted by R's nb.glm function ? My guess is that it's something like: $$\hat{y} = \binom{k+\theta-1}{k} \bigg(\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}}\bigg)^k\bigg(1-\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}}\bigg)^\theta$$ But then I don't know how to make sense of the parameters $k$ and $\theta$ I feel I've reached the limits of my google-fu, so any help would be much appreciated.
