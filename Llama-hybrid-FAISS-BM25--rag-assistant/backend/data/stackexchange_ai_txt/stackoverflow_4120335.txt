When jQuery does an AJAX request, it sends the HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH header. Have you considered checking for that header on server side? If the session has timed out, instead of redirecting to the login page, you could return a JSON structure containing the "please log in" error message. That would be the cleanest method in my eyes. Another idea would be to make an additional Ajax request before doing the "real" one. If the first request fails or gets a text/html content type back, you know you are no longer logged in. Not very elegant but easier than trying to count the session duration on client side (which is bound to be unreliable).
