Convolution operator in CNN and how it differs from feed forward NN operation?

I understand that the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Feed forward (FNN) are quite different. And that CNNs use pooling and filters of shared weights over a patch of the image. I am not so clear on the core convolution operator (1): If anyone could link me to an explanation, I have looked at the Colah blog and Nielsen's online book, and I understand what it is doing but don't understand the convolution operator. Also, it looks quite similar to the the core FNN function is there and difference? (2). (1) convolution operator is $a^1 = \sigma(b + w*a^0)$ which is equivalent to: $a^1 = \sigma(b + \sum^4_{l=0}\sum^4_{l=0}w_{l,m}a_{j+l,k+m})$ (2) feed forward operation: $a^1_i = \sigma(\sum^n_{j=1}w_{ij}x_j +b_i)$ Many thanks Sources: functions taken from: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap6.html
