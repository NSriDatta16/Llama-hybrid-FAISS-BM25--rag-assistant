Am I understanding correctly that you want BirthAppointment to inherit from tblAppointment ? If this is the case, discrimnator property is a field in the database table that used to distinguish records that represent tblAppointment objects from BirthAppointment objects. As such, you can't use appCatId since it lives in another table ( tblAppointmentType ).
