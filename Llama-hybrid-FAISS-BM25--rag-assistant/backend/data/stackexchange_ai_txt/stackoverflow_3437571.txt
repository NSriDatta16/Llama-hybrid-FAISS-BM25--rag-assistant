I once worked at a job where they had a database of "locations". They called it states. and had everything in tables each table was named by state code. so Missouri was MO, and Arkansas was AR. Several state codes are also reserve words OR ( Oregon), and IN (Indiana), and ON (Ontario) ... I know not exactly a state. Even tho I think there were better ways of organizing their database data, there are cases where people want to name things a reserved word. This is an example where the `` marks kept code working.
