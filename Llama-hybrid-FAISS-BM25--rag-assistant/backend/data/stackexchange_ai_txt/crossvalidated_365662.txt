My neural network will run okay, but occasionally (every 1000) it provides an error.

I am using a neural network to forecast the direction of gold prices. I have created a neural network neuralnet within R. My programme runs well and i can get a prediction accuracy of about 51%. However, occasionally i get this error for my confusion matrix: Warning message: In confusionMatrix.default(as.factor(predicted), as.factor(actual)) : Levels are not in the same order for reference and data. Refactoring data to match I realize that this is due to the fact that my network has predicted all values to be 1 (with no 0). Why does my network make this mistake every so often? It happens quite often for h=1 and not so much for the other architectures.
