Drag and drop batch file for multiple files?

I am hoping to accomplish something similar to the below, but with pcutmp3: Drag and drop batch file for multiple files? I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the additions Joey made as I don't usually do this, but I am wanting to drop multiple files (.cue) on a batch file and have it run more than once, which is what is happening with the following lines in the batch file: @echo off title pcutmp3 cd /d "F:\pcutmp3" java -jar pcutmp3.jar --cue %1 --dir "F:\Test" pause exit I've tried adapting Joey's code... but to no avail (I have no clue what I'm doing) Thanks in advance for any help!
