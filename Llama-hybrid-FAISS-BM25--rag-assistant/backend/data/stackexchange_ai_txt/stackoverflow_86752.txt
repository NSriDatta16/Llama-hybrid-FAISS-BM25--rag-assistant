Can I see your User class? This is just using restrictions below. I don't see why Restrictions would be really any different than Examples (I think null fields get ignored by default in examples though). getCurrentSession().createCriteria(User.class) .setProjection( Projections.distinct( Projections.projectionList() .add( Projections.property("name"), "name") .add( Projections.property("city"), "city"))) .add( Restrictions.eq("city", "TEST"))) .setResultTransformer(Transformers.aliasToBean(User.class)) .list(); I've never used the alaistToBean, but I just read about it. You could also just loop over the results.. List rows = criteria.list(); for(Object r: rows){ Object[] row = (Object[]) r; Type t = (( ) row[0]); } If you have to you can manually populate User yourself that way. Its sort of hard to look into the issue without some more information to diagnose the issue.
