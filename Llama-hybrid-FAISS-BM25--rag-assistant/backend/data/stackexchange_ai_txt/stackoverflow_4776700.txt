If you're just looking for a way to represent your graph so you can get your job done, consider boost::graph. I have to do something mildly similar when I allow the user to drag one vertex onto another to merge them. The way I do it, and you'll probably have to do the same, is to keep track of the edges, store their description in a temporary (I have data attached to the graph), delete one of the vertexes (you'll probably have to do both), and then reconstruct the parts of the graph that need to be reconstructed...but now different.
