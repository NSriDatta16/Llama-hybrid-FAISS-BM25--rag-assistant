A time-to-event (event = completition) approach as suggested by @DemetriPananos does indeed sound sensible. I'd be tempted to use a parametric survival model (e.g. a Weibull, although perhaps something more complex would make sense, if you have a lot of data) rather than the Kaplan-Meier, simply because it can somewhat sensibly extrapolate beydond the observed durations and if there's extra explanatory covariates, you could also incorporate them (including if there is truly a suggestion that something has changed - as suggested in another answer -, then that could be a covariate). library(tidyverse) library(survival) example = read_csv("example.csv", col_names = F) %>% rename(time=X1) %>% mutate(status=1) sf1 = survfit(Surv(example $time, example$ status) ~ 1) plot(sf1) sf2 = survreg(Surv(time, status) âˆ¼ 1, dist="weibull", data=example) tibble(time=c(0,sf1 $time), surv=c(1,sf1$ surv)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=time, y=surv)) + geom_step(direction="hv") + geom_line(data=tibble(time=seq(0,250,0.1), surv=1-psurvreg(time, scale=sf2 $scale, mean=sf2$ icoef[1])), col="red") If you have prior information, you could also go Bayesian and incorporate it for a survival model (e.g. using the brms R package see this vignette ).
