Silverlight 2.0 RC Drag and drop ordering of a ListBox

I am trying to give a ListBox drag and drop ordering functionality and I have hit a wall. I got it to work when I specify the list box items in xaml but it does not work when I bind to a list it no longer works because the items are no longer of a listboxitem type. I found this code http://blog.dobaginski.com/josh/?p=52 that allows me to get the underlying ListBoxItem but I can't get the mouse move event to fire. I have went through other tutorials but have not been able to find one that deals with a ListBox. Has anyone done this with a ListBox. The events I am using are SelectedChange, MouseMove, and LeftMouseButtonUp (I think that name is right). I am not using LeftMouseButtonDown because I couldn't get it to fire.
