Generating extra data can sometimes help you train a neural net. (Adding noise layers is equivalent to generating extra data, since it fuzzes the existing data.) But you still need to have enough data to train, and to make an independent test. And in your case, you don't. In your case, with such a small dataset, really your only option is to use Bayesian methods. Have you any reasonable hypotheses about the process? e.g. is it likely to have a components with daily/weekly/annual periodicity? If so, you can make a reasonable prior distribution. If you have only 500 datapoints and no prior knowledge at all, then there isn't really any way forward.
