You'd look into using GridFS if you needed to store large files in MongoDB. Quote from the MongoDB documentation which I think sums it up well: The database supports native storage of binary data within BSON objects. However, BSON objects in MongoDB are limited to 4MB in size. The GridFS spec provides a mechanism for transparently dividing a large file among multiple documents. This allows us to efficiently store large objects, and in the case of especially large files, such as videos, permits range operations (e.g., fetching only the first N bytes of a file). There's also the GridFS specification here
