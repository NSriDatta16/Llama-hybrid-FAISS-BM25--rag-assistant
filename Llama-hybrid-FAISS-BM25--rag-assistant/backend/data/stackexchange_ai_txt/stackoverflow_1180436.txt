I believe you can be slightly more elegant than Alvaro's answer using options to has_and_belongs_to_many, though his answer is perfectly fine and will result in fairly identical functionality for any clients of your class. class TvShow "tvshowlinkepisode", :foreign_key => "idShow", :association_foreign_key => "idEpisode" end class Episode "tvshowlinkepisode", :foreign_key => "idEpisode", :association_foreign_key => "idShow" end Note that the :foreign_key option specifies which column is the id for the class on "this side" of the link, while :association_foreign_key specifies the column that is the id for the class on the "other side" of the link. Contrast this with Alvaro's answer, this pattern should avoid instantiation of any unnecessary objects to represent the link.
