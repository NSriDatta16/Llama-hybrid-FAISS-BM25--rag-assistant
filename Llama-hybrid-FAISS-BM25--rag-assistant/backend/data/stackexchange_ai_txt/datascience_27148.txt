I got a similar task. Maybe you can tune your trade-off by designing an appropriate cost function . Or, see F Score on wikipedia. Reinforcement learning could also have tools you are looking for, namely, means of rewarding 'acting only if sure'. See e.g. the intro in Sutton, Barto Or, try searching so called Conformal Prediction . Venn Prediction is an extension of the original Conformal Prediction framework... ... for producing well-calibrated probabilistic predictions. It provides well-calibrated lower and upper bounds for the conditional probability of an example belonging to each possible class of the problem at hand. This paper proposes five VP methods based on Neural Networks Keep us updated...
