I've never done this, but here's the approach I'd take. Inject a dll into explorer via SetWindowsHookEx . Grab a handle by using GetDesktopWindow . Subclass the Desktop using GetWindowLongPtr & SetWindowLongPtr . Do all your fancy rendering in the new WndProc you've hooked up. Be aware that breaking the Desktop window will probably lock up your machine, as all its decedent windows (read: every window for that User) will likely be adversely affected. Also, given the um rich compatibility history of Windows, be on the lookout for dummies meant to absorb abuse. In particular, I wouldn't be at all surprised if GetDesktopWindow does not in fact return the Desktop window you're looking for. You might have to do some digging with Spy++ or the like, basically.
