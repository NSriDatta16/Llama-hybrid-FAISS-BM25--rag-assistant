the best practice i have ever found is save the session data to database or a text file. the database will have user agent, and IP record and check it every request for ensure that the session never been hijacked by other. for example how session saved at database you can see the implementation at codeigntier session library. in my opinion this way fairly save to prevent someone to hijact session.
