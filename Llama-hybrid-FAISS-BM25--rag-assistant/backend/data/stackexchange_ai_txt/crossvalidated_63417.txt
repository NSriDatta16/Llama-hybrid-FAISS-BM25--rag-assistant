Difference Between Simultaneous Equation Model and Structural Equation Model

Can anybody please help me to understand the differences between simultaneous equations models and structural equation models (SEM)? It will be great if somebody can provide me some literature on it. Also, is there any literature where SEM has been used in time series contexts? The literature I'm getting mostly explains SEM in a cross-sectional data context.
