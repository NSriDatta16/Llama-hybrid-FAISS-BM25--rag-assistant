I'm not totally sure I understand what you're asking, but in general you can stuff fragments of HTML into some existing container like this: $('div#yourDiv').html(blob_of_HTML); You can load fragments of HTML from server-side actions with: $('div#yourDiv').load(yourURL, function() { // stuff to do when the content has been loaded }); If you've got a complete page, and you want to load just a part of it into another page, you can try this: $('div#yourDiv').load(yourUrl + ' #something', function() { // stuff to do ... }); That tells jQuery to take the loaded whole-page content, then look for "#something" inside that whole page, and only load that part of the page into the target container.
