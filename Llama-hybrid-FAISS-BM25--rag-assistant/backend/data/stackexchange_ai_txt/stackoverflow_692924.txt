How do I set up the JBoss Maven repository in NetBeans 6.5?

I tried to configure the Maven plug in (version 4) to add the JBoss Maven repository at http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/ following the guide at http://wiki.netbeans.org/MavenBestPractices#section-MavenBestPractices-UtilizingAndManagingMavenRepositories . The new repository appears in the list of Maven repositories, but I can not see any items (artifacts), updating the index does not help. It looks like a problem with the Maven plug in. Maybe it requires an ".index" subdirectory which is not available on the JBoss server.
