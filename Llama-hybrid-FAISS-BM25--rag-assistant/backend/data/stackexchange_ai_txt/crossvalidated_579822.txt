What is the name of the percentage that defines a prediction interval?

For example, say I'm creating a forecast for weather patterns and I am looking for a 95% prediction interval (essentially an upper and lower bound for that forecast); what is the name of that 95% parameter? Researching I've found 'confidence level', 'coverage probability', 'coverage of the interval', and have seen it directly referred to as 'prediction interval' (though seems the term would be overloaded if this were the case). Are any of these terms correct?
