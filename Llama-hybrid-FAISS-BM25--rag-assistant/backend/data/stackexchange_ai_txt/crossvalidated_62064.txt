How to best account for population sizes in disease outbreaks

Say one has the fatality and survivor rates of a pathogen in terms of geographical location (e.g., the latest data on the MERS-CoV ). France 2 (1) Italy 3 (0) Jordan 2 (2) Qatar 2 (0) Saudi Arabia 49 (32) Tunisia 2 (0) United Kingdom (UK) 3 (2) United Arab Emirates (UAE) 1 (1) ______________________________________ Total 64 (38) The total fatality rate is ~59%. However, I am not sure that this is a good measure: the rate for Saudi Arabia is ~65%, while the smaller cases have rates of 0 to 100%. My thoughts are that the size of the outbreak should weight the outbreak's impact on the overall rate. However, I don't think averaging the individual rates would be correct. Is there a more appropriate measure that would allow me to take the size of the outbreak into account when calculating the overall impact?
