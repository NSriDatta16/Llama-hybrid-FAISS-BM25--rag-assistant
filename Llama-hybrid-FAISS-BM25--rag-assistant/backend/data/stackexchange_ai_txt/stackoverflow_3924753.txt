Where does Windows store its "Open With" settings?

I'm trying to programmatically check file associations by the file extension (for example .jnlp files). I keep reading that HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\JNLPFile\Shell\Open\Command is the Registry key to check. However, if you change the association through Windows Explorer: Open With > Choose Program > (Always use the selected program) the change isn't at all reflected in this Registry key. Where else is this information stored?
