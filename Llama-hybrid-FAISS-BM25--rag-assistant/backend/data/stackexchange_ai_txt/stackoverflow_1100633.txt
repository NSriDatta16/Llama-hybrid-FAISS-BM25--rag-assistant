Thanks to Mike Stramba on the Squeak mailing list for the following:- Drag and dropping the morph on a workspace is good start (you have to click on the "square" in the workspace header, and turn on the "create textual reference to dropped morphs" option). Also when you create the morph it gets added to the current "desktop" (world) submorphs instance variable. You can MMB on the "desktop", click the debug tab and explore the current world. You'll see it's a PasteUpMorph. You can get all the PasteUpMorphs in the image with : p := PasteUpMorph allInstances, which returns an array of all the projects "desktops" in the image.
