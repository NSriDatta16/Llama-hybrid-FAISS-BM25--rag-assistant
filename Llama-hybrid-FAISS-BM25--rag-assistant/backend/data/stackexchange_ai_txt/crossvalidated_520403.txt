Recommended machine learning method to solve my problem in sequence prediction

I am pretty new to most algorithms and with there being so many out there, it is hard to choose as a beginner which one to use. Therefore, I am looking for some recommendations here. The problem is as follows: assume different series of treatments [T1, T2, T3] for a person. Now, every person can have a different set of treatments. My goal is to use the given data (so all the sets of completed treatment arrays) and predict the next treatment sequence for a new patient, which let's say is halfway through with its pathway. I was thinking about using an LSTM model, but frankly am curious what models could be of use and especially why . If someone can explain this clearly, it would be much much appreciated.
