Principles of time series analysis by neural network models

I can understand that, in the case of speech signals, words are correlated, and therefore one should have a reason to believe that RNNs or LSTMs could predict future observations by running some complex algorithm with weights and an activation function. But for random digital signals like stock prices, why can the prices be predicted in any way? Tomorrow's price has nothing to do with the prices that showed up in the past.
