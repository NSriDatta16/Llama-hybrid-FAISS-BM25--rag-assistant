Webdriver - Opening a new browser with the same profile

I am running some java tests for a web application with Webdriver on Firefox, trying to verify the functionality of a "Keep me logged in" button. Each time a new browser is launched, it is done so with a new profile. Is there a way to instruct it to open the new browser with the same profile as before, the one that logged in and pressed on "keep me logged in"? I'm sorry if the question doesn't make sense, I'm still a bit new at this. Thanks, Ragnar
