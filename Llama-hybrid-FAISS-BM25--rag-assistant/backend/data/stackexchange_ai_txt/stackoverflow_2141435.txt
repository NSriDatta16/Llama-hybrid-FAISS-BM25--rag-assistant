You got a lot of questions there, let me see if this will help ... You are correct that rails will trigger a sql call to get all results, and then active_record should filter out the unique records. If you want to avoid that you can do the following: has_many :states, :through => :geographies, :select => "DISTINCT states.*" This post has interesting analysis Also with your line: msas = Msa.find(:all, :include=>"states", :conditions=>{"states_locations"=>{"id"=>"1"}}) It is not returning unique results because you are not leveraging the relationships that you set up. You probably want to do something like: @msas = State.find(state_id).msas Good luck
