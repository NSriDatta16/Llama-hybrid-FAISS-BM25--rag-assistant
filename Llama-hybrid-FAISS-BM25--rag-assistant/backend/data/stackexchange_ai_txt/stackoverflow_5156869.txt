This is kind of a judgment call, but many "best practice"-type questions tend to be, at least at first. My opinion is that you should use one or the other within a single statement. Not really for any "danger" inherent in mixing, but for clarity. In this particular case, the where clause is very simple, and I would refactor it into query syntax. There are however cases that cannot be elegantly expressed in query syntax. In cases where it is simply unavoidable to mix syntaxes, the queries would (again IMO) be more readable if you split out the method chain into its own variable, then simply referenced that variable in the query-syntaxed statement. Using yours as a model: //The method chain can be pulled out as its own variable... var filteredParents = _myObject.ObjectsParent.ParentsEnumerable .Where(c => c == anotherObject || c.Parent == anotherObject); //...which you can then substitute in a now purely query-syntax statement from c in filteredParents from q in c.MyObjectsEnumerable orderby c.SortKey, q.Description select new { Item = q, Text = c.Description + " -> " + q.Description };
