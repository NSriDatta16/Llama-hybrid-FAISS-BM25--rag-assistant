My attempt. For a flower to sprout it needs to be closer to the trunk than all other current flowers. We define $X_i \sim Unif[0, 1]$ as then location of seed at day $i$ . For a flower to grow it needs to be smaller than all seeds until then current point. That is, define $Y_i = 1$ if the flower sprouted and $0$ else. Therefore, the probability for a flower to sprout is $$P(Y_i = 1) = P(X_i The minimum of uniform distribution is quite simple to find (assuming independence), define $M_i = min_{j . $$P(M m) = 1 - P(X_1 > t, \ldots, X_{i-1} > t) = 1 - (1 - m)^{i-1}$$ . The density is, $$f_M(m) = (i-1)(1-m)^{i-2}$$ Therefore, the expected value is, $$E(M) = \int_0^1 (i-1)(1-m)^{i-2} m dm = (i-1) \int_0^1 (1-t)t^{i-2}dt $$ Finally, we obtain $$ E(M_i) = \frac{1}{i}. $$ Note that this answer your question 2, the average location of a flower in day $n$ , will be $\frac{1}{n+1}$ (since we are looking at the extra day). Now, to question 1, the expected number of flowers will be (note we add 1 to deal with the first seed), $$ E(\sum_{i=2}^n 1 + (Y_i)) = \sum_{i=2}^n E(Y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n E(E(Y_i)|M_{i}) = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^n E(M_{i}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}.$$ Verifying the results using simulation, (using R): runDays Question 1, x Question 2, x Looks ok.
