I've used Doug Lea's PooledExecutor with great success to handle this kind of things. There's also the ExecutorService nowadays directly in Java 5 and newer. There were some comments that it is strongly discouraged to use your own threads in J2EE. Well, anytime you do threading yourself you have to be careful and this is no different really. I find the J2EE way of letting the server take care of everything a bit disturbing and don't like the way it is limiting the design choices you can take. Just my 50 cents...
