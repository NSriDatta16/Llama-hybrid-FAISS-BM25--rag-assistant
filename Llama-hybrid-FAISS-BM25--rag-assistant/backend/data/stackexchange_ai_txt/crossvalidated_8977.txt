I am sorry, as it may not be straight answer to your question, by if you are using this "total score" as a predictor of something why dont you try regression and evaluate the results with the AUC of ROC ? or the other way, maybe user Neural networks / Random Forest / Support Vector machines on them to predict given outcome ?
