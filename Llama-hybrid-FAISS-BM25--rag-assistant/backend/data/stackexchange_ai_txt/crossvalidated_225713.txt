How to compare ordered logistic nested models?

Let's say that I have a full and a restricted model that looks like this: Full I want to conduct F-tests to determine whether the information from the X4 variable statistically improves our understanding of Y. What command is convenient for carrying out this test for logistic regression? Is it aov() ? For example: summary(aov(Y ~ X1+X2+X3+X4)) #Full model summary(aov(Y ~ X1+X2+X3)) #Restricted model In linear regression case this would be the way to do it, I am not sure for ordered logistic regression...
