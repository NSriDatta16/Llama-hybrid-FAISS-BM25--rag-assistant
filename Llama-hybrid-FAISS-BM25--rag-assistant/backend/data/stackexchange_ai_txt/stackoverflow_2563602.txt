If you are looking for off site user authentication you might want to consider openid. People have added openid support to cherrypy . If you are looking for more user management type code. I guess it depends on exactally what you are doing but others have done user management before, why not leverage off them. Skeletonz is a CMS written on top of cherrypy. If you are not wed to cherrypy you might also want to consider Pinax . It's built on Django with the idea of reusing work others have done so you don't have to do it again.
