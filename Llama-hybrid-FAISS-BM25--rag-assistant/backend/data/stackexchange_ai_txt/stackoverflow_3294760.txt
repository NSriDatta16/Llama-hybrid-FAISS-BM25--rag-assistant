In addition to Mason's very nice answer. There is a great little class in Delphi that is often underappreciated, and one that you can learn a really nice technique from and thats the PageProducer class. Have a look at the way that it parses HTML and surfaces events on things like finding tags, attributes etc. I'm not saying use the PageProducer (because you won't be able to for Nexus) but its a very simple, elegant and powerful technique.
