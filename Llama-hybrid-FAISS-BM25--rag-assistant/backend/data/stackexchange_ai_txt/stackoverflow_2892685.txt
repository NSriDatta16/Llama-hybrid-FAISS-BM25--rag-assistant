Left Leaning Red-Black Trees . A significantly simplified implementation of red-black trees by Robert Sedgewick published in 2008 (~half the lines of code to implement). If you've ever had trouble wrapping your head around the implementation of a Red-Black tree, read about this variant. Very similar (if not identical) to Andersson Trees.
