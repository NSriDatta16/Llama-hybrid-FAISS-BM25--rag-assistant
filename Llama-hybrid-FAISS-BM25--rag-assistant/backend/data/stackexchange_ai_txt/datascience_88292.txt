When to use which multiple testing correction?

There are a large number multiple testing p-value correction methods. e.g.: bonferroni : one-step correction sidak : one-step correction holm-sidak : step down method using Sidak adjustments holm : step-down method using Bonferroni adjustments simes-hochberg : step-up method (independent) hommel : closed method based on Simes tests (non-negative) fdr_bh : Benjamini/Hochberg (non-negative) fdr_by : Benjamini/Yekutieli (negative) fdr_tsbh : two stage fdr correction (non-negative) fdr_tsbky : two stage fdr correction (non-negative) (based on https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests.html ) I have found a lot of pages that explain the methods individually (and why corrections are needed) but I have not found an overview of when to use which method e.g. a comparison table or even better a decision flow diagram as it exists for machine learning methods . Any ideas? How do I decide which multiple testing correction I should apply?
