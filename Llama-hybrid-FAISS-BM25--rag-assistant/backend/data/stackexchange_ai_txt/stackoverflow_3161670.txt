I haven't tested out the actual window size math; not sure if that's correct. But the first, obvious, problem you have is embedding the variables into the call to window.open. Try changing window.open("something.htm", "mywindow", "width=300, height=viewportheight, left=(viewportwidth - 300), top=0, screenX=0, screenY=0"); to window.open("something.htm", "mywindow", "width=300, height=" + viewportheight + ", left=" + (viewportwidth - 300) + ", top=0, screenX=0, screenY=0"); Basically, if you want the variables or the math to get resolved, they have to be outside the string.
