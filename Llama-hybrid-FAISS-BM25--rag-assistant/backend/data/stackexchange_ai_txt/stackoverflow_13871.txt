Depends a lot on the kind of queries you've got to parse and somewhat on the structure of the data in your database. I'm going to assume that you're not trying to do full text search in a DB (i.e. a search engine across your entire DB) because, as most Information Retrieval people will tell you, the performance for that is terrible. Inverted indexes are most certainly the best way of doing that. Tell us a bit more about the actual problem: what are the users going to input, what are they expecting as output, and what's the data model like. Design a search solution without those pieces of information, and you'll get a far from optimal result.
