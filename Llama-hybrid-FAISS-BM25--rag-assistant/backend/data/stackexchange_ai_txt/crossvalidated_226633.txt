Since it's been almost a week since I asked this I suppose I can answer for anyone coming by. I suspect you should go with (2). I believe this is true because normalization is based typically upon an average, or subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation or some variation on that. This means the normalization process is dependent on the moments of the column you're normalizing. In the example, I don't believe that the moving average done on the normalized wait time would be accurate because we would lose information on the moments by normalizing. As such, you need to normalize each column after generating all the data for analysis, rather than normalizing the "main column" you're analyzing and then applying analysis. I wish someone with more experience would confirm this for me, but until someone does, I believe this is correct.
