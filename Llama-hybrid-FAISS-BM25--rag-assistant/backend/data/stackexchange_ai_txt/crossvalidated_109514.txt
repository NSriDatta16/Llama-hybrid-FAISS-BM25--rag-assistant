auto.arima will do some things like use approximations, in order to speed things up. You can try using auto.arima(data, approx=FALSE, stepwise=FALSE) to turn off some of the approximating to deal with the error, which is likely caused by coefficients being close to the edge of the stationarity region. As a warning, this may take longer than normal. You could try just approx=FALSE first. You can use auto.arima(...)\$aic to get the actual value of the AIC, maybe it is very slightly smaller for $q=3$. As the values are almost exactly the same, it probably doesn't matter too much the value of $q$. If you think $q=2$ from "playing around", then $q=2$ is fine. Time series is not an exact science and there is a small amount of subjectivity involved. As long as you justify why you chose $q=2$ and you do the correct model diagnostics (for example, looking at the residuals), then there is no need to worry.
