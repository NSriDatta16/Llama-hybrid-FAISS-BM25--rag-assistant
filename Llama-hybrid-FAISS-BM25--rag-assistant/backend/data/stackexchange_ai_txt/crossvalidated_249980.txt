Is anyone stacking LSTM and GRU cells together and why?

TensorFlow allows you to create MultiRNNCell composed sequentially of multiple simple cells (LSTM and GRU). I usually use same type of cell when creating MultiRNNCell but I was wondering if there could be some benefits in using both LSTM and GRU? Does anyone have some experience with it or theoretical insights?
