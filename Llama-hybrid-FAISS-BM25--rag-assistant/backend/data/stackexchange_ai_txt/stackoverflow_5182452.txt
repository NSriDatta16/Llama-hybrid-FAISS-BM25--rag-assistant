Can we convert ISingleResult to IList

I started using LINQ to SQL recently. On my DMBL designer, I open the server explorer and drag a stored proc onto the designer. I open the properties for the Method in the designer and see that its return type is AutoGenerated. I look at the designer.cs class and it says the return type is ISingleResult . Can this be cast to IList ? I tried doing this and there are no compile time errors. I am trying to understand what a ISingleResult is and how it can be cast to IList .
