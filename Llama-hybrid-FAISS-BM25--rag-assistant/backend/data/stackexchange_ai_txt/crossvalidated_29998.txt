For univariate outliers there is Dixon's ratio test and Grubbs' test assuming normality. To test for an outlier you have to assume a population distribution because you are trying to show that the observed value is extreme or unusual to come from the assumed distribution. I have a paper in the American Statistician in 1982 that I may have referenced here before which shows that Dixon's ratio test can be used in small samples even for some non-normal distributions. Chernick, M.R. (1982)"A Note on the Robustness of Dixon's Ratio in Small Samples" American Statistician p 140. For multivariate outliers and outliers in time series, influence functions for parameter estimates are useful measures for detecting outliers informally (I do not know of formal tests constructed for them although such tests are possible). Look at Barnett and Lewis' text "Outliers in Statistical Data" for detailed treatment of outlier detection methods.
