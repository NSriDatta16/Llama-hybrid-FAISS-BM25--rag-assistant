Image Matching to solve captcha

I am building a bot with python and I need some system to solve captchas like these: I think I need a deep learning algorithm, but coding one is a pain in the ass. Is there any easy solution to this? I can code the part that screenshots the images and clicks on the correct answer, image 4 or 5 in the example. The images get rotated and change every time. Thank you!
