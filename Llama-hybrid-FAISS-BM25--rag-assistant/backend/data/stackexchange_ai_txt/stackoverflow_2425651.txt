select outgoing ip for curl request

I have a server with two different IPs. I need to send odd curl requests from first IP, and even from the second one. How can I select outgoing IP address? My PHP script is something like this: $curlh = curl_init($url); curl_setopt($curlh, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $uagent); curl_setopt($curlh, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); $result = curl_exec($curlh); How can I do so?
