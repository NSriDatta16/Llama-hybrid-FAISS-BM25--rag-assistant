XmlWriter.WriteRaw indentation

I have a similar question like XML indenting when injecting an XML string into an XmlWriter . I also use XmlWriter.WriteRaw to output an XML fragment into an xml node. This document fragment does not follow the idention which would be nice. The answer given on the post above does not work for XML fragments. Well, I can read the fragment with the XmlReader , but WriteNode does not work with document fragments (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1wd6aw1b.aspx ). Any hints on how to cheat to get proper indentation? Thanks for any hints
