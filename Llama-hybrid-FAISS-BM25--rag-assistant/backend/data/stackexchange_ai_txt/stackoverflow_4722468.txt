Shared variables among subclasses

I have a problem with inherited classes. Have a look at the following VB.NET 2.0 / VS 2005 code: MustInherit Class templateclass Public Shared x As String End Class Class child1 Inherits templateclass End Class Class child2 Inherits templateclass End Class The templateclass has a shared variable x which is of course inherited by the child classes. But I wonder that all child classes share only one x! Until now I thought that shared variables are only shared among the instances of a class, not among all childs. This is very annoying because I have a base class which I need in two slightly different versions and they should not "share the shared" variables. And because the classes have a lot of shared variables, shadowing each in the childs would be very... inelegant and cause a lot of work. Has anyone a better solution for this problem? Thanks in advance, Sagi
