They are all in different files, which means that they were different enough to group by file. Just take the same logic when building them into classes. I have a Page object that deals with building the page. Technically the HTML for my page header is part of the page, but I separate it into a Page_HTML class for maintaining my sanity and not creating gigantic classes. Also, I tend to make the sub_classes, like Page_HTML in this case, static, instead of instantiating it. That way I can access the $this variables in the Page class, but still group it into another class. class Page { function buildPage($content) { $content = Page_HTML::getHeader() . $content; } } class Page_HTML { function getHeader() { } }
