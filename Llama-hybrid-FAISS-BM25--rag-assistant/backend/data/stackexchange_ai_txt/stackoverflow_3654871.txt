Sounds like you've done the right thing though and tried to stay within the existing branch and now it is appropriate to fork. If nothing else, forking is a more powerful action than most other things i.e. if you fork and still don't get the original developer's attention then you can be satisfied that you did the right thing. Of course once forked, there's no real reason why there can't be some convergence at a later stage.
