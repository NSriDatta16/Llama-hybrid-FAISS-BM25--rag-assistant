Should I check Multicollinearity When There is An Inverse?

At Machine Learning algorithms there are usually inversion process about matrices and sometimes Matlab throws error when Multicollinearity occurs. Should I check Multicollinearity(and how) everytime before I inverse a Matrix (and use pseudo inverse - pinv)
