If I understand your question correctly, you want to find the best features to optimize your model's performance? I think what you're looking for is feature selection, which is an entire subject within machine learning/statistics. There is a whole tag on here about feature selection, you'd be better off asking your question with that. I would poke around a little online to learn more about feature selection, and if after that you still want help here you should provide more information about the problem you're trying to solve, the data you're working with, and more details about your model.
