First, I encourage you to say more about why "just comparing the grades is not enough." But more to your point, although the use of correlation is not out of the question, you and the people to whom you are reporting would no doubt be better off viewing the problem as one of group differences. Then your question becomes "Is Device A, on average, viewed more or less favorably than Device B?" For this, T -tests are the usual starting place. Or perhaps you have highly non-normal distributions, in which case means are not the best way to represent the typical score. In such a situation, you would want to test for differences using medians, or ranks. So you would want to get familiar with the techniques of Median tests and/or Mann-Whitney tests involving ranks. (Since the same group of 30 people have supplied each set of ratings, you have what are called "dependent sets of scores" and may need to look for a more specialized test that takes this into account. Others on this site will probably have ideas.) Another approach would be to average the 12 ratings, creating a single summary score for each person with regard to each device. This average would probably be normally distributed, and so you could use a single Dependent-Means T -test of differences. Just to make things confusing, this is also called a Correlated Means test. But if you are going to create such a summary score, you might want to check and see that it is an effective one, i.e., that all 12 component scores are correlated enough to "play their part" in forming the summary score. this is a reliability problem, so you could look into that as well. and one measure of reliability that would help you would be Cronbach's alpha.
