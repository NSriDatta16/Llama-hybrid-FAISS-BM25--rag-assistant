Messaging can certainly be one of the more elegant ways to go. However, it also requires a bit of work and will have to change over time as each database changes. We've taken the "easier" approach by simply having each application know how to logon to the other database, and then query each database from there. We've found that most of the cross database queries are pretty light and therefore do not pose a substantial code base in the second app. There is some duplication of select queries, but it has been less work than a messaging system would have been. It all depends on the degree to which you'll be pushing and pulling data around. If it is substantial, then messaging is the best way to go. If it is minimal, then perhaps a simple new connection to the other database is a way to go.
