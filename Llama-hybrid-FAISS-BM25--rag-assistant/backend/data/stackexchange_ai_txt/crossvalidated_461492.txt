Contradicting model of fits results in logistic regression?

For my master thesis I'm using a binary logistic regression to see whether Brand Type (= dummy) and Attitude towards the advertisement (= continuous) has an effect on the likelihood of people's Willingness to Recommend (DV). However, my model of fit results are contradicting (see below the results) The omnibus test indicates a significant result, which would indicate a good fit: χ2 (2) = 29,541, p = However, the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test is significant, which indicate a poor fit: χ2 (8) = 39,184, p = Also the Pseudo R-squares have low values Than again Wald test indicates that only 1 IV is significant. However, how do you interpret this significance? Because of the contradicting results of the model fit? Do you conclude that the model is not well at predicting (eventhough Brand Type is significant) the outcome variable as most of the results indicate poor results???? The full model:
