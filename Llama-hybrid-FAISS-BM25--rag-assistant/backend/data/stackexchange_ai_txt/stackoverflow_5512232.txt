You probably mean asprintf ? From the man page: Description The functions asprintf() and vasprintf() are analogues of sprintf() and vsprintf(), except that they allocate a string large enough to hold the output including the terminating null byte, and return a pointer to it via the first parameter. This pointer should be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed. Note that asprintf is a GNU extension, which is also found in various BSD implementations, but it's not in standard C or POSIX.
