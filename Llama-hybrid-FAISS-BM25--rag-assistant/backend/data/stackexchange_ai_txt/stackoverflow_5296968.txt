How to enable/disable MenuItem based on change in class variable

I have an options menu in an Activity with three MenuItems create select delete When there is no item currently selected I disable the MenuItem for delete. @Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) { super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu); final MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater(); inflater.inflate(R.layout.basic_menu, menu); this.deleteCharMenu = menu.findItem(R.id.basic_menu_deletechar); this.deleteCharMenu.setEnabled(this.current != null); return true; } However onCreateOptionsMenu is not called every time the menu is opened (try and error got me this result). So I stored the MenuItem in a class variable to be able to change its state whenever this.current changed its value. Is there a more elegant method to ensure that the correct MenuItems are enabled and disabled? I am hoping for some kind of listener I can use?
