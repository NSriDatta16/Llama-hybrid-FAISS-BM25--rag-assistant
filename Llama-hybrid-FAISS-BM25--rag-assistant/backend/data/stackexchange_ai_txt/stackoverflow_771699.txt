Different length of month? Which month should it take? the time span is not bound to a certain year or month in the year. You can only count the days between two dates: Timspan span = date2 - date1; Console.Writeline("Days between date1 and date2: {0}", span.Days); Counting from DateTime.MinValue just take the year 0001 as start and counts the months from January. I don't think that this is of practical use. EDIT: Had another idea. You can count the month since date1: // primitive, inelegant, but should work if date1 The problem here is that you just ignore the days. After all it's not a good solution.
