How to send email from android (using the default account)?

I would like to leverage the goggle account credentials belonging to the synced user on android to send emails in the background, it is possible to achieve that ? If not, is it possible to ask the user to send an email (with an intent) AND get the receiver's email ? maybe by calling startActivityForResult ? Cheers, Ze
