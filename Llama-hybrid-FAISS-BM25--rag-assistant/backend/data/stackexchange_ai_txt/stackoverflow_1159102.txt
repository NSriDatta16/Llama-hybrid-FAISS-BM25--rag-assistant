Flash CS4 - Component Inspector, properties always null?

I've created a small component in Flash CS4, and I have associated my MyComp symbol with it's respective MyComp class. The code in MyComp.as looks as follows: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class MyComp extends MovieClip { public function MyComp() { trace(this.test); } private var _test:String; [Inspectable(defaultValue="blah")] public function get test():String { return this._test; } public function set test(v:String):void { this._test = v; } } } When I drag the component to a test FLA, the component's properties are all showing up as per the Inspectable[] meta tag. But when I set the properties in the Component Inspector, the value is always null, despite what the Component Inspector says. When tracing for example test, it always outputs null? How do I get the Component Inspector's values to reflect in the component at runtime?
