McNemar's test is for paired data but CMH is not. What kinds of differences are you looking for? If you're interested in heterogeneity of the prevalence of the outcome, fit a logistic model with site effects for the reference values only (this will give you independent data). If you're interested in heterogeneity in the agreements, just mutually compare the 95% CIs for the matched ORs or fit a conditional logistic regression model.
