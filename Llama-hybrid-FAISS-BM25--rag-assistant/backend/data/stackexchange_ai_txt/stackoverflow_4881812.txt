Merging changes from multiple GIT repo's?

I'm pretty new to anything but the more basic features of GIT. Here's the scenario. I have multiple GIT repo's: Torque3D.git MyGame.git Torque3D.git houses the sources for Torque3D. Garage Games provides updates in the form of a source dump (no CSM access). As Garage Games provides updates, Torque3D.git is updated with those changes. MyGame.git is originally cloned from Torque3D.git and pulls those changes from Torque3D.git when appropriate. In this scenario I'm always pulling ALL changes from Torque3D.git. This works fine. However as we make changes to the engine in MyGame.git, we on occasion want to push just a specific change back to Torque3D.git, but not all changes that have ever been made to MyGame.git. How would we go about allowing for this kind of access?
