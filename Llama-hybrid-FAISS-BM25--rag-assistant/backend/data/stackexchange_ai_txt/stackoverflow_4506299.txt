ReSharper - Conditional Compilation XML comment errors

If I have the following code... #if PocketPC /// Indicates whether usage of the Windows Mobile 5.0+ GPS intermediate driver is allowed. private static bool allowGpsIntermediateDriver = true; /// Indicates whether the device detection thread is currently active. private static bool isDetectionThreadAlive; #endif ...ReSharper gives me "xml comment is not placed on a valid language element" errors. Sometimes these can be suppressed with #pragma but mostly they can't. Is there any way around this?
