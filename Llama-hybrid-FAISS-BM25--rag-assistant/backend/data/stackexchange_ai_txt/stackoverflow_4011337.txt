I believe that to really understand functional programming you must first reorganize all your knowledge about the ways to implement different things (e.g. you have to understand that objects may be represented as hash maps or even associative lists, not just as records). Also you will need to start thinking in terms of immutable data and pure functions (procedures of no side effect). Then you'll have to compare functional and procedural ways to implement and treat objects. All of this you can find in SICP - classical book for learning not only FP, but programming in general. To understand functional way you won't have to read all book, but at least first 3 chapters. After you understand main FP concepts and are able to implement anything in it's style, read any book on statically typed languages. E.g. Apress books on F# will be much easier to read.
