Depending on the intent of SWC file, you can just drag it into your Library, alongside all your other MovieClips etc. It seems to me that this is the way AS3Signals wants to be used - it's not a Flash "Component", per se. Adding it to the Components directory will only make it available in the Components panel, where you can easily drag it into your Library, or maybe onto the Stage (which has the same effect). Any progress or detail available?
