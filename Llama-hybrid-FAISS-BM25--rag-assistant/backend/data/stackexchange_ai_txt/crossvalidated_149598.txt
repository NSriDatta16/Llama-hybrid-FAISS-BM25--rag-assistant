Can boosting be thought of as a genetic algorithm?

Can boosting be classified as a genetic algorithm or as an instance of simulated annealing? Or, is it a completely different paradigm? Essentially, I'm trying to rectify discrete optimization methods with their counter parts in machine learning. Thanks! Also, if you can provide a reference, that'd be great.
