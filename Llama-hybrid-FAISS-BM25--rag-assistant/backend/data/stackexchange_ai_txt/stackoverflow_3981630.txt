Rodney, My understanding is that when you put an object in one of the two State Dictionaries (the one off of PhoneApplicationPage and the other off of PhoneApplicationServices) it does not immediately serialize or deserialize. If you use the Page.State to store data, it serializes your state bag when you leave the page, and deserializes when you return to the page (rather than when you add or read an object from the state bag). If you use the PhoneApplicationService.State, serialization happens when you tombstone and deserialization when the application is re-activated (though I'm not sure if this is tied to the PhoneApplicationService.Activated event or not). Page.State, by the way, doesn't allow sharing data between pages. Saving to PhoneApplicationService.State does allow you to do so. IsolatedStorage.AppSettings seems to handle deserialization problems silently, so I'm not sure when that happens. Serialization, however, occurs when you call Save(). James
