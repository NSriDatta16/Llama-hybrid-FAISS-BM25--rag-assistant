You're venturing into the world of numerical analysis, and here be dragons. Seemingly small differences in specification can make a huge difference in what is the right approach. I hesitate to make specific suggestions without a fairly precise description of the problem domain. It sounds superficiall like you are solving constrained linear problems that are simple enough that there are a lot of ways to do it but "..." could be a problem. A good resource for general solvers etc. would be GAMS . Much of the software there may be a bit heavy weight for what you are asking.
