How to capture DOM modifications with JavaScript and send them to a PHP server

I've been asked to create a web UI that allows a user to modify a specific section of the HTML DOM and then POST the modifications back to the server for storage. The modification should be done via drag'n'drop, with my tool of choice being jQuery. The server will be PHP, but written by someone else since I'm not a PHP programmer. The only way I can think to do this is to send back to the server the entire DOM section via AJAX whenever it is modified. However, that is expensive since the section could be quite large. Furthermore I'm not sure how I'd efficiently capture the modified section and write it to a string which can be sent to the server. Overlapping events would also be a big concern. Any ideas for a better approach? Are there libraries/tools (JavaScript or server-side) that I should be considering? Many thanks.
