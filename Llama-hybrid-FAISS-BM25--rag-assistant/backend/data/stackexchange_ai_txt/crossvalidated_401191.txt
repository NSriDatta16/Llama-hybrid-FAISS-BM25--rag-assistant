(Sorry, not enough reputation to add a comment.) Are you sure sequence analysis in required for your sort of problem? I'd suggest using time series analysis for interval variables (in case you're monitoring characteristics that can be projected on a numeric scale). This will help you to deal with missingness in an 'interval' way and apply various sorts of imputation methods like those mentioned here: Imputation methods for time series data . If you deal specifically with ordinal data (say, switching from state to state monitored periodically), the recommended way is to convert your data to patterns (sequences of states) and model transitions between patterns, with methods like Discrete Autoregressive mentioned here: Analysis of Ordinal Value Time Series .
