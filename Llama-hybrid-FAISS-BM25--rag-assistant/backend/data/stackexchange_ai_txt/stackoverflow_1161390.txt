The traditional solution is to use URLs. If the files all live in the same place, relative URLs will do very nicely. Navigating a link is as simple as opening the URL. If you want to point to things inside the target document, there are W3C standards - XPointer and XLink - but i don't think they're well supported by tools. You might just write such links as a combination of a URL and an element ID or an XPath expression - you could put the ID or XPath in the fragment identifier of the URL.
