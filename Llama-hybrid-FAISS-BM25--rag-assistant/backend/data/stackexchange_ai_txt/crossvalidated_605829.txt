How do I modify logistic regression in my case (for repeated measures)?

I am a physician conducting some research in Critical Care patients (I have full ethical approval, none of my results will be used to inform patient treatment, etc). When a person's lungs are enormously sick, they can be turned on their front. It often helps. I have a dataset from around 135 patients who have had this maneuver performed. I am trying to create a logistic regression model (if appropriate) to examine if there are differences in the response of patients who undergo this. My outcome variable is 'death during ICU admission' (yes/no), and I have blood tests from before and after the positioning maneuver was performed. Each patient had between 1-13 of these changes in position performed (in total I have 360 instances of this happening in 135 patients). As far as I am aware, it is inappropriate for me to perform logistic regression since the 'treatment' was often performed multiple times on each patient. My question is as follows; do I need to modify my approach to logistic regression to analyze this data? Alternatively, is there a completely different approach I must use to do this?
