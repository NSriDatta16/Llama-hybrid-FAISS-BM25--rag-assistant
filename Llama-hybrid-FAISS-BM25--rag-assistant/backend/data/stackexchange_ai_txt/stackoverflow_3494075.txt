You can add a class to EVERY table cell where you'll have the price to compute VAT like and then do something like on the first press button $('priceCell').each(function(index) { $(this).text() = calculateVAT($(this).text()); }); Where calculateVAT is a function javascript who calculates VAT. As this solution performs float point calculation on a number that could be rounded, another possible elegant solution is to add an hidden column with VAT-added totals and the button just switch between the two columns
