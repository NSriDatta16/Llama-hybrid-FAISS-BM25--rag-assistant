It's hard to say without seeing the code- However, Resources.NotFoundException usually means you tried to look up an asset (think R.layout.xx, R.drawable.xx, etc) incorrectly. That said, I tried writing a small app using your layout XML, and the compiler yelled at me for hardcoding strings as the ID's when I copied in your XML code to test it out. Try switching the values of the android:id attribute to read like this: android:id="android:id="@+id/frag1" that might fix the issue.
