Can I redistribute the Microsoft T4 Engine with my product?

I'm generating code dynamically, currently using String.Format and embedding placeholders - but reformatting the C# code for use as a template is a pain, and I think using a T4 template would be better. However, the code generation will be happening on a running system, so I need to know that I can safely and legally redistribute the Microsoft T4 Engine with my product. Anyone else done this? Or know the (legal) answer?
