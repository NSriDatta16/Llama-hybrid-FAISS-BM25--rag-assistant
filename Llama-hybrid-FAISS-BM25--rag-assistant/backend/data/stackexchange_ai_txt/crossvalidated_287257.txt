Probabilities of medical risks

Recently, I read a UK Supreme Court judgment Montgomery (2015), a judicial decision advocating patient's dignity and safety. The Court held that no matter how small the percentage of a certain risk of harm/damage relating to certain clinical procedure (e.g. the risk of brachial plexus injury in case of shoulder dystocia involving diabetic mothers (delivering the baby vaginally), is just about 0.2%), if (1) the risk could, if materialised, cause serious harm to the patient, and (2) a reasonable patient, if properly warned, would attach significance to it, a healthcare provider is duty bound to disclose that risk to the patient. That risk, in legal definition, is material, even though statistically speaking, negligible (too small in terms of number/percentage). I like this judicial decision very much as it really respect patients' dignity and care about patients' safety. After all, common sense! We used to see healthcare providers, as part of medicine culture, ordinary relying upon statistical figures to explain for their failure to disclose material risks of harm to patients, claiming that the relevant risk was just negligible (in figure), not worth mentioning. As a result, denying patients rights to make informed decisions very important to their own health, at times, resulting in some serious and sad consequences. Now I know how the judges approach this question of healthcare providers' clinical decision making. I want to know, on the other hand, how statisticians and mathematicians would approach the same question: statistical figures naturally lead many healthcare providers to feel confident in choosing their favorite "gold standard" clinical procedures, most if not all invasive and have the potential however small to cause serious harm (especially when the relevant published incident rate was small). Are healthcare providers correct in applying statistical figures that way in their everyday clinical decisions on individual patients? I heard about Bayesian and Frequentist approach but I don't know if they are relevant to the question I asked cos' I'm just a sport medicine student without any training in statistics. I would be most grateful if someone may enlighten me in this regard. Thanks in advance!
