NetApp has supported deduplication (that's what its called in the storage industry) in the WAFL filesystem (yeah, not your common filesystem) for a few years now. This is one of the most important features found in the enterprise filesystems today (and NetApp stands out because they support this on their primary storage also as compared to other similar products which support it only on their backup or secondary storage; they are too slow for primary storage). The amount of data which is duplicate in a large enterprise with thousands of users is staggering. A lot of those users store the same documents, source code, etc. across their home directories. Reports of 50-70% data deduplicated have been seen often, saving lots of space and tons of money for large enterprises . All of this means that if you create any common filesystem on a LUN exported by a NetApp filer, then you get deduplication for free, no matter what the filesystem created in that LUN. Cheers. Find out how it works here and here .
