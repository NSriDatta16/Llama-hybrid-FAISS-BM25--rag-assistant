It is not possible to save The Combox items if the user exits your application if you use that Comboboc.Items.Add in Runtime. The only way is that you may need to have Storage(Database) and store those items in it. After that bind it to your combobox. E.G: private void SaveItemtoCombobox() { //save method stuff } private void LoadDatatoCombobox() { cmbBox1.DataSource = source; cmbBox1.DisplayMember = "MyTableName"; } Regards
