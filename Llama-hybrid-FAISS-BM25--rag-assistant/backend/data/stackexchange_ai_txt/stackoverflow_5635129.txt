You should not use GET for this kind of action at all as GET is considered as being a safe method : [â€¦] the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". Use a POST form instead where you can use a hidden form control for the ID: Apart from the safe method reason, using POST instead of GET is also not that vulnerable against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks . At that point you should also think about using so called CSRF tokens to further reducing the chances of successful CSRF attacks.
