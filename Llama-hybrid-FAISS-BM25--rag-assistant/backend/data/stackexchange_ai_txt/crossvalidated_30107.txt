This is actually an extremely sophisticated problem and a tough ask from your lecturer! In terms of how you organise your data, a 1070 x 10 rectangle is fine. For example, in R: > conflict.data head(conflict.data) confl country period landdeg popincrease liveli popden NDVI NDVIdecl1 NDVIdecl2 1 1 1 1 Type1 1 0 Low 113.4744 0 1 2 1 2 1 Type2 1 1 High 103.2979 0 0 3 0 3 1 Type2 1 1 Med 109.1200 1 1 4 1 4 1 Type2 0 1 Low 112.1574 1 0 5 0 5 1 Type1 0 0 High 109.9875 0 1 6 1 6 1 Type1 1 0 Low 109.2785 0 0 > summary(conflict.data) confl country period landdeg popincrease liveli popden NDVI NDVIdecl1 NDVIdecl2 Min. :0.0000 1 : 10 1 :107 Type1:535 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 High:361 Min. : 68.71 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 2 : 10 2 :107 Type2:535 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 Low :340 1st Qu.: 93.25 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 Median :1.0000 3 : 10 3 :107 Median :1.0000 Median :1.0000 Med :369 Median : 99.65 Median :1.0000 Median :0.0000 Mean :0.5009 4 : 10 4 :107 Mean :0.5028 Mean :0.5056 Mean : 99.84 Mean :0.5121 Mean :0.4888 3rd Qu.:1.0000 5 : 10 5 :107 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:106.99 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 Max. :1.0000 6 : 10 6 :107 Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 Max. :130.13 Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 (Other):1010 (Other):428 > dim(conflict.data) [1] 1070 10 For fitting a model, the glm() function as @gui11aume suggests will do the basics... mod ... but this has the problem that it treats "country" (I'm assuming you have country as your 107 units) as a fixed effect, whereas a random effect is more appropriate. It also treats period as a simple factor, no autocorrelation allowed. You can address the first problem with a generalized linear mixed effects model as in eg Bates et al's lme4 package in R. There's a nice introduction to some aspects of this here . Something like library(lme4) mod2 would be a step forward. Now your last remaining problem is autocorrelation across your 10 periods. Basically, your 10 data points on each country aren't worth as much as if they were 10 randomly chosen independent and identicall distributed points. I'm not aware of a widely available software solution to autocorrelation in the residuals of a multilevel model with a non-Normal response. Certainly it isn't implemented in lme4. Others may know more than me.
