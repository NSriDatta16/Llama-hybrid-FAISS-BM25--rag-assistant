showing extra information in an html5 meter element; nesting elements within the meter?

I am using the meter element to show a score between 1 & 10, and in the newest webkit browsers, it looks fantastic. I would now like to show the average score, as well. While it's useful to know that my submission received a 6 out of 10, it would be even more useful to know that the average for this magazine so far is a 5. Unfortunately, the slew of available attributes for the meter tag does not include "average". I want to show a simple vertical line at the average value. I thought perhaps I could put a span or a div inside the meter, make it display: block, and give it a 100% height, a 50% width, and a border-right. Unfortunately, Chrome 11 doesn't even allow me to nest block elements within the meter, my preliminary investigations indicate. I'd be willing to use JS to display the vertical line if I had to (when I originally envisioned this feature I thought I'd be using entirely JS), but the meter tag is so delightful that I refuse to not use it now.
