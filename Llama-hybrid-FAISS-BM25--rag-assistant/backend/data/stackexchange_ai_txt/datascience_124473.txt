Are there other pre-trained time series transformers than TimeGPT?

I am looking for pre-trained transformers trained on time-series data to use for transfer learning (for forecasting). I found TimeGPT, and it does claim in this paper to be the first foundation model. However, that is a claim I am skeptical of; The claim in the abstract is very broad. Are there any others?
