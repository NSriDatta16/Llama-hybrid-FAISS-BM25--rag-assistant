I know that I could obviously solve this by always passing isLinux as a parameter to getUserInput, but this complicates the usage of this method and makes it less intuitive. Actually using global variables complicates the usage of this program waaaay more than a simple parameter. try something like: debug = getUserInput(isLinux=True) Here's some other suggestions You mention there are lots of parameters that you'll change often. Should these be hard coded? Try using a configuration file , or passing a dict() from 'flow' as a parameter. That way you have a central place to change common variables without having to dive in! your 'flow/helper' class sounds like a Controller/Model paradigm. This is good. But your model shouldn't have to import your controller. These aren't suggestions specific to 'pythonic style' these are general programming practices. If you're concerned about program design try reading The Pragmatic Programmer , they have great tips for workflow and design. There's also Code Complete which Roberto suggested.
