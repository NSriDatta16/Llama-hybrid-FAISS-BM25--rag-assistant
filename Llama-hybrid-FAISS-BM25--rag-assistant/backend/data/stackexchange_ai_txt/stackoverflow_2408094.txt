How to achieve multiple grids like the SQL server Results pane

I'm having problems with my project once again :( The front end is C# I need to support multiline querying like MS SQL server and when these queries are executed, naturally there are going to be multiple result sets. Getting the datatables respective to the results is not a problem, but how do i make it appear like its done in MS SQL server. One result set below the other and with a scroll bar? Should i bind it to a datagrid? If so how can i bind multiple tables to a datagrid ? and will it generate the scrollbars and the columns automatically? If i am not clear, please let me know and i'll try to be more clearer. ps: If anyone knows how this can be done with the XtraGridControl in devexpress that would be awesome ! :D
