You are correct that the method used in the solution to the average tree size question is simpler. This is found in Ross' text $\it Introduction \ to \ Probability \ Models,$ 8th Edition. I will follow the approach given there. Let $T_n$ be the number of trials needed to get $n$ consecutive successes, where the probability of success is $p.$ Let its expected value be $M_n.$ Conditioning on $T_{n-1},$ $$M_n = E[T_n] = E \left[ E \left[ T_n|T_{n-1} \right] \right]$$ Now consider that if you have had $n-1$ successes, you either reach your goal on the next trial or you restart: $$E \left[ E \left[ T_n|T_{n-1} \right] \right] =(T_{n-1}+1)(p)+(T_{n-1}+1+E[T_n])(1-p)$$ This simplifies to $$ E \left[ E \left[ T_n|T_{n-1} \right] \right] =T_{n-1}+1+(1-p)E[T_n].$$ Taking the expectation of both sides gives $$M_n = M_{n-1} + 1 + (1-p)M_n,$$ which gives the recursive $$M_n = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{M_{n-1}}{p} $$ But the time $T_1$ until the first success is geometric and so we know $$M_1 = {{1} \over {p}}$$ So $$M_2 = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{1}{p^2}$$ and in general $$M_n = \dfrac{1}{p} + \dfrac{1}{p^2} + \cdots + \dfrac{1}{p^n}$$
