Seeking feedback on the interpretation and reporting of a glmm output

This might be a very beginner level question. I have fitted a model with glmmTMB R package, considering the interactive effect of mean wind speed and average daily rain as well as an interactive effect of mean temperature and mean relative humidity on plant disease severity. Here is my fitted model mod1 Here is the model output. Formula: disease_severity ~ mean_rh * mean_temp + mean_ws * avg_daily_rain + (1 | year) Data: dat_seasonal AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid -41.9 -27.4 29.9 -59.9 28 Random effects: Conditional model: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. year (Intercept) 0.7874 0.8874 Number of obs: 37, groups: year, 11 Dispersion parameter for beta family (): 7.03 Conditional model: Estimate Std.

Can I say that the predictors mean_rh and mean_temp had a significant positive effect individual effect (effect on their own). The predictors mean_ws and avg_daily_rain had no significant effect on their own? There was a signficant negative interaction effect of mean_rh & mean_temp as well as a significant positive interaction effect of mean_ws and avg_daily_rain . For plotting, I just need to plot interactive terms of my model. Plotting individual effects alone would be misleading. For example, if I'm using ggeffects package. Figure 1 In summary, it's okay to report individual as well as interactive effects (main & interaction effect). But it is NOT okay to plot main effects alone in my case. Is that right? Edit: Thank you very much for the feedback @EdM. I am editing the question based on the test you suggested, so all can benefit. I ran car::Anova(mod1) on my model and I got the following output. Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II Wald chisquare tests) Response: disease_severity Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) mean_rh 0.0535 1 0.817057 mean_temp 0.2366 1 0.626650 mean_ws 1.1419 1 0.285252 avg_daily_rain 9.8801 1 0.001671 ** mean_rh:mean_temp 5.1498 1 0.023249 * mean_ws:avg_daily_rain 4.8148 1 0.028217 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 This output suggest significant interaction effect of the interactive terms as shown in the original model above. However, it doesn't give a positive or a negative sign, but I assume there is a significant negative interaction effect of mean_rh:mean_temp and a significant positive effect of mean_ws:avg_daily_rain as shown in the original model above? So if need to report this, I'd report that there was a positive main effect of avg_daily_rain and significant interaction effect of mean_rh:mean_temp & mean_ws:avg_daily_rain . Is that right? Regarding overfitting, I fitted the same model (but excluded random effect of year) using beta regression as shown below. mod2 The output of interactive effects is the same as mod1 (above model with random effect) Call: betareg(formula = disease_severity ~ mean_rh * mean_temp + mean_ws * avg_daily_rain, data = dat_seasonal) Standardized weighted residuals 2: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.8117 -0.9641 -0.0679 0.9726 1.8027 Coefficients (mean model with logit link): Estimate Std.

Interaction effects are the same in both models, but wind speed became significant too after running car::anova on the second model. The study was conducted in 11 years.
