Statistics and machine learning references which require functional analysis background

I am doing a PhD in functional analysis, particularly Banach space theory. Thinking of my future prospect, I would like to venture myself into statistics. However, as I do not want to 'waste' my background, I would like to search for statistics or machine learning which requires functional analysis to understand its underlying concepts. I found Bickel et al. Efficient and Adaptive Estimation for Semiparametric Models , Tsiatis's Semiparametric Theory and Missing Data and Small et al. Hilbert Space Methods in Probability and Statistical Inference . Note that I know functional analysis is required for stochastic calculus, theoretical probability, browninan motion, etc. But I am more interested in statistics. I also found that similar question was posted reddit . It would be good if someone can suggest some statistics books that require functional analysis background.
