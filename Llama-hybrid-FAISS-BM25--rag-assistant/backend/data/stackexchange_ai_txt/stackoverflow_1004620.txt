phxsoftware System.Data.SQLite DbDataReader misbehaving

The following post relates to the System.Data.SQLite data provider by phxsoftware ( http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com ) I have a question (and possibly a problem) with DbDataReader’s Read method and/or Visual Studio 2008. In many examples I see things like the following (and I know this code doesn't make a lot of sense ... but it serves a purpose): DbDataReader reader = null; Long ltemp = 0; lock (m_ClassLock) { DbCommand cmd = dbCnn.CreateCommand(); cmd.CommandText = “SELECT col1 FROM table1”; reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(); if (null != reader) { while (reader.Read()) { ltemp += (long)reader[0]; } } reader.Close(); First question - What I dont understand from this example is am I missing data the first time through the while loop by calling reader.Read() upfront? For instance, if the reader has values (3,5,7,9) the returned reader from cmd.ExecuteReader() should be pointing at 3 initially, correct? reader.Read() would then move to 5, 7, and 9 on subsequent invocations within the while loop. But, because reader.Read() is invoked before the first "ltemp += ..." line am I skipping past the first result (3)? Second question - (and I'm starting to think this might be a bug in VS) If I step through this set of code in the debugger when I stop at a breakpoint on the "if (null != ..." line I can clearly see mu mousing over and drilling down in the popup that reader has multiple row data values assigned to it. However, if I close that popup information, and then try to bring it back up, when I drill down I now see the line "Enumeration yielded no results" where there was clearly data before. Can anyone explain this behavior?
