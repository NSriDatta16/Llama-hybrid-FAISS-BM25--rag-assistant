Actually, the null hypothesis of a portmanteau test on residuals is "$\rho_1=\rho_2=...=\rho_L=0$" where $\rho_l$ is the correlation of the noise between $\epsilon_t$ and $\epsilon_{t-l}$. Thus, if $L=6$, then a small p-value (column "Pr>Chisq") indicates it is difficult to accept the hypothesis of an independently distributed noise (until 6 time lags). As a result, the model (here, an AR(1) process) does not seem to take into account all the dynamic of the time series. In the displayed example, the noise seems to have signifant autocorrelations between 1 and 3-4 (Columns "Autocorrelations"). Thus, an AR(4) could be more appropriate. However, an other test has to be performed before to be sure! Another method is to use some BIC or AIC criteria to compare autoregressive models.
