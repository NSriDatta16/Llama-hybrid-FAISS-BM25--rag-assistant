How can I copy table cells in excel style using jQuery?

excel has a nice feature which allow that cells to by copied by a mouse drag and drop.The same functionality is offered by Google spreadsheet. I can't grasp the Googles JavaScript code and figure out how they've done it. Is this functionality something that the jQuery framework provides? I would appreciate any information: jQuery keywords/functions/plugin, pseudocode, link etc.
