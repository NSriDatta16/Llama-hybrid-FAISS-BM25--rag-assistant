1. Why are the PI outputs (gray lines) so different for certain setups like the below? You've astutely observed that the PI outputs (represented by the gray lines) can vary significantly depending on the specific model setup and data characteristics. Several key factors influence this variability: Model Uncertainty: The inherent uncertainty of the model directly impacts the width of the PIs. Higher model uncertainty generally leads to wider intervals. Data Variability: The more variability present in your data, the wider the PIs tend to be. The model needs to account for a broader range of possible outcomes. Bootstrapping Iterations : The number of bootstrapping iterations specified by n_boot plays a crucial role. Using only ten iterations might not be sufficient to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty. Consider increasing this value to stabilize the PIs. Quantile Choice: The specific quantiles selected ( 10th and 90th percentiles in your case) affect the width of the PIs. Opting for wider intervals, such as the 5th and 95th percentiles, will naturally result in broader PIs. 2. How final PI output (pink interval) is computed out of the rest of Bootstrapped PIs? Computation of the Final PI: The final PI output (represented by the pink interval in your reference image) is typically computed by aggregating the PIs generated from each bootstrapping iteration. Here's how the process usually works: You have a set of bootstrapped predictions at each forecasting step. For example, you might have 100 bootstrapped predictions per step. The desired percentiles are calculated from these predictions independently for each step. For a 95% PI , you would compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. The final PI for each step is then represented by the lower and upper percentiles obtained in the previous step. This aggregation process allows you to construct the final PI by leveraging the information from all the bootstrapped iterations. Increasing PI Width over the Forecasting Horizon The observation that the PI distribution widens as you move further into the future is a natural consequence of increasing uncertainty. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors: Limited Information: As the model makes predictions further away from the last observed data point, it has less reliable information to work with. The further into the future you go, the more the model has to rely on its own predictions rather than actual data. Error Propagation: Any errors or uncertainties in the model's predictions at earlier steps will propagate and accumulate as you move forward in time. This compounding effect leads to broader PI distributions for later forecasting horizons. Increasing Plausible Range: With each additional step into the future, the range of plausible values for the target variable expands. The model needs to account for a broader set of possible outcomes, resulting in wider PIs. In summary, the variability in PI outputs, the computation of the final PI, and the increasing PI width over the forecasting horizon are all inherent characteristics of the bootstrapping approach used in skforecast . Understanding these nuances is crucial for interpreting and effectively utilizing prediction intervals in your time-series forecasting tasks.
