I don't think that people have discovered a really good way to combine non-sequence information with time series information in an LSTM. There are a few things that you can do though. One is to just feed in your non-sequence information at every time step even though it is constant over time. See this paper by Mikolov and Zweig where they feed in topic information at every timestep of a language model.
