Dynamically select a comparison operator (>=, <=, etc) in a conditional?

if (foo >= bar) baz(); But let's say sometimes baz(); needs to be run when foo , or foo == bar ... and let's say that this comparison operator is grabbed from, say, a db table, and placed into a variable: $param = ">=" . Is there any way you could modify the first line to use $param , besides a switch-case with multiple if statements? In my code, baz(); spans about a whole bunch of lines, and would become an organizational nightmare were I to manage it by hand.
