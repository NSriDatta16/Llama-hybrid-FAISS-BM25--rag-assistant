tmp does not get the expected value after thread join because creating a boost::thread object copies all arguments to thread storage ( see documentation ). You must encapsulate tmp with boost::ref , which has the effect of providing a "copy-constructible reference" (sorry if the terminology is inadequate, but that's the idea) double tmp = -42.0; boost::thread up(&analyser::findup,*this, startwl,max, boost::ref(tmp)); More on the Thread Management documentation
