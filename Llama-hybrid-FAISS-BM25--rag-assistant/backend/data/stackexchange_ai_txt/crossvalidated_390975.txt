Compare expectancies of count data following poisson distributotion

I have some count data for different groups (average number of goals per league - football, assuming they follow Poisson distribution). I want to see if there is statistical significance in the difference between average number of goals per league, and perhaps do some pairwise comparisons. Apparantly I cannot use anova, assumptions are totally violated. What test ahould I do!
