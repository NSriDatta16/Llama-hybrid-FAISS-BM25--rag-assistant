AJAX Using a REST API Without Server Side Framework

I am building a REST based API (Read only) for accessing services of my application. I plan on writing a web application that will leverage these APIs to provide basic information on the status of the application. I plan to use AJAX (using jQuery) to show the information. Originally I planned on using Grails, Spring MVC, RoR or one of the web frameworks to handle the back end of my application. The REST APIs I will be providing though are already built on a stanalone REST framework so I would only be leveraging the web framework for the core application and not the business logic. In the future, I might need the server side framework to handle other tasks but for now most of the work is done in the REST APIs. My question is, should I bother with using a web application framework on the server side? I should be able to make all the API calls I need from AJAX directly from the browser. I cannot think of much I would need to do on the server side. Would it make sense to have the application be standard HTML + AJAX + REST?
