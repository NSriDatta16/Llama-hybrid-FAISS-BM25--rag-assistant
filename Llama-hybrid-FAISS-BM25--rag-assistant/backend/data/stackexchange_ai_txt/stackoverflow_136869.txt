Something that would help on clarification would be is this an internal company application or something that will be on user's personal computers. Typically when it comes to computers that are owned by the company, if the company decides to do monitoring, it is their choice. Disclosure of the monitoring is often encouraged in an effort to be open and honest, but is not mandatory. A user should not have any expectation of privacy when using equipment owned and managed by the company. This is not just a matter of custom built applications, but also web browsing, email, phone conversations, etc. If you are using company resources then you are releasing your privacy. If this is an application going to users outside of the company, then yes it is wrong without permission by the users.
