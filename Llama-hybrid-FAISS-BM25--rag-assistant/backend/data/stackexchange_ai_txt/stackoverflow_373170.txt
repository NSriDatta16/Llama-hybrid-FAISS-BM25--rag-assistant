When I go to the control panel of my webhost, open up phpMyAdmin, and click on "Show MySQL runtime information", I get: This MySQL server has been running for 53 days, 15 hours, 28 minutes and 53 seconds. It started up on Oct 24, 2008 at 04:03 AM. Query statistics: Since its startup, 3,444,378,344 queries have been sent to the server. Total 3,444 M per hour 2.68 M per minute 44.59 k per second 743.13 That's an average of 743 mySQL queries every single second for the past 53 days! I don't know about you, but to me that's fast! Very fast!!
