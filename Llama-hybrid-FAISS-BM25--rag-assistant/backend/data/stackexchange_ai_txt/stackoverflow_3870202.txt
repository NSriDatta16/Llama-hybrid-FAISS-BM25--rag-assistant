Actually, the behaviour of jScrollPane is correct and expected when it sets the height of the drag. This is because as with native scrollbars the height of the drag is proportional to the amount of content that needs to be scrolled. If you want to fix the height of the drag and override this behaviour then use the dragMinHeight and dragMaxHeight setting properties (set them both to 16px in your example) if you are using jScrollPane version 1. If you are using version 2 (recommended) then please see this example: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/drag_size.html
