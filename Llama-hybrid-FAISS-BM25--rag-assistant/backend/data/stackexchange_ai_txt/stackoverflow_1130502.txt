Why is the advanced search not working with price criteria in magento?

The advanced search with all the default product attributes are working fine and gives the desired result except for the price criteria where even if i fill the values with the correct range and price that is present in the product list, the message "No items were found using the following search criteria" is displayed.I tried printing the query that is in the model class within function getProductCollection(), and it seemed ok.Also in the query I checked if all the required attributes are selected and that also seemed fine..Can someone please give me some suggestions to solve this problem?
