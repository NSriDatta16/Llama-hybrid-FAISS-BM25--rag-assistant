listbox selectionmode = multiextended how to get rid of selecting items with mousekey down

When Setting the listbox selectionmode to multiextended I observed three ways to select items: pressing mouse key while holding shift key pressing mouse key while holding ctrl key pressing mouse key while moving mouse over unselected item 1 and 2. is exactly the behaviour I want but I dont' want 3. because later I want to rearrange items by moving all selected items up and down with the mouse. How to get rid of 3. ? I need a behaviour just like the playlist in Winamp. Rearrange items by dragging and copy paste items
