HMM's are the simplest form of Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Have a look at this tutorial paper which starts by defining HMM's and then talks about Bayesian Networks before finally introducing Dynamic Bayesian Networks. It is indeed hard to define a generative model since you need to model the joint probability distribution from which (you would hypothesize) your dataset was drawn. Since calculating the joint probability distribution is not computationally possible in most cases, we make independence assumptions. In a temporal setting, as you point out, one of the simplest assumptions to make is the Markov condition. There are Dynamic BN's that make less simplifying assumptions compared to HMM's but then they are much more difficult to fit computationally.
