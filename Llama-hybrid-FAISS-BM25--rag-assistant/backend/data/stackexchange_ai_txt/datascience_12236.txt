I asked a similar question a couple weeks ago and got some good feedback. One of the answers to my question is also from Robert de Graaf, here's the link: Tips for a new data scientist It seems like the first task is often just collecting the data from various sources and cleaning it. Based on my limited experience, I think that is a good place to start and can actually take quite a bit of time. Once the data is organized, moving on to data visualization/exploration will help you get a feel for the data. Kaggle has some good data visualization tutorials and I will post one if I find it.
