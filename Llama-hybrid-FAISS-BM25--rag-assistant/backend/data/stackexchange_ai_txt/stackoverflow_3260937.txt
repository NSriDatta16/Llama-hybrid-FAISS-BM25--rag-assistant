How to respond to a Javascript event only if it is fired once and then not fired again during some time period?

In my application I listen to the Google Maps API 'bounds_changed' event to send an ajax request to update some div on the web page depending on the new boundaries of the map: google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'bounds_changed', function() { // here goes an ajax call } The event 'bounds_changed' is fired with a high frequency when the user drag the map around. So much that there are too many ajax requests sent to the server. Basically I would like to make the ajax call only after the user has stopped to move the map during some time period (for example 500ms). I am not very experienced with Javascript and tried to achieve this with setTimeout and clearTimeout but without success. Any idea would be appreciated :)
