How can I add extra new data after trainning neural network?

Let's say, I completed a training with 10k images on neural network with a certain number of epoch, which means all of 10k images went through forward and backpropagate epoch times. Let' say, I get extra new 100 more data and wanto to train my machine further. Do I have to start all over again from cleared weight with 10k+100 images? Or Can I train by starting with a current trained neural network and its learned weight saving some time? if I can, any risk of local minimum? I also noticed that answer might be different between Classification and Regression case.. In regressio case, adding new training data is more likely fall into local minimum? Thanky you
