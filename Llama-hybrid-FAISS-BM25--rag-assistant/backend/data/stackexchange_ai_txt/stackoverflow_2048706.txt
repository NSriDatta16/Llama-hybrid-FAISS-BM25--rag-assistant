This line returns a QString by value ui->lineEdit->text(),ui->spinBox->value() Hence, you can't use it as a modifiable reference. However, you can use it as a non-modifiable (const) reference, by modifying the function add_item to take const QString& . void Storage::add_item(const QString& key,int value) { *my_map_[key] = value; } Also, depending on the implementation of QString, it might be as effective to just pass it by value: void Storage::add_item(QString key,int value) { *my_map_[key] = value; } ... note however, that usually with classes it's a lot more effective to use const references where possible.
