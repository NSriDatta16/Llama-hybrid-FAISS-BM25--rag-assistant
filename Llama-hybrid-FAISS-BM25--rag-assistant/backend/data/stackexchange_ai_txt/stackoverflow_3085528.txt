For a 2D game, I think it's better to use ARB_vertex_program extension than GLSL. There are still OpenGL drivers out there that do not support GLSL , but support ARB_fragment_program . Support for paletted textures is nowadays non-existent, but pre-shader-age video cards may support it. See the links for statistics. The old ARB language is a low-level assembly language, but you can use NVidia's high level Cg language to compile shaders to this format. Despite it being a NVidia technology, it works for all GPUs. That said, if you are programming the game for your own amusement, it may not be worth the trouble.
