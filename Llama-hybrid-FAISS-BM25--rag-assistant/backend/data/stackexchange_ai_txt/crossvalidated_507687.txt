Logistic regression for insurance data with a lot of zeros

I have a dataset of insurance claims with a variable $Claim$ is a Binary random variable (i.e. $Claim = 1$ if there is a claim and $Claim = 0$ otherwise). About 95% of the observation has $Claim = 0$ I want to model the Probability of claim: $P(Claim = 1)$ . I tried to use logistics regression but get a model with a very low $pseudo$ - $R^2$ (about 5-10%). Moreover, normal logistics regression seems not to be a wise choice when there is a very large number of 0 in the data. Could you please recommend me some ideas of which model other than logistics regression to predict the probability of the outcome, especially when there is a lot of $0$ in the data ? Or, is there any way to enhance the power of prediction of the logistics regression ? Thank you very much for your help!
