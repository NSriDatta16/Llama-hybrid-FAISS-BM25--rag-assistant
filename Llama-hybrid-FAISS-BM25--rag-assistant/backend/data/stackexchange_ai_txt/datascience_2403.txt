Data science without knowledge of a specific topic, is it worth pursuing as a career?

I had a conversation with someone recently and mentioned my interest in data analysis and who I intended to learn the necessary skills and tools. They suggested to me that while it is great to learn the tools and build the skills there is little point in doing so unless i have specialized knowledge in a specific field. They basically summed it to that I'd just be like a builder with a pile of tools who could build a few wooden boxes and may be build better things (cabins, cupboards etc), but without knowledge in a specific field I'd never be a builder people would come to for a specific product. Has anyone found this or have any input on what to make of this ? It would seem if it was true one would have to learn the data science aspects of things and then learn a new field just to become specialized.
