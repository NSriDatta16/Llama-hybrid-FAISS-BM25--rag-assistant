How to choose an interaction term in logistic regression

I am working on building a logistic regression model. I have 5 variables A, B, C, D, and E. Based on my domain knowledge, I know that A can interact with B, C, D, and E. But the condition is I can only add 1 interaction term to my model. Assuming, all the interaction terms, when individually added to the model, are statistically significant. How do I choose the best interaction term and explain my decision? I am guessing that the lowest p-value and the variable with the highest coefficient value prior to adding the interaction term is the one I should select. I appreciate your answer.
