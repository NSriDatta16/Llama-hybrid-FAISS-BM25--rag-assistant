Randomness in Random Forests

One method to implement randomness in random forests is to use a random subset of the features for a split node. What will be done at the next split node of the same branch beneath (that current / former split node)? Is it a random subset of the former subset, so, a subsubset? Because I think choosing a subset from the entire feature subset does not make sense?
