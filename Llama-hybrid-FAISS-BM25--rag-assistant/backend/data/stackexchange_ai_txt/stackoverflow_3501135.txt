Embedding a dynamic file using the "view file" macro

The view file macro allows embedding documents ( .ppt , .pdf , etc) on a Confluence wiki page. Limitation is, documents must be on attachments. So question, is there a way to load dynamically a file located into an SCM's deposit? P.S. Current SCM: Perforce. UPDATE : As I see, there is no official Perforce plugin.
