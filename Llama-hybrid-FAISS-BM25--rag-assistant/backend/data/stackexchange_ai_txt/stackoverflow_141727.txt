It is Microsoft specific, don't expect to see the same information in other OSes. Note that you get the same format when you copy a fragment from IE. I am not sure what you mean by "webpage-to-webpage drag and drop operation". To drop where? A textarea? I don't know C#, but in C/C++ applications, you have to use OpenClipboard and related Win32 APIs to get this info. In particular, GetClipboardData(CF_HTML) allows you to get this info (can be obtained in plain text too, for example, or Unicode data, etc.).
