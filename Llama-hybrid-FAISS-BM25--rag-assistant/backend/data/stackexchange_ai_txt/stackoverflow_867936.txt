Python: Elegant way of dual/multiple iteration over the same list

I've written a bit of code like the following to compare items with other items further on in a list. Is there a more elegant pattern for this sort of dual iteration? jump_item_iter = (j for j in items if some_cond) try: jump_item = jump_item_iter.next() except StopIteration: return for item in items: if jump_item is item: try: jump_item = jump_iter.next() except StopIteration: return # do lots of stuff with item and jump_item I don't think the " except StopIteration " is very elegant Edit: To hopefully make it clearer, I want to visit each item in a list and pair it with the next item further on in the list (jump_item) which satisfies some_cond.
