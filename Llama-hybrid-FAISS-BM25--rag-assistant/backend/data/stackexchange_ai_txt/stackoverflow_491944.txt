uploaded files - database vs filesystem, when using Grails and MySQL

I know this is something of a "classic question", but does the mysql/grails (deployed on Tomcat) put a new spin on considering how to approach storage of user's uploaded files. I like using the database for everything (simpler architecture, scaling is just scaling the database). But using the filesystem means we don't lard up mysql with binary files. Some might also argue that apache (httpd) is faster than Tomcat for serving up binary files, although I've seen numbers that actually show just putting Tomcat on the front of your site can be faster than using an apache (httpd) proxy. How should I choose where to place user's uploaded files? Thanks for your consideration, time and thought.
