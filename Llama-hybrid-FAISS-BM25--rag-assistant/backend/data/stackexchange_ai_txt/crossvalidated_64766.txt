Distribution of deviances from logistic regression

I would like to know what is the theoretical distribution of the vector of (signed) deviances $d_i$ from a logistic regression. Failing that, is there a way to to transform them unto approximately normally distributed r.v.? My model for the data generating process is the simplest one, e.g. $$y_i\sim\mathcal{B}(p_i)$$ where $$p_i=\pmb x_i'\pmb\theta$$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is the Bernoulli distribution. so in R code: n
