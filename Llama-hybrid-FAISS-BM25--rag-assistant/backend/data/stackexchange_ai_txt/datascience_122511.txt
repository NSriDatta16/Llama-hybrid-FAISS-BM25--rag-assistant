Validation error less than training error

entire project link: Github Repository In a classification task using Neural Network, I computed the fraction of misclassification as an error. And I am getting a validation error less than the training error? I was trying to find the model with the lowest validation error and select that model. I found the validation error to be less than the training error which is unusual.
