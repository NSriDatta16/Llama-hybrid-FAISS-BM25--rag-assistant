Your'e asking a question about formatting data for viewing. SQL is a declarative data retrieval language, not a data pretty formatting language. You should solve this problem in your non-SQL code. Formatting data in a SQL query is not a good idea, unless you have to write something that will run in a query analyzer. Your question isn't specific about whether or not that is the case.
