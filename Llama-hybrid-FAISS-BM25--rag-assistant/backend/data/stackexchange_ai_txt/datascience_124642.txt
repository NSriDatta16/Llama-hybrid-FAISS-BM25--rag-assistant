Open-Source Large Language Models (LLM): Your experience and recommendation

I’m looking for an open-source LLM for a new project. I want to use it for instructions and to fine-tune the model to a specific domain like legal and rights. Some LLMs are open-source, but they didn’t document, on which training data they trained their model. This makes it a bit complicated in my case. I’m looking for models, that are open-source and the community knows on which datasets the model was trained. Do you know open-source LLMs like that and do you have experience with them? Thank you in advance.
