Distributed C++ game server which use database

My C++ turn-based game server (which uses database) does not stand against current average amount of clients (players), so I want to expand it to multiple (more then one) amount of computers and databases where all clients still will remain within single game world (servers will must communicate with each other and use multiple databases). Is there some tutorials/books/common standards which explain how to do it in a best way?
