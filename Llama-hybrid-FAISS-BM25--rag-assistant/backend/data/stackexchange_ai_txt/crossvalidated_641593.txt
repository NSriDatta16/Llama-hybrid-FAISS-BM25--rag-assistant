Gap in Partial Residuals Plot for Logistic Regression Model

I'm working on a logistic regression model using R with a binary outcome (prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors or other drugs) and several predictors. My model is specified as follows: model_dpp4is After fitting the model, I generated partial residuals plots for my continuous variables and observed a peculiar pattern. There is a noticeable gap around the zero line in these plots, with a clustering of values above and very few spread below, indicating a threshold that the residuals do not cross. Here's an example plot for BMI: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0VzxW.png I cannot share the dataset, but here are some details about the variables involved: Outcome Variable (Binary): DPP-4 inhibitors (1) vs. other drugs (0) Proportion of cases: 10% DPP-4 inhibitors (n= 1935), 90% other drugs (n = 17190) Continuous Predictors: Age (rage): Range = [18, 87], Mean = 56.64, Median = 58, 1st Qu. = 49, 3rd Qu. = 66 Year of prescription fill (year_of_rx_fill): Range = [2014, 2020], Mean = 2017, Median = 2017, 1st Qu. = 2016, 3rd Qu. = 2019 BMI (bmi): Range = [13.00, 56.13], Mean = 29.50, Median = 29.27, 1st Qu. = 25.79, 3rd Qu. = 33.15 Serum Creatinine (mrcreat): Range = [0.36, 24.67], Mean = 3.94, Median = 2.91, 1st Qu. = 1.58, 3rd Qu. = 5.70 Log time since transplantation (log_time_since_transplantation): Range = [0.000, 8.465], Mean = 3.727, Median = 3.258, 1st Qu. = 1.792, 3rd Qu. = 5.645 Categorical Predictors: Sex (rfemale): 6852 Female, 12273 Male Delayed graft function (dgf): 5691 Yes, 13434 No Early steroid withdrawal (esw): 5268 Yes, 13857 No Insulin use at start (insulin_at_start): 1229 users, 17880 non-users Congestive Heart Failure (C_CongestiveHeartFailure): 5853 Yes, 13272 No Mild Liver Disease (C_MildLiverDisease): 8171 Yes, 10954 No Categorical Predictors: Gender: 40% female, 60% male Congestive Heart Failure: 15% yes, 85% no Mild Liver Disease: 10% yes, 90% no (Include frequency for other categorical predictors) This strange gap around the 0 line exists in all of my partial residual plots for my numeric and categorical variables. My questions are: 1. Why might these gaps around the zero line be occurring? 2. What steps can I take to diagnose and address this issue in my model? [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jwxv.png
