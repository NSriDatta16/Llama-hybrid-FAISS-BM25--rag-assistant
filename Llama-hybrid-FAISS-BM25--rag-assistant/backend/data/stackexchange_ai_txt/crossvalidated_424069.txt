Cross validation and negative score

I am new to machine learning. I am using both HuberRegressor and Linear Regression for my data and used cross_val_score with split of 5 and 10. I get scores as positive for both Huber and LinearRegression when splits =5 but below values for split of 10 HuberR --- printing scores with Kfold of 10 = [-0.89745286 0.57398566 0.89670278 0.71272131 0.67122895 0.37063536 0.34396314 0.91340008 0.71485618 0.74122021] LinearR --- printing scores with Kfold of 10 = [-0.25560712 0.53450138 0.88401398 0.77523712 0.66942213 0.4324412 0.30291753 0.98206453 0.76385236 0.7207619 ] Can somebody explain if HuberRegressor or LinearRegression is better model and how to explain a negative score in both models? I am using scores as below cv1 = KFold(n_splits=10) scores = cross_val_score(pipeline1,X,y,cv=cv1) The values listed above are from results of cross_val_score. I used these from sklearn. I tried adding "shuffle=True" in KFold and I do not get negative values. I would still like if some one can explain the beahvior a little deeper.
