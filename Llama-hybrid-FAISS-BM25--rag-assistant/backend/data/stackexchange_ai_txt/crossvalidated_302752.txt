Fitted values of tsoutliers from R

I am trying to identify outliers from a simple time series ( ts1 ; see below) and subsequently fit an ARIMA model on the adjusted ts (w/o the outliers). Appologies, if the questions below are beginner's questions. I have a question concerning the fitted values for the tsoutliers package in R. I thought that the package identifies outliers iteratively, thereby fitting an ARIMA model. I am not not sure now, how to interpret the output of ?tso $fit$fitted . What I do: tt_out plot(tt_out$fit$fitted) So from these two plots, I can tell that one outlier was correctly identified (at t=172), however, the fitted values still incorporate the outlier. So what are they for? If I want to run ARIMA without the outliers do I need to do this: Replace the outlier by the adjusted value (yhat) and then run ARIMA from the package forecast . However, I thought the goal was to automatically identify and to fit the model directly. Why is the output of tso fit including the outliers? Do I need to use tso to identify the outliers, and then run ARIMA seperately? ts1
