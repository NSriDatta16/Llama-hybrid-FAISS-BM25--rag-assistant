There's one thing you haven't mentioned, which is how you will use the PCA results to judge if something is undervalued. Like you said, PCA reduces dimensionality, and will tell you the directions in which the data has most variance. However, in order to use this to judge new properties, you need some classifier. Reducing dimensions is not enough. But to answer your question, assuming you have a classifier, you seem to be asking if the PCA results on the first 20 years will be similar to the PCA results on the entire 22 years. This really depends on the data. One thing you can do to empirically check this is to just run both of these PCA's and compare them. I would expect that the initial PCA will generalize well to the next two years, but that's just a guess. It would be much better to get your answers from the data.
