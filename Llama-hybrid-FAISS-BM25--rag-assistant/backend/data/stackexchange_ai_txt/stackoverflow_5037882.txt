The elegant ( more accurate ) way of doing this ( but not blazing fast ) // Closest within radius of 25 Miles // 37, -122 are your current coordinates // To search by kilometers instead of miles, replace 3959 with 6371 SELECT feature_name, ( 3959 * acos( cos( radians(37) ) * cos( radians( lat ) ) * cos( radians( long ) - radians(-122) ) + sin( radians(37) ) * sin( radians( lat ) ) ) ) AS distance FROM geo_features HAVING distance Edit This is Haversine formula for calculating circular distance from geo-coordinates. Here are some implementation of this formula in different platforms R = earth’s radius (mean radius = 6,371km) Δlat = lat2− lat1 Δlong = long2− long1 a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1).cos(lat2).sin²(Δlong/2) c = 2.atan2(√a, √(1−a)) d = R.c // Note that angles need to be in radians to pass to Trigonometric functions
