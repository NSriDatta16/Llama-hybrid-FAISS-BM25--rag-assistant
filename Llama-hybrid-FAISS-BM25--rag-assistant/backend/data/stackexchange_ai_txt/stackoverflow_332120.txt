iPhone video buffer

I'm trying to build a video recorder without jailbreaking my iPhone (i've a Developer license). I began using PhotoLibrary private framework, but i can only reach 2ftp (too slow). Cycoder app have a fps of 15, i think it uses a different approach. I tried to create a bitmap from the previewView of the CameraController, but it always returns e black bitmap. I wonder if there's a way to directly access the video buffer, maybe with IOKit framework. Thanks Marco
