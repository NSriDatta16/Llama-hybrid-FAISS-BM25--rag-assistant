I have never seen this before, but this indicates that your Eclipse project is really messed up. At least the web.xml root declaration makes no utter sense. It look like a mix of Servlet 2.4 and 2.5 specifications. Maybe Eclipse is getting confused because the root namespace ( xmlns ) is pointing to the Servlet 2.4 one (with j2ee URI) while the web project itself is set as Servlet 2.5 or newer (which should be using the one with javaee URI). Also, when your web project is set to Servlet 3.0 during creation, by default no web.xml will be generated by Eclipse because of the new Servlet 3.0 annotations like @WebServlet , @WebFilter , etc.. which makes the web.xml superfluous. When you create new servlets by New > Servlet , Eclipse will already autogenerate those annotations. Probably you've attempted to create the web.xml yourself based on misinformation. I'd suggest to backup some code if necessary, throw the whole project away and create a new one with the proper settings and do not touch the web.xml root declaration. Assuming that you're using the latest Eclipse version, Helios SR1 for Java EE developers, rightclick Eclipse's Project Explorer , choose New > Dynamic Web Project and just fill the project name and keep everything default. Click Next until the last step and then tick Generate web.xml deployment descriptor checkbox to let Eclipse generate one. The root declaration should then look like this:
