How do I input 4-byte UTF-8 characters?

I am writing a small app which I need to test with utf-8 characters of different number of byte lengths. I can input unicode characters to test that are encoded in utf-8 with 1,2 and 3 bytes just fine by doing, for example: string in = "pi = \u3a0"; But how do I get a unicode character that is encoded with 4-bytes? I have tried: string in = "aegan check mark = \u10102"; Which as far as I understand should be outputting . But when I print that out I get á´¶0 What am I missing? EDIT: I got it to work by adding leading zeros: string in = "\U00010102"; Wish I had thought of that sooner :)
