Precheck: If you are getting any 'Headers already sent...' then you have some output already on the page which is preventing the setting of session. Otherwise try debugging steps like: 1) Do an echo $row['lifemember'] inside the while loop so that you know REAL value of what's been fetched from DB. 2) In else block, change it to $_SESSION['MemberType'] = 'Hello'; Then see, whether Hello is printed or not?
