How to make label & other controls transparent with background image on windows mobile?

I am developing the smart device application in C#. I am new to the windows mobile. I have added the background image to the form in my application by using the following code. I want to make label & other controls on this form transparent so that my windows form will be displayed properly. protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { base.OnPaint(e); Bitmap CreateCustomerImage = new Bitmap(@"/Storage Card/background.png"); e.Graphics.DrawImage(CreateCustomerImage, 0, 0); } how to do this ? How to solve this problem? Can you provide me any code or link through which I can solve the above issue?
