In C++ it is syntactically correct. In C you can initialize a global variable only with a constant. So your code would not compile in C. In C this is legal BTW int main() { int i = i+1; } 3.3.1/1 Point of declaration The point of declaration for a name is immediately after its complete declarator and before its initializer (if any). The behaviour is well defined as per ยง3.6.2/1 which says: "Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place."
