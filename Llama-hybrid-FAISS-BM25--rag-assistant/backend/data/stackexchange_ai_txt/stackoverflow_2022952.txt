Don't store it if you don't need to... Is OpenID not an option? If you do, make it strong... I like the idea of using an email address as the "username," eliminating the need to store it later for communication, etc. And as for passwords, encourage "strong" ones. 6-12 characters of random-casing and numbers interspersed. Not many good reasons to store plain text... I would then hash the password.
