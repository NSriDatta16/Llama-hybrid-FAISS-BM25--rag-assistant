Generative design - algorithms and sources

I have recently encountered the term "generative design" where a computer algorithm (usually with the help of Machine Learning) comes up with new designs that conform to a certain set of requirements. These designs are usually more intricate while also being lighter and stronger than what humans would design. I would like to get deeper into the topic, however I can mostly only find offerings (from AutoDesk etc.) instead of a good description on how exactly it works (or even a mathematical description). Could you please point me to some studies, articles or any sources where I could delve into the topic?
