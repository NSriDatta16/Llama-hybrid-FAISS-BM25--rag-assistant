Identify highly fragmented indexes and rebuild for single database/table SQL Server 2005/2008

I'm looking for a script that will identify highly fragmented indexes on a single DB, and optionally a single table as I think sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats is quite resource intensive. Also with the option of making the table offline? I read this is possible somewhere?
