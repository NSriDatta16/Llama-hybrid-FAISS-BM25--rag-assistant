Neural networks - Difference between deep autoencoder and stacked autoencoder

As I understand it, the only difference between them is the way the two networks are trained. Deep autoencoders are trained in the same way as a single-layer neural network, while stacked autoencoders are trained with a greedy, layer-wise approach. Hugo Larochelle confirms this in the comment of this video . I wonder if this is the ONLY difference, any pointers?
