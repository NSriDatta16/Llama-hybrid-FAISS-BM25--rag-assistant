Sun has recently launched a new technology called JavaFX for these kinds of RIAs. You may want to check it out (javafx.com). It is suppose to run on Java 5 or better but that will definitely not have the kind of client penetration that Flash does. I think however given your requirements for testing that this technology may not be appropriate at this time. Also, I think Troy Gilbert made an error in his post. Specifically, he seems to indicate that a GWT application will run (by the client) in java. I'm almost certain that a GWT application is written first in Java and then GWT will compile that into a javascript library that the client runs.
