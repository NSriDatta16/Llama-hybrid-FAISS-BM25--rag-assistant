A conditional GAN would likely work. Many practical implementations of cGAN leave out the noise, on the basis that there is so much training data, it's unlikely the discriminator will notice that the generator only produces one output per conditional input. (Or, if you don't want to use this trick, you could query the GAN with multiple noise vectors and average all the outputs to get the "conditional mean").
