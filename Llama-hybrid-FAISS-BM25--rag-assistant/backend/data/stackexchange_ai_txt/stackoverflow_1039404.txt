Drag to rotate in iPhone-app

I'm trying to drag a UIImageView according to an anchorPoint but the whole image move. In fact i have a view for my app settings and one parameter is setted with a dial (with a hand/needle(?)). I'd like the rotation center of the needle/hand doesn't move when i'm dragging it. Thanks for your future answers.
