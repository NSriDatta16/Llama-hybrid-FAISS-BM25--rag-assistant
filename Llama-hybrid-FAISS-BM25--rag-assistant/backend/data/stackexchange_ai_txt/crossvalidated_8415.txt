Short and long-run trend

I have a time series, let's call it $y(t)$. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests indicate no unit root but a deterministic trend. The series is strongly autocorrelated. I estimated the following short-run dynamic model: $$y(t) = \alpha + \beta\cdot y(t-1) + \gamma\cdot t + \varepsilon_t$$ where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are estimated coefficients. The estimated model has no statistical anomalies and the coefficients are significantly different from zero. The estimated value of $\gamma$ measures a trend. However, a long-run trend can be estimated by calculating $\gamma/(1-\beta)$. We can estimate directly the following static, long-run model: $$y(t) = \alpha + \gamma\cdot t + \varepsilon_t.$$ Question : What is the best , consistent model to apply in an analysis of a deterministic trend?
