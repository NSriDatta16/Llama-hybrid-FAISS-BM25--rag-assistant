Make a usable Join relationship with LINQ on top of a database CSV design error

I'm looking for a way to fix and/or abstract away a comma-separated values (CSV) list in a database field in order to reconstruct a usable relationship such that I can properly join the two tables below and query them using C# LINQ and its .Join method . Following is a sample showing the Person table and CsvArticleIds field having a CSV value to represent a one-to-many association with Article records. TABLE [dbo].[ Person ] Id Name CsvArticleIds -- ---------- -------- 1 Joe "15,22" 5 Ed "22" 10 Arnie "8,15,22" ^^^(Of course a link table should have been created; nonetheless the relationship with articles is trapped inside that list of CSV values.) TABLE [dbo].[ Article ] Id Title -- ---------- 8 Beginning C# 15 A Historic look at Programming in the 90s 22 Gardening in January Additional Info the fix can be at any level: C#.NET or SQL Server something easy because I will be repeating the solution for many other CSV values in other tables. Elegant is nice too. not looking for efficiency because this is part of a one-time data migration task and can take as long as it wants to run.
