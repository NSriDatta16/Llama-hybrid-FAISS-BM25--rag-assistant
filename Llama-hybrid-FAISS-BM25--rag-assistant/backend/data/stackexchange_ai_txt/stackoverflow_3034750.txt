What I am currently learning towards is storing the message ID in a sqlite DB and flagging a field whether an SMS has been sent or not This is one of the most simple and straightforward ways to do this. Regardless of storage method, you'll have to keep the list of seen-but-unread message IDs somewhere. May as well be in a simple, self-contained SQLite file. I suppose you could just keep them in a list in a flat file. That is by definition more simple, but is it really easier?
