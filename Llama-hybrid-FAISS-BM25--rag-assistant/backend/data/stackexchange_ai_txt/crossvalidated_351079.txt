Are there networks specialised on object detection for a single class of object?

I want to detect the location of a single class of object, which might occur multiple times in an image. Specifically, this relates to research on detecting brake lights for autonomous vehicles. I imagine similar techniques could be used to detect all faces for security applications, or balls for robot soccer, or a specific type of cancer or... At the moment I am considering retraining a YOLO9000 or SSD network, as both have the necessary real-time performance to run 30fps. However, I'm assuming that at least some of their capacity is dedicated to features I don't need classification across a wide range of classes detecting whether something is an object or not for any of these classes Since my problem is much simpler, I wondered whether there are any network architectures which have specialised on the localisation task? I have found similar questions, but in both cases the question I want an answer to was mixed up with a secondary question and didn't give the answer I was looking for. I'd be happy to close as a dupe if one of these gets a better answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45891271/neural-network-to-detect-one-class-of-object-only https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2279/cnn-for-detecting-not-just-the-nature-of-the-object-but-position-within-image-a I did learn one helpful thing from those questions: trying to detect a single class is actually differentiating between 2 classes - objects I want to detect and background/everything else.
