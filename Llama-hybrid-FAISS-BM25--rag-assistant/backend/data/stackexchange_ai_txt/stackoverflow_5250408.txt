Can someone teach me how to write this Paragraph Entry as a boolean expression?

Note: I am a beginner Programmer but love the hobby and I'm wanting to get a degree in computer science so I'm not to experienced so if anyone has tips that may benefit me as a beginner that'd be awesome. But here is the question. Chicago's Wrigley Field is a baseball field with a vine-covered wall in the outfield, that has a railing above the wall. A ball that hits the wall and does not leave the playing field is sometimes still in play and sometimes a dou- ble according to the following rules: A ball striking the railing and rebounding onto the playing field is still in play. A ball that lodges in the screen that is attached to the bleacher wall is a double. A ball that lodges in vines on the bleacher wall is a double. A ball entering the vines on the bleacher wall and rebounding onto the playing field is still in play. A ball that hits the wall is ruled a double IF (condition), else the ball is still in play. Rewrite this as a single Boolean condition of the form?? I almost clueless!
