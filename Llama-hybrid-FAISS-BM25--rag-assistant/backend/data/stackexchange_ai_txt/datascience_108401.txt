Convolutional Neural Networks are not easily usable for Transfer Learning like Transformer Models are in NLP. They very much depend on their training data set and the objects shown in there. So a ConvNet trained on flowers will maybe be transferrable to a roses classification task but not to detecting cars since the dataset features are completely different. Maybe if you use a wider dataset like CIFAR10 , the model becomes more robust.
