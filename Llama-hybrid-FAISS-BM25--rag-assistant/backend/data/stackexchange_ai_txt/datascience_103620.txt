In NLP parlance what you ask for can be framed as a case of Lemmatisation There are NLP tools like spaCy for Python which support such tasks. Beware that a very simple NLP algorithm for Lemmatisation which can be applied directly to your case is Dictionary Lookup (which is equivalent to a trivial rule-based system). Yes this is an NLP algorithm.
