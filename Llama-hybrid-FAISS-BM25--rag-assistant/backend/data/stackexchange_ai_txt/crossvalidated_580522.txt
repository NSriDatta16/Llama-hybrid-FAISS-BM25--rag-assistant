The feeding machine has three possible states: idle; occupied by type A; occupied by type B. If we discretize time, then we can model our problem with a Markov chain with 3 possible states. We need to estimate a 3x3 transition probability matrix whose entries are the probabilities of switching from one of the 3 states to another one. The estimation of time-invariant transition probabilities can be done as described in this question . However, in our case we probably need to make the transition probabilities time-varying and dependent on some observables (e.g., a dummy that tells us whether the machine has been occupied in the last x minutes by A or B). The technology to estimate these models is described in the time-series textbook by James Hamilton and in several other places (e.g., here ). You can then use the estimated probabilities and the impacts of the observables on the probabilities to answer many interesting questions. A simpler alternative would be to train a classification model (having as output the probability distribution of the next state and as input the one-hot encodings of the current state, plus other predictors such as statistics about the occupancy of the feeding machine in the previous minutes).
