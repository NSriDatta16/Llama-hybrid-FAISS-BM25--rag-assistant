I'm not sure about what are you asking precisely but SVM works with the support vectors, since the power of this tool is finding the best separating hyperplane, the support vectors are used in order to define the margin. I don't know exactly what do you mean by "not using alphas" but in order to predict the correct label for new fresh data points you are going to use the relation that you wrote that already uses the alpha since it guarantees that your data points will be outside the margins. If you use Soft-SVM instead you can allow some points to being inside the margin introducing some slacks variables. In your particular case you need to apply a kernel function in order to linearly separate your data, but again even in that space, SVM will find the best separating hyperplane using the margin and the alpha, and when you compute the label for your new data points you are going to use a formula that already consider alpha.
