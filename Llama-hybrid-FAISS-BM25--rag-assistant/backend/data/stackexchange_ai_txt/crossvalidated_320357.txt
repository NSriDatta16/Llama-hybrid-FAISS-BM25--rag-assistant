What are the characteristics of a deep learning algorithm, apart the fact of being a multilayer network?

I have read a lot about Deep learning, and I'm little bit confused. Most of multilayer Machine Learning algorithms are considered as Deep Learning algorithm. I don't get it, does being a multilayer architecture is what characterizes a Deep learning algorithm or there's something else that I'm missing?
