SharePoint Online file storage

We have a requirement to store documents in SharePoint Online as people copy files to a shared network directly. Is there a way of automating this? I was thinking of a windows service which will poll the directories, find any changes like new subdirectories or new files, then upload them to a SharePoint Online document library.
