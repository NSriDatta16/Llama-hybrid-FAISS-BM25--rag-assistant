It's probably always best to put these advice and tips into perspective. The assumption being made here is if your application is going to be utilized in a multi user mode (that means more than one user in the application of the same time), then it's pretty much assumed that your applications going to be split into two parts. The so called application part (front end), and then the data file only part, or so called backend part. So, you have a FE and a BE. In this environment, each individual user within your office will have their own copy of the application placed on their workstation. The BE (data file) is thus assumed to be placed on some share folder on a server. In the case we're not going to have multiple users running this application, or the application is not really under development, then you really don't need to split your application into two parts. However if you split your application, it means all of your users can safely work and utilize your application while you work on a copy of the next great version of this application release. Without a split environment, you really can't have any workable development cycle. It is a long time and honored suggestion that if you're going to use access in a multi user environments, each individual user must have a copy of the front end application placed on each individual computer. If you avoid this suggestion, the end result is instability in the general operation of your application. I have an article here that explains on a conceptual level and doesn't just tell you two split your application, but explains well why you should split your application: http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/Articles/split/index.htm
