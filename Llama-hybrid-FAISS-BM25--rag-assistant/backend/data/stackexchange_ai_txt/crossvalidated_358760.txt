Well, the answer does depend on how many variables you have and how interested you are in accuracy. The answer also depends on if you are dealing with a time series or not. However, there are a few approaches to your problem... Using the mean. You can fill in missing values with the mean of the variable over the time period of observation. Pros : Easy to compute and understand. Decent option if you know your variables to be distributed normally. Cons : You if your data has a trend (if the rolling-mean is increasing over time) your added values may make your charting look odd. Also, this is not acceptable if your variables have an odd distribution that makes the mean value meaningless. Rolling forward the last value . This is generally only acceptable if you have a time series, such that you have sequential observations. Here, you "roll forward" the last value of the variable into the missing space. Pros : Computationally simple, also easy to understand, very helpful for missing data in time series of asset movements. Cons : You may roll forward an anomoly-type value (outlier) if you are unlucky. Exclude the observation . You can choose to simply exclude any observation with missing variables. This reduces the total number of observations, obviously. Pros : You are not estimating any data, so you know all of your observations are 100% correct and you are not creating any sort of simulated results. Also easy to understand and compute. Cons : You lose some information due to the exclusion, which can be harmful to your analysis. Not useful for datasets with few observations (this is completely subjective, generally you would like $n > 50$). Simulate the value using distribution of the variable . You can use the values you do have for the variable in question to determine an approximate distribution of the variable. Then, use a random generator to simulate a variable out of the distribution you determined. Alternatively, you could add all variable values into a bag and randomly pull one out, which is less accurate but ensures you are sampling values directly from an observable set of values. Pros : "Fancy", will be theoretically closer to the actual variable values (had they existed and are randomly simulated assuming your observations are $i.i.d.$). Cons : Computationally expensive, requires knowledge of statistics and/or computing, more difficult to explain, assumes your observations are $i.i.d.$.
