What is the meaning of having a sum of weights equal to zero?

In my dataset, the target variable has three labels: Normal, suspect, and Pathology. Using multinomial logistic regression, I calculated the weights for each predictive feature and got something like this: When estimating the model, identification constraints are required on the parameters. These constraints do not influence the goodness of model fit, odds ratios, estimated probabilities, interpretations, or conclusions. Identification constraints do affect the specific values of parameter estimates. The typical constraints are to set the parameter values of the baseline category equal to zero (e.g., aj = $\beta_j$ = 0) or to set the sum of the parameters equal to zero (e.g., $\sum \beta = 0$ ). Question: why does the sum of the coefficients equal zero? how does this constraint happen and why is it necessary?
