mvabund does not support random effects, so you can't fit random intercepts as you would with a mixed effects model to handle repeated measures. I can think of a two suggestions: as you suggest you could fit fixed effects for the grouping IDs that you would otherwise have fitted random intercepts for. It sounds as though you may have 6 sites nested within 30 years, so this will entail 30 estimates for year, and 6 x 30 = 180 estimates for the interaction, which should be avoided if possible. you can adopt a Bayesian approach using, for example, MCMCglmm or R.
