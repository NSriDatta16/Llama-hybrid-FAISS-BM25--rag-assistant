Mathematics topics required to work on time series analysis

I will soon start working with time series data. Which topics in mathematics should I cover? I am planning to go all the way, and I do not shy away from challenging topics. P.S. I have already gotten introductory class level calculus, linear algebra and diff equations, prob/stats covered.
