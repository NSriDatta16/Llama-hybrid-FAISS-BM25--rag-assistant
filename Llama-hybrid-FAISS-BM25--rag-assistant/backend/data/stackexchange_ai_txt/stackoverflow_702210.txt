The way I have done this is to have an absolute layout and then just update the object position as it is dragged. You have to implement dragging yourself. If the widgets have a natural order (a toolbar where you want to be able to drag buttons around) you can stack an absolute layout on top of the toolbar and when the drag starts, you add it to the absolute layout and when it finishes, you add it back to the original layout in the new position.
