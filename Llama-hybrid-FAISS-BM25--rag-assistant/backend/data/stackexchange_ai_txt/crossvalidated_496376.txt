Is it ok to organize the labels this way?

I'm a beginner with ML and I am trying to create models to classify whether an image from venus contains volcanoes using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/volcanoesvenus The labels are inside a csv file that contains four columns: Volcano?: if in the image there are volcanoes (Main target), 1 or 0. for Volcano?=0 these three next features are NaN Type: 1= definitely a volcano,2 =probably, 3= possibly, 4= only a pit is visible Radius: is the radius of the volcano in the center of the image, in pixels Number Volcanoes: The number of volcanoes in the image I didn't really understand why the "Volcano?" column exists because it makes more sense to add a label with value 0 to the "Type" column and then fill Nan values if the type is 0. So I thought it can be better to change it but and I wasn't sure if maybe there is a reason behind it or if it will affect the model somehow when training. Is it okay to change the labels this way? Will it change something? By the way,I am planning to use a neural network with convolutional layers.
