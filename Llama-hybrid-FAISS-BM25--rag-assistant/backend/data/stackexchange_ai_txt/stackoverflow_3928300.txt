Send files from form directly to remote server

In my application I'm dealing with upload of really big image files. They will be stored on a remote server, so from what I was able to learn I need to write some custom Storage system (probably with the use of python's poster module). Because of the size I would like to send the files directly to media server without storing them in memory (which 'poster' enables). But all uploaded files are handled by UploadHandler class, which forces files to be stored locally in some way (file, temp or in memory). So how can I get around this ?
