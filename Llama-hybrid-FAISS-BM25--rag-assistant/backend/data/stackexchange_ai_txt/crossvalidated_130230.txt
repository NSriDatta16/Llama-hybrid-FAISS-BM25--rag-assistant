Standard ARMA models assume the unconditional mean and unconditional variance to be constant. For ARMA-GARCH models this is also the case I don't think it is true, they're constant conditional variance models, see e.g. MATLAB's help on ARMA and GARCH. Whether you have to test before or after applying the model is up to you. We usually have a battery of standard tests, including ADF and Engle's ARCH, applied to our series during the data exploration phase. We never jump right into modeling before understanding the series, gathering literature, studying their basic time series properties such trends and cycles etc. However, for the purposes of exposition, you can always apply the model then test the residuals for unit-root and homoscedasticity assumptions if they were implied, such as in constant conditional variance models.
