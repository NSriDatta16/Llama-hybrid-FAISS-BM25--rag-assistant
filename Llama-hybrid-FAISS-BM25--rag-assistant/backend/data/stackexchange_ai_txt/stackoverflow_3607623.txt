An option to save data locally would be to use cookies: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp or the HTML5 localStorage: http://people.w3.org/mike/localstorage.html But the obvious drawback is that it's tied to the current browser and computer. If you want something more persistant, you'd want to use some kind of server side help. What are your requirements? I guess you could then save start and end positions and then at page load re-create the range using document.createRange and then the methods setStart and setEnd https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.createRange https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/range.setStart
