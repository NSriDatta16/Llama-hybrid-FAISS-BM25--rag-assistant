In order to read XMI/UML using EMF, you will need to find, generate or write ECore model for UML. Once you have one of those, you can generate the in-memory classes for manipulating the UML and leverage the other EMF infrastructure. But a simpler route may be to use the UML2 infrastructure developed by the Eclipse MDT project . (My guess is that it uses EMF under the hood and that there is an ECore model for UML2 in there somewhere.)
