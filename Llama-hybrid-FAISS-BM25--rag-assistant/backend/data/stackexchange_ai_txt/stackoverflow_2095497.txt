I have a large text file that I need to search for a specific string. Is there a fast way to do this without reading line by line? The only way to avoid searching across the entire file is to sort or organize the input beforehand. For example, if this is an XML file and you need to do many of these searches, it would make sense to parse the XML file into a DOM tree. Or if this is a list of words and you're looking for all the words which start with the letters "aero", it might make sense to sort the entire input first if you do a lot of that kind of searching on the same file.
