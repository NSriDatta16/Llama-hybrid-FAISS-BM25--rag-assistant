You are correct to conclude that a $\chi^2$ value of 0 is odd when df > 0, though that does not mean it is impossible. From your description of the model in the comments, your model does appear to be quite complex. I would first check your mplus syntax to see if a mistake was made, and if not, I would consider a simpler model. My reasoning for this is that it is possible your model is misspecified. Try freeing or fixing paths you believe are not central to your research question and see how it changes your results. Additionally, you could check if any of your sample variables have constant values (i.e., everyone in your dataset has the same value for a particular variable), as this can often lead to odd results (this has happened to me!). Finally, you could try to use Bayesian estimation, which is easy to implement in mplus . If you do this, be cautious. First, because the use of Bayesian methods does not "fix" any potential issues related to misspecification, and second, because the mplus default priors $^1$ may not be appropriate for your data (e.g., MacCallum, Edwards, & Cai, 2012). $^1$ Note that naive use of default priors is not only an issue with mplus but with all Bayesian software packages that don't require explicit prior specification.
