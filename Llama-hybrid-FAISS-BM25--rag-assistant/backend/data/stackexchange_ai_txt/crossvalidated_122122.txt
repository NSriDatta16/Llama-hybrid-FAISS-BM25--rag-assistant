Temporal linkage between two lists of data

I have 2 lists, representing a time series: list_a = [23,43,29,45,6,12,240] list_b = [13,23,11,35,60,52,40] i.e. list_a[0] is value in first year.... list_a[6] is values in 7th year. I want to check if increase in values in list_a is followed by an increase or decrease in list_b in the subsequent year. Is there a statistical test that will allow me to do that? The key is looking at the direction of change rather than the magnitude of change. Even better if I can say something about the temporal linkage between the two lists. I.e, perhaps increase in list_a precedes changes in list_b by 2 years.
