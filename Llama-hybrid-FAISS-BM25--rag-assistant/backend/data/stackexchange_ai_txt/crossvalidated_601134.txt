YES The log loss corresponds to using maximum likelihood estimation for a binomial likelihood (conditional distribution) and does not care at all about the function being used to predict the probability. Logistic regression often uses log loss. Neural networks often use log loss. A logistic regression with nonlinear terms like polynomials or splines could use log loss (I think you intend to do this). Itâ€™s even theoretically possible (even if challenging) to use log loss for a linear model of the probability (whereas logistic regression is a linear model of the log odds but a nonlinear model of the probability).
