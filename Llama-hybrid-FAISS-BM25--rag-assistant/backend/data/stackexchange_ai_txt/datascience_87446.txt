Machine learning and time-based data

I want to predict conversion rates for an eCommerce store. I have data from Google Analytics with features like averageSessionDuration, bounceRate, numberOfVisitorsBySource etc. and the corresponding conversion rate. That's the specific background for a generic question: I am not sure how I should select the time units for my data. Should I export the data by day, by week, by month or by year? When I have one row per day, I have a lot of data (a lot of rows), but also a lot of noise, because the conversion data for one day is sparse. When I have one row per year, I have less noise, but also less data (less rows). In general, what's the right approach to select the right time frame per row in such a case?
