As hocker said you have to use that method passing in the XIB name (without the extension). Then you have to control this list: Open the .xib file in IB Click on File Owner and select the correct class (MyCustomView in your case) Hold down control and drag from File Owner to the View (Now the outlet for the view is ok) Hope it works. Cheers.
