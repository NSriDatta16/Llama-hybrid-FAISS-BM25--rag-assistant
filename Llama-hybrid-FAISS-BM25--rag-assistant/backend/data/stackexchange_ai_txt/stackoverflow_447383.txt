Depends on the size/scale of the project. If its a short program (trivial to compile and run), I will test it early and often any time I add in any new functionality. This lets me catch most errors quickly. In a large project (company-size), I'll test my piece in isolation like this, IF I can. Otherwise, pay attention to tests on those daily builds. In short, test as often as possible, so long as the compile/run time doesn't take so long you consider taking up office swordfighting!
