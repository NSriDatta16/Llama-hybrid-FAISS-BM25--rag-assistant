removing/stopping a specific mkAnnotationView from being reused

I've been playing around with the MapKit and came across a puzzling scenario that i'm not creative/knowledgable enough to work my way around of. In my map application, I have a mapView that I would like to drop pins onto. My dilema arrises from the fact that mapView reuses it's annotationViews. what I would idealy like to do, is press a button, then drop a draggable temporary pin in order to record a location that a user would like to use. This annotation's view does not have a rightCallOutAccesoryView however. When it comes time to drop a legitimate pin, iIneed to remove the temporary pin from the mapView and then add legitamate one with the old pin's coordinates. Apparently, If I drop the legit Pin first, and then remove temp Pin, the mapView still somehow manages to reuse the annotationView of the tempPin that does not have the rightCallOutAccesoryView when infact i just want a new one for the legit Pin that does have one. can anyone tell me how this could be done? What I need to do in a nut shell, is remove an annotation, and then make a new one without reusing the old pin's annotationView... Thanks in advance.
