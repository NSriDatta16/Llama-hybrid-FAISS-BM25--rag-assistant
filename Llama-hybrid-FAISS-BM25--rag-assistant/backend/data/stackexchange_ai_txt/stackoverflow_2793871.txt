Help regarding android 1.5 and 2.1 (beginner, issue of Book Version)

I am new to android and last year i bought two books of android 1.5 . But at that time i was busy in my project so was not able to work on android. Now i want to start android again. Should i go for those books or should i buy new editions Is there any major change regarding basic learnings? Two books i am having are:- Pragmatic Hello Android (New addition of this book is available, But still in beta phase) Apress begining Android (Dont know about this whether new edition is available or not) Please let me know. Thanks EDIT here i am not asking about the good books of android, as there are lot of questions regarding that. I can find out from them. My question is purely related to change in version
