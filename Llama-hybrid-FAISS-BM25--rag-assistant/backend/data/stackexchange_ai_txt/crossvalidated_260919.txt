javascript is client side, it runs in your local browser. The only use you might have is to have a page you have written, with javascript, to take a snapshot, or parse through the roulette site page and extract the wheel numbers which you could then perform your analysis on. The wheel numbers are coming from their server (not from javascript.) If this a real (money) site, it won't work, the numbers will be random enough such that any advantage you might (read: won't) extract will be more than offset by the enormous 5.5% house edge on the bets. That feeling in your in your gut is simply you randomly being correct a couple of times. Your time would be better spent writing a limit poker machine learning model.
