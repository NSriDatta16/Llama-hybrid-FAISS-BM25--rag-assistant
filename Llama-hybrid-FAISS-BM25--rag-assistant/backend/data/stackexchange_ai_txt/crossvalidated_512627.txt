Is there no such thing as a multivariate generalized linear mixed model?

I am reading Fong, Y., Rue, H., & Wakefield, J. (2010). Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. Biostatistics, 11(3), 397-412. and was surprised to see that the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is defined such that the outcome variable is a scalar (see Section 2). Two reasons for my surprise include: The construction defines the mean of the exponential family distribution as a function of covariates and regression weights, and the exponential family includes multivariate distributions (e.g. multivariate normal). I expected that multivariate normals could be handled as a special case. Is there no such thing as a multivariate generalized linear mixed model? If not, why not?
