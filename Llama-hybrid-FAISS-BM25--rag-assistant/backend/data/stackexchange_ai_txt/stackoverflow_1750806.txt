How do I get something like repeat customers in Django

My models look something like this: class Customer(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100) class Order(models.Model): customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer) date = models.DateField() total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2) I then have a queryset of orders: from datetime import datetime start_date = datetime(year=2009, month=6, day=1) end_date = datetime(year=2009, month=11, day=1) orders = Order.objects.filter(date__lte=end_date).filter(date__gte=start_date) Now, I want to find out which customers made multiple orders between those times, how many orders they made, and what their average total is. I get the feeling that I should be using Django 1.1's new aggregation features, but I can't really wrap my head around it.
