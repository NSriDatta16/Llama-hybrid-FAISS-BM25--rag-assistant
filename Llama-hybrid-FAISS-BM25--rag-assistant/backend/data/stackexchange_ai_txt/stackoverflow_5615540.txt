Looking for a C++ code prettifier that will remove empty lines

I've just taken over a large, poorly formatted mass of C++ code. I'm looking for a code prettifier with two specific features. Remove superfluous access modifiers Clean up white space in a nice way. eg. leave blank lines between functions, collapse multiple blank lines into one within functions, remove blank lines between the opening/closing brace of a function and the start/end of the code. This is a typical example. I don't want to have to write one, it'd take too long to prove that it couldn't damage the code and there's way too much to check by eye. class CLASS_DECL_BASE OComStorage : public OBase { private: protected: public: OComStorage (void ); ~OComStorage (void ); void Thanks_Guys();
