How to use NVelocity without embedding the templates as resources?

I've been playing around with NVelocity to create a library that loads mail templates. And I haven't been able to load a template without embedding it into the application assembly. Is there a special way of doing this? Properties to be specified? I've tried several string formatting tweaks to get the path of the template and keep getting an exception of wrong path.
