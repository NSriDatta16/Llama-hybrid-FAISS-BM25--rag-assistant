Conditional Reference Paths Based on Solution

I have a set of solutions that are organized like this... Master Solution - Proj A - Proj B - Proj X - Proj Y SolutionAB - Proj A - Proj B SolutionXY - Proj X - Proj Y Dependencies Proj A & B => Proj X & Y What i need is to have MasterSolution look at local project references, and SolutionAB look at a totally arbritrary location for the same dlls. I can make any changes I need to the .proj files, but am limited in my ability to move projects around. These are just the limitations I have to work with.
