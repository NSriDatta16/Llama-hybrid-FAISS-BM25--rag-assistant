This is a textbook case of a time series, so you could bring some well-developed machinery to bear. The initial challenge is that you have an irregular series. There are far more tools available for regular series. I would suggest that you pre-process your data to only contain day-end reputation, but that also for days on which you don't get any new rep (so the cumulative rep would be equal to the day's before). Once you have this regular series, you can start fitting standard methods, e.g.: ARIMA. For a cumulative series that mostly only increases, you want to use first differences in an ARIMA(p,1,q) model, so in effect you would be modeling daily increases and adding these back together afterwards. This is also what an auto-ARIMA tool will likely recommend. Exponential Smoothing. Your upward trend can be modeled in these models. Modern implementations like forecast::ets() for fable::ETS() for R can decide on the trend shape, or you can prespecify an additive trend. In any case, you might have seasonality, e.g., intra-weekly, getting more rep on certain days of the week. Both ARIMA and Smoothing can deal with this; just tell them you have a seasonal frequency of 7. It's probably less likely that you have intra-yearly seasonality (although some of our sites show patterns that look like more traffic as the school/college year starts). The tools above have issues with such "long" seasonalities. In any case, you might have multiple-seasonalities , with both kinds of seasonality interacting. There are specialized methods for that. I personally like simple linear regressions with Boolean dummies for days of week and something like harmonics for intra-year seasonality best here. If you have external predictors, e.g., knowing that you didn't get here a lot during certain periods of time, you could try running a regression on these and then modeling residuals with the tools above. I would recommend that you start with simple methods like an auto-ARIMA and an automatic Smoothing tool. These are quite well developed and are often very hard to beat.
