To describe effects of variables engaged in one or more interactions, you can use the technique described below. List Equation of Fitted Model Based on the information you provided, the expected/average value of Y given the predictors included in the model can be expressed like this: Expected value of Y = 1 + 2*CrewB + 3*ShiftNight + 10*HealthBad + 4*CrewB:ShiftNight + 5*CrewB:HealthBad where: CrewB = 1 for crew B and 0 for crew A; ShiftNight = 1 for night shift and 0 for day shift; HealthBad = 1 for bad health and 0 for good health. Quantify Effect of Crew What happens if you want to determine the effect of crew from your fitted model listed above? Simply re-arrange your model by grouping together all the terms in the model which include the dummy variable CrewB: Expected value of Y = 1 + (2 + 4*ShiftNight + 5*HealthBad)*CrewB + 3*ShiftNight + 10*HealthBad Thus, the effect of crew on subjects sharing the same type of shift and the same type of health is captured by the coefficient (2 + 4*ShiftNight + 5*HealthBad). This effect depends on both the type of shift and on the type of health. For example: The effect is equal to 2 for subjects working the day shift (for whom ShiftNight = 0) and having good health (for whom HealthBad = 0) - in other words, the expected value of Y is higher by 2 units for subjects working the day shift and having good health who belong to crew B compared to those sharing the same characteristics but who belong to crew A; The effect is equal to 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 for subjects working the night shift (for whom ShiftNight = 1) and having bad health (for whom HealthBad = 1) - in other words, the expected value of Y is higher by 11 units for subjects working the night shift and having bad health who belong to crew B compared to those sharing the same characteristics but who belong to crew A. You can consider all possible combinations of shift and health status in order to describe the effect of crew on the expected value of Y; in the above, I only considered 2 of the 4 possible combinations of values of shift and health status. You can and should also construct confidence intervals to go with the reported point estimates 2, 11, etc. Quantify Effect of Shift What if you are interested in quantifying the effect of shift on the expected value of Y? Then you need to re-express your model like this: Expected value of Y = 1 + 2*CrewB + (3 + 4*CrewB) * ShiftNight + 10*HealthBad + 5*CrewB:HealthBad From this re-expression, you can see that, for subjects with the same health status, the effect of shift depends on crew. Specifically: The estimated effect of shift is 3 for subjects in crew A sharing the same health status (since CrewB = 0 for them) - these subjects have an expected value of Y that is higher by 3 units under the night shift than under the day shift; Specifically: The estimated effect of shift is 3 + 4 = 7 for subjects in crew B sharing the same health status (since CrewB = 1 for them) - these subjects have an expected value of Y that is higher by 7 units under the night shift than under the day shift. Again, you can construct confidence intervals to go with the reported point estimates 3 and 7 of night shift. Quantify Effect of Health Status Finally, if you wanted to report the effect of health status, you would have to re-express your fitted model as: Expected value of Y = 1 + 2*CrewB + 3*ShiftNight + (10 + 5*CrewB)*HealthBad + 4*CrewB:ShiftNight Clearly, the effect of health status among subjects working the same type of shift depends on crew. This effect is estimated to be 10 for subjects working the same type of shift in crew A and it is estimated to be 15 for subjects working the same type of shift in crew B. To construct the suggested confidence intervals, you would need to construct and estimate appropriate linear combinations of the (true) model coefficients.
