You have a list of keyphrases that you need to extract from documents. You could use NER for this purpose. But looking at the size of the keyphrases (3000) it will be a difficult task because you would have to first annotate the keyphrases in the documents. After that you can train a NER model to make it learn to look for those phrases and extract them. There are many NER models out there. Start with the SpaCy library first as it gives a simple but effective framework for NER. You can try multiple BERT based models using the SpaCy library. You can use any of the NLP models available on HuggingFace inside SpaCy for NER.
