I had my qsrand() in the thread/class constructor. When i moved it to the run() function, it started to work randomly. Not sure why it would not work from the constructor though. qsrand() uses thread-local storage to store the seed which is actually the pseudorandom number generator state that also gets updated on each call to qrand() . If you seed the PRNG outside the thread where you will be using it, that seed does not influence the outcome. Thread-local storage usually defaults to zero so that way you would get the same sequence of pseudorandoms every time because the seed is always the same.
