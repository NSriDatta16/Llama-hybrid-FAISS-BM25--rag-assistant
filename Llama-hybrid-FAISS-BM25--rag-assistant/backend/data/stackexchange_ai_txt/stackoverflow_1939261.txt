You should investigate thoroughly how to configure an error page in the Servlet API. In that error page you can do whatever you want to with the triggering exception. See the Java EE tutorial about how to handle errors in JSP pages at http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnahe.html#bnahi EDIT: Also see the documentation of how to do it just with Tomcat at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/jndi-resources-howto.html . Search for JavaMail.
