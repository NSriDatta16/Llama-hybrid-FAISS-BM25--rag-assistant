In addition to Peter Flom's answer (+1), a problem affecting specifically the reliability of online surveys is that they require an Internet access and the capability to use it. So you have to make sure your population of interest not only want but can access the survey to answer it, in particular as people without an easy, cheap, and reliable access to Internet may have a specific profile (e.g. people from developing countries, people from disadvantaged backgrounds, people in remote places or at sea for long periods of time, possibly people in prison, etc.). If the survey will be used to influence decisions that will affect those people, there is obviously an ethical issue to consider if this coverage error is not addressed.
