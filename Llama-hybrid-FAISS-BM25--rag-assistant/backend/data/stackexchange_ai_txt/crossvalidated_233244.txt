You are just making an error in your maths, since $\sqrt{n}$ equals $\sqrt{10}$ in the first answer and $\sqrt{5}$ in the second one, not $10$. About the fact that the shortest interval is that centred on the mean, it's quite obvious from the shape of the normal distribution, not just because it's symmetrical but because density probability lowers as you move away from the mean. By geometric reasoning or using the average value theorem for integrals, it should be easy to prove that any interval with the same length would have a lower probability than the symmetrical one.
