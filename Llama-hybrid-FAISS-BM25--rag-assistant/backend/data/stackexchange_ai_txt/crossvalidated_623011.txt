Sampling without replacement until all elements of specific type are found

Suppose I have a population of size $n$ in which each element has a probability $p$ of being sick. By sampling this population without replacement , how many elements would I have to sample in average (expected value) to find all the sick ones? Simulating this in Python, when $n=100$ and $p=0.5$ , the expected value is $\approx$ 99.
