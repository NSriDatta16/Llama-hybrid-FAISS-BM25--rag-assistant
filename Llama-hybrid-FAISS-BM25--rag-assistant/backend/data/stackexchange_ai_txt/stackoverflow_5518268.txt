Visual Studio Windows keep undocking

I've had a long lengthy problem with something else and in trying to fix that, I've created a new problem. If you want the back story to my original problem, read this thread: VS.Net 2008 Windows 7 Debug Environment My NEW problem is that when I execute my code, all my windows pop-out and undock themselves. I can drag them back to their original positions, but every time I run the code, they undock themselves again. EVERY window like "watch 1", "watch 2", "watch 3", "watch 4", "call stack", and MANY others. The solution explorer and properties just disappear alltogether. I'm trying to get a project base to play nicely in XP and 7.0 and THIS is one of the results I'm getting. Any ideas?
