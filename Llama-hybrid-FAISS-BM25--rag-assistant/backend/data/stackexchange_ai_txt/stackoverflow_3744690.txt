The Standard (ISO C++-03) says the following thing about references It is unspecified whether or not a reference requires storage (3.7). Please someone correct me if I am wrong or if I have not understood his question correctly. EDIT : My question is sizeof(c2) > sizeof(c1) in 64bit machines? No, as @Chubsdad noticed sizeof(c2) = sizeof (c1) , the relevant quote from the Standard is When applied to a reference or a reference type, the result is the size of the referenced type . (ISO C++ $5.3.3/2)
