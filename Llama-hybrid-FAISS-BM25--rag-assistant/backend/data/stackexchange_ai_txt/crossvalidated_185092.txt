You have stated that you are interested in factors that are associated with severe and very severe, so it is appropriate to dichotomize so the interpretation of model results will match your hypothesis of interest. (Maybe this is when treatment starts to get expensive?). There are no moral imperatives here, no "should never"s. The reason for not dropping the 2s is it depends on what would you like the interpretation of your resulting odd-ratio to be. To me the odds of being severe (3,4) vs non-severe (0,1,2) makes more sense then the odds of being severe (3,4) vs non-severe (0,1) among those who are not moderate . The second interpretation is not useful. As a starting point I would go with the most simple model that does not throw away data. Then from there add more levels or parameters if they statistically improve the fit. Ordinal regression answers a much more broad question about the chances of going up a category, maybe not of interest to you. The more complicated ordinal logistic regression makes the proportional odds assumption the odds of (0) vs (1,2,3,4), (0,1) vs (2,3,4), (0,1,2) vs (3,4), and (0,1,3) vs (4) are all equal, is a strong assumption, not easy to understand and usually not valid in practice so the model may not fit well. It is akin to treating the categories as continuous variables and running a linear regression, assuming a linear relationship between the categories and the factors. If you don't know how the categories were derived (ie how is no erosion different from mild erosion? is it quantified in terms of enamel thickness or some other continuous measurement?) that is a risky assumption.
