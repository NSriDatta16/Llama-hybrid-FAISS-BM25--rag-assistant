SpreadsheetGear for .NET is an Excel compatible spreadsheet control for WinForms which can also be used in ASP.NET applications. It supports autofill (drag fill with mouse as well as API) which is compatible with Excel as well as a Data Series command / UI / API which handles more complex cases including linear and growth trends, dates / times, etc... SpreadsheetGear also supports reading from, writing to xls and xlsx as well as clipboard support (Cut, Copy & Paste) which can handle Excel content on the Windows clipboard. We do not have a SpreadsheetGear for Silverlight control yet - but that is a high priority for the future. You can download the free trial here if you want to give it a try.
