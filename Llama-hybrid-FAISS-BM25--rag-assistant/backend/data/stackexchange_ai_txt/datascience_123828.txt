How in the heck should I tackle this classification problem? I'm not even sure if it's classification or regression

So, I'm currently a third year student in electrical engineering and I'm currently enrolled in a Mathematical Modelling and Machine Learning class and we're currently tasked to classify or use regression for the given datasets. Members of my group are all confused on how to tackle this problem since we're practically equipped with little to no knowledge and are told to explore the ocean by ourselves. Here's the dataset that my group are tasked with: https://univindonesia-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/andrano_mario_office_ui_ac_id/ETCLu_dRRWtCjgg1hDmnTGEB78T2DbIMRGvFQm6bzjpP-Q?e=8Cu9Bo From my understanding, this dataset is a form of multi-class classification problem since I thought that the output of this dataset is "quality" which can range anywhere from 1 to 10 (What I saw in the dataset is that the quality of those wines are mostly 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 so I assume that it's from 1 to 10). Now if this dataset does refer to a multi-classification problem, where should I start. My lecturer gave me his PowerPoints about SVMs but those are barely readable to me, it's filled with equations and no real life examples on how to do anything with those equations. Can anyone give me a clue on how should I tackle this problem, and also can anyone give me some good resources? I've been given books about the mathematics of it but none of them actually give understandable examples. (I learn better if I know how those mathematical equations are used in-depth).
