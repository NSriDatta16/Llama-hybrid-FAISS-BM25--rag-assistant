The first step to do this correctly is to prepare and organize your data. An amazing reference on how to undertake survival analysis using Stata is Cleves et al.'s 2010 book (refs below). It is very clear and helpful, plus it includes worked examples and commands. I agree with Nick in the comments about the syntax error. Since the goal is to investigate the same relationship over time, there is no need to define three sets of variables. You could just re-estimate the same model for each sub-period or consider a different one, such as a piecewise model. On the logistic regression point, the use of logit (or similar) models for discrete-time survival analysis requires a specifically structured dataset. Stephen Jenkins explains it well at p.95 of his unpublished manuscript (2005, still available); the procedure is also described in the Stata help . Honestly, I am not sure how well this kind of discrete-time survival models deals with fixed effects and multilevel interactions. However, the literature you refer to may provide further details in this regard. References Cleves, M., Gould, W. W., Gutierrez, R. G., & Marchenko, Y. U. (2010).
