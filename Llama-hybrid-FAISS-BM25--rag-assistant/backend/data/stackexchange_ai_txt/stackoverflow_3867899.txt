A somewhat elegant solution could be: $letters = array('/a/', '/p/', '/l/');// combo $sentence = "The rain in Spain stays mainly on the lane."; $sentence = preg_replace($letters, ' $0 ', $sentence, 1); Check the preg_replace documentation for more info on how this works. As I said that was an elegant solution. This one works ;), but it's not pretty. $letters = array('s', 'p', 'a', 'l', 'l', 'b');// combo $sentence = "The rain in Spain stays mainly on the big lane."; foreach($letters as $letter){ $sentence = preg_replace('/(? \ )'.$letter.'/i', ' $0 ', $sentence, 1); } echo $sentence;
