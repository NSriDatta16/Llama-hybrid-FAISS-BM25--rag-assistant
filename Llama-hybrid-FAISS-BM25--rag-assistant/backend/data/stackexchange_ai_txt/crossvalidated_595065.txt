Thinking about it, I could see two advantages: In pre-registered studies, one may then choose $\epsilon$ a priori , based on certain arguments, such that $|\mu| would may be deemed uninteresting but anything above would be perceived as most likely relevant/meaningful. This makes it harder to move the goalpost if the effect does not have the expected strength. The value of $\epsilon$ is also a basis for choosing a sample size that gives the test the proper amount of statistical power. So, specifying $\epsilon$ beforehand may help planning the study anyway. This may help counter the argument according to which the null will always be rejected provided the sample size is large enough (by making it just large enough to find interesting effects, but not much larger than that). This makes null hypothesis testing a little closer to ideal Popperian falsification, by committing to stricter requirements for rejecting the null prior to testing, and by making the null hypothesis a more challenging contender to the alternative. Now is your question that, even if one accepts to commit to a certain choice of $\epsilon$ prior to the study, then CI remains more informative and should be preferred? If this is about being more informative then, I agree with @Frank Harrell's Bayesian take, that the posterior distribution of the effect size would be more interesting anyway.
