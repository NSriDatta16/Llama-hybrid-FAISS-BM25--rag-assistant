Try this: using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream()) { FrameClass frame= new FrameClass (); frame.string1 = "hello"; frame.string2 = "world"; XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(frame.GetType()); xmlSerializer.Serialize(ms, frame); ms.Flush(); socket.Send(ms.GetBuffer(), (int)ms.Length, SocketFlags.None); } If you're sending the Frame XML one right after the other, then you're not sending an XML document. The XML Serializer will attempt to deserialize your entire document! I don't have time to research this now, but look into the XmlReaderSettings property for reading XML fragments. You would then create an XmlReader over the memorystream with those settings, and call it in a loop. The important thing is to flush the stream. It's also useful to put the stream in a using block to ensure it's cleaned up quickly.
