Crystal Reports - very large database, very long processing time

I'm really at a loss as to how to procede. I have a very large database, and the table I'm accessing has approx. 600,000 records. This database is accessed using an accounting application, which provides the report with the SQL query by which this report accesses the database. My report has a linked subreport which has restrictions that are placed in the report header. When this report is run, the average time to refresh, using a very base query is 36 minutes. When adding two more items to the query, the report takes 2.5 hours. Here is what I've tried: cleaned up the report only leaving items in absolutely necessary - no difference removed most formulas (removing the remaining formulas makes no time difference) tried editing the SQL query - wasn't allowed because of the accounting application tried flipping subreport and main report - didn't work added other groupings - no difference removed groupings - no difference checked all the servers for lack of temp disc space - no issue tried "on demand" subreport - no change checked Parameters (discrete vs. range) and it is as it should be tried bursting indexes, grouping on server, etc. - no difference the report requires 2 passes. I've tried getting it down to one pass unsuccessfully. There must be something I'm missing. There does not appear to be any other modifications to the report using regular crystal functions. Is there any way to speed up the accessing of the data without having to go through all 600,000 records? The SQL query that accesses this data is long and has many requests. It is not something I can change. Can I add something (formula?) that nullifies these requests? I'm reaching now...
