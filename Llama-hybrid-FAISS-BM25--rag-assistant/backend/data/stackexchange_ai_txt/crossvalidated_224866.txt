Best approach for this non-supervised clustering problem?

I'm a software engineer new to Machine Learning. I've read about basic non-supervised techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering and now I'm trying to put them into practice with a basic problem. Say I've got a lot of rows of data with each row looking something like this: "employeesRange": "11-50", "category": "Lobbying", "categoryGroup": "Polication Action", "sector": "Industrials", "subCategory": "Direct", "tags": [ "Progressive", "Libertarian", "PAC" ] My goals are to use hierarchical clustering to find clusters of common patterns. For example maybe it's a common pattern to find smaller groups of lobbyists 11-50 people for "Progressive", "Libertarian" causes but "Presidential" or "Local Politics" groups tend to skew larger. I also want to extract the most common patterns and get their recurring characteristics. I think hierarchical is the right approach because I don't know k in advance and I don't think association rule mining is best because that would let me predict one tag, given another. I want instead to have returned to me the strongest clusters and their strongest repeated patterns. My questions: 1) Is this a good approach? 2) How to I handle the tag field which has multiple tags? 3) Do I need to convert all the data into numbers i.e. does "Progressive" need to = 1 and "Libertarian" need to equal 2? 4) Is Python and SKLearn a good tool for this?
