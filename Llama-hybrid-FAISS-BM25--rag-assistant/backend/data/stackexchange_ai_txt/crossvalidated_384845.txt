I think, a couple of things should be noted here: 1) This equation resembles $E[X^2]$ , and it resembles the variance only if $E[X]$ is zero, since $var(X)=E[X^2]-E[X]^2$ . 2) It assumes that the $y_k$ 's are row vectors. So, $y_k^Ty_k$ will a matrix of $d\times d$ , where $d$ is the dimension of each sample. So, we're averaging $d \times d $ matrices here, as in @Francis's sample covariance link (which assumes $y_k$ 's as column vectors). 3) What you get out of this equation is a covariance matrix estimate, with entries $C_{rm}=cov(y^{r}, y^{m})$ , where $y^{i}$ represents the $i$ -th element of a random vector $y$ . 4) $\frac{1}{n-1}$ , instead of $\frac{1}{n}$ comes from unbiased estimation of sample covariance.
