Bounded functions when x tends to infinity

Please help me understand the below: The notation $g(x) = O(f(x))$ denotes that $\left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right|$ is bounded as $x \to \infty$ . For instance if $g(x)=3x^2 + 2$ , then $g(x) = O(x^2)$ So, when the author says bounded, $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is essentially $3 + \frac2{x^2}$ and when $x$ tends to infinity the second part tends to $0$ and hence the boundaries are $[3,0]$ ?? Note: This is from the book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
