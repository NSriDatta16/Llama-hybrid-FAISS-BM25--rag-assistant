The p-value answers the question "What is the probability of observing a result as extreme as the result I have, purely by chance, if I assume that the result should be zero on average?" The confidence interval answers the question "what is the interval around the mean that captures a given proportion of observations?" I'm not sure how to interpret your notation. What does p-hat represent? Is this the result of the test statistic? If so, I would go with something other than p, to avoid the possibility of confusing it with the p-value. Also, what is the confidence interval lower bound? zero?
