Some excellent ideas, but I think the best way (as sidereal said that it's more read heavy that write heavy) would be to have columns rating and times_rated, and just do something like this: new_rating = ((times_rated * rating) + current_rating) / (times_rated + 1) current_rating being the rating being applied when the person clicks the little stars. This simply weights the current user's rating in an average with the current rating.
