It's a shame this one was dismissed and left unanswered. Jonckheere (1954) and Stilson & Campbell (1962) independently proposed a significance test for the average Kendall's Tau against a "correct", or criterion ranking that seems to match the question perfectly. A Kendall's Tau correlation between two separate rank-orderings can be transformed into the number of (dis)agreements on the relative ranking of each pair of objects (e.g. do both rankings agree object A is rated over B?), and forms the well-known Kendall's Tau distance, $\tau_D$ (a.k.a. the bubble sort distance). $$\tau_D = \Bigg(\frac{1-\tau}{2}\Bigg)\tau_{Dmax}$$ Where $\tau_{D\text{max}} = k(k-1)/2$ and reflects the maximum number of possible disagreements (i.e. totally opposite rank-orderings), with $k$ objects being ranked. I've provided another answer exploring this previously here ; transforming a Kendall's Tau correlation into Kendall's Tau distance is useful in this case because it underlies the null distribution used in the test. If we calculate $\tau_D$ from the criterion rank-ordering for each independent rater, we can sum the total disagreements with bounds between $0$ and $n\tau_{D\text{max}}$ (i.e. all rank-orderings provided by the raters agree with the criterion, and all rank-orderings are exactly the opposite, respectively). Conceptually, this is the same as finding the average Kendall's Tau, and a relevant transform is provided below. You can flip this by only counting agreements instead and come up with a similar measure if you're interested in quantifying how similar the rankings are to the criterion. The test proposed by Jonckheere basically defines a null distribution for the sum of total agreements for each ranking against a criterion ranking, defined as $P$ . The relationship between the average Kendall's Tau, $\bar{\tau}_c$ and $P$ is given by $$P=\frac{nk(k-1)(\bar{\tau}_c+1)}{4}$$ Note that in Jonckheere and Stilson & Campbell compute this statistic directly, rather than calculating $\bar{\tau}_c$ as an intermediate step. The distribution of $P$ under the null has a mean of $$E(P)=\frac{nk(k-1)}{4}$$ and variance of $$\text{Var}(P)=\frac{nk}{72}(k-1)(2k+5)$$ which can be used to create a test statistic $$Z = \frac{P - (1/2)-E(P)}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(P)}}$$ which follows a standard normal distribution. In R you could implement this test like so: criterion_tau You can replicate the results in Jonckheere (1954) fairly easily. He analyses a dataset of errors made by learners in an experiment, and expects that as subjects complete more trials, they should make fewer errors. # Table 3 - Learning Experiment (Jonckheere 1954) tab_3 References Jonckheere, A.
