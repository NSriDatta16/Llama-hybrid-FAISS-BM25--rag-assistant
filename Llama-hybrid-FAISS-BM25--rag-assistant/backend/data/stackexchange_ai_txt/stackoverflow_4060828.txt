First use a Fast Fourier Transform to transform the signal into the frequency domain. Then check if the signal in the typical "cry-frequencies" is significantly higher than the other amplitudes. The preprocessor of the speex codec supports noise vs signal detection, but I don't know if you can get it to work with XNA. Or if you really want some kind of loudness calculate the sum of squares of the amplitudes from the frequencies you're interested in (for example 50-20000Hz) and if the average of that over the last 30 seconds is significantly higher than the average over the last 10 minutes or exceeds a certain absolute threshold sound the alarm.
