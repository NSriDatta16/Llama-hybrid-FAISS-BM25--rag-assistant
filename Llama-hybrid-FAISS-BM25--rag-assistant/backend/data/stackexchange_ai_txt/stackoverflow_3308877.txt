As was pointed out by others, this is a well-known and encouraged pattern in C++. A way to deal with the problem of forgetting the variable name is to define operations so that they need the variable. Either by making the possible actions a member of the RAII class: PushedMatrix pushed_matrix;; pushed_matrix.transform( /*...*/ ); or by making functions take the RAII class as an argument: PushedMatrix pushed_matrix; transform_matrix( pushed_matrix, /*...*/ );
