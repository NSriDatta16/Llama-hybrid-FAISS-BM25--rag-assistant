The composition of one or more linear functions is itself a linear function. A neural network using only linear activations can be rewritten as a linear function. What is the purpose of a neural network activation function? Using a linear function, you'll be able to approximate functions which are single, straight lines, i.e. linear functions. Approximating a nonlinear function with a linear function will have some amount of error -- perhaps small enough to be ignored, perhaps too large to be acceptable. This judgement depends on what you need from your model.
