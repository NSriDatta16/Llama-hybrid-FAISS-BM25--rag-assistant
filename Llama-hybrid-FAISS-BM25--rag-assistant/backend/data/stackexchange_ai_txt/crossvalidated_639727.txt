Comparison of confidence intervals: bootstrap & exact resampling

Consider data $X_1,...X_n$ generated from a probability distribution $F$ with density $f$ . I'm interested in constructing confidence intervals for a parameter say, $\theta(F)$ . Via Monte Carlo simulations, I want to compare the expected lengths and coverage probabilities of $X\%$ confidence intervals based on exact resampling (i.e., can generate multiple independent samples of size $n$ from $F$ ) and bootstrap. This explains the fundamental difference between Bootstrapping and Monte Carlo procedure. While I understand what it means to use Monte Carlo simulations to generate confidence intervals for bootstrap resampling method, I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Theoretically, what I know is if $X_1^{*},X_2^{*},\ldots,X_n^{*}$ is a single resample then, the bootstrap estimate for $G_n(t)=P_F(\sqrt{n}[\hat{\theta}-\theta]\le t)$ is given by $\hat G_n(t)=P_{F_n}(\sqrt{n}[\hat\theta^*-\hat\theta]\le t)$ where $F_n$ is the resampled distribution. Using Monte Carlo, if we have generated $B$ resamples, the bootstrap estimate is $\tilde G_n(t)=\frac{1}{B}\sum^B \hat G_{n,i}(t)$ . Also, I know that the pivotal quantity $\sqrt{n}[\hat{\theta}-\theta]$ can be a little different for some parameters, just using it as a placeholder. Confidence interval from a one resample $X_1^*,\ldots,X_n^*$ would be for $\hat\theta$ : $$\left(\hat\theta^*\pm\frac{q_{\alpha/2}}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$ where, $q_{\alpha/2}$ is the $\alpha/2$ th quantile from $F_n$ . But where does the Monte Carlo estimate prove useful? From a single bootstrapped sample I get a single estimate of the mean. To use Monte Carlo, I get $B$ estimates of the mean using which, I need to create a confidence interval but, how? Moreover, a single confidence interval is not enough to get the expected length and coverage probability. Do I need to get $N$ different confidence intervals? I don't want the complete procedure written, I just want to have the gaps in my understanding cleared.
