Depending on what environment you guys are working in, you may be able to leverage existing frameworks for this sort of thing rather than rolling your own. If you are using .NET 2.0 or higher, I'd suggest leveraging the System.Web.Security.RoleProvider class. A previous answer of mine has more thoughts on this here .
