BASE and weaker consistency boils down to the convergence of copies in a replication scenario. There is a large literature on replication in distributed system, with eiter eager or lazy replication, with group or master copy, etc. Consensus is one problem that can be precisely formulated. Several solutions/algorithms can be proposed. Lazy replication with convergence of copies isn't. I feel like it's more an architectural issue. But as I just said, there is a large body of work on replication or distributed storage, which might be what you are looking for. Here are nevertheless a few links which I found interesting: Comparision of some modern distributed storage system Scalaris The danger or replication ACID vs. BASE
