Multiple R-squared from bootstrap in R

I am fairly new to R and am having issues with my bootstrapped linear model. I'm using non-parametric case re-sampling to account for some skewed variables. Here is what I have done so far: library(car) library(carData) set.seef(214) mod1 Then I use the average of individual predictors 95CIs to get a coefficient estimate. My question is how to find the CIs for the multiple R-squared , so I can assess the fit of the model. I suspect it is by re-writing the "f" (function) in the Boot model? apologies if this is a super elementary question, any input would be much appreciated. Thanks!
