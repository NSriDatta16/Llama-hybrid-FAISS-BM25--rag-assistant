You don't need a foreach loop - just use a regular loop but go in reverse, start at the end and go to the beginning. //For each checked box, run the delete code for (int i = 0; i = 0; j--) { ToolStripMenuItem menuItem = favoritesToolStripMenuItem.DropDownItems[j] as ToolStripMenuItem; //This rules out seperators if (menuItem != null) { //This matches the dropdownitems text to the CheckedItems String if (menuItem.Text.ToString() == organizeFav.CheckedItems[i].ToString()) { favoritesToolStripMenuItem.DropDownItems.Remove(menuItem); } } } } this was @Kurresmack's code rearranged, i just coded it directly here in the page so excuse any small syntax error or anything obvious i overlooked (disclaimer: it is a sample!!) You can still treat favoritesToolStripMenuItem.DropDownItems as a collection like you were, but you don't have to enumerate over it using a foreach . This cuts down on a few lines of code, and it works because you are iterating it in reverse order, you will not get an index out of bounds exception.
