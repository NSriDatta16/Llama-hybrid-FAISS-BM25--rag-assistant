From A Tutorial on Particle Filtering and Smoothing: Fifteen years later : Since their introduction in 1993, particle filters have become a very popular class of numerical methods for the solution of optimal estimation problems in non-linear non-Gaussian scenarios. In comparison with standard approximation methods, such as the popular Extended Kalman Filter, the principal advantage of particle methods is that they do not rely on any local linearisation technique or any crude functional approximation. The price that must be paid for this flexibility is computational: these methods are computationally expensive. However, thanks to the availability of ever-increasing computational power, these methods are already used in real-time applications appearing in fields as diverse as chemical engineering, computer vision, financial econometrics, target tracking and robotics. Moreover, even in scenarios in which there are no real-time constraints, these methods can be a powerful alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms â€” alternatively, they can be used to design very efficient MCMC schemes. In short, Particle filter is more elastic as it does not assume linearity and Gaussian nature of noise in data, but is more computationally expensive. It represents the distribution by creating (or drawing) and weighting random samples instead of mean and covariance matrix as in Gaussian distribution.
