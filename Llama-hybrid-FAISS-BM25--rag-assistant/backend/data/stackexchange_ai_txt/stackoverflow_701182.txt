I wrote an entire blog entry on this subject: Regular Expression Limitations The crux of the issue is that HTML and XML are recursive structures which require counting mechanisms in order to properly parse. A true regex is not capable of counting. You must have a context free grammar in order to count. The previous paragraph comes with a slight caveat. Certain regex implementations now support the idea of recursion. However once you start adding recursion into your regex expressions, you are really stretching the boundaries and should consider a parser.
