Is Kernel PCA with linear kernel equivalent to standard PCA?

If in kernel PCA I choose a linear kernel $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf x^\top \mathbf y$, is the result going to be different from the ordinary linear PCA ? Are the solutions fundamentally different or does some well defined relation exist?
