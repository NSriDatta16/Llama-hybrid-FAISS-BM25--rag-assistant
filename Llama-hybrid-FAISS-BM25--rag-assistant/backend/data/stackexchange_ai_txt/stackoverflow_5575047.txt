Azure Storage Voting Pattern

I'm investigating the use of Azure Storage for an application I have in mind. Part of it involves some SO-like functionality for voting and favourites. As with SO I'd like to be able to allow a user to vote/add favourites only once and use these for scoring/weighting purposes later on. How would one go about doing this using Azure Storage, or AWS SimpleDB for that matter? Are there patterns for this type of scenario emerging?
