Updating the contents of a dropdown list Javascript/PHP

I'm new to Javascript/Jquery and struggling with a certain issue. In the process of adding a job to a database, the users have an option to update the contents of dropdown lists with new options. Adding the new options is handled through a greybox which posts data with PHP through to the database. After adding the new option it does not display in the dropdown list. As such they need to be able to click a button to refresh the contents of the dropdown list. Has anyone accomplished this before, and can show me some sample source code? Or is there a more elegant solution fo this issue? I've been researching pretty much non-stop and cannot find a solution, any help is appreciated. n.n Edit: function getbrands(){ new Ajax.Request('ajax/brand.php',{ method: 'get', onSuccess: function(transport){ var response = transport.responseText; $("brand").update(response); } }); } It works... sometimes. Highly unstable. Also has a bad habit of conflicting with other scripts on the page. (mainly the greybox) Any suggestions will be taken on board at this stage. :X
