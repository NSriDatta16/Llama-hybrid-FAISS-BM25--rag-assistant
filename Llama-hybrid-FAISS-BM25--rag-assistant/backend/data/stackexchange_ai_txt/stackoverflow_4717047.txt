How do I manipulate my session's expiry time after Rails app initialization?

I'm using the dalli memcached client for session storage in my Rails app. I'd like to allow users to check a 'Keep me signed in' box when they login to the app, which will cause the session to expire after a month or something. It's pretty straightforward to set the expiration time in the app initialization: config/initializers/session_store.rb require 'action_dispatch/middleware/session/dalli_store' Rails.application.config.session_store :dalli_store, :memcache_server => ['host1', 'host2'], :namespace => 'sessions', :key => '_foundation_session', :expire_after => 30.minutes But how would I go about manipulating :expire_after after the app has been initialized?
