Using teamcity on a Project with multiple Mercurial Repos

So why working on improving some of the development habits at the company that I work for I've decided to attempt to create a CI process using TeamCity. It was fairly straight forward until I got to the point where I was trying to set up my Build Agent to build a .sln that is comprised from about 11 mercurial repos (1 for each project). So currently as I understand it and from what I can see in the TeamCity agent set up I point the agent to the repo to pull from to perform the build under the Create Build Settings tab I go to VCS Settings, at this point I can't seem to figure out how to get it to pull the changes from all of the repos that are associated with the sln file? Am I going about this the wrong way or am I missing something obvious?
