Yes, a bootstrap sample is in general chosen to be of the same size with the training set, say $N$ and on average it contains $N-N/e\approx 0.63N$ unique samples. I think the sources saying " is typically around 63% that of the size of the training set" mean the same thing, although worded differently. A possible rewording maybe: a bootstrap sample has on average 63% of training set diversity.
