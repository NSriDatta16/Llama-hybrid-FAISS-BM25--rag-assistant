In this instance, a neural network could be very appropriate. The inputs to the network would be each of the sensors onboard the node, along with that of its neighbors. You would calculate weights based on your feedback. Another option (that is simpler, but can achieve good results as well) is a Gossip Algorithm . You would have to look into incorporating feedback though.
