You question has two parts 1) how to use LSTM to find anomalies in time series data 2) how to deal with imbalanced data. Regarding 1) the closest thing comes to my mind is this post from the sister website https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/127484/cluster-sequences-of-data-with-different-length/440432#440432 - the only difference is you have labeled data therefore, you have to adjust the architecture to accept a binary vector and optimize the weights with respect to that. You can also think of your case project as an unsupervised where you use and auto-encoder to find distances between pair of data. You are lucky to have labels, so the auto-encoder is not the entire architecture and you need the output layer with size 1 to take care of the labels. Regarding item 2), in your question the imbalanced data. There are various strategies in fact. One way is what you suggest. I would filter the data (up-sampling or down-sampling) and train the model with balanced data.
