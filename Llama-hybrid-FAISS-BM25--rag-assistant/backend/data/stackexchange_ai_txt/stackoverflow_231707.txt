Strategies for handling memory consumption in PHP5?

We have a large management software that is producing big reports of all kinds, based on numerous loops, with database retrievals, objects creations (many), and so on. On PHP4 it could run happily with a memory limit of 64 MB - now we have moved it on a new server and with the same database - same code, the same reports won't come up without a gig of memory limit... I know that PHP5 has changed under the hood quite a lot of things, but is there a way to make it behave ? The question at the end is, what strategies do you apply when you need to have your scripts on a diet ?
