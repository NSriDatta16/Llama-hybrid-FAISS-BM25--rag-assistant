The chi square transformation is a transformation of a data matrix $Y \rightarrow Y^{\prime}$ such that when one computes the Euclidean distance of $Y^{\prime}$ the resulting dissimilarity matrix represents chi-square distances in the original data $Y$. The transformation is $$y^{\prime}_{ij} = \sqrt{y_{..}} \left ( \frac{y_{ij}}{y_{i.} \sqrt{y_{.j}}} \right )$$ where $y^{\prime}_{ij}$ is the chi-square transformed data for species $j$ in the $i$th sample/row, $y_{..}$ is the grand total of the matrix (your "matrix sum"), $y_{i.}$ is the row sum for the $i$th row, and $y_{.j}$ is the column sum for the $j$th species. Mathematically there is nothing stopping you from computing this using the grand total and row and column sums of the subset of data you have available. If this makes sense for your data/application then I don't know enough detail about that to answer the question. Conceptually, if you are willing to consider essentially relative composition in terms of relative to the subset of species/variables you have then it is probably OK. If it would seem odd to think of relative composition of the community based only on a subset of the species then perhaps you shouldn't do this. I should add, that while the documentation for decostand() in vegan talks about the row and column sums and grand total, it will actually compute these from the data supplied to decostand() - there isn't a mechanism for you to supply these even if you did know them.
