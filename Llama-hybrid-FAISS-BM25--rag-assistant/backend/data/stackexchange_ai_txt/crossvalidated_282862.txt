It really depends on what you are using your PCA for. Are you using it to simplify your model for prediction? Then predict using a PCA model and a model without PCA (and use other methods for simplification, too, e.g., the Lasso), and check which one gives better predictions. Or are you using it simply to explain and understand your data better? Then talk to experts about whether your factor loadings make sense. Peer review is a wonderful thing here, though it will be subjective and may be slow. If you publish an article with conclusions based on PCA, but it is never cited (or cited only to be ridiculed), then at least the community does not believe your PCA was any good. Alternatively, collect another data sample and perform PCA again on that sample, checking whether factor loadings etc. are similar. This goes into test-retest reliability terrain.
