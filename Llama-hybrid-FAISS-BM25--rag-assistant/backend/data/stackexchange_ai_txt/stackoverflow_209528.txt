How do I drag and drop something into a Static control?

How would I drag and drop something into a static control? It looks like I need to create a sub class of COleDropTarget and include that as a member variable in a custom CStatic. That doesn't appear to be working though. When I try and drag something onto the Static control I get the drop denied cursor.
