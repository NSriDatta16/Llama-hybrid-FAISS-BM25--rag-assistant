In the original paper, the author states the cold-start problem can be adjusted by replacing the user / item embedding with content features. Note that with such a generic feature representation for inputs, our method can be easily adjusted to address the cold-start problem by using content features to represent users and items. To my understanding, the content features can be geographic information / profile / behavior of a new user or categorical feature for a new item. The model can still make an inference on a new user / item because content-based features for existing users and items are used during model training. link to paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031v2.pdf
