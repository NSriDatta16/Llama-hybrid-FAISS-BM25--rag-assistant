What you want to make sure is that the query will use ONLY the index, so make sure that the index covers all the fields you are selecting. Also, since it is a range query involved, You need to have the venid first in the index, since it is queried as a constant. I would therefore create and index like so: ALTER TABLE events ADD INDEX indexNameHere (venid, date, time); With this index, all the information that is needed to complete the query is in the index. This means that, hopefully, the storage engine is able to fetch the information without actually seeking inside the table itself. However, MyISAM might not be able to do this, since it doesn't store the data in the leaves of the indexes, so you might not get the speed increase you desire. If that's the case, try to create a copy of the table, and use the InnoDB engine on the copy. Repeat the same steps there and see if you get a significant speed increase. InnoDB does store the field values in the index leaves, and allow covering indexes. Now, hopefully you'll see the following when you explain the query: mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT date, time FROM events WHERE venid='47975' AND date>='2009-07-11' ORDER BY date; id select_type table type possible_keys key [..] Extra 1 SIMPLE events range date_idx, indexNameHere indexNameHere Using index, Using where
