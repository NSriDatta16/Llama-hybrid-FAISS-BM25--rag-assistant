First, visualization is just an easy and intuitive way to understand underlying patterns in your data. Everything that you can achieve through this, can also be achieved through painstakingly printing different values and statistics. I will just mention two simple examples of algorithms chosen because of patterns in the data. They are very simple, but they can be generalized. Regression If you find out that the data is linear, Linear Regression can be a good choice of algorithm Classification If the data are linearly separable, SVM is suitable These are visualizations of the datapoints themselves, but other visualizations like histograms can help find underlying distributions too. In addition, visualization can be useful in other parts of the process. For example, if you see a normal distribution, you can impute missing data using the mean value, while for a skewed distribution the median is more suitable.
