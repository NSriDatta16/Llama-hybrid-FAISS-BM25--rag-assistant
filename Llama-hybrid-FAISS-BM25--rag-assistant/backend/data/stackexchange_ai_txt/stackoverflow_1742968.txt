Seems like a useful tool, I thought it might already exist, but I couldn't find anything. I think you probably would need to create it. To do so you can probably leverage one of the many existing CSS parser libraries or programs that are out there. A quick search reveals multiple ones in .NET, Java, Ruby, etc. There's even questions about this on StackOverflow.
