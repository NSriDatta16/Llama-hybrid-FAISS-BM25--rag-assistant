Is it a bad idea to use GUIDs as primary keys in MS SQL?

We have a system that uses UniqueIdentifier as the primary key of each of the tables. It has been brought to our attention that this is a bad idea. I have seen similar post on the subject but I am interested in any MS SQL performance and other potential problems I may encounter due to this decision.
