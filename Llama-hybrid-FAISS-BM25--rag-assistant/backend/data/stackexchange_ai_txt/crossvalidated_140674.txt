Textbooks on linear regression with least squares

I watched several videos on linear regression, mainly from Khan Academy . As I have no background in statistics, I thought this was a good way to get an idea of the topic. However I'm currently writing a bachelor thesis on Structural Equation Modeling and I want to get a deeper understanding of Regression Analysis. The Book should roughly include these topics: linear least squares regression variance, covariance regression coefficient coefficient of determination residual analysis (esp. leverage effect) multiple regression I especially enjoyed the videos on khan academy, of the proof of minimizing the squared error to the regression line or illustrations like this one from Wikipedia: I don't like it when books only present a formula and some common rules etc. without any further explanation of these. F.e. Residuals should be normally distributed. However I'm also not comfortable with strictly mathematical books, so I'm searching for something in between. A plus would be example code in R, but definitely not a must have.
