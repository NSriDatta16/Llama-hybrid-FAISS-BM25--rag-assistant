rhino embedding

Anyone understands the rhino javascript Contexts? I cannot find any useful documentation about it. My main problem is the Context.exit() (really should be cx.exit()) which from what I understand exits the context associated with the current thread? Does that mean I need to keep track of what which thread does? main thread: Context cx; cx.evaluateReader( ... ) // load some function start thread 2 thread 2: Object o= scope.get("methodname", scope); ((Function)o).call( ... ) I do not plan on doing multithreading but what if the different setups comes from different threads?
