Vaadin SEO how?

I am going to use Vaadin UI framework to develop web application where indexing in search engines is very critical. And I know that the most search engines not indexing GWT sites. I have already googled and found some solutions that identifies search engines by user agent and redirect them for special indexable pages. I think it is not best way. Is there any creative ideas? (That really will amaze!!!)
