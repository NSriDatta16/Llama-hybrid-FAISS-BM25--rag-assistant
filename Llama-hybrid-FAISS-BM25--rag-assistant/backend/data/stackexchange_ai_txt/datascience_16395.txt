Feature usage for machine learning algorithm

Given a list of software installed by users as features, e.g., Microsoft_VC80_DebugCRT_x86_x64 1.0.0; Microsoft_VC80_DebugCRT_x86 1.0.0; ;Windows UPnP Browser 0.1.01;Adobe Acrobat Professional 10; I want to predict whether the student will buy certain product. Now the question is: what are the ways to turn the list of software into something learnable by a machine learning algorithm?
