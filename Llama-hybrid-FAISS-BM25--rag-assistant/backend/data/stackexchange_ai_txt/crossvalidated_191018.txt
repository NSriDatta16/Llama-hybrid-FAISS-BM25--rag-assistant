How to deal with negative Shapley coalitions/contributions

I have a moderate understanding around the Shapley value/theorem (I've been digging into many papers and research articles lately). I'm trying to derive weights/attribution for each player when they combine to "play" a game together and gain points. The issue I've uncovered (with certain coalitions or permeated groupings) is that some players have a negative/drag effect on the team...In other words, their final Shapley weight/value (when computed from previous groupings) is a net negative... Example (each players points & combinations): Game Types & Results ------------------------------------- [single] [double] [triple] A = 8 AB = 0 ABC = 6 Question.... B = 2 AC = 12 find out how much percentage of credit C = 9 CB = 1 should be given out to each player in game of ABC = 6 Answer.... SHAPLEY WEIGHTS (with negative allowed) --------------------------------------- A = + 63.9% B = - 55.6% (Question #1) I've read some material (I'll try to link the PDF later) that stated you can choose to "opt-out" negative coalitions during the calculation of the Shapley value--- in other words, you skip the calculation for (instead of negative contribution, just give it zero)...Is this correct or do I have it all wrong? (Question #2) If I allow for a negative Shapley value (for a player, while I'm calculating everything), could I instead give them just 0% in the final output and then scale the weights proportionally to the other players? How should I most appropriately approach the most "fair" solution... I can't "steal" persons B's money (that doesn't seem cool) Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks again!
