They arrive at this identity by a technique called completing the square. The left hand side is in a quadratic form, so start by multiplying it out $$ (y-X\beta)'H^{-1}(y-X\beta)= y'H^{-1}y - 2y'H^{-1}X\beta + \beta'X'H^{-1} X\beta $$ continue on and then rewrite in terms of $\hat{\beta} = (X'H^{-1}X)^{-1}X'H^{-1}y$. The algebra is kind of long but googling completing the square in Bayesian regression and you can find plenty of hints. For example, see the wikipedia on Bayesian linear regression , and other CrossValided answers regarding completing the square, like here .
