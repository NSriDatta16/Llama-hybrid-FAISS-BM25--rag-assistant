What is the best way to create a debugging web page for a computation in Java?

I'm developing a website that uses some complex computations (NLP-related). My customer wants to have "debugging" webpages for some of these computations where he can run them with arbitrary input and see all the intermediate results that occur during computation. Before this request all of the computations were encapsulated in beans and intermediate results were logged into general log. What is the best way to capture all these results on Java level to render them as webpage?
