How to calculate the probability of occurrence of the dependent variable in spline logistic regression analysis?

I know how the probability of the dependent variable is calculated using the regression equation: P(1) = exp(Y')/(1 + exp(Y')) But I do not know how it calculated in a spline binary logistic regression.
