Your assetsInStorage doesn't appear to be an IEnumerable ... as such, you'd have to project your anonymous type into a string. assetsInStorage.Select(a=>a[0] + a[1]) (Or however you want to convert that anonymouns type to a string.) And then you can return .ToArray() : return assetsInStorage.Select(a=>a[0]+a[1]).ToArray();
