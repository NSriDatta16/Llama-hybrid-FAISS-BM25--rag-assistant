Mean average error normalized by the standard deviation of the target

I'm working on a regression model, aiming at prediction age from structured data. I'm using the mean average error (MAE) as evaluation metric, and want to compare my performances with state-of-the-art performances. The thing is that we are not using the same dataset, so the target variable (age) doesn't have the same range. Having an MAE of 2 if age is ranging from 2 to 5 isn't the same as if the age is ranging from 2 to 40. Does it makes sense to compare MAE/std(age) instead of MAE alone? Thanks for your help
