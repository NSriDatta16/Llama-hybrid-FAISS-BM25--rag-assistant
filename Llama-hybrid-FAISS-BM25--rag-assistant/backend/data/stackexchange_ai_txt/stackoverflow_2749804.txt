Drag drop open file in Macvim split window?

I like to use the split window feature in Vim. However I cannot seem to drag drop new files into the different sections. Doing so will just open a new tab. I don't like using tabs as I still need to flick between them and not much different to using separate windows. Is there anyway I can change this behaviour? It works fine on Windows gVim and Im using the same vimrc file.
