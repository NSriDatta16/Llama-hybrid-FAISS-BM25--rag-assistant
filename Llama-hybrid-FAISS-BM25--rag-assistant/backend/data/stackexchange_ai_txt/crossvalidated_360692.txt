What is the optimal number of neurons in fully connected layer in CNN?

I am reading this paper "Human Activity Recognition From Accelerometer Data Using Convolutional Neural Network". NN experts don't have to read the entire paper. I'm adding the important diagram here: It takes a vector as an input. First layer is convolutional layer. It consists of 128*3 neurons with three different sizes (3,4 and 5). Then maxpool layer. Output of maxpool layer is concatenated and vector of length 384 is formed which then is inputted to fully connected layer. My question here is that how many neurons should be there in the fully connected layer. It might sound like a naive question but I am a newbie to these concepts :)
