With a variable that cannot be negative, even a single positive value is sufficient to cause us to reject a null hypothesis that the average ring size is 0 against the alternative that it's greater than 0. That's because for the population mean ring size to be 0, all values in the population must be exactly 0 . If even a single member of the population is non-zero, we can be certain that the average exceeds 0. If we observe even one non-zero value in our sample, the population must have at least that many non-zero values in it. No test is necessary; you can say with certainty that the average ring size is not zero. (It may be that more careful identification of a suitable hypothesis is needed.)
