Do I need to standardize my likert data for principal component analysis?

I am doing a PCA and I am analyzing 15 performance variables. All of these variables are measured from a scale of 1-5 (1 very dissatisfied, 5 very satisfied). Do I need to standardize the data for analysis? Can I just use the original data / mean-corrected data for analysis?
