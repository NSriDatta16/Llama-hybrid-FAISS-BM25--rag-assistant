Faruz, Gaussie is right you need to use a timeout. However, consider using mootools' addEvent function as described in the mootools docs as well as the $$ function which will allow you to achieve something much more elegant, along the lines of: window.addEvent('domready', function() { $$("tr td input").addEvent("mouseover", function() { //anonymous function like Gaussie's here }); }); Note that this isn't the exact code, it will take some modification but it is cleaner and should be more efficient then setting the onmouseover property of every image. Also, remember this goes in the head of your HTML document.
