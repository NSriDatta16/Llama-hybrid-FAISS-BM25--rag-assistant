oh oh! I had this one once... I had a regex with the hiragana, then katakana and then the kanji. I forget the exact codes, I'll go have a look. regex is great because you double the problems. And I did it in PHP, my choice for extra strong auto problem generation --edit-- $pattern = '/[^\wぁ-ゔァ-ヺー\x{4E00}-\x{9FAF}_\-]+/u'; I found this here , but it's not great... I'll keep looking --edit-- I looked through my portable hard drive.... I thought I had kept that particular snippet from the last company... sorry.
