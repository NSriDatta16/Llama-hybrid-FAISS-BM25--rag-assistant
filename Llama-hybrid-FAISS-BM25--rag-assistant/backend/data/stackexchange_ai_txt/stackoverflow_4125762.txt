Is there an elegant way of doing something to the last element of a for-each loop in Java?

I'm using Java 6. Suppose I had a bunch of cats to feed, and suppose myCats is sorted. for (Cat cat : myCats) { feedDryFood(cat); //if this is the last cat (my favorite), give her a tuna if (...) alsoFeedTuna(cat); } and I wanted to treat my last cat specially. Is there a way to do this elegantly inside the loop? The only way I can think of is counting them. Stepping back a little bit for a wider picture, is there any programming language that supports this little feature in a for-each loop?
