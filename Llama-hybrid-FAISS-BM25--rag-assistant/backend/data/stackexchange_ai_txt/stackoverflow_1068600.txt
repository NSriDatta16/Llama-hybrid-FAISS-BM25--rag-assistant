Depending on what version of ASP.NET your are using you can use one of the Form Validation controls in your toolbox under 'Validation.' This is probably preferable to setting up your own logic after a postback. There are several types that you can drag to your form and associate with controls, and you can customize the error messages and positioning as well. There are several types that can make it a required field or make sure its within a certain range, but you probably want the Regular Expression validator. You can use one of the expressions already shown or I think Visual Studio might supply a sample email address one.
