Accessing E4X nodes having special characters in name without breaking binding chain in flex

I am using E4X to bind some values from xml in flex 3. There is a problem when xml tag's (or attribute's) name has special character in it: having xml content var xml:XML = special-name could not be accessed using xml.special-name.@att because it is interpreted as subtraction, on the other hand using square bracket notation xml['special-name'].@att breaks binding chain. Is there an elegant way to solve this (like special language syntax) without writing custom binding setters and listeners?
