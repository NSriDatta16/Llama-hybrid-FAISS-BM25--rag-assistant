What's the most efficient bit vector compression method for my use case?

I'm working on a project in computational biology and I need to store an index of locuses that differ between many sequences. For now, I'm using a B+Tree for that purpose, but I guess using a bitmap index would be way faster for such a use case : only a small number of locus differ between two sequences, 1% on average, and they are nearly equally distributed along the sequence; so it seems like there is a lot of room for bitmap index compression. My problem is that I cannot manage to find a compression method that can efficiently: allow fast individual bit setting/unsetting permit efficient range queries over the bitmap possibly allow fast XOR-ing/AND-ing of two indexes Thx in advance for your suggestions.
