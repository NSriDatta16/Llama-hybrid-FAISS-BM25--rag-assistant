I believe that the number of elements in C1 clusters are more than that of C0. Can you please check that once? C0 has 8554 samples, thus the average SSE becomes $\frac{28101.1}{8544} = 3.28$ . While C1 contains 20534 points with average SSE of $\frac{47725.5}{20534}=2.324$ . This implies that the C1 cluster is more contained, it has a very high SSE because it contains more than 2x times the points present in C0.
