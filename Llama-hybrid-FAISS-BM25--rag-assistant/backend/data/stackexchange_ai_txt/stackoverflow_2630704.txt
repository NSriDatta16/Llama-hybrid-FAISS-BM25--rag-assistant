You can use 2 maps (map in java, in other languages it can have another name): 1 for Attacking-->Defending and one for Defending-->Attacking . Let's consider Attacking-->Defending example. Map will contain Attacking types as keys and arrays of Defending types as values. For example: Fire-->[Fire, Water, Grass, Ice, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Steel]
