Based on the linked thread, I wonder if you might be interested in a prediction interval rather than a confidence interval . A prediction interval is one that contains the prediction error in, say, 90% of the instances (you could choose another fraction instead of 90%). In such a case, bootstrap is unnecessary. As Sextus Empiricus wrote in their answer, Your test set already contains multiple observations and you evaluate an error for each of them individually, giving you a distribution of errors. Thus, you can obtain a prediction interval as follows. First, obtain the errors on the test set. Second, calculate their 5% and 95% empirical quantiles. These are the end points of your 90% prediction interval. The interval is symmetric, as it leaves out 5% of the lowest and 5% of the highest errors. You may find that an asymmetric interval is shorter; e.g. check out the pairs of empirical quantiles whose levels are 90% apart such as 4% and 94%, 3% and 93%, etc., 6% and 96%, 7% and 97% etc. Perhaps some of these intervals will be shorter than the one based on 5% and 95% quantiles, so if you want the shortest interval for a given coverage percentage, you can choose that. For a relevant keyword, see conformal prediction .
