Why both no-cache and no-store should be used in HTTP response?

I'm told to prevent user-info leaking, only "no-cache" in response is not enough. "no-store" is also necessary. Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store After reading this spec http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html , I'm still not quite sure why. My current understanding is that it is just for intermediate cache server. Even if "no-cache" is in response, intermediate cache server can still save the content to non-volatile storage. The intermediate cache server will decide whether using the saved content for following request. However, if "no-store" is in the response, the intermediate cache sever is not supposed to store the content. So, it is safer. Is there any other reason we need both "no-cache" and "no-store"?
