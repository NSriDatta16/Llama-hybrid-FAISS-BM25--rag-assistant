How could have a loss/cost/error function that cannot be written as an average?

Check this phrase in this online book: https://hyp.is/GsHrloyvEeaYQ093X053Wg/neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html It refers that the quadratic cost function (RSS) can be written as an average for each individual training example. so if the cost of a single training example is Cx = (1/2) * ||y-a||^2 you can have C = (1/n) * Î£(Cx) Could you give an example of an error / cost function that cannot be written as an average?
