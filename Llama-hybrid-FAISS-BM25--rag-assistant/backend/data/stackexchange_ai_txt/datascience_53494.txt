I see 2 possible reasons for why a RNN could necessitate fewer layers than a CNN to reach the same performance: RNN layers are generally fully connected layers which have more parameters than a convolutional layer. A RNN has some components which allow to combine inputs by multiplication unlike a CNN which can only combine inputs by weighted addition. Thus the multiplicative capacity of the RNN gives him more "power" to compute features. The CNN would need many layers to "imitate" this multiplicative capacity.
