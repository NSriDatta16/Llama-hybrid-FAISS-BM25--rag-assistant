Regex to replace html whitespace and leading whitespace in notepad++

I have tried to use the following regex expression to remove html whitespace and leading whitespace Find: \s*([<>])\s* Replace: $1 But each time that I do this I end up with 186 occurrences of $1 literaly in my document. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated Here is an example of what I am talking about This Original AA Features: 2 pole rectangular dome tent with 13.4 sq ft of vestibule storage Durable, shockcorded, self-supporting fiberglass frame and ring and pin/pole pocket assembly 2 side opening door panels are constructed entirely of no see-um mesh to maximize air flow inside Poke-out vent in side wall allows the option of additional ventilation when needed 2 interior storage pockets keep essential items handy Specifications: Season: 3 Sleeps: 2 Doors: 2 Windows: 2 Weight: 5 lbs 12 oz Area: 36.5 Sq. Ft. Center Height: 3' 7.5&quot; should become: Original AA Features: 2 pole rectangular dome tent with 13.4 sq ft of vestibule storage Durable, shockcorded, self-supporting fiberglass frame and ring and pin/pole pocket assembly 2 side opening door panels are constructed entirely of no see-um mesh to maximize air flow inside Poke-out vent in side wall allows the option of additional ventilation when needed 2 interior storage pockets keep essential items handy Specifications: Season: 3 Sleeps: 2 Doors: 2 Windows: 2 Weight: 5 lbs 12 oz Area: 36.5 Sq.
