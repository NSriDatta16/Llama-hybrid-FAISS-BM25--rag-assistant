Per @DeveloperChris' suggestion, you can enable SQL logging in Magento in the Varien_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql class (in the lib\Varien path). Change the $_debug and $_logAllQueries class variables to true . You can also change the file path where the queries are logged in $_debugFile . Don't forget to turn it off before production!
