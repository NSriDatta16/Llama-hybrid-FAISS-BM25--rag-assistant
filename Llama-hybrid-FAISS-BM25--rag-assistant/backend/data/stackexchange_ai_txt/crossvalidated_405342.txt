ugarchforecast is not using the data argument if you supply a fitted model as the first argument; you can see this by reading the help file for ugarchforecast . When you supply the data retu_test via ugarchforecast(ugfit,data=retu_test) , the data is ignored and the forecast is based on the fitted model and the last few data points in the training set retu_train . The trick is, GARCH models are autoregressive in the sense that they do not need new data to predict multiple steps ahead; the fitted model and the last few observations from the training data are enough to make forecasts. What you could do instead is rolling-window forecasting. Take a single time series of length $T$ . Estimate the model on the first $T-k$ data points (window $[1,T-k]$ ) and forecast the next data point. Then roll the estimation window from $[1,T-k]$ to $[2,T-k+1]$ and forecast the next data point. Keep rolling until you run out of data. Collect the $k$ forecasts and compare them to the actual realization to assess forecasting performance. This assesses one-step-ahead forecasting performance. You can forecast a few steps ahead instead of one if you are interested in a different forecast horizon. You can also assess how well a model trained on one time series works on another time series. You would take an estimated model (defined by all of its coefficients plus the distributional assumption) and "filter" a new series and produce forecasts. Point forecasts are in the column Series . Forecasts of the conditional variance are in the column Sigma .
