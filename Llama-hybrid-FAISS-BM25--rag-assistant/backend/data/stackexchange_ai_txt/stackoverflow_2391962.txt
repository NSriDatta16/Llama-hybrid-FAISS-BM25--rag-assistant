MySQL - Matching 2 rows (or more!) within a sub-query/table

I have this schema which I need to match 2 rows from user_data : user_id, field_id, value A sample output would be: user_id field_id value ----------------------------- 1 1 Gandalf 1 2 Glamdring How do I write a query which basically say "Find the user id of the user whose field_id 1 is Gandalf, and field_id 2 is Glamdring?" SELECT FROM looks at one row at a time. I am stumped on this. I will also need to find a solution that scale gracefully (such as looking at three rows etc.)
