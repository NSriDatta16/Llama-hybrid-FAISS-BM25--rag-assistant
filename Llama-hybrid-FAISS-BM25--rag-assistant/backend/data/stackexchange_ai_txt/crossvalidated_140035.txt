I work with machine learning algorithms, so I can only tell you how I would approach the problem. If I had access to labeled data (like the blue/red data points in your example), I would employ a linear C-SVM, which: is non-parametric (except for a mis-classification/regularization parameter 'C') attempts to solve the problem of separating labeled data using a 'maximum margin' line/plane in N dimensions allows for unequal class distributions (achieved by varying 'C' proportional to the inverse of class membership) I apologize if you are already aware of this class of algorithms...
