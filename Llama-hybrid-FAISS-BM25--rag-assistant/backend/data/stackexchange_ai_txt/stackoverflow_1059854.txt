How Do You Prevent A javax Transformer From Escaping Whitespace?

I'm using the javax.xml.transform.Transformer class to perform some XSLT translations, like so: TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); StreamSource source = new StreamSource(TRANSFORMER_PATH); Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(source); StringWriter extractionWriter = new StringWriter(); String xml = FileUtils.readFileToString(new File(sampleXmlPath)); transformer.transform(new StreamSource(new StringReader(xml)), new StreamResult(extractionWriter)); System.err.println(extractionWriter.toString()); However, no matter what I do I can't seem to avoid having the transformer convert any tabs that were in the source document in to their character entity equivalent ( &#9; ). I have tried both: transformer.setParameter("encoding", "UTF-8"); and: transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, "UTF-8"); but neither of those help. Does anyone have any suggestions? Because: &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9; looks really stupid (even if it does work).
