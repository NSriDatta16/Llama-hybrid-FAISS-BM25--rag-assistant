How do I upcast a collection of base class in C#?

In C#, I have a class A that I cannot modify. From this class I've created class B (i.e. inherited from A) which adds some properties. I also have a static function that returns List when GetListOfA() is called. How can I cast the return from GetListOfA() to List ? e.g. List bList = foo.GetListOfA() as List
