Model Selection: Logistic Regression

Suppose we have $n$ covariates $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and a binary outcome variable $y$. Some of these covariates are categorical with multiple levels. Others are continuous. How would you choose the "best" model? In other words, how do you choose which covariates to include in the model? Would you model $y$ with each of the covariates individually using simple logistic regression and choose the ones with a significant association?
