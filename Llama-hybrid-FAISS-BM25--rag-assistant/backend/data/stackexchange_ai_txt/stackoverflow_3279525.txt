You can cast the CLOB type to XMLTYPE (or consider using an XMLTYPE column on the table). When dealing with XMLTYPEs you can then run XPATHs e.g: SELECT extractvalue(xml_col, '/*/Body/*/name/@value') FROM TableA or extract for xml fragments. EDIT: changed the 'Car' to * in XPath, having re-read the question.
