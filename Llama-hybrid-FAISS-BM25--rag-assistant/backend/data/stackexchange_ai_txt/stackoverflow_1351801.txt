UITableView: user interaction with section's footer

For one of UITableView sections I have put a view with a UIDatePicker into it's footer (using tableview:viewForFooterInSection:). The problem is that UIDatePicker receives only single touch events (tapping) and doesn't receive scroll events, so I am unable to set appropriate time inside it. Instead of scrolling UIDatePicker's hours or minutes spinners, UITableView scrolls. How can I make UIDatePicker respond to user "drag" events and make it spin instead of scrolling UITableView?
