Switchpoint calculation in linear models with probabilistic programming

My question is motivated by the switchpoint in texting frequency example at the end of the first chapter of "Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers". In that example, the rate of texting is modeled as a poisson distribution where the rate parameter undergoes a sudden change at a point in time. I was wondering if it would be possible to extend this modeling to linear regression. I have data that I expect to have different slopes in two different regimes. The boundary between those regimes would be the "switchpoint." How would one go about calculating the location of the switchpoint and the slopes before and after it for linear regression using probabilistic programming? EDIT I wanted to note that ideally there would be no gap before and after the kink. So while the slope would be discontinuous at the switchpoint,the line itself would be connected at the kink.
