Java web installer - How'd they do that?

Does anyone know how Citrix gets this installer to push an EXE straight out from a web page, and install it into the start menu as if it were a regular downloaded installer? https://support.gotoassist.com/download/repDownload I'm stumped! Is this Java Web Start in action? If so how do they get it started without downloading a JNLP? (or do I have something installed on my computer previously that I'm not aware of that allows this?)
