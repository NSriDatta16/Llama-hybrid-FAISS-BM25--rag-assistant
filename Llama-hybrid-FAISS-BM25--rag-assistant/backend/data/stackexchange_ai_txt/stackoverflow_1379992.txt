Qt doesn't find QStackedWidgets' slot setCurrentWidget

I am writing a wizard-style application in Qt that uses a QStackedWidget to organize the individual pages of the wizard. Now I want to switch between the pages, which should be possible using the function setCurrentWidget(...) : I have a simple main class that instantiates a QWidget audioconfig . Then, it adds this QWidget to a QStackedWidget pageStack using pageStack.addWidget(&audioconfig); . Later, I want to connect a certain signal from a different QWidget hub to setCurrentWidget(...) of the QStackedWidget in order to switch the page. However, my compiler remarks that 0Object::connect: No such slot QStackedWidget::setCurrentWidget(audioconfig) in /Users/paperflyer/Development/App/main.cpp:41` There are two things I don't get here: there clearly is such a function. You can look it up in the class definition of QStackedWidget. What is going on here? Why is the first character of the compiler output a '0', while my source code clearly and correctly shows it as 'Q'? Here is the whole code: int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { QApplication app(argc,argv); QStackedWidget pageStack; CHub hub; // inherits from CWidget CAudioConfig audioconfig; // ditto pageStack.addWidget(&hub); pageStack.addWidget(&audioconfig); // connect() is a custom signal of hub QObject::connect(&hub, SIGNAL(configure()), &pageStack, SLOT(setCurrentWidget(&audioconfig))); pageStack.setGeometry(100,100,700,500); pageStack.show(); return app.exec(); } As always, thank you so much for your help!
