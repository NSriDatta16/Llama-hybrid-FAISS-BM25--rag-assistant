(1) Once control is transfered to safari, iPhone OS starts shutting your app down. Control will not transfer back to your app - the user will need to close safari and restart your application. The only way to display web content in an iPhone app without your app closing is by embedding the web browser inside your application. However, I expect your ad network insist that their adverts open in safari to ensure that the content isn't tampered with. (2) Likewise, there's no way to get back to your app once safari started loading. I suggest you focus on fixing whatever is wrong with the implementation of the ad code.
