Silverlight: Cannot use more than 1MB isolated storage when running out-of-browser

I'm reading everywhere the running a Silverlight app as out-of-browser allows you to use up to 25MB of isolated storage. I'm writing a 1.6MB file to IS, but get an error saying I've exceeded the storage capacity when it hits 1MB. Yes, I made sure the Out-Of-Browser option is checked on the project settings... What am I missing?
