The only random part here is the individual. Both Time and Treatment are fixed parts. As I understand it, you want global (ie. fixed) estimates of the effect of Time Each level of Treatment (except for the reference level) The interaction between each level of Treatment (except for the reference level) and Time. The following models will give you that. fm1 That being said, you can get a random effect of time, ie. a random slope model where the effect of time varies between the individuals. fm3 This is possible since there is within-subject variation with respect to time. However, since there is no within-subject variation with respect to treatment, you cannot do the same for treatment. Since there is no within-subject variation with respect to treatment, the effect of time in a random slope model is actually the deviance between the individual effect of the particular treatment that the indivdual received and the global estimate of Time, which would measure the average effect of the treatment that corresponds to the reference category of the variable Treatment. You can use anova() to compare the models and test whether or not it is justified to let the effect of time vary by subject: anova(fm1, fm3) anova(fm2, fm4) would do the testing you need.
