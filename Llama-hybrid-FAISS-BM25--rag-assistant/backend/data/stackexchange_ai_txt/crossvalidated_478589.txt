Binary Classification with almost no positives

I have a dataset with 121 features and 7176 data points. Only 11 of these are positive, the rest is negative. If I want to train a SVM on this data set, what would be the best strategy to do this? Does this even make sense? For now I decided to 5-fold cross validation with stratified sampling. Would this approach be reasonable?
