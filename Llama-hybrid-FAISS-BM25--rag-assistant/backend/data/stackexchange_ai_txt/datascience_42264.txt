In Reinforcement Learning can I randomly assign next_states from the state space to my agent while creating transition set?

In Reinforcement Learning, while creating transition samples (state, action, next_state, reward), where: Agent: The learning agent Environment: The trainer The environment gives two feedback to the agent: reward and next state. Can I as the environment, randomly assign next_states from the total state space to my agent. ? How can I decide what are the allowed next_state(s) from a given state?
