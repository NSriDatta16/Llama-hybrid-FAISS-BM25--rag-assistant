How do I interpret regression coefficients with PCA scores as dependent variable?

I am performing a PCA on four variables all measuring performance on a test in some way. Now I want to use the first principle component (test1_pca) as dependent variable in a linear regression, such that I can regress the newly found principle component scores on several continuous (e.g. age) and categorical (e.g. sex) variables without having to run four separate linear regressions with the four variables separately as dependent variables. In my opinion it makes sense to combine them into one score, since they all measure performance and that is how I would interpret the principle component accordingly. However, I am not sure how to interpret the regression coefficients that follow in terms of performance. To be more specific, all four original variables could be interpreted as: lower score means better performance. The variables were scaled (and centered) using prcomp(), which makes that I don't know what the resulting coefficients indicate of the regression. Usually, you would say something like "with every unit increase in X, Y increases ...", but how does that work with a PCA dependent variable? lm_mod |t|) (Intercept) 2.56987 1.17483 2.367 0.004378 ** Group2 -1.23648 0.57839 -3.893 0.000120 *** Age -0.32894 0.03478 -2.938 0.026473 * EdNo -0.23405 0.34589 -0.537 0.538949 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 with Ed as factor (yes/no), Age continuous, and Group factor (Group1/Group2) The PCA with loadings: pca_res EDIT: The PCA I am doing is only on continuous variables perf1, perf2, perf3, and perf4. In the regression, I use both categorical and continuous predictors and the PCA scores created with the perf (=performance) variables serve as the dependent variable, which is where I get stuck on the interpretation of the coefficients.
