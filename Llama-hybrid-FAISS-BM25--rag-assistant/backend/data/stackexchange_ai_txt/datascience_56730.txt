Handling unwanted negative numbers

With me is a dataset collected from IoT sensors with one column labeled “Soil Humidity” measured in percentage. It stands to reason then that all the values be positive percentages, however there’s a mix of negative percentage in there which is undesirable. Is there a way to handle unwanted negative numbers in pandas python before running it through a machine learning model.
