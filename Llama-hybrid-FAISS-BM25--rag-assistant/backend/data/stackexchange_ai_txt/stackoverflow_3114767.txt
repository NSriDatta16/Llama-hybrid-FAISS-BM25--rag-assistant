SQL INSERT: skip values allready present

I'm trying to add sequence of tags to a list subjects. I wouldn't make unique tag column field because I may have the same duplicate depending by the user language like in the example table_houses id name location 1 Victoria's Home New York 2 Black Mesa Lab New Mexico 3 Tube London table_tags id tag id_subjects language 1 garage 1 it 2 garage 2 fr 3 research 3 en 4 lab 3 en 5 laboratorio 3 it 6 garage 1 it I've saw some example where people uses INSERT IGNORE INTO statement but I've got It works only with unique columns and it is used to skip duplicate errors. Does exist some way to skip duplicate tags for the same language only?
