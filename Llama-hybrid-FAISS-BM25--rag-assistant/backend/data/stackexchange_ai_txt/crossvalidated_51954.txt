Chi-squared test for histogram data after doing an averaged shifted histogram

I have a data set of 903 continuous observations, that I graphically visualize with a histogram. The bin and width values could be optimized, but it is logical from the distribution that I have a Gaussian function. When I do the fitting, I use the frequency values of the data as the Y-values. For example, if the observations are ${(2,3,3,3,4,4,5)}$, and the user-defined bin width is 1.0, then the corresponding y-values would be $(1,3,3,3,2,2,1)$, assuming that the first bin limit will be assigned as the minimum value. I am not obtaining statistical significance with a Gaussian fitting, in terms of goodness of fit ($Q$) with the Chi-squared test ($\chi^2$). In other words, my null hypothesis is rejected making that a Gaussian model does not represent the experimental data. Now, I am doing the same test but using an averaged shifted histogram version of my x-values and the frequency for those averaged bins as the y-values for each observation, I now obtain good results in terms of goodness of fit. I need to clarify if it is valid to realize a Goodness of fit for an averaged shifted histogram, or if there is clear bias for data overfitting. Here it is a q-q plot of the data:
