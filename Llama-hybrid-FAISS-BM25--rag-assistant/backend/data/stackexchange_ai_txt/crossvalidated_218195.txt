Do neural networks use efficient coding?

My question concerns the relationship between the efficient coding hypothesis which is outlined on the Wikipedia page on efficient coding and neural network learning algorithms. What is the relationship between the efficient coding hypothesis and neural networks? Are there any neural network models explicitly inspired by the efficient coding hypothesis? Or would it be fairer to say that all neural network learning algorithms are at least implicitly based on efficient coding?
