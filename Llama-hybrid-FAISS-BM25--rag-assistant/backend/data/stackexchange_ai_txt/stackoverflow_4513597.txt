It looks like you're using require() calls not for dynamic functionality loading (get a class definition in), but as something like a function call. Don't. Avoid global variables like a plague. Side note: Instead of worrying about doing the require() calls in the right order to get your classes defined, I'd encourage you to look at Autoload functionality in PHP 5. It allows you to define which classes are defined in which file, and load those files on-demand when the classes are requested.
