Unfortunately, there is no "the" correct way to calculate the MAPE. Your approach uses rolling origins and then evaluates over the entire rest of the test sample, starting at horizon $h$. If this does not yield the same results as in the paper, try calculating the MAPE only at the correct horizon, by only storing a single forecast for the horizon $h$ for each origin, then averaging these single forecasts over the origins.
