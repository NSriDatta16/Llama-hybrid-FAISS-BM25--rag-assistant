iTunes Visualization -- What type of code is it written in and what does that code look like?

Being a web developer, I know how event driven user interfaces are written, but do not have insight into other families of code (embedded software like automotive software, automation software on assembly lines, drivers, or the crawling lower-thirds on CNN, etc.) I was looking at the iTunes visualizer ( example ) and am curious: What code is used to write the visualizer? Objective C? Does it use Core Animation? What type of abstraction does that library offer? What does the code look like? Is it a list of mathematical equations for producing the crazy graphics? Is it a list of key frames with tweening? Is there an array of images, fractals, worm holes, flowers, sparkles, and some magic mixing them together. Or something totally different? I am not looking for a tutorial, just an understanding of how something very different than web development works. Oh yah, I know iTunes is closed source, so all of this is conjecture.
