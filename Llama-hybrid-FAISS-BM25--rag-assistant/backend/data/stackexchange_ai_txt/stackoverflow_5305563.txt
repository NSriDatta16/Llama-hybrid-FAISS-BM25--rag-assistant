Custom Record View in Cocoa Application

I want to create a custom view in a Cocoa application. It's basically a record view, where the data from multiple database fields is displayed in a long list. Here's a quick mockup: Now there are several things to consider: The number and type of fields is dynamic Fields may be formatted differently (the short fields are in one line, the long fields are in a separate paragraph. In the future, images might be included as well.) The text is not editable, but it should be selectable so users can copy it I already have some experience in Cocoa, but I don't know how I should best create this basic layout. In iOS I would probably use a UITableView with custom cells, but NSTableView is very different and probably not suited for this application. Several ideas come to my mind: Just use a WebView and create the layout as HTML. I have a lot of experience with HTML, so layouting should be easy. On the other hand, this seems like a dirty hack. Use an NSAttributedString . Since this layout is mostly text, this should be possible. Then just put that into a read-only NSTextView . It might be hard to get the layout pixel-perfect. Create a lot of NSTextField s and NSBox es programmatically. Layouting will be complicated and involve a lot of mathematics (but I like maths, so that's okay) Make a custom view and do all drawing in drawRect: What is the best solution? I'm overwhelmed by the amount of choices that are available, and I can't see which solution is cleanest. Does anybody have experience with creating dynamic data views?
