How to constrain a neural network to be commutative in its inputs?

What is the most general way to constrain a neural network to be commutative with respect to its inputs? The learned network function: f(.,.) Commutative: f(a,b) = f(b,a) "most general": can represent the widest class of commutative functions I'm not sure how to make that totally precise, but maybe something theoretical can be constructed out of some composition of universal approximators and some fixed commutative function...
