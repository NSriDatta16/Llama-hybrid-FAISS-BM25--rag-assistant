Order of XML attributes after DOM processing

When processing XML by means of standard DOM, attribute order is not guaranteed after you serialize back. At last that is what I just realized when using standard java XML Transform API to serialize the output. However I do need to keep an order. I would like to know if there is any posibility on Java to keep the original order of attributes of an XML file processed by means of DOM API, or any way to force the order (maybe by using an alternative serialization API that lets you set this kind of property). In my case processing reduces to alter the value of some attributes (not all) of a sequence of the same elements with a bunch of attributes, and maybe insert a few more elements. Is there any "easy" way or do I have to define my own XSLT transformation stylesheet to specify the output and altering the whole input XML file? Update I must thank all your answers. The answer seems now more obvious than I expected. I never paid any attention to attribute order, since I had never needed it before. The main reason to require an attribute order is that the resulting XML file just looks different. The target is a configuration file that holds hundreds of alarms (every alarm is defined by a set of attributes). This file usually has little modifications over time, but it is convenient to keep it ordered, since when we need to modify something it is edited by hand. Now and then some projects need light modifications of this file, such as setting one of the attributes to a customer specific code. I just developed a little application to merge original file (common to all projects) with specific parts of each project (modify the value of some attributes), so project-specific file gets the updates of the base one (new alarm definitions or some attribute values bugfixes). My main motivation to require ordered attributes is to be able to check the output of the application againts the original file by means of a text comparation tool (such as Winmerge). If the format (mainly attribute order) remains the same, the differences can be easily spotted. I really thought this was possible, since XML handling programs, such as XML Spy, lets you edit XML files and apply some ordering (grid mode). Maybe my only choice is to use one of these programs to manually modify the output file.
