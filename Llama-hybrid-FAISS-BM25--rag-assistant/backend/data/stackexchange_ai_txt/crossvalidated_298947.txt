Depending on the notation, $\tau$ either means the length of a particular episode (and so changes between episodes). It would also be valid to have $\tau $ denote the longest possible episode, although I have not seen it used in that way. Sometimes, $\tau$ can be used as a hard limit on the maximum number of timesteps in an episode. For example, when playing Atari games, it is a common practice to truncate the maximum play time to say 5 minutes, in order to encourage more exploration of the state space. You are correct that if $\tau$ was used as a cap on the number of time steps then time would have to be incorporated into the state in order for the MDP assumption to hold. However, in the case of the Atari games and artificial termination, I have not seen the time as part of the state. That is probably because it's such a small violation of the MDP conditions that not much of value is lost.
