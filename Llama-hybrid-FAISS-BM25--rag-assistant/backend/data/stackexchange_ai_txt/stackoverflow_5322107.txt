With a string you can remove last character with: msg = msg[:-2] You could also remove all whitespace from the end of the string (including newlines) with: msg = msg.rstrip() OK. After reading your comment, I think you should check this page: The Tkinter Text Widget where it is explained: "If you insert or delete text before a mark, the mark is moved along with the other text. To remove a mark, you must use the *mark_unset* method. Deleting text around a mark doesnâ€™t remove the mark itself." ----EDIT---- My mistake, disregard the above paragraph. Marks have nothing to do with the newline. As Bryan explains in his answer: The tkinter text widget guarantees that there is always a newline following the last character in the widget.
