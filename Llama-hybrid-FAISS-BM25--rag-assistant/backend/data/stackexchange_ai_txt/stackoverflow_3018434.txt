embedding multiple lua instances in a multiple threaded program

I have a program with 4 threads. Within each thread, I do a luaL_newstate(); Each thread only has access to it's own lua instance. Is there anything I need to worry about? [I.e. is there some hidden state that all lua instances share behind my back?] Thanks!
