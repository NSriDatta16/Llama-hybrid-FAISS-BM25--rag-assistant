Which clustering techniques can be used with Dynamic Time Warping (other than Hierarchical clustering)?

I have time series of cars' speed (speed observed over time for 50 different drivers driving the same car). I want to find the groups of "similar" driving styles based on these speeds. Therefore, I first apply DTW to compute a dissimilarity matrix between each pair of car speeds. And then use Hierarchical clustering using this matrix. My question is: Are there any other clustering algorithms that I could use for this purpose? I have studied different algos. that were mentioned here , but the examples I find use non-time series data. Please direct me to any relevant resource. You can see some sample data in this stackoverflow question . I use R.
