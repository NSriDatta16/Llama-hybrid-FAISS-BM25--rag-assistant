My only comment would be to put the persistence and Hibernate classes into a separate module; so that the model module can be purely beans/POJO/your domain classes. Here's how I've organized a few multi-module projects before project-data - contains domain classes and DAOs (interfaces only) project-services - "Business logic" layer services, makes use of DAO interfaces. Depends on project-data . project-hibernate - Hibernate implementation of DAO interfaces. Depends on project-data . Conceivably if I were to use some other sort of data-access method I would just create a separate module for that. Client apps could then choose which modules to be dependent on.
