If your map really is as simple as the example you linked to, I would highly recommend avoiding the use of java (or javaFX altogether). You can do what you want with any of the javascript DHTML mapping apis. See Google Maps API OpenLayers Java is overkill. Applets are slow to load and difficult to properly deploy under a varied number of environments. Better to publish a KML file (or something equivalent) and leverage someone else's maps than to write and maintain an entire application yourself.
