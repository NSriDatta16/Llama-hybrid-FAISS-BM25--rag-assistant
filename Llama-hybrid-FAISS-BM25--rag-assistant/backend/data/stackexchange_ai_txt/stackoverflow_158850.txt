I think that some of that is just the way that the framework handles Office applications, but I could be wrong. On some days, some applications clean up the processes immediately, and other days it seems to wait until the application closes. In general, I quit paying attention to the details and just make sure that there aren't any extra processes floating around at the end of the day. Also, and maybe I'm over simplifying things, but I think you can just... objExcel = new Excel.Application(); objBook = (Excel.Workbook)(objExcel.Workbooks.Add(Type.Missing)); DoSomeStuff(objBook); SaveTheBook(objBook); objBook.Close(false, Type.Missing, Type.Missing); objExcel.Quit(); Like I said earlier, I don't tend to pay attention to the details of when the Excel process appears or disappears, but that usually works for me. I also don't like to keep Excel processes around for anything other than the minimal amount of time, but I'm probably just being paranoid on that.
