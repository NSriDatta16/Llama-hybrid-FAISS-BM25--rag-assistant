A comparison of artificial neural network and time series models for forecasting commodity prices compares the performance of ANN and ARIMA in predicting financial time series. I think it is a good starting point for your literature review. In many cases, neural networks tend to outperform AR-based models. However, I think that one major drawback (which is not discussed that much in the academic litterature) with more advanced machine learning methods is that they use black boxes. This is a big problem if you had to explain how the model works to someone who doesn't know that much of these models (for example in a corporation). But if you are doing this analysis just as a school work, I don't think this is going to be an issue. But like the previous commentator said usually the best way is to form an ensemble estimator in which you combine two or more models.
