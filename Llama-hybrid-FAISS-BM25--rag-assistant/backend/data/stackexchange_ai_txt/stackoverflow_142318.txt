Add a column containing a calculated random value to each row, and use that in the ordering clause, limiting to one result upon selection. This works out faster than having the table scan that ORDER BY RANDOM() causes. Update: You still need to calculate some random value prior to issuing the SELECT statement upon retrieval, of course, e.g. SELECT * FROM `foo` WHERE `foo_rand` >= {some random value} LIMIT 1
