Vista, inifiles, and run at startup oddities... what the heck

I've got something happening with a little app that I made that I don't understand what the problem is. The app is just a little texted panel clock that sits above the taskbar on the second monitor. Settings are saved via inifile in the proper appdata folder, and the specs are saved properly, i.e. X and Y location, font, font style, etc. I wanted it to run automatically when Windows boots up, so yesterday I just dragged a shortcut to the Start | Programs | Startup folder. This morning when booting up, for a moment, it loaded in the proper location, then quickly moved itself back to 0 by 0 on the X-Y plane. I looked at the inifile, and sure enough... it's Top=1133 Left=1920, just like it is supposed to be, yet windows starts it at Top=0 Left=0. What the heck?...
