Forecasting a time series with conditional variance (heteroscedasticity) using Arima

I want to forecast a time series and have reason to believe that there are heteroscedastic errors/variance, which could be modelled with GARCH. However, I am not really interested in modelling/forecasting the variance. I only want point forecasts. Does it make any sense for me to use GARCH (e.g. as an ARIMA-GARCH hybrid)? Does GARCH have any effect on the point forecasts for my time series? Or can I still use ARIMA or another common forecasting technique (without GARCH), even though there are heteroscedastic errors?
