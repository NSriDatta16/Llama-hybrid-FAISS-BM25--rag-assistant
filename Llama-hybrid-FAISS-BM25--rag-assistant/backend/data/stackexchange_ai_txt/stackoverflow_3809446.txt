This message may be too old to be useful. I was hacking around with an old Nyko 3rd party Guitar Hero / Rock Band PS3 controller on a laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 (2.6.32-25) and I discovered that the hardware was not recognized immediately by the USB HID module. It reports an error of: "can't set config #1, error -32". I began writing a small test application with libusb-1.0 and was able to apply a configuration directly. Upon doing so, I unintentionally triggered the USB HID module taking over the device and making it available as an input device through a /dev/input/js* interface.
