If 2 knife types have the exact same mean, but very different variances then you would still have information useful to classification, if you are seeing a cut that lies far from the mean relative to the small variance, but reasonble from the large variance then it seems much more likely to have come from the knife with the larger variance. So focusing on differences is means when there are other differences is probably not the best approach. You should look into classification analysis, possibly K nearest neighbors methods, or a Bayesian approach (using either the distribution that you believe fits the data, or a smoothed approximation like a logspline estimate).
