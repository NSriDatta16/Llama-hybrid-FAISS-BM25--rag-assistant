As mentioned previously, storing large files in Sharepoint is generally a bad idea. See this article for more information: http://blogs.msdn.com/joelo/archive/2007/11/08/what-not-to-store-in-sharepoint.aspx With that said, it is possible to use external storage for BLOBs, which may or may not help your performance issues -- Microsoft released a half-complete external BLOB storage provider that does the trick, but it unfortunately works at the farm level and affects all uploads. Ick. Fortunately, since you can implement your own external BLOB provider, you may be able to write something to better handle these specific files. See this article for details: http://207.46.16.252/en-us/magazine/2009.06.insidesharepoint.aspx Whether or not this would be worth the overhead depends on how much of a problem you're having. :)
