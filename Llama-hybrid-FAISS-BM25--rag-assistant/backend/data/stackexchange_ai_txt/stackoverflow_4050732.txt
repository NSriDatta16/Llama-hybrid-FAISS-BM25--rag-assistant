If it's a fixed format, why don't you take advantage of the positional information? for example, you know always that the year is the first four characters, so: const char* date = "2010-10-28T16:23:31.428226"; int year = (((date[0] ^ 0x30)) * 1000) + ((date[1] ^ 0x30) * 100) + ((date[2] ^ 0x30) * 10) + (date[3] ^ 0x30); int month = ((date[5] ^ 0x30) * 10) + (date[6] ^ 0x30); int day = ((date[8] ^ 0x30) * 10) + (date[9] ^ 0x30); etc. the microsecond segment is a little trickier, depending on whether it's 0 padded or not... but you know the format, so I should assume it's trivial... significantly faster than any library routine, of course it's very fragile, but if you can control input, why not?
