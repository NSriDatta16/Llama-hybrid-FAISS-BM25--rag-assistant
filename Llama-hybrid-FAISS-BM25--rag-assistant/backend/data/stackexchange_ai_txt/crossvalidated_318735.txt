Exponential smoothing models are in general a subset of ARIMA models . When I say ARIMA models I am including the possibility of including trends, level shifts ,seasonal pulses and pulses in the equation. This is also known as a subset of ARMAX models. ARIMA models are more general thus requiring some logic in forming a final useful model. Demand planning software is deficient in this regard even from the so-called leaders. In terms of why one would go with es over ARIMA it is quicker being more presumptive). Additionally poor ARIMA model identification sftware assuming no anomalies often leads to inadequate forecasts. If you want to conduct a mini-experiment of es models and ARIMA models for a few time series , I would be glad to help but offline as this kind of task is beyond SE's mission.
