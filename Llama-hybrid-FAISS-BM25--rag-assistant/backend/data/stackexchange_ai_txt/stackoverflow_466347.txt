Sparse matricies are common in linear algebra, numerical methods, and modeling of physics problems. If a matrix is diagonal, it's easy to represent it using a single vector. A bandwidth approach might require storing both row and column indicies for a non-zero element. Googling for "sparse matrix storage" brought back lots of hits, including this . Maybe it can stimulate some ideas.
