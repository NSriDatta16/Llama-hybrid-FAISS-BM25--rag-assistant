Disadvantages of MySQL versus other databases

Every single book that teaches programming (or almost anything else) starts off with a whole bunch of spiel on why what it's about (C++, MySQL, waterskiing, skydiving, dentistry, whatever) is the greatest thing in the world. So I open the MySQL O'Reilly book, and read the intro, and get the traditional sermon. The main points that the book mentioned were: MySQL has been shown to have tied Oracle as the fastest and most scalable database software. It's free and open source. Sounds pretty convincing, but I know there's always at least two sides of every story. I knew I needed to be disillusioned when I saw someone suggest to someone to use Oracle instead of MySQL and thought, "Why in the world would you want to do that?!", just because of the few paragraphs I'd read, with no other justification. So lets investigate the other side of the story: What are some reasons NOT to use MySQL?
