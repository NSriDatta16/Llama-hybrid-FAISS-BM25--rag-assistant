Bayesian VAR: Derivation of predictive distribution for reduced form VAR

I have a standard reduced form VAR of type without intercept: $y_t = A_{1}y_{t−1} + \ldots + A_py_{t−p} + e_t$ , $e_t \sim N(0,Σ)$ . I need to derive the predictive posterior distribution $p(y_{T+h}|y_{T} , \ldots, y_1)$ in the general case for $h=1,2,3,\ldots$ and define its moments. I already exhausted many textbooks and couldn't find a solution. If anyone has an idea how to solve this problem, it would be really helpful!
