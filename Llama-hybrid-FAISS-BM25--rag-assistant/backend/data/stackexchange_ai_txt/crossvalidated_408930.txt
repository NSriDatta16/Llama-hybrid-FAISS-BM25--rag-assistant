How to calculate intra-observer error and average difference?

I am trying to assess intra-observer error in a setting where measurements where done repeatedly by a single observer. So far I'm having some conceptual and technical issues. In the dataset we have measurements of 24 variables from 40 samples done four times in different days by one researcher. The aim is to assess the reliability of the measurements of each variable. The error here is dependent on the tools used for measurements. I am quite unsure how to approach this issue. Can intraclass correlation be used for this estimation in the case of a single observer? I would appreciate any help getting me into right direction.
