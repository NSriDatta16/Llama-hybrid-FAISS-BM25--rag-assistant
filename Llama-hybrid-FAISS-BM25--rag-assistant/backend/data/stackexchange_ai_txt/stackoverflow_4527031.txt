Forking a new project out of my existing source code should not be allowed Above is in conflict with Open Source idea (which allows/encourages forking). More info here: Which open source license has no forking If you think that you can drop that requirement the best choice is LGPL and additional requirement that people must give you credit (you will have to define what type of attribution/credit do you want per different uses) As James stated in previous comment: Forks very rarely happen It is very hard to fork a (big) project You can benefit more if there are forks - you can take the good ideas from the fork and leave the bad. That way the better judgement about features/code will eventually win (which is part of the idea of Open Source)
