Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Generated Data For Better Classifier

I am doing some classification work on a set of relatively small dataset, and the model starts to overfit quickly, but there is no way I can get extra data. Can I use a generative adversarial network (GAN) or other generative model to generate data that looks like my dataset but has more diversity or noise, in order to reduce the overfitting of my classifier? Is there any paper on the application of GAN in this subject?
