initWithArray seems to give a reference to source array rather then a new array

In my code I use initWithArray like so : vendorArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithArray:resultsCore.availableVendors]; But changes I make to the vendorArray also seem to be made to restultsCore.availableVendors. This was not what I had desired. I want populate vendorArray with restultsCore.availableVendors but then leave it untouched by the changes I make to vendorArray. Is there away to get this functionality without using an for and if statements to copy the data object by object into vendorArray from restultsCore.availableVendors ? Many Thanks -Code EDIT Below is my edit. Vendors is an object i made @interface Vendor : NSObject { NSString *vendorID; NSMutableArray *availableCars; BOOL atAirport; } @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *vendorID; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *availableCars; @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL atAirport; - (id)initFromVehVendorAvailsDictionary:(NSDictionary *)vehVendorAvails; @end As you can see it has an array. This array is another object I made called Car. @interface Car : NSObject { NSMutableArray *vehicleCharges; // These are extras like breakdown assist etc NSString *rateQualifier; BOOL needCCInfo; NSMutableArray *fees; // This array contains 3 dictionarys NSMutableArray *pricedCoverages; } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *vehicleCharges; @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *rateQualifier; @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL needCCInfo; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *fees; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *pricedCoverages; - (id) initFromVehicleDictionary:(NSDictionary *)vehicleDictionary; @end Car also has 3 arrays of my other objects. Its all very object oriented -.- I've been reading up on NSCopying and saw a tutorial. But I still feel really lost as what to do here. Do I need to implement the NSCopying protocol for my Vendors class, Car class and the other 3 classes that are contained in the arrays by car. Vendors is the object contained in the array i want to copy. So is this the only class i need to implement the NSCopying tutorial for? Many thanks, sorry for the long question -Code
