I would use a drag-and-drop approach, allowing the user flexibility in positioning. This is possible even using a web-application. See, for example, Dropthings ( http://www.dropthings.com/ ). This provides all the code you'd need to implement drag-n-drop in an ASP.NET environment. What environment are you using?
