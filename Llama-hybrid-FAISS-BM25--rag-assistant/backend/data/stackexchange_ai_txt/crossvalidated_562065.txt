Good libraries for exponential time series smoothing

I've a pandas series which contains the daily load consumption of a city for a year. I wish to forecast the load consumption for next year.As a result , I'm making use of exponential time series. The problem is apart from statsmodels' SimpleExpSmoothing , ExponentialSmoothing and Holt I couldn't find any other library which does this. I work in Google Colab which uses Python 3.7 and the only version of Statsmodel which is compatible with Python 3.7 is 0.10.2 which has a lot of issues. As a result , I'd like to know if there any other libraries which accomplish this task. (I'm too lazy to code this from scratch).
