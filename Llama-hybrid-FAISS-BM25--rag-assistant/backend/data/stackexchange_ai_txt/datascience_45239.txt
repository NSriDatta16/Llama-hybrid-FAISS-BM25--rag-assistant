Here I have a data file and I designed neural network to predict value. I have a three inputs. These three inputs affect to predict value bysubtarcting and adding. If my three inputs are x1,x2,x3 . X1 and X2 add together and that value will subtract with the X3 value and give the predict value. This process will happened in x_train. I wrote a code. But it gives me this error. Can nyone help me to solve this problem? My code is, data = pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['X1','X2','X3']) data = data.values a = [] for i in range(0,len(data)): X1 = data[i][0] a.append([X1]) b = [] for i in range(0,len(data)): X2 = data[i][1] b.append([X2]) c = [] for i in range(0,len(data)): X3 = data[i][2] c.append([X3]) x_train =[] x =[] for i in range(0,len(data)): x_train.append([a[i] ,b[i], c[i]]) x.append((a[i] - b[i] + c[i])) x_train =np.array(x_train) x = np_array(x)
