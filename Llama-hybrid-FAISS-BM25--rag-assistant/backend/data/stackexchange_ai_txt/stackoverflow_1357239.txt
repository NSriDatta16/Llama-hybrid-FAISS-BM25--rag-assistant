I would focus on your current problems versus picking a whole new process. If your primary issues involve working tracking, install a time tracking system. It will show where developers are spending time and in turn it may also show profit/loss per project. In general, evolve your process slowly, but continuously. Monitor your problems and the actual costs of some of these problems to encourage yourself to only fix the problems that cost money or morale, not just the problems that are annoying to the bosses. A tip: implementing any type of metrics in a business can be difficult. Make sure it doesn't come with too big of a stick and set it up in such a way that developers and sales reps are not encouraged to game the data in the same direction. Depending on your business model and each one of their deals, SRs may be prone to push up or push down the number of hours. For developers, their bias will tend to be to show they are busier than they are until somebody points out that they seem less skilled or efficient as their peers. An added tip: If the metrics aren't going to be used to change people, collect them blindly (so the participants won't know). You will likely get the most accurate information.
