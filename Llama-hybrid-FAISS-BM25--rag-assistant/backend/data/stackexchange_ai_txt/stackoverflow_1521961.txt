Drupal6: Embedding a region in a view .tpl.php file

Anyone have any ideas on how I might embed a region into a view .tpl.php file? I accomplish it easily enough in a node .tpl.php by adding something like this to theme_preproces_node() : $vars['promos'] = theme('blocks', 'promos'); No problem at all. However, there obviously isn't a theme_preprocess_view() function, and I get memory errors when I try to add the same snippet to theme_preprocess() . Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 104857600 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 523800 bytes) in /Users/cpharmston/Sites/Projects/Threespot/neh01/includes/database.mysqli.inc on line 42 I'm stumped. Any ideas? Thanks!
