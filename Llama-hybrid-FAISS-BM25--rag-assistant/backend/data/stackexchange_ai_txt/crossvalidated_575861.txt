When we use k-means clustering with Light GBM, comparing with Random Forest

I am developping the prediction model with many parameters. As I was not satisfied by the performance of Random Forest Regression, I tried to use k-means clustering to regroup the similar variable and applied LIGHT GBM to each cluster. It improved 16% in terms of RMSE and I was happy. However, I cannot understand how it can improve the perforamnce because the basic idea of random forest is very similar to k-means clustering. We make a branch considering the relation between variables when we use tree algorithm. K-means make a cluster in terms of distance between each variable. So, probably Random Forest did the similar thing with K-means. Can you explain how can k-means-lightGBM improve the performance comparing with RF ?
