mogilefs/php question

Hey Guys, u I am using mogilefs to store files on a storage cluster. And i want to offer a download link to users. Only when i run getPaths on mogileFS it returns something like: http://10.0.0.23:7500/dev11/0/422/711/0494715033.fid i can rename the .fid to the actual file extension, but how do i offer the original file for download to the user? Can i force the file somehow with php? (Without using readfile or anything, the files are there for bandwidth reasons). thnx guys
