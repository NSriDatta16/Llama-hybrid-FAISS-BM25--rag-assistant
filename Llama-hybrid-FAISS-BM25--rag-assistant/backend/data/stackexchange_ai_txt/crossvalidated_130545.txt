Dummy for multivariate time series regression (intercept and slope effect)

I am trying to understand if it is possible to use dummy observations in time series analysis, to split the effect of two or more groups in the model. Assume that we have n observations for 4 variables and there are two groups A and B. In the first group there are the first two variables and in B the last two. Is there any way possibile to create a dataset that consider the slope and intercept effect of the two groups? Thank you.
