How to spot and remove unimportant columns in a dataframe?

I have a pandas dataframe with several columns, for example let's say: A B C D(labels) 45 88 44 0 62 34 2 1 85 65 11 1 74 43 42 1 90 38 34 0 ... 0 94 45 1 58 23 23 0 How can I detect which columns are useless and which columns are useful to a machine learning model?. I all ready tried several methods like PCA, removing features with low variance, univariate feature selection with a chi criteria, etc. However none of them seems to work since the performance of my classifier still is low. I also tried to create more features (add more columns to the feature matrix) and they decreased the performance of my classifier, thus is there anyway to spot which columns are useless?.
