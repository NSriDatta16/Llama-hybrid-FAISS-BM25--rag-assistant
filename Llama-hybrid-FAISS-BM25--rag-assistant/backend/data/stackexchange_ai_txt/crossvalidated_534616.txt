It is important to distinguish the distribution part and the model part (also called structural part or something). The distribution part . Consider a distribution of the form you presented. Note that not every exponential family distribution is of this form, but this form defines a proper sub-family of the exponential family. For any exp. fam. distribution the following relation holds: $E[s(y)]=b'(\theta)$ , where $s(\cdot)$ is the sufficient statistic, $E$ denotes expectation, $b(\cdot)$ is the log-partition function, and $\theta$ is the natural/canonical parameter. For our distribution, we have $s(y)=y$ , and although $\theta$ and $c(\theta)$ are not exactly the natural parameter and the partition function (but their scaled versions), we still have $E[y]=b'(\theta)$ . This establishes the relation $E_\theta[y]=g^{-1}(\theta)$ , where we have introduced an invertible function $g$ . We don't give function $g$ any name at this point, we only note that it is determined by the distribution we chose. The model part . Now we want to build a regression or classification model, in which we want to predict outputs $y(\boldsymbol{x})$ based on inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$ . We decide that $y(\boldsymbol{x})$ is distributed with the pdf $f_\theta(y)$ , which implicitly depends on $x$ . We decide that this dependence should be such that $\mu(\boldsymbol{x}):=E[y(\boldsymbol{x})]=h(\boldsymbol{\beta}^T \boldsymbol{x})$ , where $h$ is an invertible function of our choice and is called mean function ; and its inverse $h^{-1}(\cdot)$ is called link function . To make the implicit dependence of $f_\theta(y)$ on $x$ explicit, we write $\theta(\boldsymbol{x}) = g(\mu(\boldsymbol{x})) = g(h(\boldsymbol{\beta}^T \boldsymbol{x}))$ . The pointwise dependence of $\theta$ on $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the simplest when $g\equiv h^{-1}$ . To highlight this exceptional property, we call $h^{-1}$ the canonical link function (as opposed to just a link function ). Oh! But then $g$ , which is the same function, can also be called the canonical link function . Update . The above should remove the confusion you express in But just why the canonical link is connected to $b$ through the inverse of the first derivative of $b$ is unclear. Why not $g=b^{-1}$ ? As to the word canonical , I think, it is not related to the "canonical form" or the "canonical parameter"; it is just the same word used in a different situation and in a different sense. You can replace the term "canonical link" with "organic link function". And among possible choices of the link function there will the "organic link function", which is organic to a given distribution, because it makes $\theta$ of this distribution equal $\boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{x}$ .
