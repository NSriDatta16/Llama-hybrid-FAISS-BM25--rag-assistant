The alternative to reversible jump is to go for the respective posterior probabilities of the different models, $$\mathbb P(\mathfrak M_k|\mathbf x)\propto \pi(\mathfrak M_k) \underbrace{\int_{\Theta_k} \pi_k(\theta_k)f_k(\mathbf x|\theta_k)\,\text d\theta_k}_\text{$\mathfrak e_k$: evidence on $\mathfrak M_k$}$$ which can be approximated from simulations of $\pi_k(\theta_k|\mathbf x)$ . Hence a marginal MCMC scheme could proceed by exploring the set of models (or model indices) as follows: At iteration $t$ , with current model index $k^{(t)}$ make a proposal $k^\prime\sim q(\cdot|k^{(t)})$ compute an unbiased estimator $\hat{\mathfrak e}_{k^\prime}$ , e.g. by running some MCMC simulations targetting $\pi_{k^\prime}(\cdot|\mathbf x)$ accept the move with probability $$\dfrac{\pi(\mathfrak M_{k^\prime})\hat{\mathfrak e}_{k^\prime}}{\pi(\mathfrak M_{k^{(t)}})\hat{\mathfrak e}_{k^{(t)}}}\,\dfrac{q(k^{(t)}|k^\prime)}{q(k^\prime|k^{(t)})}$$ In general, it is not possible to use solely simulations from the encompassing (or largest) model, since the posterior measures on the $\theta_k$ 's are supported by sets of measure zero wrt the encompassing measure. This is why, even if model $\mathfrak M_k$ corresponds to a subset of $(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{k_\text{max}}$ it must be treated as a completely different object, with a separate prior density.
