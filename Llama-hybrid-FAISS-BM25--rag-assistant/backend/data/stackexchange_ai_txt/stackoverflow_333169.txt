"out of memory" exception in CRecordset when selecting a LONGTEXT column from MySQL

I am using CODBCRecordset (a class found on CodeProject) to find a single record in a table with 39 columns. If no record is found then the call to CRecordset::Open is fine. If a record matches the conditions then I get an Out of Memory exception when CRecordset::Open is called. I am selecting all the columns in the query (if I change the query to select only one of the columns with the same where clause then no exception). I assume this is because of some limitation in CRecordset, but I can't find anything telling me of any limitations. The table only has 39 columns. Has anyone run into this problem? And if so, do you have a work around / solution? This is a MFC project using Visual Studio 6.0 if it makes any difference. Here's the query (formatted here so wold show up without a scrollbar): SELECT `id`, `member_id`, `member_id_last_four`, `card_number`, `first_name`, `mi`, `last_name`, `participant_title_id`, `category_id`, `gender`, `date_of_birth`, `address_line_1`, `address_line_2`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `phone`, `work_phone`, `mobile_phone`, `fax`, `email`, `emergency_name`, `emergency_phone`, `job_title`, `mail_code`, `comments`, `contract_unit`, `contract_length`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `head_of_household`, `parent_id`, `added_by`, `im_active`, `ct_active`, `organization`, `allow_members`, `organization_category_id`, `modified_date` FROM `participants` WHERE `member_id` = '27F7D0982978B470C5CF94B1B833CC93F997EE23' Copying and pasting into my query browser gives me only one result. More info: Commented out each column in the select statement except for id. Ran the query and no exception. Then I systematically went through and uncommented each column, one at a time, and re-ran query in between each uncomment. When I uncomment the comment column then I get the error. This is defined as the following (Using MySQL): LONGTEXT
