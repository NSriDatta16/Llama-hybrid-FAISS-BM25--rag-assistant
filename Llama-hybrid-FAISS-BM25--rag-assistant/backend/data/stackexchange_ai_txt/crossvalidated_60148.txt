Good question. I suggest you take a look at the recent thesis of Shahab Jolani. He discusses various ways to combine the response model and the substantive model. See http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2012-1120-200602/Jolani.pdf In general, the results are good (i.e. unbiased, appropriate coverage), and do not critically depend on the form of the parametrization chosen (chapter 2). Also, it is possible to put incomplete Y into the nonresponse model, thus opening up a way to deal with MNAR data by a MICE-like algorithm (chapter 4).
