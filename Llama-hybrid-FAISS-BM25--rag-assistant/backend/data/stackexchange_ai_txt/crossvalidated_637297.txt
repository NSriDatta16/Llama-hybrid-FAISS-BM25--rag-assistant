Most software packages have a day-based differencing function for which you get the exact number of days between the start of study at each site, and specific date of sample capture. Thus, that will give you the numdays for each measurement. Now, with regard to using the first day of the month, you should drop that idea. Rather, use a plot that has nettle relative cover vs. day of measurement (over the entire x-axis). Many failure time studies drop any notion of displaying calendar date on the x-axis and instead just use #days since start of study that each measurement was made on. Something you never mentioned was whether you were concerned about some months having 28, 30, 31 days? That concern shouldn't matter either, since e.g. Excel will make such a plot with calendar date on the x-axis and your nettle coverage on the y-axis. However, you have multiple collections sites, so simply tell the sites to report, for each sample, the number of days since a global study start date for each measurement, and then just plot the nettle values (or means) per #days since global date representing start of study.
