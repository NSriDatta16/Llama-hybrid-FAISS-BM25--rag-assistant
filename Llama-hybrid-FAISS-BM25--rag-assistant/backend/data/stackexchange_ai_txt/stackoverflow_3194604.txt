There is really no way of ensuring that every implementation of IStore raises an event. You could have an abstract class that has the put method, but that still doesn't mean that you could have a put method in a subclass of the abstract class that totally ignores the abstract class's method. In the end, the best way to encourage the raising of the event is to write the method the developer should use, by way of an abstract class. That way, they have to go out of their way not to use it
