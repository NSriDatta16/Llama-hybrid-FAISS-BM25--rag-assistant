dojo and the offline application cache

We've been working on an offline capable JavaScript applicaion using Dojo and the storage and offline capabilities available in newer browsers. The application is quite large, but it seems to load the larger files from the cache, and I can see that the application is in deed cached. Were using the applicationcache features, and there are no errors in the application cache as far as I and Chrome can see. However we run into problems. Apparently Dojo cannot load its lanugage resources, nor the SMD file that describes the service we connect to. These problems are highly visible on webkit-mobile, which is the targeted browser. Any ideas to what might be wrong?
