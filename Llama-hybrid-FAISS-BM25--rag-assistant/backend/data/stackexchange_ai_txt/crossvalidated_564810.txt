Negative Feature Importance on Linear Regression

Using the statsmodels OLS and checking the coefficients of the independent variables, some had negative coefficients. How to interpret them exactly? Context: In a dataset with ecommerce transactional data, I used the revenue from the datapoint period, the average amount sold by the datapoint store and the average revenue from the datapoint store. The datapoint store's average revenue coefficient was negative. What does it mean ? edit: The values of x and y are in natural logarithm in the model.
