For each platform (Version of the JDK, etc) in netbeans, you can specify the location of the JavaDocs Select the Tools-> Java Platforms menu Select the Platform you're interested in In the Javadoc tab, add the zip file or folder with the javadoc files. The files you want should be in /enterprise6/docs/javaee6-doc-api.zip . However, if you install the EJB and EAR plugins in the Netbeans Platform these should be setup automatically so perhaps a fresh install is required. (Note: I just added them to my Netbeans install on Karmic and the docs worked.)
