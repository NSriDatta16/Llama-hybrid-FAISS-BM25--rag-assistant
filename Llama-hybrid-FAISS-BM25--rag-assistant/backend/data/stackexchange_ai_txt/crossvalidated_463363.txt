Here is the contingency table: sentiment region 1 2 3 Africa 6 27 297 Americas 356 809 3353 Asia 3 171 345 Europe 147 479 2518 Oceania 60 372 1063 and here with row percentages: sentiment region 1 2 3 Africa 2 8 90 Americas 8 18 74 Asia 1 33 66 Europe 5 15 80 Oceania 4 25 71 and given the large sample, it is quite clear that the profile of sentiment is unequal among regions. We can get a likelihood ratio test via ordinal logistic regression in R: mod.polr
