doc2vec - How does the inference step work in PV-DBOW

I am quite confused about how we generate new paragraph vectors in PV-DBOW? If I want to use the embeddings to classify some text how would I generate a vector for a new paragraph? In the original paper the authors wrote: At prediction time, one needs to perform an inference step to compute the paragraph vector for a new paragraph. This is also obtained by gradient descent. It is unclear to me how they would compute the paragraph vector for a new paragraph using gradient descent.
