If you want the order to be consistent, I would do something to force a particular order. Although you might be able to convince yourself that the order is guaranteed, and you might be right, it seems fragile to me, and it will be mysterious to other developers. For example, you emphasize always in your question. Is it important that it be the same order in Python 2.5 and 2.6? 2.6 and 3.1? CPython and Jython? I wouldn't count on those.
