What are the default values for frequency feature of a datapoint not found in training

Given a dataset, I would like to use the frequency count of each element in a column. But if the testing data has a data point that is not found in training, how do I go about? For example consider the column in the training data that has values 1,2,3,5,1,3 If there is a data point 4 in the testing data which is not found in the training data, what is the recommended approach? Some of the proposed techniques are: 1) If the column is numeric, then we can compute the average of the closest numbers. In the case of 4, the frequency is 1.5 . 2) default the frequency of all unknown values to 1. What are the common techniques to apply to both numeric and non numeric values in this case?
