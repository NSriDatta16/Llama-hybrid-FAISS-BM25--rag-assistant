Using generics (as in the above answers) is your best bet here. I've just double checked and: test.put("test", arraylistone); ArrayList current = new ArrayList(); current = (ArrayList) test.get("test"); will work as well, through I wouldn't recommend it as the generics ensure that only the correct data is added, rather than trying to do the handling at retrieval time.
