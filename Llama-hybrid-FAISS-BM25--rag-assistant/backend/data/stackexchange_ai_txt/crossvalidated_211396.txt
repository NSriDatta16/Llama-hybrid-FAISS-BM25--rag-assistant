To get the coefficient in a space that lets you directly compare their importance, you have to standardize them. I wrote a note on Thinklab to discuss standardization of logistic regression coefficients. (Very) Long story short, I advise to use the Agresti method: # if X is the input matrix of the glmnet function, # and cv.result is your glmnet object: sds If you relied on internal standardization by glmnet (default option standardize = TRUE ), these standardized coefficients are actually the ones resulting from the fitting step, before retransformation by glmnet in the original space (see another note :-) ).
