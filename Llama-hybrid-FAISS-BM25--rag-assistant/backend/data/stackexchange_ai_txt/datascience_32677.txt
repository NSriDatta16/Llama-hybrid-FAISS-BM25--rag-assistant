In general, tidy data refers to a table that has One observation (sample) per row One feature (attribute) per column Data has historically been recorded like this in ledgers, spreadsheets, csv's etc. Tidy data is easier to interpret and inspect. More importantly, tidy data can be very efficiently processed by modern CPU's/GPU's through vectorization , which is why packages like pandas, excel etc. store data like this. One interesting fact though, is that neural networks usually take the transpose of a matrix dataset as input - think of this as turning the dataset sideways (so rows are columns and columns are rows) and feeding that into the neural network. Of course, there are exceptions to this. Think about image data, sound data, some forms of text data; it would not be feasible to store each one of these in a standard row / column table, which is why usually they are stored in other formats (jpeg, txt etc.). Of course, you can transform these types of data so they look more like "tidy-data" for example vectorizing all the pixels of an image, so that you transform a 28x28 image into a vector with 784 columns; now one row is one image and one column is one feature (a pixel location in this case).
