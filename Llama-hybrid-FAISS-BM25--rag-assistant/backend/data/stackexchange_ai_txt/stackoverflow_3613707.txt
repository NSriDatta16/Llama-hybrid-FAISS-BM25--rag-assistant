Can I avoid the above code fragment? I'm affraid for a performance penalty and it looks very heavy? Well, you could use an enum instead. I don't really see why you don't actually. But if you really want to use an entity, then it would be a perfect candidate for 2nd level caching and this would solve your performance concern.
