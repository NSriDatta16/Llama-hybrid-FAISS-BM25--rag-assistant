Is it possible to yield high-dimensional data from its low-dimensional point in KPCA?

With PCA, it is possible to reconstruct high-dimensional data from its low-dimensional point by $$ x_i' = Pb + \bar X $$ Where $\bar X$ is the mean of training set $X$, $P$ is the eigenvectors and $b$ is a principal component. Can this be achieved with kernel PCA (KPCA)? If so, how?
