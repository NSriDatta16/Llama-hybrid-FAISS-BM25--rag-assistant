Searching 2 fields at the same time

I have a table of first and last names firstname lastname --------- --------- Joe Robertson Sally Robert Jim Green Sandra Jordan I'm trying to search this table based on an input that consists of the full name. For example: input: Joe Robert I thought about using SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE firstname LIKE BUT the table stores the first and last name separately, so I'm not sure how to do the search in this case
