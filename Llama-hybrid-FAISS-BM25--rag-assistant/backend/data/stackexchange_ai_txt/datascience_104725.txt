We recently developed fcmpy library. Hopefully, you can find some answers there! You can use it for building FCMs, simulating them, creating interventions as well as optimizing or generating them using machine learning. Article about the library is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12749v1 The package can be installed via pip https://pypi.org/project/fcmpy/ Git repo https://github.com/SamvelMK/FCMpy cheers!
