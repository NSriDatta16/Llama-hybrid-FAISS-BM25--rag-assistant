About Moderators and Users What is the difference between moderators and users? Moderators can modify text, but how? Are they planning you to practise permissions, fs or some open-source system to differentiate users from moderators? Very odd that they do not allow Google products, but they allow open-source. Interestingly, USFCA encourages Google products in similar projects. Perhaps, there are some users, who could help you with userspaces. Good luck!
