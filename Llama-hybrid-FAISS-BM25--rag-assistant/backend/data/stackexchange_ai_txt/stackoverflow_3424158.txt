The problem is that you're likely adding that as a string, instead of as an element. So, instead of: $simple->addChild('foo', ' '); which will be treated as text: $child = $simple->addChild('foo'); $child->addChild('something'); You can't have a literal in the body of the XML document unless it's the opening of a tag. Edit: After what you describe in the comments, I think you're after: DomDocument::createCDatatSection() $child = $dom->createCDataSection('your body '); $dom->appendChild($child); Edit2: After reading your edit, there's only one thing I can say: You're doing it wrong... You can't add elements as a string value for another element. Sorry, you just can't. That's why it's escaping things, because DOM and SimpleXML are there to make sure you always create valid XML. You need to create the element as an object... So, if you want to create the CDATA child, you'd have to do something like this: $child = $PrintQuestion.....->addChild('TextFragment'); $domNode = dom_import_simplexml($child); $cdata = $domNode->ownerDocument->createCDataSection($value[0]); $domNode->appendChild($cdata); That's all there should be to it...
