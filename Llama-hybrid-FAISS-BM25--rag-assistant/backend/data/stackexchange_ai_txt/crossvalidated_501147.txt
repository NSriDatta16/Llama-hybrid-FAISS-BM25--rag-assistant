If you have a single variable with four groups, you need three dummy variables (in regression this is sometimes called the contrast. You can use whichever group you want as a baseline, it doesn't matter, it will jut change your interpretation slightly. Most statistical software we automatically do all of this for you if you input the data as-is with four levels. The contrast will look something like this: b c d 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 etc. etc. In this data set, observation set is in group a, which has been "dropped." Your regression will give you three coefficients: one for b, c, and d. If the coefficient for b is 2, it means group 2 is on on average two units higher for variable Y than group a . If c has a coefficient of 3, it means it is two units higher than group a . It also implies that c is on average 1 unit higher than b.
