I am working part time and a full time student. My curriculum encourages (read requires) many group projects. I have used openLdap and phpLdapAdmin to control access to my Subversion and Mercurial repos, Trac projects, Hudson, etc. It wasn't easy to install, but the time saved in administration was a God send. If you have projects where you will have many groups of people who need to be able to use different resources, it is a good tool.
