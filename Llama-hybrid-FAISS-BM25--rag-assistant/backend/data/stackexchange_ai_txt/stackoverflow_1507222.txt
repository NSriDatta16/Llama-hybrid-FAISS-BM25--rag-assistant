Actually, I remember doing something similar. I will write code that I wanted to use as a snippet and then I will just select it and drag it to the General Toolbox. That will create a control like object in the Toolbox that you can just drag and drop in your code when you need it. It is not a real snippet but it works. Another option is to create a class library with all your code snippets and then add a reference to it in your projects.
