Dynamic CSS3 prefix user agent detection

Is there a better way then using jQuery.browser , or equivalents , for determining css 3 prefixes (-moz, -webkit, etc), as it is disencouraged ? Since the css is dynamic (the user can do anything with it on runtime), css hacks and style tag hacks can't be considered.
