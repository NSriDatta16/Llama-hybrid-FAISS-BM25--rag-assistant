That's weird. Iframe fancybox's content is shown only for certains urls?

I'm using iframes with fancybox 1.3.1 and works great but only for some urls. If I put for example google.com everything is Ok, but with youtube.com the iframe fancybox is empty...??? A working example here (click on tab "date passate" and then on one of the google maps link on the top right column) http://ragazzosemplice.com/live.html A non working example: just click on the bubble "Video" (same web site a s above, just in the header) and then an empty fancybox appear, the missing link is a youtube profile... I literally used the same syntax... ????? Cheers
