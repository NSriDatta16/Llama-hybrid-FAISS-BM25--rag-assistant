Bayesian Linear Regression

I have the following question concerning Bayesian linear regression on my machine learning assignment: Consider $f = w^Tx$, where $p(w) ∼ N(w | 0, Σ)$. Show that $p(f | x)$ is Gaussian. I believe that $p(f|x) ∼ N(w^Tx, \sigma^2)$ for some variance $\sigma^2$ but I'm not sure how to show it. I'm also not sure why the prior was mentioned for this question since we're deriving an expression for the likelihood. If anyone could give me some tips to push me in the right direction it'd be appreciated (please don't solve the entire problem).
