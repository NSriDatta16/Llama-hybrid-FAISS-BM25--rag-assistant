Eclipse + AppEngine =? autocomplete

I was doing some beginner AppEngine dev on a Windows box and installed Eclipse for that. I liked the autocompletion I got with the objects and functions. I moved my dev environment over to my Macbook, and installed Eclipse Ganymede. I installed the AppEngine SDK and Eclipse plug in. However, when I am typing out code now, the autocomplete isn't functioning. Did I miss a step? UPDATE Just to add to this: the line: import cgi appears to give me what I need. When I type "cgi." I get all of the auto complete. However, the lines: from google.appengine.api import users from google.appengine.ext import webapp from google.appengine.ext.webapp.util import run_wsgi_app from google.appengine.ext import db don't give me any auto complete. If I type "users." there is no auto complete.
