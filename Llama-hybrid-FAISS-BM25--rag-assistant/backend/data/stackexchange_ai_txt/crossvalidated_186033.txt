How do you see a Markov chain is irreducible?

I have some trouble understanding the Markov chain property irreducible . Irreducible is said to mean that the stochastic process can "go from any state to any state". But what defines whether it can go from state $i$ to state $j$, or cannot go? The wikipedia page gives the formalisation: State $j$ is accessible (written $i\rightarrow j$) from state $i$, if exists integer $n_{ij}>0$ s.t. $$P(X_{n_{ij}}=j\space |\space X_0=i)=p_{ij}^{(n_{ij})} >0$$ then communicating is if $i\rightarrow j$ and $j \rightarrow i$. From these irreducibility follows somehow.
