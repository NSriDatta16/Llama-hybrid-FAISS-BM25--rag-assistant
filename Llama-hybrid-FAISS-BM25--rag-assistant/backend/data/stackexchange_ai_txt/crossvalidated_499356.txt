Your 2-sided test implicitly allots exactly half of your 5% significance level to "masks are harmful" ( $M_-$ ) and the other half to "masks are beneficial" ( $M_+$ ). To a Bayesian like Taleb that might suggest that you aren't properly thinking about your prior, because it implies that the amount of evidence it would take you to accept $M_-$ is exactly equal to the amount it would take you to accept $M_+$ , even though $M_+$ is intuitively more likely (to me, at least - if you had asked me a year ago whether wearing a mask would be more likely to increase or decrease the risk of catching a respiratory virus, I would have said decrease). And it seems to me that since the single independent variable was binary, using Firth's logistic regression over Fisher's exact test doesn't add much value. But your core point was that most of the doubt that mask wearing reduced PCR infections in the trial comes from the presence of uncertainty in the estimate $p=\frac{5}{2470}$ . This seems unarguable. Taleb says: "You donâ€™t get it. BTW I added a double column table joint distribution a la Fisher." Maybe that's his way of saving face while admitting that you raised a valid criticism.
