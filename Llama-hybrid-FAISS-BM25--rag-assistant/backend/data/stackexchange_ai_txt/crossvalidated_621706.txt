Can ANOVA suffice for comparing mean of percent/proportion data?

I've been handed off some data to analyze and I'm looking for something simple and straightforward. The 1 response variable/dependent variable is average percent mortality from 7 treatment groups (with 1 independent variable). These data can be analyzed using the the proportions (example: 30 of 50 trees died). I'm worried about meeting the assumptions of ANOVA and have considered non-parametric approach using kruskal-wallace. Any suggestions?
