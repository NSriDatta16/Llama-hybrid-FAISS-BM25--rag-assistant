Can you test for significant changes across 4 data points that represent the average cycle time in 1 month?

I have 4 data points that represent the average cycle time for a process in one month. The data is of the full population, not a sample. I am trying to determine if there has been a significant change over those 4 months. Here are the data points, with 't' representing the month and 'ct' the cycle time: t ct 1 1 48.33 2 2 42.71 3 3 33.42 4 4 34.17 I have tried a linear regression model. Here is my code and the results from that model: #create data set ct Model results: Call: lm(formula = ct ~ t, data = df) Residuals: 1 2 3 4 0.907 0.464 -3.649 2.278 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 52.600 3.828 13.739 0.00526 ** t -5.177 1.398 -3.703 0.06580 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 3.126 on 2 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.8727, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8091 F-statistic: 13.71 on 1 and 2 DF, p-value: 0.0658 While this shows a p-value close to 0.05, I don't think this approach is valid since I only have 4 data points and the diagnostic plots indicate violations of the assumption of normality. I have also created a time series object with the data and tried the MannKendall test: #create a time series object ct_ts Results: tau = -0.667, 2-sided pvalue =0.30818 This also shows a p-value > 0.05, however I have read that you should have at least 8-10 data points for the test. Lastly, I have considered creating confidence intervals for each mean and seeing if there is any overlap. The basis for this is a paper that I read by David Edelman on "A Confidence Interval for the Center of an Unknown Unimodal Distribution Based on a Sample of Size 1." The application here, I think, would be to treat each data point as our sample of size 1 and calculate the respective CI. If they overlap, then we could suggest that there are not significant differences and that the points come from the same distribution with any difference attributable to chance variation. Is there a better way to approach this? Perhaps with a one-sample T-test?
