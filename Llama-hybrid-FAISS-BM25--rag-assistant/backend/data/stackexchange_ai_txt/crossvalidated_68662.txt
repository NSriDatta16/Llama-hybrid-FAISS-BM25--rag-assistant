Using deep learning for time series prediction

I'm new in area of deep learning and for me first step was to read interesting articles from deeplearning.net site. In papers about deep learning, Hinton and others mostly talk about applying it to image problems. Can someone try to answer me can it be applied to problem of predicting time series values (financial, internet traffic,...) and what are important things that I should focus if it is possible?
