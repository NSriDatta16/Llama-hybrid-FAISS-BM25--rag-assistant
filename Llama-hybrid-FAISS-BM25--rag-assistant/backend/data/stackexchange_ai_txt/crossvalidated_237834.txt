The individual day values should not be corrected, in the long term, they have the same mean and SD as the 250 day data because there is no trend in you example problem. Please do not divide the mean of SD by anything, the daily mean, on the average, is very close to the yearly mean, and the actual daily SD, you cannot really judge by just one day's data, unless you have minute by minute data for that day. Then it gets a bit more complicated because the SD you have is the day by day SD, not the year to year SD, if you got that SD by using all 250 trading days in the SD formula.
