If two values of the parameter of interest have the same likelihood then it means that those values of theta are equally well supported by the data, according to the statistical model. It does not mean that those values are equally believable or that an inferential decision has to treat them the same. Any Bayesian prior that gave more weight to one of the values than the other would give a posterior that renders one of the values more probable than the other. You have not indicated the form of the likelihood function, or the nature of theta. It is possible for a likelihood function to be bimodal, but not every statistical model allows more than one peak and simple models involving the normal distribution will generally yield a bell-shaped likelihood function with a single mode. If theta is discrete then it is possible for two adjacent values to have the same likelihood even when the function has a single peak.
