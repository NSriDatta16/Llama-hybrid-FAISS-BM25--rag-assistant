Had the same problem with IE8 and Exporting to Excel that worked in all other browsers. The culprit for me was setting "NoCache" for the response headers: HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Once I removed this response header for the Excel Export page, it worked. By the way, your App might be doing this automatically, so you may have to programatically remove this response header in your page. Make sure you do that before outputting any content.
