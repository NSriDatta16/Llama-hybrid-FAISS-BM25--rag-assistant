The idea behind False-Coverage-rate (FCR) adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) is that if you can construct regular CIs, you merely need to inflate them for FCR control. The inflation is done by constructing the marginal CIs to the level $\alpha R/m$ where $\alpha$ is the desired FCR level, $R$ is the number of selected parameters, and $m$ is the number of candidate parameters. If you are constructing intervals on all considered parameters (i.e., $R=m$), there is no need for correction. Regular intervals will control the FCR [1]. For an application, and brief intro to other FCR controlling methods, see [2]. [1] Benjamini, Y., and D. Yekutieli. “False Discovery Rate-Adjusted Multiple Confidence Intervals for Selected Parameters.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 100, no. 469 (2005): 71–81. [2] Rosenblatt, J.
