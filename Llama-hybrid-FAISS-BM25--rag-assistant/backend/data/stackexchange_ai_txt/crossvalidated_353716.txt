Constant of Laplace approximation

I'm reading Example 3.16 of Robert & Casella's Monte Carlo Statistical Methods . It uses a Laplace approximation for approximating an integral related with the Gamma distribution namely $$\int_a^b\frac{x^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha}e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}dx$$ I'm wondering where $\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha$ does go in the end result. Also, the book didn't mention too much about importance of $n$, can anyone give some explanation on this regard?
