Short and sweet answer: The answers above are very thorough, so here is a quick description of how LDA and SVM work. Support vector machines find a linear separator (linear combination, hyperplane) that separates the classes with the least error, and chooses the separator with the maximum margin (the width that the boundary could be increased before hitting a data point). E.g. which linear separator best separates the classes? The one with the maximum margin: Linear discriminant analysis finds the mean vectors of each class, then finds projection direction (rotation) that maximizes separation of means: It also takes into account within-class variance to find a projection which minimizes overlap of distributions (covariance) while maximizing the separation of means:
