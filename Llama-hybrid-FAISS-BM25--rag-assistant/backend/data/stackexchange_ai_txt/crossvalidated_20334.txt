You said Problem: Given two or more functions, each of which takes in an X value and returns the probability of that result. That means the two functions are pdfs. and a data set, quantitatively figure out which function best matches the data. Doing the reverse(taking in a probability and returning an X value) would be a bonus. This is equivalent to checking the data for best fitting probability distribution, so yes, this is sane enough. Idea: Be able to compare Logistic Regression, a Data Tree, and "If yes within the past 3 years then .8 else .01" style predictions. umm, that is a different thing altogether. data tree and "If yes within the past 3 years then .8 else .01" style predictions are equivalent. The first can be compared with rest two wrt accuracy.
