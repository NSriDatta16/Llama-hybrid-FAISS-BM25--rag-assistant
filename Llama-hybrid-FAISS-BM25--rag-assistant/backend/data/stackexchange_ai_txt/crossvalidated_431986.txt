There are a couple of ways the logistic regression model can be rewritten. Let $X$ denote the student's GPA. The standard way the model is expressed is in terms of the log odds. We have $$\text{log}\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right)=\alpha+5.45X$$ and so a one unit increase in $X$ would increase the expected log odds by 5.45. Exponentiating both sides we get $$\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}=\text{exp}(\alpha+5.45X)$$ and so we'd expect a one unit increase in $X$ to multiply the odds by $\text{exp}(5.45)\approx 233.73$ Finally it can be shown that $$\pi=\frac{\text{exp}(\alpha+5.45X)}{1+\text{exp}(\alpha+5.45X)}=\frac{\text{odds}}{1+\text{odds}}$$ so the predicted probability can be found after finding the predicted odds.
