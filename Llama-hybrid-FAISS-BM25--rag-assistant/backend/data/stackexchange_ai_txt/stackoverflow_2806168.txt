Just an idea to consider: You can separate the transformation logic from the objects themselves, and then you have a fixed set of transformers, implementing the following interface : public interface Transformer { public T fromText(String text); public String toText(T obj); } Your actual data classes can have a method getTransformer() that returns the right transformer for them.
