Standard error of estimated coefficient

In a book Intepretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar there is a following passage: I donâ€™t understand how can we talk about a standard error of the estimated coefficient. I understand standard error as standard deviation of a given sample o values. However, when we are talking about a given weight of a linear model there is no sample, or rather the sample consists of just one value - the estimated weight, so the standard error would be 0. What am I missing? Link to the book: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/limo.html#example
