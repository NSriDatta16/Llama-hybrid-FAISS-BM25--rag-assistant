The "standard" approach, when using python, would be data manipulation with the numpy library. If you have more complext needs pandas library is also a very good idea. In order to train a predictive model I would highly recommend scikit-learn . It offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and they have a very good online documentation and examples. Depending on your needs there may be more efficient approaches but as a rule of a thumb your implementation using the aforementioned libraries will be good enough. If you are not dealing with a big dataset I would suggest using pickle in order to save intermediate python objects instead of having to recalculate them again.
