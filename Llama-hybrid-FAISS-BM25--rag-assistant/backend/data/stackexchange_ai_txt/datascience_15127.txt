I have used S3 , S4 and R6 (you forgot that one in your overview ;)). I would agree with Hadley Wickham that S3 is sufficient for most tasks . However, this is only required if you start building advanced functions that operate on objects. Say for example you build a model with one function and you want to create a summary and print function for the object returned by your model building function. For general Data Science purposes I would say that it helps to know the systems but none of them are very good examples of real OOP. For that I would recommend to work in Python, Ruby or Java. All have been build with OOP in mind. In regards to knowing OOP, I think it is vital for someone involved in ML. Not when you are prototyping in R or Python but definitely when you start working on production code. I think this Quora thread gives a good run down on when OOP becomes important in ML. If your focus is more on statistics in R it may be of less importance.
