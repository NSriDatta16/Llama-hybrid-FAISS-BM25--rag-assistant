You can use SimpleStorage, a XML storage based framework I created. You can download it from here. SimpleStorage Download It was made to solve problems like yours. To do what you want you need a single line of code: SrcStorage.Ensure('Data').Filter('gzip').AsBinary.LoadFromStream(MemoryStream); Not only it automatically base64 encodes the data but it also supports filter so you can gzip on the fly. So with three lines of code you can do it all: SrcStorage := CreateStorage('BinaryStorage'); SrcStorage.Ensure('Data').Filter('gzip').AsBinary.LoadFromStream(MemoryStream); SrcStorage.SaveToFile('Data.xml'); It uses OmniXML a very good delphi XML library. You can find all info on the download page.
