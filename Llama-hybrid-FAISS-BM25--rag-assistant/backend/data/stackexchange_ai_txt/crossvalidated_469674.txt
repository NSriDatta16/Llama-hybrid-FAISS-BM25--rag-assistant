Why do we need to model max, min, and average temperature for infection disease

For COVID-19, I read many papers who try to find the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature. In these papers, the authors found the relationship between daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and temperature, using maximum temperature, minimum temperature and average temperature. For me, I think that the number of the recorded confirmed cases is the same for the day. For example, if the government report that 200 people infected at 02-Feb-2020, and 215 at 02-Feb-2020 and so on. Then what is the idea behind find the relationship between the confirmed cases for max, min, and average of that day? If the tag is not appropriate for my question, please let me know what is the best one.
