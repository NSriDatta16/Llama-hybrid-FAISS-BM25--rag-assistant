Tensor Classification Models

Aside from Convolution Neural Networks, are there any other methods that allow for classification of Tensors? My observations consist of multi-dimensional tensors with height of 1, where each channel corresponds to a particular time-series and am wondering how I can effectively classify the tensors, taking into account the relationship between the time-series.
