As explained by CodeBlock, this seems to be related by the installation state of Microsoft.mshtml.dll We've got customers where the Microsoft.mshtml.dll is not present in GAC (nor in computer), and then the WebBrowser component never fires any event. By using Reflector in the WebBrowser class, the DocumentComplete event is raised by a subclass named WebBrowserEvent , which implement a private interface DWebBrowserEvents2 . This interface is a ComImport of {34A715A0-6587-11D0-924A-0020AFC7AC4D} , which, I suppose, is related to Microsoft.mshtml.dll. So our solution was to install the Office 2003 Redistributable Primary Interop Assemblies , which install the DLL on Program Files then register it on the GAC. Note : Don't pay attention to the .NET Framework 1.1 required or office required, it just copies some dlls. Note 2 : The 2007 package seems to include the same dll.
