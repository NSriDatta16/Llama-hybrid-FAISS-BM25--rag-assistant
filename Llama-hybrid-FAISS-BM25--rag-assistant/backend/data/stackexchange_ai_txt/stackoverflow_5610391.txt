Keeping text on the screen in Android's browser

I'm trying to adapt a Dokuwiki template for personal use. One problem I have is that when I access it in Android's default browser and zoom the text, some of the tool links are off the screen â€” I have to swipe repeatedly to bring them into view. This is in spite of the fact that the rest of the text wraps fine at its increased size, and it doesn't use absolute positioning (it does used fixed positioning, but only vertically, and my demo below doesn't at all). In Chromium (and Firefox), resizing the window or the text does not push the text out of view. I've put together a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Here's the XHTML: test Heading Menu Item It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. ...and the CSS: #tools { float:right; text-align:right; margin-bottom:2.1em; } The paragraph of text resizes and wraps normally, the Menu Item text ends up off the screen after zooming.
