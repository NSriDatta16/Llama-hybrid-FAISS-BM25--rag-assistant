Should we apply normalization to test data as well?

I am doing a project on an author identification problem. I applied the tf-idf normalization to train data and then trained an SVM on that data. Now when using the classifier, should I normalize test data as well. I feel that the basic aim of normalization is to make the learning algorithm give more weight to more important features while learning. So once it has been trained, it already knows which features are important and which are not. So is there any need to apply normalization to test data as well? I am new to this field. So please ignore if the question appears silly?
