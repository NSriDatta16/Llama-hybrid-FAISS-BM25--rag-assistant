Why would the results of PCA differ from a confirmatory factor analysis?

I have conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the fit of a model with 5 factors and 5 items per factor. I used the modification indices to alter the model until I obtained statistics indicating an acceptable fit of the model to my data. As others have done in my area I then conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) with a varimax rotation to check that items loaded on the factors identified by the CFA; however, not all of them did. Is it unusual for the results of a PCA to be inconsistent with a confirmatory factor analysis? Could this be because I have a small sample size ($n=96$)? As the CFA model has 'acceptable fit', should I simply work with the scale structures from those results and not do the PCA?
