If I understood correctly what you are doing, the problem is basically that sum(pH0)/k is not 0.05, is that right? This problem can easily be solved: just add the option , correct = F to prop.test , i.e. in your for-loop you should write: pH0[i] By default, prop.test uses Yate's correction for continuity , which might be appropriate in situations where sample sizes are small (or to be more precise, when the expected frequencies are small). However, this correction tends to overcorrect and leads to type-I-error rate smaller than desired, and is not appropriate for samples as large as yours. Edit based on OP's comment Maybe now I got what you are trying to achieve. The issue of multiple testing is not simply performing multiple tests. Actually, the whole idea of p-values in the frequentist framework relies on multiple tests, i.e. the idea that you can potentially repeat the experiment infinitely many times. Instead, multiple testing becomes a problem if one single decision is based on multiple hypothesis tests. The following code is quite inelegant but I hope it is at the same time very explicit to you in what it is doing. At the bottom you see that each single sub-hypothesis test fulfills the 5% requirement. However, if we decide to reject the null hypothesis whenever one of the sub-hypotheses was rejected, re have increased type I error rate. To be precise: with three sub-tests, type I error rate becomes $1-(1-\alpha)^3 = 0.143$ . k $p.value p.value
