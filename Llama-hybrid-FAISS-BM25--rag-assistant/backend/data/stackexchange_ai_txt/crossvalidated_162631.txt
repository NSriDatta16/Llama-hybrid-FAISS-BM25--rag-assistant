Why doesn't deep learning work well with small amount of data?

I am new to deep learning, so this might be a trivial question. But I am wondering why deep learning (or neural network) does not work very well on small labeled data. Whatever research papers I have read, their datasets are huge. Intuitively that's not surprising because our brain takes a lot of time to train itself. But is there a mathematical proof or reason why neural network does not work well in such cases ?
