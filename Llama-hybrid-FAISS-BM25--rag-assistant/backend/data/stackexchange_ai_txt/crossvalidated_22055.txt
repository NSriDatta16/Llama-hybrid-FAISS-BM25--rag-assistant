How do I get a variation measure of z-scores with different underlying n's per group?

I need to confirm a stats question and I was wondering if you could let me know whether you would agree with my thought process: would need this good enough for publication purposes in a Psychology journal, for what reason I am a little unsure: Essentially: How do I get a variation measure of z-scores with different underlying n's per group? For example, 3 groups with 8 z-scores (each representing a different test result), n1=10 per z-score,n2=8 per z-score,n3=12 per z-score. I would go and simply get a variation measure (SD) for each data point (z-score) by forming a new SD from each z-score, with the typical SD formula=Sqrt of Sum (individual z-score-mean of z per group)2/N-1. And then use this SD average score and create a variation score for each z-score per group,which should give the basis for running a significance test on this variation measure for the three groups. Would you go about this the same way? Have you perhaps come across anything like that before? Appreciative of any help. Edit I attach a table with the z-scores: 3 columns are Group 1, Group 2, Group 3; the first 8 rows are the z-scores for the 3 Groups on the 8 different tests. Group1 Group2 Group3 1.93 0.45 1.21 1.32 1 0.95 0.88 1.42 1.22 0.86 1.51 0.9 0.76 0.62 0.94 0.62 0.81 0.96 0.38 0.6 0.86 0.9 1.33 1.31 ? ? ? SD 0.95625 0.9675 1.04375 M 0.4650928 0.3974056 0.1554443 Coefficient of variation (V) 47 40 15 V as % Row 9 is the SD Row 10 is the mean Row 11 is the Coefficient of Variation and this is converted to % in Row 12. I hope that makes it all a bit clearer.
