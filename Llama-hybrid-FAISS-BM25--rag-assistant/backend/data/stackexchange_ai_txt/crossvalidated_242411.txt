Is there a frequentist approach to Lu & Ades network meta-analysis model?

I'm currently reading the seminal Lu & Ades network meta-analysis paper . It proposes a bayesian hierachical model for dichotomous outcomes which treats each study's arm as an (conditionally) indepenent binomial sample $ r_{ik} \sim Bin(p_{ik}, n_{ik}) $, $i$ being of the index for the study ($i = 1, \ldots, N$) and $k$ the index for the treatment ($k = 1, \ldots, K$). Hyperparameters are a (nuisance) random scalar "location" parameter $\mu_i$ and a random log-odds-ratios ($K - 1$)-vector $\mathbf{\delta_i}$, so that $$ logit(p_{i1}) = \mu_i - \sum_{k = 2}^K \delta_{i1} / K \\ logit(p_{ik}) = \mu_i + \delta_{ik} - \sum_{k = 2}^K \delta_{ik} / K\\ \mu_i = \sum_{k = 1}^K \delta_{ik} / K \\ \delta_{ik} = logit(p_{ik}) - logit(p_{i1}) $$ So the first treatment is the baseline for comparisons. The $\delta$ vector is modeled a Nomal $N_{K -1} (\mathbf{d, \Sigma})$. Putting things together and defining the appropriate matrix and notation, the likelihood easily turns out to be: $$ p(r | \theta) = \prod_i \prod_k \frac{\exp(r_{ik}X_k^T\theta_i)}{(1+\exp(X_k^T\theta_i))^{n_{ik}}} $$ This model resembles a multivariate version of the random effect binomial-normal model, which I usually use to meta-analyze log-odds-ratios with metafor. Since I'm not very familiar with priors and simulations, I wonder if there is a relatively straightforward [R-|metafor-] way to estimate this model with a multivariate GLMM, using a likelihood-based approach. Thank you for reading and for any advice in advance.
