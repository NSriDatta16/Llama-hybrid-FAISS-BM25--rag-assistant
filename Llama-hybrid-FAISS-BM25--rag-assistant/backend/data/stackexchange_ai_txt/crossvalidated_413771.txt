Fitting model again after variable selection

This question has been asked quite a bit in other contexts (doing LASSO then OLS on selected variables for example), but I'm unsure about how to proceed for this case. Suppose I have a set of 50 predictors for one outcome. I then split my data in two parts, train and test. I then train a random forest on the training set and compute variable importances. I select the 10 most important predictors. If I now wanted to retrain a model with just these 10 predictors (because I need a simpler model than just one with all predictors), how would I go about it? Is it "OK" to just use the training set again? Would this not result in some sort of overfitting? What is the correct way to fit the smaller model and then assess performance?
