How can I override and use easily Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Collection_Abstract?

In order to find a solution for my previous question I'd like to override Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Collection_Abstract I know I can copy it from core/ to local/ but that'll break further updates. So I'd like to extend it instead. If I do how to do it? I'm totally new to extension with Magento, and I'm not totally sure I can this without breaking existing code.
