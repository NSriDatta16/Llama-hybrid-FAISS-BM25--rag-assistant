What's the Statistical test to use to compare the means of two correlated time series (i.e., t-test for time series)?

I hope everyone is doing well. I have a question about the statistical methods of comparing two time series. I got monthly data from 1/1/2019 – 1/10/19 (10 observations). I would like to compare it to another time series date from 1/1/2020 – 1/12/2020 ( 12 observations). I’m interested in comparing the two time series and test the hypothesis that the means are equal or not (similar to a t-test). However, I don’t think doing a t-test is appropriate here because (1): the observations in each series are correlated. What’s the appropriate statistical test in this case? How to conduct it in R. Thank you very much for your help. I included the data in the Excel file.
