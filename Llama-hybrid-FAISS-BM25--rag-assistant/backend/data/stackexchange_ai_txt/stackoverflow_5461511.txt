what I ended up doing is creating a calculated field for each if statement. I then created yet another calculated field that concatenates all of the output from each of the first set of calculated fields I created. Seems like a bit of a hack so If anyone knows of a more elegant way of doing this (making a calculated field of a series of calulated fields seems awfully kludgy) I'd be glad to pass on the points for answering.
