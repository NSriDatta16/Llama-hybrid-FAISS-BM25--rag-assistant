0 and 1 are the only numeric values that are actually documented : session.hash_function allows you to specify the hash algorithm used to generate the session IDs. '0' means MD5 (128 bits) and '1' means SHA-1 (160 bits). If you want to leverage other algorithms: Since PHP 5.3.0 it is also possible to specify any of the algorithms provided by the hash extension (if it is available), like sha512 or whirlpool. A complete list of supported algorithms can be obtained with the hash_algos() function. I admit it's not clearly expressed, but the definition of the directive states that its argument is of mixed type. It expects either an integer (for MD5 and SHA-1 only) or the name (string) of the algorithm as returned by hash_algos() . (Incidentally, that also means that there're two ways to specify MD5 and SHA-1.) Developers changed their mind when new algorithms were added but kept backwards compatibility. I've tried this code and I got a huge session ID: ini_set('session.hash_function', 'whirlpool');
