if you are running solr inside tomcat as a container you can specify the solr home inside the XML descriptor for this webapp. (my terminology for this is probably a little off). I've got xml fragments for each solr instance I want to run and they specify their own local solr home directory inside the xml fragment. The fragments live at /conf/Catalina/localhost and each one manages a solr instance. This way I can have multiple solr instances on the same machine each with their own solr home variable. The info is here: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrTomcat In paticular Create a Tomcat Context fragment to point docBase to the $SOLR_HOME/apache-solr-1.3.0.war file and solr/home to $SOLR_HOME: Symlink or place the file in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/solr-example.xml, where Tomcat will automatically pick it up. Tomcat deletes the file on undeploy (which happens automatically if the configuration is invalid).
