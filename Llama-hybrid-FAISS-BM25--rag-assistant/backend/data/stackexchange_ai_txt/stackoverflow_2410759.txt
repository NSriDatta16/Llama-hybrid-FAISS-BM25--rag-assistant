You can traverse the result if you want sure (it's generating inline svg fragments by the looks of it), just open your fave web debugging tool (opera dragonfly, firebug or webkit web inspector) to see what it looks like. I'm guessing it might be simpler to just use the API to make one bar have a different color, but if you want to traverse the tree and assign some style to it that should work just fine. You can use standard DOM core methods for traversing the tree, just like in HTML, e.g firstChild, nextSibling, parentNode .
