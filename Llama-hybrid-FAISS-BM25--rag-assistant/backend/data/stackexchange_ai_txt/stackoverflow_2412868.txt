Personally, I would just use the session. There's nothing non-MVCish about the session really - think of it as just being part of your model. Using a cookie is really no different than using the session. Embedding it in the URLs is not a bad option though, especially for "linkability" if that's a concern for your project. But it has the side effect of cluttering up URLs and requiring you to pass that ID around constantly from page to page.
