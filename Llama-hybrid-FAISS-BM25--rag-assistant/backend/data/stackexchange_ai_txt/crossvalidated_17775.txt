I'm not sure why you want to compute the correlation of two time-series: It's generally a bad idea, especially if the two series are not stationary. But, if they were NOT time series, but just numbers, then I would NOT use the missing data: Correlation is between pairs of values. In both versions of the formula in your link, you have sums from 1 to n for both x and y - that is not n1 and n2 or some such, just n. That implies the same thing that logic implies - don't use the missing points.
