I would recommend in your users ApplicationData/LocalApplicationData folder provided by the OS for your app.. Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData); Of course if the storage doesn't need to persist very long (really temporary) then you could just use the temp folder and create a folder inside of it to isolate your files.
