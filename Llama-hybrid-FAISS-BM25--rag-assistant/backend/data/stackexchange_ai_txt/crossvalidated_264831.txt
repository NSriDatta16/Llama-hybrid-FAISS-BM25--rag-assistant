Effect of Randomly Ordered Time Series Data

I have been asked why and how entering time series data in a random order (i.e. not consecutively in the order they were observed) can have an effect on the outcome of a test for autocorrelation. Additionally, what the relationship between the estimates of the coefficients of the two data sets (ordered by time and randomly ordered) would be. Would anyone be able to help me with these questions? Thanks!
