With DragAcceptFiles() you don't get the necessary information, only when data is finally dropped onto the drop target will a WM_DROPFILES message be sent to the window handle registered with DragAcceptFiles() . If you use OLE drag and drop you will get much more control. The Drag and Drop Component Suite for Delphi by Anders Melander implements everything in an easy to install set of components. Use any of the drop target objects, set its Target property to the pagecontrol on which you want to drop, and use its OnDragOver event to activate the correct tabsheet.
