Silverlight + RIA Services and customing the user/password storage

Using the Silverlight Business Application template in VS2010 creates a nice default solution with a Silverlight project and an ASP.NET project. It also automatically provides some nice authentication that seems to store usernames/password/etc for newly registered users into your local SQL Server database. Is it possible to customize the storage mechanism? I already have a data store elsewhere and want to handle the adding/removing etc of details myself.
