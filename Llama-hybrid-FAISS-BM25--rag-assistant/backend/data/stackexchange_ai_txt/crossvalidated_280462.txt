@Danica already gave a great technical answer. The no-maths explanation is that while the linear (order 1) approximation provides a “plane” that is tangential to a point on an error surface, the quadratic approximation (order 2) provides a surface that hugs the curvature of the error surface. The videos on this link do a great job of visualizing this concept. They display order 0, order 1 and order 2 approximations to the function surface, which just intuitively verifies what the other answers present mathematically. Also, a good blogpost on the topic (applied to neural networks) is here .
