What is the correct way to represent the variation around an average percentage?

This is an example of my data: I understand that the mean should be calculated by (Total number "Yes" / Total number of websites)*100, however I want to represent the variation around this mean in the results. What is a suitable way of doing this? I'm not sure if the standard deviation will be meaning less due to the variation in sample size...
