Well the entity designer doesnt work very well. I generally try to do everything in the XML. In the XML there are 3 parts. The Storage (a representation of the SQL Database). The Conceptual (a represention of your .Net Objects. and the Conceptual to Storage Mapping It sounds like the error is in your Conceptual to Storage Mapping. You can keep the property name SalesType on the conceptual side but the mapping must map the the correct names on both the conceptual and storage side. Refer to MSDN here are some articles http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716731.aspx
