can I control eclipse jsp validation?

Apologies if this is a rehash of an earlier question that I can't find, but is there any way to stop eclipse (ganymede irc) flagging unresolved java references as a problem? I have a web app that I want to deploy via eclipse in order to debug. However, it contains .jsp files including other .jsp files, which reference java objects defined in the includer e.g. (writing this from memory so the syntax will be all over the place): includer.jsp: then check.jsp contains eclipse is validating check.jsp in isolation, doesn't like it, won't let me deploy. I'm sure if I changed the filetype of check.jsp I could get it to work, but it's not my app and there load of other's like it that I'd rather not have to edit. So, is there any way to configure the eclipse jsp validation to ignore the unresolved reference?
