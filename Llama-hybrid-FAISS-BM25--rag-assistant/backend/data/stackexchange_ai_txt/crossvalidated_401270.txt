I wouldn't say that EFA presumes the data are static, but rather, that most people apply EFA in research using cross-sectional designs, where the possibility of change in latent measurement models cannot be indulged/explored. I haven't seen too much of this kind of longitudinal work done with EFA, but longitudinal CFA and SEM are well-established approaches. Little's book (2013) provides a very nice introduction--I would just focus on the latent CFA and latent panel model for starters. And just as between multiple groups (e.g., Vandenberg and Lance, 2000), one can use longitudinal CFA to examine whether measurement model parameters--loadings ( $\lambda$ s), intercepts ( $\tau$ s), etc.,--are equivalent between waves of assessment (i.e., longitudinal invariance). As in other forms of comparative analyses (Meredith, 1993) , longitudinal invariance is necessary if you're interested in making strong comparisons between structural parameters (e.g., latent means, $\alpha$ s) across time. tl;dr : Little's book is not super recent (pretty sure I heard a new edition is forthcoming) but it still is a great place to start as an introduction to CFA/SEM in general, and especially so for the longitudinal context.
