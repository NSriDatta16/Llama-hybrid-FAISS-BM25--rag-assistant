Actually, the best thing would be to use ordinal logistic regression, since moral development stage is ordinal. You don't say what software you are using, but this can be done in most software (certainly in R and SAS). I wrote a presentation about ordinal and multinomial logistic regression that also (very briefly) covers binomial logistic. It uses SAS, but still may be helpful to you. Also this thread on CV has some good info.
