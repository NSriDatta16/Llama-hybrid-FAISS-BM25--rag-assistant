Is there a paper accomplishing finding physical law from observation without premade perception, using machine learning?

For example: Isaac Newton finds law of universal gravitation just by looking a falling apple, without any premade perception of that phenomenon. Is it possible to accomplish that kind of discovery using machine learning?
