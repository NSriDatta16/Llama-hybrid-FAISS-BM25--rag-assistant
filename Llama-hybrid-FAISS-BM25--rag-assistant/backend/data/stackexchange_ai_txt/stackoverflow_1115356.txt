Efficiency of c++ built ins

I am fairly new to C++, having much more C experience. I am writing a program that will use the string class, and began to wonder about the efficiency of the "length()" method. I realized though that I didn't have a good answer to this question, and so was wondering if the answer to this and similar questions exist somewhere. While I am more than capable of determining the runtime of my own code, I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to provided code, and so I find I can't accurately judge the efficiency of my programs. Is there c++ documentation (online, or in "man" format) that includes information on the runtime of provided code? Edit: I'm interested in this in general, not just string::length.
