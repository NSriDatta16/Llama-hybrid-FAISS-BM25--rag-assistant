How to convert XML Data into a binary deliverable?

We have an application that requires loading A LOT of configuration data at startup. The data is stored in a XML File which currently is 40MB but will grow to 100MB and more. This data will change while developing but not between releases. We are looking for a way to speed up the loading process for a "fixed" set of data and one idea is leading to this question: What would be the easiest/most efficient way to convert the xml file into something which can be delivered as a binary? For example we could generate a static class with a lot of 'new objectFromXML (param1, param2, ..., paramn)' lines in it's initialization method or we could use one object with a gigantic array containing the data. All this can be done without too much trouble but I suspect that there are more elegant solutions to our problem. Any comments would be highly appreciated.
