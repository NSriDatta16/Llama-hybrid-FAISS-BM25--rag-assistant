Scientific name for the problem given in the description. (In machine learning what kind of problem it is termed as)

Features marked as boolean values (around 50,000) , need to score a set of fixed output (around 25,000). I have wikipedia topics relevant to a particular url as features. And the output is the advertisement keywords which will perform well on those url. If I have the training data, i.e. advertisement keywords performance on urls. Given a url (I can extract the features i.e. relevant wikipedia topics), I need to predict which keyword might perform well on that url. What is the scientific name for such kind of problems in which there is a big boolean input set and I need to score a big fixed output set. Can you name few algorithms for such kind of problems.
