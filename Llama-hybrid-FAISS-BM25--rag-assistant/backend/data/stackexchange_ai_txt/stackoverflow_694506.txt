What you're looking for is a code coverage tool. For Java, I've had a great deal of success with EMMA . You should be aware that any code coverage tool is likely to affect performance significantly - typically it's used for unit testing, to check that your unit tests hit appropriate parts of your code. You could use it for a test run of a web app as well though - I'd just recommend against using it for the production deployment.
