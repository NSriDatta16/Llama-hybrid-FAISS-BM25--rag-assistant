Want an over-the-top solution? I assume randomness is not intended to be encryption-quality, but just enough to discourage guessing the longevity of a user, by user_id. During development, generate a list of all 10 million numbers in string form. Optionally, perform some simple transformation, like adding a constant string to the middle. (This is just in case the result is too predictable.) Pass them into a tool that generates Perfect Hash functions , such as gperf . The resulting code can be used to quickly encode the user's id at runtime into a unique hash value that is guaranteed not to clash with any other hash values.
