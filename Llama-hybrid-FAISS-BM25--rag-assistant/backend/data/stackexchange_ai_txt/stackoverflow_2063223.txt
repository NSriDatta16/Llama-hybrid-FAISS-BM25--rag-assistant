Building java from MSBuild

We are using MSBuild to run our build which compiles and outputs a number of .NET projects/assemblies. Now we are faced with the need to also include a java version of on of our assemblies and are unsure how we should go about integrating the building of this java source into MSBuild. There is always the option to shell out to a command prompt and have it perform the compilation and jar'ing manually, but are there any other and more elegant ways to go about consuming java building in MSBuild?
