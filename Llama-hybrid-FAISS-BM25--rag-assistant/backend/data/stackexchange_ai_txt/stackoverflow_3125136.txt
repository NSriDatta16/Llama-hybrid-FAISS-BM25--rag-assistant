C++ header file question

I was trying out some c++ code while working with classes and this question occurred to me and it's bugging me a little. I have created a header file that contains my class definition and a cpp file that contains the implementation. If I use this class in a different cpp file, why am I including the header file instead of the cpp file that contains the class implementations? If I include the class implementation file, then the class header file should be imported automatically right (since i've already included the header file in the implementation file)? Isn't this more natural? Sorry if this is a dumb question, i'm genuinely interested in knowing why most people include .h instead of .cpp files when the latter seems more natural (I know python somewhat, maybe that's why it seems natural to me atleast). Is it just historical or is there a technical reason concerning program organisation or maybe something else?
