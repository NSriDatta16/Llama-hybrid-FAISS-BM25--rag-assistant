Better way, than this, to rename files using Python

I am python newbie and am still discovering its wonders. I wrote a script which renames a number of files : from Edison_03-08-2010-05-02-00_PM.7z to Edison_08-03-2010-05-02-00_PM.7z " 03-08 -2010" is changed to " 08-03 -2010" The script is: import os, os.path location = "D:/codebase/_Backups" files = os.listdir(location) for oldfilename in files: parts = oldfilename.split("_") dateparts = parts[1].split("-") newfilename = parts[0] + "_" + dateparts[1] + "-" + dateparts[0] + "-" + dateparts[2] + "-" + parts[2] + "_" + parts[3] print oldfilename + " : " + newfilename os.rename(os.path.join(location, oldfilename), os.path.join(location, newfilename)) What would be a better/more elegant way of doing this ?
