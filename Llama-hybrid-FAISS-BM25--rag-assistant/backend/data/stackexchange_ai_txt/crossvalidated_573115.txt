Will PCA always fit a model at least as well as NMF?

If I perform PCA/NMF on a dataset, and then use the reduced models to reconstruct the original dataset, it seems to me that PCA should typically outperform NMF, simply due to the fact that NMF has the additional restriction of all positive matrix elements. So, are there any guarantees that PCA will outperform (or match) NMF (for the same number of components), perhaps as measured by least-squares or Poisson loss between the original and reconstructed data, or by BIC/AIC? In Python, an example workflow is: from sklearn.decomposition import NMF, PCA X = model_PCA = PCA(n_components=3) W_PCA = model_PCA.fit_transform(X) X_recon_PCA = model_PCA.inverse_transform(W_PCA) model_NMF = NMF(n_components=3) W_NMF = model_NMF.fit_transform(X) X_recon_NMF = model_NMF.inverse_transform(W_NMF) What can we say about the "quality" of X_recon_PCA vs X_recon_NMF compared to the true data matrix X ?
