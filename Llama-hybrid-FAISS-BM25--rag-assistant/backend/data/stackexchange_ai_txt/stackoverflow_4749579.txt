How to verify that the CA cert is OK - capistrano github deployment ssh problem

Hello helpful fellows, when trying to deploy my rails application from a local windows 7 aptana client via capistrano, the following error occurs: ** transaction: start * executing `deploy:update_code' updating the cached checkout on all servers executing locally: "git ls-remote (myrepo.git) branch" error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed while accessing https://myaccountdetails@github.com/myrepository.git/info/refs I can push and pull as well as ssh verify from my client to github. My server setup (gentoo) has been currupted by an unsuccessful Java package installation, some setup under etc/.ssh/ has been changed at that time as well. Already tried: deploy.rb ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true (does not seem to work for me) I don't know how to setup the ssh details correctly on the server, please advise for dummies... oh yes - it worked before, and no, I can't ask the guy who made the initial setup - unfortunately... Thank you very much in advance for your kind help! Markus
