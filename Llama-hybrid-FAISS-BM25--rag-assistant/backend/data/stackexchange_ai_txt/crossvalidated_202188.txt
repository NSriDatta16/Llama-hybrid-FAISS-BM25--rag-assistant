Estimate the number of points scored by a team in baseball

Let’s say I’d like to estimate the number of runs Team A will score against Team B Team A (away) vs Team B (home). Starting pitcher for Team B is a lefty named “Ben James” Team A scores 5.2 runs per game on average Team A scores 4.3 runs per game on average when AWAY Team A scores 2.3 runs per game on average against Team B Team A batters score 6.5 runs per game against “Ben James” on average Team A batters score 2 runs per game in the specific stadium on average Etc. Team B concedes 4.3 runs per game on average Team B concedes 2.6 runs per game on average againt Team A Ben James concedes 1.2 runs per game on average Ben James concedes 3.3 runs per game on average against team A Ben James concedes 0.5 runs per game on average when playing home. Etc. I have a hard time figuring out how to take into account all these different factors in a formula (stats against a lefty, ballpark stats, home/away stats, specific pitcher, etc)
