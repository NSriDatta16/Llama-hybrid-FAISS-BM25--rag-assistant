Well, it really depends on the usability you want to offer your users. Aside from that, it will depend on what type of users you have. I don't presume the focus on a hover is a particular good idea for the following reasons: When the average user first sees a form, they will click the field they want to edit first (This comes by intuition because that's the way they usually are presented with forms.). After that, they will move the cursor away, so they can see what they are typing. In your scenario, this will cause the users to possibly change focus to another element. Actually, the first item in this list contained a few reasons (It's not natural behavior and it might cause unwanted loss of focus) The more advanced form-processes, so to say... Will usually start with the first field of a form, and then navigate it by keyboard with use of the tab-key. I recommend you put your effort into making the flow of the form alright by navigating it with the tab key (HTML has a pretty good way of doing this, unless your code is all over the place and you have css putting them on their specific locations). I would just leave the form as is, without mouse-over focusses. There's probably a good reason why focus on mouseover is not standard behavior ;)
