iPhone: Pan to move image using touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded

I have an image in a view which contains a 9x9 grid. I want to move the object along the grid, which is made up of a column array(9) inside another array(9), using a pan movement. The image should move square to square in the grid. The code below is what I have so far. The problem is the image jumps 3 - 4 squares at a time. It is much too sensitive. Can anyone shed some light as to why and make some suggestions as to what to do to fix this sensitivity issue issue? Code which works: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; // Do not move if touch is off the grid if (gestureStartPoint.x 450 || gestureStartPoint.y 450) { canMove = NO; }else { canMove = YES; } } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self.view]; double thresholdX = 50; if (canMove) { deltaX = (int)(currentPosition.x - gestureStartPoint.x); if (deltaX > thresholdX) { deltaX = 0; if([self blockCanMoveXDir:1]){ [cBlock movX:1]; } // Resets start point gestureStartPoint = currentPosition; NSLog(@"-------------> Block Moved"); } else if(deltaX thresholdX) { deltaX = 0; if([self blockCanMoveXDir:-1]){ [cBlock movX:-1]; } gestureStartPoint = currentPosition; } } } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { canMove = NO; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ canMove = NO; }
