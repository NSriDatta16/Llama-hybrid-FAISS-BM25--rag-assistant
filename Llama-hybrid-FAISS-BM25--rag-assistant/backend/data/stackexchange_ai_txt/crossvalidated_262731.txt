Is it valid to run a ordered logistic regression with a two-level categorical dependent variable?

After much labor, I've yet to come up with the answer to: Is it valid to run a ordered logistic regression with a two-level categorical dependent variable? I'm running a logistic regression on a categorical dependent survey response variable ("Most People Can Be Trusted," vs. "You Cannot Trust Most People), against a variety of categorical predictors (age with decile factor levels, household income strata, etc.).
