Name of metric: percentage of K for 100% recall

I have a recommendation system problem where full recall is important. Thus, the standard metrics of recall@k is insufficient. Rather, what I want to measure is how much of the recommendations must be used to get 100% recall. I am computing k_for_full_recall = k@r[100%] / MAX_K , and take the average of this metric across queries. Is there is a name for this metric? Where can I read more about such a metric? Should I be using a different metric? How does one evaluate recommender systems where 100% recall is critical?
