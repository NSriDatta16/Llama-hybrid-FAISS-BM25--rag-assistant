Can I say .8978 is the strongest relationship between shopping habits and weight gain? Descriptively, you can say that it is the strongest relationship. Whether it is significantly stronger than the other two depends on your sample size. There's an online calculator for that. Based on the diffference in the coefficients, can I say that there is a difference in the shopping habits and weight gain of the three age groups? That's the same statistical question as above. Test each pair of correlations for the significance of the difference. As you perform three tests, you might want to think about a correction of the $\alpha$ level. Another possibility elaborated here would be to add age group as a dummy coded variable into a regression analysis. Finally, can I just add the the three coefficients and divide by three to come up with an average? No. To get an average correlation you have to do an $r$-to-$Z$ transformation ( Fisher's $Z$ ), average these transformed values, and backtransform the average $Z$ to an $r$ again. For the transformation, there are several online calculators .
