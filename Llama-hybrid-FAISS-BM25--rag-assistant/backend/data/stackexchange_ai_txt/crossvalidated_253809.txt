I usually standardize all my features to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. However, I usually work ONLY with non-word features (I work in text readability which means most features I use are structural rather than lexical and the few lexical features are aggregates). Perhaps such standardization might be unstable with a TF-IDF language model?
