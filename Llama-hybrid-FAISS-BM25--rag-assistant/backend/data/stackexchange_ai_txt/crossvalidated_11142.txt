Sites for predictive modeling competitions

I participate in predictive modeling competitions on Kaggle , TunedIt , and CrowdAnalytix . I find that these sites are a good way to "work-out" for statistics/machine learning. Are there any other sites I should know about? How do you all feel about competitions where the host intends to profit from competitors' submissions? /edit: Here's a more complete list: Kaggle TunedIt Clopinte KDD Cup Innocentive Crowdanalytix Topcoder
