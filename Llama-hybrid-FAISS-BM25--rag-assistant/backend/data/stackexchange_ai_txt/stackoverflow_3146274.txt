Is it OK to use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X? And, what's the dynamic library search algorithm with it?

I read some articles discouraging of the use of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, as the the path of dynamic library should be fixed using -install_name, @rpath, and @loader_path. In terms of making a program that runs both on Linux and Mac OS X, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH of Mac OS X does exactly what LD_LIBRARY_PATH of Linux. And, we can share (almost) the same make file that doesn't have the -install_name and @rpath. Is this OK to use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X? What's the dynamic library search algorithm with Mac OS X when the binary can't find the dynamic library? current directory -> DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH directories ... ?
