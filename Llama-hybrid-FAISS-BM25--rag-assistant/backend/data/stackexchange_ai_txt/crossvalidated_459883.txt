Do Bayesian estimators under square error loss have an invariance property?

I feel like this is something we went over in class but it's not coming to me for some reason. I need to find the Bayesian estimator for $\tau(\theta)=e^{-\theta}$ under square error loss. I already found the Bayesian estimator for $\theta$ (idk if you'll need the context but the prior was Gamma( $\alpha,\beta$ ) and the parameter of interest was that of iid Poisson variables). I don't know if I can just take the expectation of $e^{-\theta}$ and call it a day or what I need to do. Any help would be appreciated.
