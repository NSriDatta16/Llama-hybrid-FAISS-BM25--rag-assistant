The vbdork.net domain seems to now be defunct. In searching on this error, I found several references to this article. So I found a google cached version of it and am now posting it here for reference. The original URL was: http://vbdork.net/post/2009/02/10/The-client-disconnected.aspx You get the message The client Disconnected. You're likely to sporadically get this error message if you're in a web farm and you have a page where the user can make multiple selections, it typically happens in this scenario: The user selects a drop down list box that has an event on postback, but the user does this again before the request is sent back to the user, the user is now creating a second event that is being fired on the other webserver, the previous webserver tries to return the results of the old event to the user but the user is no longer there because the user is now on the other webserver. The user will never see an error, but if you're catching the errors and emailing/logging them you'll see them like shown below and be totally frustrated. Don't worry about it, just ignore it it's not even an problem, as long as you're trapping this kind of error nothing will go wrong.
