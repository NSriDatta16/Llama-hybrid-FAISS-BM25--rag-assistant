How to get "first-order optimality" with python script

I curious about how to get "first-order optimality" value using python script. For optimatization python has many module like scipy.optimize and openopt. But I confused how to use that module to get first-order optimality This is sample matlab script to get first-order optimality [x,resnorm,residual,exitflag,output,lambda]= lsqcurvefit(func,x0,xdata,tdata); foo = output.firstorderopt %get first-order optimality value this is some of foo reference from mathworks here Thanks for your attention, Happy New Year 2011 :)
