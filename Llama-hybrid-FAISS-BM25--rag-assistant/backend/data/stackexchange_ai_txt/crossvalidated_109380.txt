I am only just getting into DTW myself and have not personally used the packages referred to below, but I hope the following may help you. The Cran.R Project, in particular: • "ts" is the basic class for regularly spaced time series using numeric time stamps. • The "zoo" package provides infrastructure for regularly AND IRREGULARLY spaced time series using arbitrary classes for the time stamps. It is designed to be as consistent as possible with "ts". • zoo: S3 Infrastructure for Regular and Irregular Time Series (Z's ordered observations) References: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html , and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html Best wishes.
