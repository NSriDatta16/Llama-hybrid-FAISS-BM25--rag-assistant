I asked Chih-Jen Lin about this problem. Here is his explanation: This is possible. Internally libsvm's probability outputs conduct a CV procedure. So you need to have enough data. Now your number of data is just too small. An easy workaround, as stated in their tutorial, is to replicate the data a few times, so that if you had 1 data point for each class, you would now have 5 or 10.
