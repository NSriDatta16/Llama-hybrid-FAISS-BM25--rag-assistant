What is the correct file extension for Orange image embedding?

I am using Orange data mining in order to create a facial recognition workflow with some prototype widgets. To do this, I am trying to import some images (test data) using the import widget. My question is: which file format do I need to use in order for the image data to be compatible with the import widget? In other words, which file format should I use to upload the image? I have tried using JPEG but when I click "browse for images" to search for images on my desktop, it doesn't allow me to select anything to import. Does this imply that it is not compatible? Is there a specific file format that I should be using in order to do the image detection/embedding process?
