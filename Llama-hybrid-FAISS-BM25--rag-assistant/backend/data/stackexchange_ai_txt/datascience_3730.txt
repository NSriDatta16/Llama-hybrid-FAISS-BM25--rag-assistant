R random forest on Amazon ec2 Error: cannot allocate vector of size 5.4 Gb

I am training random forest models in R using randomForest() with 1000 trees and data frames with about 20 predictors and 600K rows. On my laptop everything works fine, but when I move to amazon ec2, to run the same thing, I get the error: Error: cannot allocate vector of size 5.4 Gb Execution halted I'm using the c3.4xlarge instance type so it's pretty beefy. Does anyone know a workaround for this to get it to run on this instance? I would love to know the memory nuances that causes this problem only on the ec2 instance and not on my laptop (OS X 10.9.5 Processor 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7; Memory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3) Thanks.
