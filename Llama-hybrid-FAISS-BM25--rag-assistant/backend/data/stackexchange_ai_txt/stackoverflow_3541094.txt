The Scala reference mentions (chapter 9, section 9.1): A compilation unit consists of a sequence of packagings, import clauses, and class and object definitions, which may be preceded by a package clause. A compilation unit package p1; ... package pn; stats starting with one or more package clauses is equivalent to a compilation unit consisting of the packaging package p1 { ... package pn { stats } ... } See also Organizing Code in Files and Namespaces on nested packages. (From Programming Scala: Scalability = Functional Programming + Objects By Dean Wampler, Alex Payne , page 44, Chapter 2)
