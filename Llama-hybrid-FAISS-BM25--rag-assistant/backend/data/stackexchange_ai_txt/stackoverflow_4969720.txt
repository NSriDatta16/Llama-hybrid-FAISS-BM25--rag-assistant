Get customer object on an event

I’m trying to createan observer on the following event.: ‘sales_order_payment_pay’. However according to magento doc http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/reference/magento_events I don’t have so much parameters avalaible on this event.. Do you have any idea how I could retrieve the customer object (i would need info such as customer id and customer email)? Thanks for your feedback and anyway I wish you a nice day, Anselme
