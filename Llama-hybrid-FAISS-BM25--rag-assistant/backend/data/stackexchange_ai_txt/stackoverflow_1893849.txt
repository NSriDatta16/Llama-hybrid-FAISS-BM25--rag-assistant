Somewhat of a guess here since this seems like a common problem people run into when trying to do anything with asymmetric crypto on Windows. If it is a self-signed CA and your cert is signed with the self signed CA, you need to import the CA into your computer's trusted CA store. To do this, run MMC and do the following: File->Add/Remove Snap In Add the "Certificates" snap in and choose "Computer Account" if you want it to apply for all users on the computer. Open the "Trusted Root Certificate Authorities->Certificates" tree node. Right click on "Certificates" and choose import. Import the CA certificate file. (It should accept the PEM encoded version without a problem.) While the CN will need to match the name of the machine in your machine certificate in most cases, the CA validation will fail if the CA is not imported into the Windows trust storage. I hope it helps.
