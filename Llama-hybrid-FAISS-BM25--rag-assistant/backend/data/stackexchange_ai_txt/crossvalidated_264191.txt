This is a bit tricky. You have a branching survey, and because of that you have missingness. You can often use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. An assumption of FIML is that your data are missing at random [MAR] (or missing completely at random [MCAR]). Your data are MAR because another variable in the model predicts missingness - if you say not to Question 1, you don't answer question 2. I've used in surveys of things like drug use: Have you smoked cannabis in the past month? If so, how much? You then have two outcomes: one (a logistic regression) for use, and a second (linear? Poisson?) for amount - but amount only applies to those who actually smoked. Another example is discrete time survival models. Each month we ask if a person left treatment in the past month, and about some other variables. If you left treatment in Month 1, you can't answer the questions in Month 2.
