You could write a Perl/Awk script to simply delete the unwanted lines from the table of contents. For the file burble.tex , Latex will generate the file burble.toc , which will contain lines such as: \contentsline {subsection}{Class F rewrites}{38} \contentsline {subsection}{Class M rewrites}{39} \contentsline {section}{\numberline {7}Definition and properties of the translation}{44} \contentsline {paragraph}{Well-formedness}{54} Simple regexes will identify which levels each line belongs to, and you can filter the file based on that. Once you have the table of contents the way you want it, insert \nofiles in the appropriate place (the style sheet?), which means that Latex will read the auxiliary files but not overwrite them.
