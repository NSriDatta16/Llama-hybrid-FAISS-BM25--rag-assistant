Time Series Model (SARIMA) Consistently Underpredicting

I have a SARIMA model of order (0,1,1)(0,1,1) 52 on a log transformed variable (originally non-negative count data, y = log(x+1), '+1' as zero is possible for x). The series plot along with prediction (figure 1): Residuals plots against the training data (figure 2): Errors against the validation set (figure 3): As is evident from figures 1 and 3, the model is consistently predicting a lower value than that which actually occurs. How can I improve my model to mitigate this? I'm using the statsmodels package for Python. Model generated by the following code: sarima_mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(train, order=(0,1,1), trend = 'n', seasonal_order =(0,1,1,52)) sarima_fit = sarima_mod.fit(disp=False, outer_iter=400)
