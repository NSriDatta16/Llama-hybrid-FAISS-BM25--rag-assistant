problem when zooming pictures in wxpython

I need to draw over image (to comment over it) in a scrolled panel. I'm having troubles with it since it doesn't behave right when I zoom it in or out. it stops drawing , and then it shows it after a while in a wrong place. right in the upper left corner of the window. and doesn't draw lines correctly . below is the code for the ( onLeftDown ) function (the button that should draw). the right button event (zoom in). hope it is clear enough. do you guys have any idea what is going on, and how do I solve it? thanks in advance def OnLeftButtonEvent(self, event): self.curLine = [] self.x, self.y = event.GetPositionTuple() self.CaptureMouse() def OnMotion(self, event): if self.HasCapture() and event.Dragging(): dc = wx.BufferedDC(None,self.buffer) dc.SetUserScale(self.scale,self.scale) # to zoom in and out ( increases whenever someone presses the right mouse button dc.BeginDrawing() dc.SetPen(wx.Pen(wx.BLUE, 3)) coords = (self.x, self.y) + event.GetPositionTuple() self.curLine.append(coords) dc.DrawLine(*coords) self.x, self.y = event.GetPositionTuple() self.SetXY(event) dc.EndDrawing() def OnRightDown(self,event): print self.scale self.scale=self.scale*2.0 self.initDrawing() self.maxHeight=self.maxHeight*2 self.maxWidth=self.maxWidth*2
