Train CNN weights by using FFT - Reinforcement Learning?

Assume that you are doing convolution inside a CNN network, by using FFT because FFT is much way faster than using 4-5 for-loops etc. But how should I train the weights if I know the output of my CNN network and how well it predict the class labels? Can I use Reinforcement Learning?
