How to compute equation 1.68 of Bishop's book

I am trying to obtain the right hand side of equation 1.68 in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop . I was treating the problem as having four random variables $x,t,D,w$ where $D=(X,T)$ then I only obtain this: $$P(t,x,D)=\int P(t,x,D,w)dw$$ $$P(t|x,D)P(x,D)=\int P(t|x,D,w)P(x,D,w)dw$$ $$P(t|x,D)=\int P(t|x,D,w)P(w|x,D)dw$$ Could anybody help me please?
