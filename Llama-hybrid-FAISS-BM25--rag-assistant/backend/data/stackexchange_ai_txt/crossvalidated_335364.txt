It seems to me that you just get different results for different values of t. There is no need to assume normal distributions. The same result would hold for any random variables that have finite means and variances. Finishing what you wrote would give you $$\operatorname{Var}(Z_t) = \left(\frac{t}{T}\right)^2 \operatorname{Var}(X_t)+ \operatorname{Var}(Y_t) + 2 \left(\frac{t}{T}\right) \operatorname{Cov}(X_t ,Y_t) .$$ This is simply defined for each $t$ between $0$ and $T.$ There is no reason to average over the values of $t.$
