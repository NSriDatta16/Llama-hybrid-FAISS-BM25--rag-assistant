There are many business rules engines available for ASP.Net; Windows Workflow Foundation , BizTalk Business Rule Engine , Solver Foundation , Stream Insight , and Reactive Framework . Google reveals many more, such as Simple Rule Engine and Custom Rule Engine . If there are many solutions to a problem, that is a clue none of them are any good, and that has been my experience using rule engines. I investigated WWF, and my experience was that implementing the engine and defining rules was more difficult and error-prone than simply coding the rules in the application logic. I discourage binary-format or graphical DSLs. In my experience they are very hard to change, debug, search, and maintain. My advice is to implement the rules in a familiar, end-user-understandable, domain-specific, text-based language. Which language will depend on what domain you are working in, and what languages your end-users are familiar with. Investigate competing products and implementations to see what is already being used in your domain.
