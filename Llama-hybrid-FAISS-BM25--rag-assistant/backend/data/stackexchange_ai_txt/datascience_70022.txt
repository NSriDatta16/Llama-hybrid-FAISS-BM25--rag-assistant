Highly imbalanced class Machine Learning

I'm currently messing around on a wage dataset (trying to predict who did and didn't earn over 50k p.a. based on a range of factors). One of the variables - 'work-class' is very imbalanced and I was looking for some advice on how to deal with this. 100% of the people within the never-worked and without-pay categories earn over 50k. Would imputation methods even be useful given the size of groups? Thanks in advance, Kelvin
