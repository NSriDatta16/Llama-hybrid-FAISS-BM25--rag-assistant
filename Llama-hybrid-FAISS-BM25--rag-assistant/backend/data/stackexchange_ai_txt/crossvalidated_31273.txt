The short(ish) answer is that as.data.frame(mm,type="varcov") should extract the chains for the fixed effects and for the random-effect and residual variances in the form of a data frame. For example: library(lme4.0) ## I am using the r-forge version fm2 Unfortunately this vector doesn't get useful names for the variance components. You can use vnames to remedy this (instead of hard-coding the positions in the last step you could do something with -1:(length(fixef(fm2))) ) The other part of this answer is that I am having some serious doubts/questions about the behavior of the mcmcsamp chains, but I will correspond off-list: a partial/preliminary (and possibly wrong!) discussion of my confusion is posted at http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/R/misc/mcmcsampex.pdf .
