Why does Machine Learning need a lot of data while one can do statistical inference with a small set of data?

I am wondering why Machine Learning needs a lot of data compared to statistical inference. In statistics, we can use a small amount of data for a statistical inference but in Machine Learning, everybody says we need a lot of data. Why does Machine Learning needs tons of more data compared to Statistics Inference?
