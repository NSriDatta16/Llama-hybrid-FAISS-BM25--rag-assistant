Does P(Y|X)=const. in the whole P(Y,X) imply that P(X|Y) also remains constant? Or is covariate shift the same as label shift?

I research covariate shift solutions for ML models. Some papers/books (e.g. "Probabilistic Machine Learning" by Kevin Murphy) claim that one needs different solutions for covariate and label shifts, I claim they are the same. Definitions: Covariate shift - P(Y|X) remains the same, P(X) changes between source and target domains. Label shift - P(X|Y) remains the same, P(Y) changes between source and target domains. Difference between these two: causality. We speak about covariate shift when X->Y and label shift otherwise. I claim that if P(Y|X) changes in any point of the feature space X then P(X|Y) changes in the corresponding point of the label space. Therefore, assumption that P(Y|X)=const. implies that P(X|Y)=const. as well in the whole joint P(Y,X). Am I wrong?
