Location of javaagent jar in bootclasspath

I have a javaagent jar that I put on the bootclasspath using Boot-Class-Path: myagent.jar inside the MANIFEST.MF file. I need to find out the directory on the filesystem in which the jar is located. However the method described for this here doesnt seem to work for me: new File(MyClass.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().toURI().gÂ­etPath()); In this case the ProtectionDomain.getCodeSource() returns null. I guess this is happening because the jar has been put on the boot classpath. Because of this I also cannot do MyClass.getClassLoader() to get the resource location. I am using Java 6. Can anyone tell how to get the location of the jar?
