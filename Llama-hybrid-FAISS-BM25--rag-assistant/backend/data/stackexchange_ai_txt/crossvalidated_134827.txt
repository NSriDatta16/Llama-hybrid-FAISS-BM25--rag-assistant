test of correlation among binary variables prior to running logistic regression analysis

I am running a logistic regression analysis with binary variables on SPSS: dependent variable: preterm birth (Y/N) independent variables: hypertension (Y/N), diabetes (Y/N), C section (Y/N), younger than 20 (Y/N), older than 35 (Y/N) 3 questions: Is it necessary to test the correlation between the independent variables first prior to running the logistic regression model? If so, how do I test it? Pearson's chi-square? What are the implications on the logistic regression model?
