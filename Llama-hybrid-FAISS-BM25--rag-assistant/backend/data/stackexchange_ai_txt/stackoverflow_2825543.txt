Embedding wav files in AS3 Flash/Flex project?

The Flash IDE is capable of embedding many types of uncompressed sound files, including wav, and offers optional compression when publishing. However, the [Embed] tag, only seems to allow embedding of mp3 files. Is it truly impossible to embed an uncompressed wav file, or am I missing some magic, undocumented mimeType? I was hoping for something like: [Embed source="../../audio/wibble.wav" mimeType="audio/wav"] ...but I get no transcoder registered for mimeType 'audio/wav' It's possible to embed wav or other format as an octet-stream and parse at runtime, but that's pretty heavy handed I think. I'm surprised that even though the Flash IDE can embed uncompressed sound data, [Embed] cannot, given that the swf spec can contain uncompressed sound data. Any takers?
