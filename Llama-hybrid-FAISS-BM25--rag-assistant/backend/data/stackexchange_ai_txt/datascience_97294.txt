The TimeDistributed documentation says the input should have shape (batch, time, others . . .) . In your case (a batch of images in a time series), the shape should be (batch, time, r, g, b) . But the image data generator in your code is reading images from a directory in a batch, outputting tensors with shape (batch, r, g, b) . So you are missing the time dimension. If you want to use TimeDistributed layers, then you'll need to assemble your images as a time-series, then apply batching.
