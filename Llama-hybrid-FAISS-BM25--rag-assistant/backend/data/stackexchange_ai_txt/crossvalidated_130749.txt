You should form the test on the $k$ errors, testing the mean of these $k$ samples under the null distribution. Each fold is a guess at the true fit of the model using a bootstrap-like approach, so naturally this should make sense as we are comparing the model to "random guessing". There are still some suspicions to this however, as sample reusage causes the individual scores to not be independent. More generally, this problem relies on theory of statistical significance for model selection. For a Bayesian treatment, see BIC and/or Bayes factor , which will be more robust to problems such as sample size.
