Iterating over a list of lists in Python

I have this problem on my study guide that calls for a function that gets the average of two dimensional lists and prints them as one list. I don't really have experience messing with two dimensional lists therefore have no clue where to even begin attacking this problem. example of what it should do: avrg([[85, 23, 45], [66, 75, 54], [85, 54, 70], [34, 10, 0]]) [51.0, 65.0, 162.333333333334, 14.66666666666667] my coding: def avrg(L): for i in range(len(L)): for j in range(len(L[0])): L[i][j] / i return L Where in my coding did I go wrong?
