Imbalanced data classification using Random Forest in matlab

I want to solve an imbalanced data classification, with small number of data points (approximately 600 ) with the ratio of true labels to false , 1:12. Is there any function or matlab code for using Random forest for classification of imbalanced data? How should I access it and set the parameters? Thank you for your help.
