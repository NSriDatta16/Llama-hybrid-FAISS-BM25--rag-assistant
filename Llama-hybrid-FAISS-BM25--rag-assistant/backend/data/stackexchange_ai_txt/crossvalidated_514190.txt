"Conorm" image preprocessing

For a personal project, I am trying to reproduce the MCDNN of the paper Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification by Ciresan, Meier, and Schmidhuber on CIFAR-10. The different preprocessing they use are the same as for the Traffic Signs dataset, and are described in Figure 3. I have been able to reproduce the first 3 preprocessing options without issues, but I am at loss on what "Conorm" is, and I could not find out by searching on the internet (finding an aeronautic company and lots of images of Conor MacGregor instead). Could anyone point me to a description of what Conorm means in this context or some useful reference?
