Specifying the Error Ratio in Deming Regression

We use Deming Regression for method validation in our clinical ELISA laboratory. As we run clinical trials this needs to be performed if we get a new reagent batch, batch of plates, new plate reader or a new operator etc. An important part of Deming Regression is calculating the error ratio which is the ratio of the standard deviations for x and y; SDx and SDy. I can't find any information on how to derive these. Obviously I know how to calculate the standard deviation but what data can one use for this? For example, if we buy a new instrument that reads the ELISA plates, we would run a selection of samples with a wide range of values and then compare the old and new instrument by Deming Regression to make sure they give comparable results. How do I know what the standard deviation is for each instrument and thus specify the error ratio? I can provide references if required.
