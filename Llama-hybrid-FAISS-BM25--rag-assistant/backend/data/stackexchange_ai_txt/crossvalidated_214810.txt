DCC models in R: how is the first starting value chosen?

The DCC model is defined through the proxy $Q_t$ as $$Q_t=(1-\alpha-\beta) \overline{Q} +\alpha\epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_{t-1}' + \beta Q_{t-1}$$which is then normalized to find the correlation matrix $R_t$ $$R_t=\frac{q_{ij,t}}{\sqrt{q_{ii,t}q_{jj,t}}}$$ I've been using the rmgarch package and its copula-garch commands ( cgarchspec and cgarchfit ) to couple time series with either a normal or Student-t copula and a DCC dependence structure. All results are nice and everything, but my question is on a problem which is present also at the univariate GARCH level: how is $Q_0$ chosen for the first estimation of $Q_1$? I've been going through the rmgarch document and other references on the Internet but haven't found any relevant info.
