Using the mean of the leaf nodes as a prediction in R

I am trying to fit a random forest model to predict a binary variable. In this case, I would like to use the mean value of the response variable in each of the leaf nodes (on the train data) as the predictors for that specific tree (which will be a value between 0 and 1 depending on the observations that reached the leaf node). Generally, it takes the mode of the response variable in the leaf nodes as a prediction (so the prediction is either 0 and 1). Then, taking the average of all the tree predictions, it reaches the final prediction. Is there an easy way to do this in R? Although this seems like a relatively straightforward question, I cannot find a solution to do this.
