Getting prediction interval for xgboost prediction?

I am looking for a solution that can bring prediction interval for xgboost classification ( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ), i.e. instead of output the probability that an instance belongs to the class positive as a single numeric value, I would like to output a distribution. I checked some tools such as https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist or https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3 but I am not sure what tool can be integrated to xgboost. Might you suggest me some libraries that can bring the confidence to xgboost prediction? Thanks
