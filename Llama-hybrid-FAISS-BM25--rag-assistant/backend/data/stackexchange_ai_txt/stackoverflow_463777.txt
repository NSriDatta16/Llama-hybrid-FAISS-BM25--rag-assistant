I agree with Omar Al Zabir on high availability web sites: Do: Use Storage Area Network (SAN) Why: Performance, scalability, reliability and extensibility. SAN is the ultimate storage solution. SAN is a giant box running hundreds of disks inside it. It has many disk controllers, many data channels, many cache memories. You have ultimate flexibility on RAID configuration, adding as many disks you like in a RAID, sharing disks in multiple RAID configurations and so on. SAN has faster disk controllers, more parallel processing power and more disk cache memory than regular controllers that you put inside a server. So, you get better disk throughput when you use SAN over local disks. You can increase and decrease volumes on-the-fly, while your app is running and using the volume. SAN can automatically mirror disks and upon disk failure, it automatically brings up the mirrors disks and reconfigures the RAID. Full article is at CodeProject. Because I don't personally have the budget for a SAN right now, I rely on option 1 (ROBOCOPY) from your post. But the files that I'm saving are not unique and can be recreated automatically if they die for some reason so absolute fault-tolerance is necessary in my case.
