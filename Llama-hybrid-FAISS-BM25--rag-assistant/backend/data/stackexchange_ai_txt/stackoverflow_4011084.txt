Is there a way to create my own index with Windows Search?

I have an application which store files (mostly Office documents) in various distant locations. I want my users to be able to search for these files based on some criteria on its own machine. I though I could use Windows Search to create an index. I've had that idea because a few years ago and to search for email in Outlook, I had to install Windows Search. So I suppose that Outlook is leveraging Windows Search to search in the PST file. In brief, I am wondering if I can create my own index with Windows Search. Right now, I am unable to find any example online (ideally in C#). I was able to find IFilter example, but that's it. Thanks for the help!
