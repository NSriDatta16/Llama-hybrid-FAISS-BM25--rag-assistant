Why does magento always come out of session

I increased my session timing to 1 hour in admin panel, but still most of items it throws me away (both in admin side/client side) from the authorised pages and redirects me to login page. What is the problem that am facing? I am using Enterprise edtion 1.9 and is there anything should i specify in the admin side. Note: Session storage is using file and i could see no prob with that directory in my server
