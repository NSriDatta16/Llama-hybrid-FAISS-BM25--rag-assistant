You cannot use a textbox to display HTML text as rendered HTML - you will need to use a rich text box. You then would have to programatically add your HTML as child nodes to the text box like so: MainDataSource.CreateNavigator().SelectSingleNode("//my:rtfField", NamespaceManager).AppendChild(" Header Text This is some paragraph text. "); A good explanation of how to achieve what you want is here: How to get HTML tags to appear as HTML and not as plain text in a Rich Text Box And some further links related to HTML + Textboxes: Rich Text Boxes in InfoPath
