You can get value of fields like this: //div[@id='sortResult']/div[1]/div (this'd be row 1 of the search result) //div[@id='sortResult']/div[2]/div ( row 2) (I'm making some assumptions about the HTML structure here, but you get my drift...) These can be quite fragile assertions, I'd recommend you anchor these xpath references to an outer container element (not the root of your document, as lots of "automatic" tools do). When you click sort, the value changes. You'll have to find out what the values are supposed to be. Also watch out for browser compatibility with such xpaths. They're not always ;)
