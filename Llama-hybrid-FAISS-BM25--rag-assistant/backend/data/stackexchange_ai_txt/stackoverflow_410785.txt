What is the best way to do basic View tracking on a web page?

I have a web facing, anonymously accessible, blog directory and blogs and I would like to track the number of views each of the blog posts receives. I want to keep this as simple as possible, accuracy need only be an approximation. This is not for analytics (we have Google for that) and I dont want to do any log analysis to pull out the stats as running background tasks in this environment is tricky and I want the numbers to be as fresh as possible. My current solution is as follows: A web control that simply records a view in a table for each GET. Excludes a list of known web crawlers using a regex and UserAgent string Provides for the exclusion of certain IP Addresses (known spammers) Provides for locking down some posts (when the spammers come for it) This actually seems to do a pretty good job, but a couple of things annoy me. The spammers still hit some posts, thereby skewing the Views. I still have to manually monitor the views an update my list of "bad" IP addresses. Does anyone have some better suggestions for me? Anyone know how the views on StackOverflow questions are tracked?
