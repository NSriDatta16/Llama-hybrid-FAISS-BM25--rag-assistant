select first_name, last_name, member.id member_id, bases.name, bases.state from bases, sell_transaction, member where sell_transaction.base_id = bases.base_id and member.id = sell_transaction.agentId; I am going out on a limb here and guessing that agentID is the connection to member from sell_transaction , but it's not clear or obvious, and possibly incorrect (unless you clarify your data model).
