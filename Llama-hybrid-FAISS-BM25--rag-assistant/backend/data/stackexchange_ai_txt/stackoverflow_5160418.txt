I just put out GrayWolf to edit programs, I don't have the ability to edit resource(s) (if you donate$:) yet but I would think the easy change is to edit the program to load the background from disk (./back1.jpg) I have others tools that would make it easy to change the background of the running program see "Hacking .NET" at DefCon18 other tools "GrayDragon" I have a payload that does just this, it is for DefCon19, but if you send me an e-mail... Happy hunting
