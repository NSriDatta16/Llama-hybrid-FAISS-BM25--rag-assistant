Having trouble with commenting tool, the time limit is throwing me off. Robert's answer seems right but it didn't work in my script. I finally got it to work with a different approach import re import urllib2 #after I created the user url = "https://graph.facebook.com/" + user.id + "/friends?access_token=" + user.access_token response = urllib2.urlopen(url) fb_response = response.read() x = re.findall(r'"\d+"',fb_response) friend_list = [a.strip('"') for a in x] user.friends = friend_list user.put()
