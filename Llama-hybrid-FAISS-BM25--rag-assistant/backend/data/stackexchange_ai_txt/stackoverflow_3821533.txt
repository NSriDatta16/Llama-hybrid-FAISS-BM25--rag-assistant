Forking is about cloning a repo on the remote side, because you don't have direct credential to push on the main common repo . That is why GitHub introduced forking (which is nothing else than a git clone --bare on the GitHub server side). If you do have the right to push directly to a git repo, forking it (meaning establishing a second "common" repo on the remote side) is not needed . Forking is not like a git clone you would do on the client side (i.e. on your workstation): there (on the local side) you can clone as many time as you want. That is why Chris Heilmann will have this slide in his "Reasons to be cheerful" presentation of Fronteers 2010 (a non-profit trade organization of Dutch front-end developer), next October. CC license If you cannot directly contribute to a remote Git repo because you want to introduce drastic code, you can fork on the remote side, clone on the local side and pull/push at your heart's content.
