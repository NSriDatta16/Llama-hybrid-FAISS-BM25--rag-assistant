How to load a theme's clear.css before system.css and other module stylesheets?

So, I'd like to use a CSS reset (such as http://bit.ly/gd2hQX ) as part of a theme I'm assembling. This will help me avoid assorted headaches with user agent defaults. I dutifully mention clear.css in mytheme.theme, and turn on Drupal's CSS optimization so it will get loaded into the CSS cache file that becomes part of $scripts in page.tpl.php . But, Drupal loads all the theme stylesheets after core stylesheets, so this ends up overriding many of the paddings, margins, etc on admin pages such as admin/build/modules/list . This is a pain. I know I can manually add a before $scripts in page.tpl.php , but then I don't get the full benefits of the CSS optimization. Is there a way to have certain stylesheets load before core and module stylesheets? Ideally this could happen on the theme level, but I would be interested in alternative methods if that isn't possible. Thanks!
