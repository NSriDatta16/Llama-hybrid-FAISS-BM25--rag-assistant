Viral topics. How to describe and characterize bumps in time series of tag-activity on Meta Stack Exchange

Background There is much dissatisfaction on StackExchange . This can now be covered in over 250 questions on meta (see 1 and 2 ). In response to that I made a recent meta-post and supported it with the following data/image. In that image it shows a bump close to the end of the year 2019. I believe that this indicates a rise of new activity. Question Are there certain standard common ways to categorize this sort of data when dealing with 'viral topics' and 'memes'? (for instance say one wishes to search for more of those bumps and have some abbreviated statistics/descriptors). (maybe this question is better suited for data-science instead of cross validated?)
