I can think of a few different approaches. Stack all of the experiments up and treat them all as one dataset. You will get one estimate and one standard error. This will likely underestimate your standard error. Stack all of the experiments up, but use a mixed effects model to account for the different experiments. You would probably want to take a log to make the estimation feasible. The model you fit would look like: $$\log(y_{ij}) - \log(50) = -(A + \eta_i) x_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij},$$ where $y_{ij}$ is the $j$th observation in experiment $i$. The random slope of $\eta_i$ will account for the correlation that may be present among observations from the same experiment. Borrow some ideas from multiple imputation and treat each experiment as a different imputed data set. For each experiment, you will get an estimated $\hat{A}_i$ and standard error $\sqrt{W_i} = \sqrt{var(\hat{A}_i)}$. The overall estimate of $A$ will be that average of $\hat{A}_i$ ($\bar{A}$). From the law of total variance , an estimate of the squared standard error may be: $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_i W_i + \frac{1}{m-1}\sum_i (\hat{A}_i - \bar{A})^2,$$ wherer $m$ is the number of experiments.
