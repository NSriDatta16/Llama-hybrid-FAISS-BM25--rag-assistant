Yes, it is very possible. Just remember to use Qwerty every once in a while. I've been leaning Dvorak myself for about 2 weeks, and I'm up to 75wpm average. I use Qwerty every day for a bit, but most of the time I'm using Dvorak. My Qwerty speed is still averaging around 100wpm. I also learnt the Korean Dubeolshik layout several years ago, and I average about 100wpm on that too. Learning different keyboard layouts is much easier than learning multiple languages. And people still manage to remember their native tongue! So if you ever knew Qwerty, with a good bit of practice you should be able to get back up to speed on that fairly quickly.
