Given your comment on attempting to handle dependencies, what I would do is focus on which libraries you are using. Knowing this, you will know what jars have to be on the classpath, and you can pay attention to that. There are also dependency management builders (Maven and Ant being two popular ones) that can package up projects with their dependencies inside. However, in the end, it is up to the developer to know which dependencies they have, and to pay attention to the requirements for those dependencies. This is one reason why using an IDE like Eclipse, and build tools like Maven or Ant are so nice in large projects, as when you have 20 dependencies for a project, that can become pretty unmanageable.
