Hate to say it my friend but you're not leveraging the benefits of jQuery. Why set display via CSS? Just use .hide() .show() or .toggle(). Why are you setting on onclick attribute via javascript? This doesn't make much sense at all. Use $(elem).click(my_function); The second bullet will likely fix your problem, but I'd do some serious re-evaluation. Good luck!
