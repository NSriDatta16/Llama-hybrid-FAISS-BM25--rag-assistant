Let me try and explain this difference with a simple example. Suppose I wanted to take the weight average of 2 and 4, with weight 2 and 4, respectively. As you know from your computations that would be equal to: $$ \frac{2\cdot2 + 4\cdot4}{2 + 4} = \frac{2+2+4+4+4+4}{6}. $$ A weighted average of $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ by itself is not necessarily equal to an unweighted average. A weighted average of $\mathbf{x}$ by all ones is equal to an unweighted average.
