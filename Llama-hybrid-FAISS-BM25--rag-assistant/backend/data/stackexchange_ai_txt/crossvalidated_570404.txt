Timeseries forecasting (Load forecasting) - Apparent shift in actual vs predicted values when applying regression model

Tools/languages/techniques I am using python scikit-learn different regression models (only linear regression is shown here for simplicity) I am working on a regression problem. The data I have is time-series hourly consumption data and I am trying to make a step-ahead prediction. I first prepared the data and made sure no data from the future is spilled into the training data. So for consumption at a certain hour (h0), the record will look as follows feature1 feature2 target h-2 h-1 h0 Where h-1 and h-2 are the previous two hours. Note I am adding two hours here for simplicity. However, in reality, I am using different lag values and moving averages as features. I trained the model and then applied the predict function to test data. After that, I plotted the actual vs prediction ( y_test vs y_predict ), but it seems that there is some shift where the prediction is shifted by one hour in the future as you can see below I tried to shift the prediction back by one hour the performance difference was huge R2 increased from 0.64 to 0.89 ( 39% enhancement) RMSE dropped from 1003 to 536.8 ( 46.5% enhancement) My Question What could I be doing wrong? Am I doing something wrong or could this shift be an indication of something else?
