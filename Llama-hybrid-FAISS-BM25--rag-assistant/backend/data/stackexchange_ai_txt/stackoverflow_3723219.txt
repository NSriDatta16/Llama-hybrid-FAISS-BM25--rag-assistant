beginner question on investigating on samples in Weka

I've just used Weka to train my SVM classifier under "Classify" tag. Now I want to further investigate which data samples are mis-classified,I need to study their pattern,but I don't know where to look at this from Weka. Could anyone give me some help please? Thanks in advance.
