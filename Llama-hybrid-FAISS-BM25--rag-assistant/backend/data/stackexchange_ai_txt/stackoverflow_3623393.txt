the coding part of porting to 64bits generally isn't that hard, but can require some time and a lot of hairpulling regarding builds/libs etc. however, the real problem, especially for a widely deployed project like flash is going through the proper testing coverage to cover the many code paths and platforms. 64bit is a horizontal feature, so it can possibly break everything, so everything needs to be tested. for flash on linux in particular, its probably more of a cost-benefit issue. is catering to the percentage of users actually use linux and 64bit worth the development costs for adobe? probably not, at this point.
