Multicore processor core communication speeds

I would look to find the speed of communication between the two cores of a computer. I'm in the very early stages of planning to massively parallelise a sequential program and I need to think about network communication speeds vs. communication between cores on a single processor. Ubuntu linux probably provides some way of seeing this sort of information? I would have thought speed fluctuates.. I just need some average value. I'm basically needing to write something up at the moment and it would be good to talk about these ratios. Any ideas? Thanks.
