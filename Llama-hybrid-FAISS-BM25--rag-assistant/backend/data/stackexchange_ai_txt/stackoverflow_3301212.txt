You may want to consider whether the UI level is the right place to implement Undo/Redo. This depends on whether you're tracking more significant changes to your data or merely short-term editing in the UI. In the latter case, you often don't care if you lose Undo state once you move on to another control. If you're purely looking for local Undo/Redo in the context of editing (such as undoing a Cut or Delete operation), then you can get this for free on the standard text box control (and possibly the Infragistics control) using ApplicationCommands.Undo and ApplicationCommands.Redo . Try attaching these to a MenuItem or Button and experiment with how they work.
