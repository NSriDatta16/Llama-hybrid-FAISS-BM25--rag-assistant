Dynamic time warping (DTW) is for temporal alignments. You are comparing non-temporal alignment by adding a constant between the two time series. Here is an example of temporal alignment by shifting 1 time unit between the two time series. The result is a DTW distance of 1. from dtaidistance import dtw import numpy as np y = np.random.randint(0,10,10) y1 = y[1:] dist = dtw.distance(y, y1)
