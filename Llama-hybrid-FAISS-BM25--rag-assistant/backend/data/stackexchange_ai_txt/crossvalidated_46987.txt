Flying Bomber aircraft through SAM sites - combining normal distributions

I have been puzzling over this for days but I don't think this was covered at school We simultaneously fly a known number of bomber aircraft, K, through three sequential batteries of surface to air missile (SAM) batteries, A B C. Assume the planes are incapable of destroying the SAM batteries. Assume that the SAM batteries are sufficiently spaced out such that only one battery A,B or C can engage the planes at once. I.e. the enemy gets three separate goes, once with each battery to shoot at the planes. E.g if we start with 10 planes, battery A shoots down 3, B then gets a go at the remaining 7 it shoots down 2 etc etc... Assume each SAM battery shoots down a random number of planes. This random number is drawn from a normal distribution unique to each battery i.e. Mu_A, Var_A, Mu_B, Var_B etc. How would one combine these three distributions into a single distribution from which could be drawn the number of planes that make it through all three layers? I need the parameters i.e. Mu_Combined, Var_Combined of the combined distribution Is it as simple as adding the distributions together? (This seems a little naive to me) I found this question: How can I combine two normal distributions functions? - Is it simply an average? Thanks very much EDIT: Use of the normal distribution is essential. In the model I am using the number of planes shot down is not particularly dependent on the number there are to shoot as it assumed each battery gets one shot and can only shoot some integer number of missiles. In addition the model uses a continuous distribution with the same mu and var as the binomial. Apparently it is a well established approximation whose accuracy can be improved using a continuity correction.(applied later)
