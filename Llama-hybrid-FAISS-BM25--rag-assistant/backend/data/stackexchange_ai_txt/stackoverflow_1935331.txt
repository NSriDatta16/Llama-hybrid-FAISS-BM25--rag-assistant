How can I check that I didn't break anything when refactoring?

I'm about to embark on a bout of refactoring of some functions in my code. I have a nice amount of unit tests that will ensure I didn't break anything, but I'm not sure about the coverage they give me. Are there any tools that can analyze the code and see that the functionality remains the same? I plan to refactor some rather isolated code, so I don't need to check the entire program, just the areas that I'm working on. For context, the code I'm working on is in C/C++, and I work in Linux with GCC and VIM.
