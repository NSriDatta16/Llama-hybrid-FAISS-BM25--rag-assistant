How should an element get references to elements further down the tree without hardcoding in Flex?

I have a custom Flex Container component written in AS3, called StatisticsContainer. When used in the application, it contains various custom Label components called StatisticsBoxes. So there might be a StatisticsContainer containing 3 StatisticsBoxes: "averageAge", "divorceRate" and "infantMortalityRate". The StatisticsContainer needs to be able to reference and operate on all the StatisticsBoxes. However I don't want to hard-code the references into StatisticsContainer, as there will be various different instances of StatisticsContainer with different StatisticsBoxes in them. So how do I dynamically give StatisticsContainer an ArrayCollection of all the StatisticsBoxes it contains? So far I started with a function like this in the creationComplete of StatisticsContainer: for (var i:int = 0; i This works only if the StatisticsBoxes are direct subchildren. Anyway it feels a bit hacky. Then I tried listening for a CreationComplete event in StatisticsContainer. However these don't arrive from StatisticsBox because they don't bubble. In the end I created my own event which bubbles and I fire it on creationComplete in StatisticsBox, and listen for it in StatisticsContainer. This works, but is this really the best way to do it?
