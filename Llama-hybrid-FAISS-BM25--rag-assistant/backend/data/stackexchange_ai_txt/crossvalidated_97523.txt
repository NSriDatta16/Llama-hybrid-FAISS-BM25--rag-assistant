In a matched case-control study, what do I use for hypothesis testing in the descriptive statistics or the "univariate" associations?

I am doing a case-control study with 80 disease cases matched 1:3 to non-diseased controls and examining whether they had a binary exposure prior to developing the disease. I am using multivariable conditional logistic regression for the main analysis. My question is, for the "descriptive" or "univariate" table where we try to investigate simple associations of each (non-matched) variable with the outcome, do I just use something like a chi-square test and ignore the matching, or do I use main effects conditional logistic regression (or something else)? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
