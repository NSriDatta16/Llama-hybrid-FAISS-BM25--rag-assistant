Quick overview of the structure if iPhone apps

Can someone give me a quick, one-to-few paragraph(s) overview of the structure of iPhone apps. I'm working my way through a book, but I can't really understand the purpose of App Delegates, MainWindow.xib vs. individual views' nib files, actions vs. outlets, etc. I'm looking for a high-level description, because all I can find are really detailed accounts of this stuff.
