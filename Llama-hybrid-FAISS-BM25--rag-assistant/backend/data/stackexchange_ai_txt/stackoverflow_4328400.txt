Looks like Scrappy is using XPATH for DOM traversal, which is a language itself and may feel somewhat cryptic for some time. I think BeautifulSoup will give you a faster start. With lxml you'll have to invest more time learning, but it generally considered (not only by me) a better alternative to BeautifulSoup. For database I would suggest you to start with SQLite and use it until you hit a wall and need something more scalable (which may never happen, depending on how far you want to go with that), at which point you'll know what kind of storage you need. Mongodb is definitely overkill at this point, but getting comfortable with SQL is a very useful skill. Here is a five-line example I gave some time ago to illustrate hoe BeautifulSoup can be used. Which is the best programming language to write a web bot?
