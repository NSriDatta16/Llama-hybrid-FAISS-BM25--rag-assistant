When to calc std dev? Before or after?

I have a sample which is analysed 5 times. I get an average of these 5 results. I repeat this test in triplicate to give me three answers which I then find an average of. My question: should I use the standard deviation of all 15, or just the standard deviation of the final 3 results? Thanks
