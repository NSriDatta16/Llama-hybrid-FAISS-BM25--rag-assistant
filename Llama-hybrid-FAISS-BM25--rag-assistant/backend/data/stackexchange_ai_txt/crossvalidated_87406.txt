Your reasoning is correct: if both series are I(1), and the residuals from their so-called "long-run relationship" are I(0), one can conclude that the series are cointegrated. The way you did it follows the "Engle-Granger two step approach", where a unit root test is applied on the residuals. Note that this approach, the residual based approach, was improved by Philips and Ouliaris (PO), who suggest a very similar procedure, and their test is recommended instead of the two-step approach you use. But note that in any case, be it using the ADF on residuals, the PO test, or the Johansen test, you will have to specify a parameter including the lags/bandwidth for auto-correlation, so in any case what you call "a subjective choice" has to be taken, although you can base it on stat tests or information criteria such as AIC/BIC. That results might differ according to the number of lags is a unfortunate but pretty common fact with time series...
