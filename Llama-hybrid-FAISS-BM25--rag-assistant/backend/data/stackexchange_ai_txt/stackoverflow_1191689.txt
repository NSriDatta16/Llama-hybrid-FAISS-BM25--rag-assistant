Hierarchical Bayes for R or Python

Hierarchical Bayes models are commonly used in Marketing, Political Science, and Econometrics. Yet, the only package I know of is bayesm , which is really a companion to a book ( Bayesian Statistics and Marketing , by Rossi, et al.) Am I missing something? Is there a software package for R or Python doing the job out there, and/or a worked-out example in the associated language?
