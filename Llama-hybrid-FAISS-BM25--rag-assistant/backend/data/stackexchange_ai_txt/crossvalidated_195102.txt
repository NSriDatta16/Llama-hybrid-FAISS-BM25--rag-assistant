Allow me to ignore the hype and buzzwords. I think "Data Scientist" (or whatever you want to call it) is a real thing and that is distinct from a statistician. There are many types of positions that effectively are data scientists but are not given that name - one example is people working in genomics. The way I see it, a data scientist is someone that has the skills and expertise to design and execute research on large amounts of complex data (e.g. highly dimensional in which the underlying mechanisms are unknown and complex). This means: Programming: Being able to implement analysis and pipelines, often requiring some level of parallelization and interfacing with databases and high-performance computing resources. Computer Science (algorithms): Designing/choosing efficient algorithms such that chosen analysis is feasible and error rate is controlled. Sometimes this may also require knowledge of numerical analysis, optimization, etc. Computer science / statistics (usually emphasis on machine learning): Designing and implementing a framework in order to ask questions on the data or find "patterns" in it. This would include not only knowledge of different tests/tools/algorithms but also how to design proper holdout, cross-validation and so on. Modelling: Often we would like to be able to produce some model that gives a simpler representation of the data such that we can both make useful predictions and gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the data. Probabilistic models are very popular for this. Domain-specific expertise: One key aspect of successfully working with complex data is incorporating domain-specific insight. So I would say that it is critical that the data scientist either have expertise in the domain, be able to quickly learn new fields, or should be able to interface well with experts in the field that can yield useful insights about how to approach the data.
