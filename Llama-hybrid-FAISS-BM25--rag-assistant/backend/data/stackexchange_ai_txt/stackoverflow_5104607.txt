How to include array data in CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS?

I'm basically processing a HTML form with PHP and then sending it off elsewhere for storage and processing. However I'm having trouble sending array lists through curl. I need to do it in such a way that when it gets to the receiving server it's as if it has come straight from the input form. I don't receive any errors when using the function if I serialize the arrays, however this makes them unreadable by the server, so they need to keep the post format as if they were coming from a HTML form. I'm using Kohana but principles of Curl are still the same, here's my code: $path = "/some/process/path"; $store = "http://www.website.com"; $url = $store . $path; $screenshots = array(); $screenshots[0] = 'image1.jpg'; $screenshots[1] = 'image2.jpg'; $screenshots[2] = 'image3.jpg'; $videoLinks = array(); $videoLinks[0] = 'video1.wmv'; $videoLinks[1] = 'video2.wmv'; $params = array( 'id' => '12', 'field1' => 'field1text', 'field2' => 'field2text', 'field3' => 'field3text', 'screenshots' => $screenshots, 'videoLinks' => $videoLinks, ); $options = array( CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array("Accept: application/json"), CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30, CURLOPT_POST => TRUE, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $params, ); $data = Remote::get($url, $options); $json = json_decode($data); Cheers.
