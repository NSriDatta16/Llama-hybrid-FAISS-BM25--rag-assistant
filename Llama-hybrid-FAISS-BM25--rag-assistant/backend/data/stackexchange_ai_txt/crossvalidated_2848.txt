It looks like you are referring to eigenanalysis for SNPs data and the article from Nick Patterson, Population Structure and Eigenanalysis (PLoS Genetics 2006), where the first component explains the largest variance on allele frequency wrt. potential stratification in the sample (due to ethnicity or, more generally, ancestry). So I wonder why you want to consider all three first components, unless they appear to be significant from their expected distribution according to TW distribution . Anyway, in R you can isolate the most informative SNPs (i.e. those that are at the extreme of the successive principal axes) with the apply() function, working on row, e.g. apply(snp.df, 1, function(x) any(abs(x)>threshold)) where snp.df stands for the data you show and which is stored either as a data.frame or matrix under R, and threshold is the value you want to consider (this can be Mean $\pm$ 6 SD, as in Price et al. Nature Genetics 2007 38(8): 904, or whatever value you want). You may also implement the iterative PCA yourself. Finally, the TW test can be implemented as follows: ##' Test for the largest eigenvalue in a gaussian covariance matrix ##' ##' This function computes the test statistic and associated p-value ##' for a Wishart matrix focused on individuals (Tracy-Widom distribution). ##' ##' @param C a rectangular matrix of bi-allelic markers (columns) indexed ##' on m individuals. Caution: genotype should be in {0,1,2}. ##' @return test statistic and tabulated p-value ##' @reference \cite{Johnstone:2001} ##' @seealso The RMTstat package provides other interesting functions to ##' deal with Wishart matrices. ##' @example ##' X
