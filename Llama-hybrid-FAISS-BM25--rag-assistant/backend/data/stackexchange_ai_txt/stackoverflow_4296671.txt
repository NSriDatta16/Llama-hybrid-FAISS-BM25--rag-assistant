how to close open html tags automatically with php?

I developed many sites on php and mysql. I have a problem on fetching certain words like i use SELECT *,left(' ',200) from I got the problem on layout of whole website due to no closing of opened tags. any suggestion would be great. I used strip_tags() and then substr() to crop text. but i need a permanent solution. update What a mighty fine da'; $tidy = new tidy(); $tidy->parseString($fragment,array('show-body-only'=>true),'utf8'); $tidy->cleanRepair(); echo $tidy; ?> enable php_tidy extension in localhost through php.ini and it works.
