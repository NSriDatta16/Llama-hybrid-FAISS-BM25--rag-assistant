It would be possible to have several MediaWikis hooked together as a "wiki family" or "wiki farm". However I have to agree with the other commenters that this would be overkill if everyone has access to everything, and it's not a huge group. Namespaces "can be thought of as partitions of different types of information within the same wiki, and keep "real" content separate from user profiles, help pages, etc." You might have namespaces "Testing:", "Dev:", "Mgmt:", "Users:". Then you can write about each topic from those different perspectives. So a page "Testing:Logging in", "Dev:Logging in", "Mgmt:Logging in", "Users:Logging in" etc. However when you make [[links]] in MediaWiki, you always have to put the namespace explicitly (if there is no explicit namespace, it is the "main" namespace which has no prefix). So you would have to teach each group to always put the namespace into their links and searches. It's pretty annoying. If you are insistent on using an approach like namespaces, I would recommend PmWiki. Its "namespace" feature is called WikiGroups . Creating a "namespace" is as simple as creating a link, and more importantly, if you are on a page in a particular name, by default links you make to other pages will be in that same namespace. If you want to link to a page in a different namespace you have to put it explicitly. So that is a big plus for users. But you certainly don't need to go to namespaces to organise content in MediaWiki. You can use categories and/or templates to group content. If you are likely to have more than one group writing on the same topic, though, it's likely you'll have page name clashes. You could just get everyone to write on the same page, separating the different author groups by sections, e.g. ==Users== ==Testing== ==Dev== ==Management==. To be honest, from what you have described I would really just use PmWiki. It is quite simple and effective.
