Inputs to the RNN Transducer at test time

In an RNN transducer (as defined here ), the input to the prediction network at train time is $\hat{Y}$, where $\hat{Y} = \text{blank},y_1,y_2,\dots$, and the output targets are $Y$. (So the network is trained to predict the next label, given the history of labels seen so far.) At test time, the prediction network does not have access to $Y$/$\hat{Y}$. My question is: what is the input to the prediction network at test time? Is it the output network's output at each timestep $t$? In the paper, it's $g_u$, but it's unclear to me how $g_u$ is calculated at test time.
