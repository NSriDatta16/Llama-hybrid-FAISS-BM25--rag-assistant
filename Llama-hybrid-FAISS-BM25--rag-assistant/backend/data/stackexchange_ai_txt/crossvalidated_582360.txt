How to consider time from vaccination on final outbreak size

I want to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the risk of infection during outbreaks and the change in efficacy due to the time passed from vaccination. I would like to achieve a causal interpretation of the results if possible. The data reports the number of cases over the total at the end of each outbreak, divided by vaccination status, and the average time from vaccination (in months) for each vaccination group. The setting is nursing homes. I am trying to imagine the causal flow of these variables using DAGs but I am not sure if the time from vaccination should be considered an independent ancestor of the outcome (fig1) or a descendant of the vaccination (fig2). Consequently, I am struggling to model my question in a regression setting, that is: the effect of vaccination (Vax) in determine infection risk (rate of infected at the end of the outbreak), and how the effect of time from vaccination (VaxTime) changes Vax effect. Should I adjust for both VaxTime and VaxTime * Vax (eq1), or for VaxTime only (eq2)? $$eq. 1:\ f(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Vax + \beta_2 VaxTime + \beta_3 VaxTime * Vax + ...$$ $$eq. 2:\ f(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Vax + \beta_3 VaxTime * Vax + ...$$ (here I omit a random intercept for the individual outbreaks and the nursing home characteristics) Finally, I wonder if I should include time from vaccination at all to consider the full effect of the vaccination.
