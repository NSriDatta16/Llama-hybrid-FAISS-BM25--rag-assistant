Lagrangian dual of SVM: derivation

The Lagrangian of a hard-margin SVM is: $$ L(w, b, \alpha)=\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 - \sum_{i}\alpha_i[y_i(\langle w, x_i\rangle)+b)-1] $$ It can be shown that: $$ w=\sum_{i}\alpha_iy_ix_i $$ $$ \sum_i \alpha_iy_i=0 $$ We derive the dual by substituting the second group of equations into the first. Most textbooks (sensibly) skip to the final expression: $$ -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\sum_j \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j \langle x_i, x_j \rangle + \sum_i \alpha_i $$ but I want to work this out in detail myself and am really struggling with the substitution of $w$. Could someone please post a detailed guide to computation?
