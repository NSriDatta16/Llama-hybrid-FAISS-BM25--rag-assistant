I'm actually working on a R package that runs randomForest as the local classifier along a pre-defined class hierarchy. The package can be found in R Forge under 'hie-ran-forest'. The package is already operational, although it is failing one of the cran test (for MAC), I'm not sure exactly why. In addition to actually running randomForest for each parent node down the hierarchy, the package also contains predict functions and performance functions. One of the performance measures actually accounts for the hierarchical class structure. The package addresses cross level interaction by first running random forest as the local classifier at each parent node of the class hierarchy. Next the predict function retrieves the proportion of out of bag votes that each case received in each local classifier. Then there are two ways to turn the proportion of votes to crisp classification: 1. a stepwise majority rule- Start with the local classifier closest to the tree root and select the child of this classifier that received the highest proportion of votes. Next, look at all the children of the selected node and again select the child that received the highest proportion of votes in the relevant local classifier. Continue until a terminal node is reached. 2. a multiplicative majority rule- multiply the proportion of votes along each path from the tree root to any of the terminal modes and select the node that received the highest multiplicative proportion of votes. The multiplicative proportion of votes are comparable to the proportion of votes produced by a regular randomForest
