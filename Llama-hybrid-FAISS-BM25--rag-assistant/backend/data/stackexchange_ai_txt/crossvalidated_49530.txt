Machine Learning is a specialized field of high dimensional applied statistics. It also requires considerable programming background which isn't necessary for a good quantitative program, especially at the undergraduate level but also to some extent at the graduate level. It has application only to the prediction aspect of statistics, whereas mathematical statistics as well as inferential and descriptive applied statistics require attention. Many programs offer students the chance to have a great deal of exposure to machine learning (CMU for instance), but industrial statisticians on the whole rarely get the chance to apply these tools, barring certain high profile tech jobs. While I have recently seen many data scientist and machine learning positions in the job market, I think the general job description of "statistician" does not require a machine learning background, but does require an impeccable understanding of basic statistics, inference, and communication: these should really be the core of a graduate statistics program. Machine learning and data science are also relatively new as job titles and as disciplines. It would be a disservice to those seeking employment as statisticians to sway their problem solving strategies toward machine learning if it's mostly abandoned in business/pharma/bioscience enterprise for underwhelming efficacy in 10 or 20 years. Lastly, I don't feel that machine learning tremendously enhances a solid understanding of statistics. Statistics is fundamentally a cross-disciplinary field and it's important to communicate and convince non-technical experts in your field (such as doctors, CFOs, or administrators) exactly why you chose the methodology you did choose. Machine learning is such a niche, highly technical field that, in many applied practices, only promises incrementally better performance than standard tools and techniques. Many of the methods in supervised and unsupervised learning are perceived by non-experts (and even some less trained experts) as "black box". When asked to defend their choice of a specific learning method, there are explanations that fall flat and draw on none of the applied problem motivated circumstances. This is a great risk to advising any decision making process.
