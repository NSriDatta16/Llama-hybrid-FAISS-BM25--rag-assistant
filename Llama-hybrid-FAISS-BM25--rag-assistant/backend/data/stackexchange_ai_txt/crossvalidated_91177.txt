Machine learning techniques for spam detection, and in general for text classification

I am going to configure a system for spam detection. What I have is a dataset of labeled (spam/not-spam) strings containing, mostly, sentences. I have a background in machine learning techniques, but no background in machine learning applied to text. One approach could be creating vectors of extremely high dimensions, in which the features are boolean and each feature represent one possible word (present/not present). Of course such approach is unsatisfactory due the high dimensionality, but also for the extreme sparsity of one feature across the instances and extreme sparsity across the features. What I am asking is just a few pointers (to tutorials, for example) to simple entry-level techniques that may address the aforementioned shortcomings of boolean per-word encoding. Any ideas on which tools may be more suitable for this task? Maybe RapidMiner?
