XHTML Favicon - proper usage

What is the proper way to have a favicon for a website in XHTML? 1.Does it have to be .ico or can it be .gif or .png? 2.Is this the proper code for embedding and rel value: 3.Does the favicon file have to reside in the root of the site or it can be anywhere and correctly specified in the link href attribute? 4.Anything else? Thank you.
