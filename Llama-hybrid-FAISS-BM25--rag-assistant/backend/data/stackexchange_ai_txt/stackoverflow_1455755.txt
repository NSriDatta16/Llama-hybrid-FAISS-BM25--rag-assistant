Where to begin largely depends on your learning style. Personally, I like to take stock of the tools available to me before I tackle a problem. I like to know what's in the toolbox and get a feel for what each tool does. Others prefer to dive into a problem and crack open the toolbox only once they know what type of tool they're looking for. This, to me, is slower and increases the likelihood of picking the wrong tool. If you're like me, I'd recommend (like Marc Gravell) the 70-536 training guide. The examples are probably too trivial to apply to the real world, but that's not the point. It's purpose is to give you a guided tour of the toolbox. Start here to get your overview of the core framework and then move on to one of the books (or online tutorials) that'll guide you through leveraging parts the framework to accomplish something practical.
