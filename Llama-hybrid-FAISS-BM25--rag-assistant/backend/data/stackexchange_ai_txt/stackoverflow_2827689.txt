For reasons more adequately explained by CodeSlave the answer is No and you should switch to a proper relational database. I'd like to add that this does not have to be SQL Server. Quite possibly the reason why you are reluctant to do this is one of cost, SQL Server being quite expensive to obtain and deploy if you are not in an educational or charitable organisation (when it's remarkably cheap and then usually a complete no-brainer). I've recently had extremely good results moving an Access system from MDB to MySQL. At least 95% of the code functioned without modification, and of the remaining 5% most was straightforward with only a few limited areas where significant effort was required. If you have sloppy code (not closing connections or releasing objects) then you'll need to fix these, but generally I was remarkably surprised how painless this approach was. Certainly I would highly recommend that if the reason you are reluctant to move to a database backend is one of cost then you should not attempt to manipulate .mdb files and go instead for the more robust database solution.
