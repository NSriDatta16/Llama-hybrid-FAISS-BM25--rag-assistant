If you can build it in a more unix-ish environment, you should have a size command you can run on .o files that will tell you the data and bss segment sizes for each .o file. This is a very quick way to find variables of static storage duration (just look for nonzero sizes in either of these fields). Perhaps you could try building with mingw or cygwin, or looking for a similar tool in the MSVC toolset.
