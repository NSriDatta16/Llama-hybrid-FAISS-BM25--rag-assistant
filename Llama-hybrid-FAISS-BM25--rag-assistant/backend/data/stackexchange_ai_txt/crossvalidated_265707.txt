If you predict on partial data, then use partial data to train! X2 is believed to depend on X1 and Y which depends on both X1 and X2 This means that Y only depends on X1. In your particular case, X1 are player/team id's and X2 are the actions of the game. You have stated that these actions include goals . Then why do you need a neural network to compute score Y from X2? You literally have an array saying which teams scored. X2 is something that you should let the neural network figure out. The only thing that you should supply is X1 in both training and prediction. Analogy If you want to predict how well a student scores on a test (Y), the data you have available is X1, including sleep, previous scores, hours of learning and amount of coffee. That's all you need . You don't need X2, which in this case, is what the student wrote down on the test. With X2 you could compute Y directly, without a neural network. Solution What you should do is make X1 include as much details about players and team as possible. For players, include average amount of goals, average takeover, average distance travelled, average swings made etc. Also include stuff like the environment; the season in which their playing, the amount of supporters. Do not compute the resulting actions of the teams, that is the 'magic' happening in the neural network already.
