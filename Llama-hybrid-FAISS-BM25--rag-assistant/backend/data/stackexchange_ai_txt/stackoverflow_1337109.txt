How do I drive pagination for an infragistics grid in a webpage via watin?

Using IE8's developer mode, I see that select lists are implemented using partial postbacks. Unfortunately, the select list itself doesn't appear addressable. It has no ID. Here is how it looks in IE8: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 How do I address the select list here? Alternatively, using WatiN from C# and nunit, how do I send pagination events to the grid?
