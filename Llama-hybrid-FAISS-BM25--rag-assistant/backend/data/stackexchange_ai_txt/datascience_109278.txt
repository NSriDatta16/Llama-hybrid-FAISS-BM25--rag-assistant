Should i always transform data to normal distribution?

I am trying to understand transformations but this question seems to be in my and some people's mind. If we have a numeric variable in EVERY data science case. Transforming data(Log, power transforms) into normal distribution will help the model to learn better? And stationarity. Stationarity is a different thing than transforming data to make it have a normal distribution. Is Transforming EVERY numeric data to stationery will make EVERY model learn better too?
