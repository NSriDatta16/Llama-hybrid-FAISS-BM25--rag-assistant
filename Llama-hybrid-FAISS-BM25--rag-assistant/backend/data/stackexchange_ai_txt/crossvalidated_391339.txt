I strongly doubt your method will work unless the training set is massive and the prediction is for members inside the training set. Moreso, you would be ignoring Elo rating which does provide a prediction as to which player would win. Let me give you two scenarios as to why I do not think this will work. My brother was at an international open and an international grandmaster was playing a simul with about twenty other players. He was zipping along moving from board to board when my brother did something unexpected, he manually reversed the castling that he had performed previously. The GM stopped playing everyone else and started just playing my brother. The GM won but congratulated him. He showed my brother that he had a guaranteed win in five from the uncastled position. My brother made a mistake and lost. This creates two problems for your algorithm. First, the probability of a win was unity. There was no uncertainty as it was unstoppable. The person with no chance of losing, lost. My point is that chess is a deterministic system that is too complicated, but not too complex, to see deep enough into the future to determine the winner. What would your logistic regression be measuring? Would it be the absence of precision by a player in executing their best game? Chess is not a random process. The second example happens quite a bit with beginners. King-Rook versus King is a guaranteed win, but beginners force a draw all of the time. If your logistic regression were trained on masters, then the probability would be unity, but on beginners, it may be 80%. Go slightly more complicated, to Bishop-Bishop-King versus King and you may never see an end to the game. Positional thinking depends only on the skill of the player. Players with more skill can do more with a given position. Some openings, such as the center-counter should always result in a loss for black, but black wins from time to time. It should never happen with a master, but it happens quite a bit otherwise because the players do not take advantage of black being one pawn down. They lack the skill to take advantage of the position and black wins.
