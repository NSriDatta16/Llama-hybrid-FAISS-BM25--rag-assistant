There's no way to better organise the tables? For example a "DataPointTypes" and "DataPointValues" table? For example (and I don't know your particular circumstances) if all of your tables are like "WebsiteDataPoints (WebsitePage, Day, Visits)" "StoreDataPoints (Branch, Week, Sales)" etc. you could instead have DataPointSources(Name) (with data: Website,Store) DataPointTypes(SourceId, ColumnName) (with data: (Website, WebsitePage), (Website, Day), (Store, Branch), (Store, Sales) etc.) DataPointEntry(Id, Timestamp) DataPointValues (EntryId, Value(as varchar probably)) (with data: (1, Website-WebsitePage, 'pages.php'), (2, Store-Branch, 'MainStore'), (1, Website-Day, '12/03/1980'), (2, Store-Sales '35') etc.) In this way each table becomes a source, each column becomes a type, each row becomes an entry, and each cell becomes a value.
