Risks in sending out high volume of emails over SMTP

What are the risks, if any, of sending out massive amounts of emails over SMTP? Specifically, this question is regarding the risks of being labelled/blacklisted as spammers of spoofers. Our mails are legitimate, however. Our system needs to send out reminders to our corporate users on a daily basis, which may number into the thousands, say. Our worry is that with such a setup, our domain might end up being blacklisted by the receiving organisation, thus rendering our reminder service useless. Does anyone have any information on what might be a "safe" volume of emails to send out to avoid being blacklisted? Or can we just churn out emails with abandon?
