If you want to change the user agent string you send when opening web pages, google around for a Firefox plugin. ;) For example, I found this one . Or you could write a proxy server in Python, which changes all your requests independent of the browser. My point is, changing the string is going to be the easy part; your first question should be, where do I need to change it? If you already know that (at the browser? proxy server? on the router between you and the web servers you're hitting?), we can probably be more helpful. Or, if you're just doing this inside a script, go with any of the urllib answers. ;)
