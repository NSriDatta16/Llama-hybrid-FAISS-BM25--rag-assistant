Yes, it definitely makes sense to do this. I can give two examples in addition to the nice answer by Kevin Li. There is work on Bayesian record linkage that you might be interested in. In this setting, records emerge from the same real world entity (such as a person's name), but are corrupted by e.g. misspellings or missing middle initials. Steorts, R., Hall, R., & Fienberg, S. (2014, April). SMERED: A Bayesian approach to graphical record linkage and de-duplication. In Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (pp. 922-930). https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4645 There is also work on Bayesian recovery of molecular barcodes after corruption by copying (PCR) errors. In this setting, the real world entity is a short oligonucleotide, and the data-generating process consists of individual substitutions. Petukhov, V., Guo, J., Baryawno, N., Severe, N., Scadden, D.
