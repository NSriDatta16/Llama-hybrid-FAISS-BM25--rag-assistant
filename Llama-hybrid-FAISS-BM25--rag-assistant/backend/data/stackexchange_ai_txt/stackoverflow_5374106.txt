distributed MAKE

I had a MAKE compilation process that took around 1 hour to complete earlier. I used the -j command and was able to reduce it to 40 mins. What I observed is that the CPU utilization was high and my mentor suggested me to distribute the jobs on different SERVERS or machines available with our organization. I read about distcc but it can be used for c code only and we have a mix of c and java code. Kindly suggest me an appropriate tool to look for and which is the easiest to install and deploy as I am the only one working on this project. Specifications - platform - solaris-sparc and x86 also Thank you Ankit
