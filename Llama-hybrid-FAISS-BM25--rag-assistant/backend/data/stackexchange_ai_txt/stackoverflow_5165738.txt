Note that the two fragments are not necessarily equivalent, because the first block could re-assign name so that the second condition will also be true. This can introduce hard to spot bugs, so I suggest that (before thinking about performance), you think about making the variable final if possible and use if/else when it makes sense (i.e. it should enter only one of the two branches) and chained if's when that makes sense (for example when the first if can establish a default value for the next one to use).
