In Message.CreateMessage, what is the meaning of the "action" parameter?

Here's the deal: public static Message CreateMessage( MessageVersion version, MessageFault fault, string action) action : A description of how the message should be processed. What do you guys put in there? " Handle with care!!! " or " FRAGILE "? Does it make any difference in the end?
