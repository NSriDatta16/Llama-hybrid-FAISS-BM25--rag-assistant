The DevExpress Winforms Scheduler isn't free - but looks like it would do pretty much everything you need. Using a component such as this (there are others) would most likely be less expensive for your organisation than creating one from scratch: plus I've found the DevExpress fellows to give top-notch support and help. Although their samples are oriented mostly towards C# and VB.NET, this would work just fine from Managed C++. As others have stated, avoid Access for data storage. If this is a single-user system you may want to consider simple XML, or if a relational database is required database engines such as MySQL or SQL Server would definitely be a better bet.
