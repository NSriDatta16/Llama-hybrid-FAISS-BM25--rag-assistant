There are suprisingly few books on this topic Here are some thoughts: Do not bother withn the Dragon Book unless you are actually writing a compiler using a table driven approach. It is a very hard read abd does not cover the simplest approach to parsing - recursive descent - in any detail. Caveat: I haven't read the leatest edition. If you actually want to write a compiler, take a look at "Brinch Hansen on Pascal Compilers ", which is an easy read and provides the full siource for a small pascal compiler. Don't let the pascal stuff put you off - the lessons it teaches are applicable to all compiled languages. When it comes to linking, there are very few resources. The best book I've read on the subject is Linkers & Loaders .
