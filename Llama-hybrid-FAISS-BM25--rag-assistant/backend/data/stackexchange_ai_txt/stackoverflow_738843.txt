newsequentialid is primarily to solve the issue of page fragmentation when your table is clustered by a uniqueidentifier. Your table is clustered by an integer column. I set up two test tables, one where the newsequentialid column is the primary key and one where it is not (like yours), and in the primary key the GUIDs were always sequential. In the other, they were not. I do not know the internals/technical reasons why it behaves that way, but it seems clear that newsequentialid() is only truly sequential when your table is clustered by it. Otherwise, it seems to behave similarly to newid() / RowGuid. Also, I'm curious as to why you would want to use newsequentialid() when you don't have to. It has many downsides which newid() does not, and none of the benefits - the biggest being that newid() is not practically predictable, whereas newsequentialid() is. If you are not worried about fragmentation, what's the point?
