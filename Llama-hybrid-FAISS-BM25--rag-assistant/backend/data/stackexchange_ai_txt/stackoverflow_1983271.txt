Strange behaviour of TableRow as a LinearLayout

I've noticed a strange thing with a TableRow. This code doesn't work properly as TextView text1 doesn't wrap it just stretches beyond the screen. I've managed to get it working by embedding this LinearLayout into RelativeLayout but it seems to be the least elegant solution plus I don't understand what's wrong with the code above...
