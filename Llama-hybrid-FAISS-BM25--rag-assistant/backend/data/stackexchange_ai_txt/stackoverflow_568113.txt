Once upon a time when the ARPAnet was still new and IP was still a germ of an idea, someone said "Oh, gee, a 32 bit IP address is plenty -- four billion addresses? No one will ever need that. Hell, we can split them up into different address types, there's plenty of room." Little did we know, 25 years later, that it would be an issue. And don't even talk to me about domain naming. The point is this: you need to think about what can change. Making this into a hierarchy of name spaces just for elegance's sake is unnecessary and wasteful, and when your extra layer doesn't provide any more information content, then why bother. On the other hand, if you're doing it to make your code less sensitive to changes in the problem, or to make the implementation noticeably easier or less error prone, then it might well be worth it. So there's your answer: is it just to be more elegant, or does it have other advantages?
