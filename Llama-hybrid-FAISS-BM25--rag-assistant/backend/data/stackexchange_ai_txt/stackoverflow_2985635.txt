const wchar_t *file = L"C:/x.bmp"; This is according to C++ Standard 2.13.4/1: A string literal that begins with L, such as L"asdf", is a wide string literal. A wide string literal has type “array of n const wchar_t” and has static storage duration, where n is the size of the string as defined below, and is initialized with the given characters. Note that you should use const qualifier here. The effect of attempting to modify a string literal is undefined (2.13.4/2).
