That's an interesting scientific problem and an interesting question. You wrote that $Y = a x^b$ , where $x$ is body mass and $Y$ is either metabolic rate or gill area. However, this has no noise term. I suspect you mean that equation holds with " $Y$ " replaced by its mean " $\mu$ ". Notice that \begin{align*} & \mu = a x^b \\ \leftrightarrow\, & \log \mu = \log a + b \log x, \end{align*} so that each line is equivalent. Therefore assuming the error is additive (iid) Gaussian, as indicated by your preference for using a linear model, we can fit this model using mod You can access standard errors and tests through the command summary(mod) . This model is appropriate for a given outcome, but not for both simultaneously. To handle both, you need to (vertically) stack the data, with an additional variable temp which determines the temperature. Then the following model will fit the bill: mod I encourage you to further consider the modeling assumptions. Are the errors really additive gaussian? Does the error distribution for each temperature really have the same variance? If not, the above should be updated.
