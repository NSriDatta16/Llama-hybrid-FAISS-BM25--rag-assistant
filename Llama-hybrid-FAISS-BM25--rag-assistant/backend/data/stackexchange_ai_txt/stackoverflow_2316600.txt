Actionscript duplicate variable definition

if(true) { var a:int = 1; } else { var a:int = 2; } In the above actionscript code I get duplicate variable definition error because "a" has been declared twice. But, doesn't "a" exist in two "different" scopes? Is there an elegant way of removing this warning, rather than pulling "a" out of both the scopes and moving it outside the if block? I need that alternate solution since it is in just too many places in a code which I have to refactor.
