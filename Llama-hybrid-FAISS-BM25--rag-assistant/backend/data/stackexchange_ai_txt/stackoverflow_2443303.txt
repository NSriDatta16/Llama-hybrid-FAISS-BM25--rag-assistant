I find that sometimes if in the leaks instrument you click the button that looks something like this: {= and drag your app delegate file onto the screen, it will lead you in the right direction by highlighting the code that allocated that leaked block. Every time it goes into a function call drag the source file with that function onto it. This can be hit and miss though as sometimes these mystery leaks aren't tracked back to the delegate.
