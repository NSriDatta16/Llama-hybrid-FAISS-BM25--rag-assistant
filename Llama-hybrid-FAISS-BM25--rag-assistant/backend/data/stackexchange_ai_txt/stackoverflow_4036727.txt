Use one NetStream object to feed two Video objects simultaneously

I'm trying to attach a single NetStream Object to two separate Video objects instead of pulling redundant streams from the server. The expected behavior would be for both Video's to display the same content. However, it seems that the last video I attach the NetStream to is the only Video that will display the content. Has anyone else run into this? I'd rather not go to the inelegant steps of using BitmapData to clone pixels if I don't have to. Thanks
