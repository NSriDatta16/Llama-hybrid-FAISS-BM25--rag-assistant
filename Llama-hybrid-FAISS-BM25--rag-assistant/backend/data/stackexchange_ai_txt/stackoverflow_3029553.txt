Rails / omitted from link_to?

I am using a Gem to communicate with FreeagentCentral via their API. I have the following code to display a link to the relevant freeagent project: The problem - There is a / omitted from the URL which makes the url like this: https://XXXXX.freeagentcentral.comprojects/12345 where it should be: https://XXXXX.freeagentcentral.com/projects/12345 This may be simple, but to me - it's driving me crazy! Thanks, Danny
