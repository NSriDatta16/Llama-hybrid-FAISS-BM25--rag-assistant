A Bayesian approach would be able to model "not sure" or decision uncertainty. The Bayesian approach to Random Forest is often called Bayesian forests . The goal is to generate a posterior distribution of trees, thus there is no splitting on "not sure". Move the "not sure" aspect to the decision after the forest has been estimated.
