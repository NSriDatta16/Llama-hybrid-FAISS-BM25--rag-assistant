The way I have done it in the past is a uibutton as a subview of uiscrollview. UIButton allows you to stretch an image across it similar to that of the SMS app, then you can also respond to the user selecting the text. To make the button appear like a balloon like the SMS app: [button setBackgroundImage:[[UIImage imageNamed:@"balloon_blue.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:9 topCapHeight:13] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; You could also use UIViews but you get a lot of nice things with UIButton like adding text with alignment, easy callbacks when pressed and different control states when selected with access to the text inside them. This can be handy when implementing copy and paste. You will have to calculate how long your text will be to determine the size of your button unfortunately but there should be examples on the net for that.
