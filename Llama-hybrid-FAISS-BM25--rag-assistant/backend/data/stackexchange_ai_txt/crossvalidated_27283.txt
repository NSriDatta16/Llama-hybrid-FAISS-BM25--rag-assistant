Binomial regression asymptotes

Binomial logistic regression has upper and lower asymptotes of 1 and 0 respectively. However, accuracy data (just as an example) may have upper and lower asymptotes vastly different to 1 and/or 0. I can see three potential solutions to this: Don't worry about it if you are getting good fits within the area of interest. If you aren't getting good fits then: Transform the data so that the minimum and maximum number of correct responses in the sample give proportions of 0 and 1 (instead of say 0 and 0.15). or Use non-linear regression so that you can either specify the asymptotes or have the fitter do it for you. It seems to me that options 1 & 2 would be preferred over option 3 largely for simplicity reasons, in which case option 3 is perhaps the better option because it can yield more information? edit Here's an example. Total possible correct for accuracy is 100, but the maximum accuracy in this case is ~ 15. accuracy Option 2 (as per comments and to clarify my meaning) would then be the model glmx2 Option 3 (for completeness) would be something akin to: fitnls
