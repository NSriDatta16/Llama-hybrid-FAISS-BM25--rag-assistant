Write as much as possible in a unit test framework in a high-productivity language such as Python. Python unit testing uses reflection to deduce things are tests and catches the normal asesrtions. All up, it requires very little effort to get started - I've used Python in this manner to work out networking protocols as well as wrap command-line XSLT transformations using Saxon jars. By playing with the fragments in a test-driven manner, you will keep your PoC app from becoming too entangled and you will set the basis for testing in the future implementation. Even when you're committed to a particular language for the main app, consider something more lightweight for any helpers, such as simple servers testing a network protocol.
