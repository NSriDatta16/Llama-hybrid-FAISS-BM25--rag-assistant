Measuring some rotations as a little more than 180 degrees and some as a little less shouldn't be a problem in itself. I suspect the real problem lies in how you're combining these rotations from "different parts of the shape". For instance, if you are averaging the rotations then this will give absolutely crazy results. Here are three approaches you can take. (1) Compute a "typical rotation" figure in some way that isn't bothered by the discrepancy: for instance, just pick one of the rotations at random. (If it's possible for a few of them to be badly wrong, there are more robust things you can do.) Now adjust all your rotations so that the "typical" one goes to zero: for (i=0; i 180) rotations[i] -= 360; } Now average these (or do whatever sort of thing you're doing with them), and then correct by doing the same operation in reverse. (2) As for (1), but either use the rotations as they stand or adjust them all by 180deg before and after processing. Choose which to do by, for instance, counting rotations between -90 and +90 and seeing whether they're more or less than half of all your rotations. (3) Instead of averaging rotation angles, for each angle compute (cos theta, sin theta) and average those . Then use atan2 to convert the average back into an angle. (The idea is that angles are "really" points on a circle, so it's better to work with these points rather than with the angles. When you do this, the ambiguity between -180 and +180 degrees just goes away.) If what you're doing really is averaging, my favourite of these is 3. Your mileage may vary.
