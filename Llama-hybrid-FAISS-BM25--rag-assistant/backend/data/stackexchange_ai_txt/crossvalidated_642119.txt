Given that this is a screening assay where any apparent positive results will be tested in new (presumably larger) experiment, there may be no need to perform a statistical test. Any test that you do use is likely to have low power given the small number replicates and so you would quite likely erroneously discard many of the candidate strains. Given that you will have more data about the control than the test wells, consider calling a putative positive any supernatant that gives an average maximum or lambda that is more than a standard deviation or so different from the controls. If that gives too many putative positives then increase the threshold accordingly. It is important to have control wells on every plate, and ideally you would have the well locations randomised. "Biological replicates" are going to be essential in the follow-up experiments if you wish to make inferences that extrapolate beyond the single plate being tested, but for the preliminary screen they may be an inefficient use of resources.
