Trend in residual plot

I have a regression problem: I have to predict for how long (in days) a house will stay in the market before that someone will buy it. To predict how many days the house stays in the market I am fitting an xgboost to the data that I have, and testing my output on an unseen dataset. My residual plot looks like this Clearly a trend is visible (the difference between the real and the prediction gets bigger as the house stays more in the market). I also plotted the RMSE for the houses sold each day Also here you can see that the error increases the more a house stays in the market. RMSE:50.69616116149248 days RMSE (for houses that stay in the market RMSE (for houses that stay in the market >= 42 days):108.39701898105788 days In the following graph you can see the predictions vs actual value In the dataset there are a lot of houses that stay in the market for few days... I think that from the graphs I can deduct that there is something wrong.... Could you help me interpreting and finding the way to improve my results?
