Magento: turn off cache for session messages/errors?

Is there a way to turn off the page cache in magento for some page areas? We're triggering custom session message on one of our product pages, but since the page cache is on, we never see it till we hit an uncached page (say, checkout). Is there any sort of 'no cache' block for magento? thx
