Mixed-effect logistic regression in R, Error: no random effect specified

In a study per-field disease incidences were collected by sampling 35 plants in each field and counting proportion of infected ones (# of infected/total sampled). In result, each sampling location corresponds to a value between 0 and 1. I have about 100 locations in total, each sampled in the same way. I have then a column representing two groups of growers knowledge. There are people who have a knowledge and I have a set of disease incidences in their field and I have a group of people who have no knowledge and I have a set of incidence scores in their fields. Data structure is following infnumber = c(7,17,26,12,....etc) totalplants = c(35,35,35,35,....) incidence = c(0.19, 0.50, 0.75, 0.34, ....) knowledge = c("yes","no","yes","yes",....) I would like to use mixed-effect logistic regression model in R with the followig structure: $Y_i$ is the number of infected plants in field $i$ . The model is: $$Y_i \sim Binomial(35,\pi_i)$$ $$\mathrm{logit}(\pi_i)=\log(\frac {\pi_i}{1-\pi_i})=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +\gamma_i$$ where $X_i =1$ if grower on the $i$ -th field is have a knowledge, = 0 for otherwise. $\gamma_i$ is random intercept for field $i$ to account for possible over-dispersion. $\beta_1$ is log odds ratio between knowledge vs no knowledge. The mean proportion of infected is $\frac{\exp(\beta_0)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0)}$ for no knowledge grower, and $\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)} $ for knowledge grower. Which one of the following is a proper way to do it? Or maybe even other solution? m This post is a follow up to my previous question
