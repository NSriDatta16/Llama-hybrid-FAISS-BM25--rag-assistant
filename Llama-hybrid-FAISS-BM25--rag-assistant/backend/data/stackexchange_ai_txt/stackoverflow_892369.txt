How can I display a tooltip showing the value of a trackbar in WinForms

I'm new to C# and WinForms so please excuse me is this is a bit of a newbie question. I'm trying to add a tooltip to my TrackBar control which shows the current value of the bar as you drag it. I've instantiated a ToolTip object and tried the following handler code but it doesn't show any tooltip: private void trackBar1_Scroll(object sender, EventArgs e) { toolTip1.SetToolTip(trackBar1, trackBar1.Value.ToString()); }
