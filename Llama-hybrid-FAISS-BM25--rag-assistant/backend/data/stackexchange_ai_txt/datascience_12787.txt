I skimmed over a paper recently that aims to use Neural Networks as Poisson regression. The method they propose is basically a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron where they use a different loss function, namely: $$E = -\sum_{n=1}^N[-t_n + y_nlog(t_n)]$$ This is a version without regularization to prevent the overfitting, they use regular weight decay. They mention that they wrote it in R and Matlab but I don't have a clue if it's available online somewhere, but any neural network package where you can pass your own loss function should suffice. http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~hgu/Neural%20Comput%20&%20Applic.pdf
