The solution can be read here: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html in the last paragraph: The click() method allows you to simulate a click on a form field. Checkboxes get toggled, radios selected, and so on. Unfortunately Mozilla and Opera haven't added this method to file upload fields. I wonder why, adding it is not really a security risk since the worst that can happen is that the file selection window pops up.
