Do you essentially attach the generator's outputs to the discriminator's inputs ?>and then treat the entire thing like one giant network where the weights in the >discriminator portion are constant? Shortly: Yes.(I dug some of the GAN's sources to double check this) There are also a lot of more into GAN training like: should we update D and G every time or D on odd iterations and G on even, and a lot more. There is also a very nice paper about this topic: "Improved Techniques for Training GANs" Tim Salimans, Ian Goodfellow, Wojciech Zaremba, Vicki Cheung, Alec Radford, Xi Chen https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498
