Python version and performance in ML

I couldn't find any answer on that question, but does Python version really matter when you implement different ML models (like catboost or xgboost) or NN (like pytorch). I do know that these models were written on C++ and other programming languages and my question may sound quite trivial, but does it really matter to upgrade Python version to increase performance and use less Memory
