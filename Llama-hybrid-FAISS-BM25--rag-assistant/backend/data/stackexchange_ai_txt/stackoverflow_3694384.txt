Better GUI classes organization?

I am currently trying to program in Scala but I guess this can generally applies to other programming as well? In Swing, we generally organize our code and logic in a single class (perhaps our Frame or Panel). What I have learnt in the pass has always been dealing with a class as well. I am wondering if there is any medium size (not too large and complicated) project to view on? How do we actually organize our code such as from login to view tables, update tables, so other tasks? Do we normally create a lot of frame, which seem to be what I learnt from Visual Basic? Or just a lot of panels, and have a frame to hold these frame? If it is second case, how would I actually pass down information from one panel to another as they are not actually directly related except through the frame. Any guide on this organization?
