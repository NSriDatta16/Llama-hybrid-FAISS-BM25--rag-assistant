Oie, Agamemon! I would encourage you to try a different structure. For instance, three tables, as opposed to a single table. First, your users table which represents everybody on your site. Second, a modules table which represents all possible modules. This way you can add more in the future without having to add columns to the user table, etc. And lastly we bring them together into a relationship with the usersmodule table, which shows what modules belong to each particular user. I hope this gives you some direction. table:users userid username ... table:modules moduleid modulename ... table:usermodules userid moduleid ...
