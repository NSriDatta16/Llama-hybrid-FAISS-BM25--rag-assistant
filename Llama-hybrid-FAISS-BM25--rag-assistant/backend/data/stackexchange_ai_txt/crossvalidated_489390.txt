Multiple Regression and variable optimization

I'm seeking a means to find the optimal values for a set of variables in MLR. I've seen other posts which suggest using Linear Optimization. I have already fit a model and have the coefficients. Now, my goal is in order to achieve a specific DV value of Y, what is the best way to calibrate (select the optimal values) of each of the IV values? One might suggest to just increase the value of all IVs, but this comes at a cost. Hence the thought to use linear optimization. EDIT: Let's say this is a marketing problem and let's say I have built a model that predicts a proprietary sentiment score from a set of IVs, including things like spend on advertising, number of advertisements, number of local markets in which to advertise, etc. - all continuous variables (no categorical). I have a data set consisting of 5000 data points collected over a period of time. (let's ignore any time series aspect for the time being). The MLR model says that each variable in the model is statistically significant, and I have beta weights / SE for each. for the sake of argument, let's say the model looks like this: y^ = C + .876 B1 + .435 B2 + 1.23*B3, where: B1 = advertising spend B2 = num. advertisements B3 = num. local markets Now, I want to know what is the optimal value of each variable (B1, B2, B3), such that is maximizes the sentiment score (Y^). It's not enough to know that the variables are statistically significant predictors, and one cannot simply just maximize all of them - because there is a cost to doing so, and funds are not unlimited. Logically, one could just take the variable with the largest coefficient and "maximize that"; but in the real world, that's not how things are done - especially in marketing/advertising. I'm seeking options from what others have done to solve these kinds of problems. I'm using Python for everything... No code to share yet, just thinking through options. If anyone has ideas to share or suggestions, I would appreciate it.
