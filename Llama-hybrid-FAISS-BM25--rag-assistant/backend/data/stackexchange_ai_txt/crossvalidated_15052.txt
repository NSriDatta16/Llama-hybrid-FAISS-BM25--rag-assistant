Bayesian AB testing

I am running an AB Test on a page that receives only 5k visits per month. It would take too long to reach traffic levels necessary to measure a +-1% difference between the test and control. I have heard that I can use Bayesian stats to give me a good chance of determining whether the test outperformed. How can I do use Bayesian stats to analyze my current data?
