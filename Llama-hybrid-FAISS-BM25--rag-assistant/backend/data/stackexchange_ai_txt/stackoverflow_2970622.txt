NserviceBus I don't think will really help you in this situation. I would go with WCF hosted in a robust environment. Could be Azure, but doesn't need to be. Most Importantly though, I think it's all about providing an efficient and intelligent OFFLINE strategy, so your app can still work if services fail. So that would involve efficient syncing and local storage. For Syncing, check out the MS Sync Framework . Not sure it will work on WP7 yet, but may do at release.
