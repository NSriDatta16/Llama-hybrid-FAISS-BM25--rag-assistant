Distribution of the top $m$ of $n$ samples of a Gaussian distribution?

I was wondering if there was an analytic description of the distribution of the largest $m$ of $n$ samples of a Gaussian distribution, where $n \geq m$ . (As an example, I generated 100 samples from $\mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$ . The average of the top 100 samples came to $0.0404$ , the average of the top 50 samples came to $0.832$ , the average of the top 10 samples came to $1.842$ , and the top 1 sample was 2.88.) Intuitively, as $n$ increases and $m$ stays constant, or $m$ decreases and $n$ stays constant, the expected value increases. It's like taking the top $m$ applicants. Is there a name or analytic description of such a distribution? (I haven't been able to figure out how to do this, and I spent a lot of time searching. This seems like a simple / common problem and I'm surprised I haven't found anything on it.) EDIT: After the comments below, I as able to find a good answer here: Approximate order statistics for normal random variables
