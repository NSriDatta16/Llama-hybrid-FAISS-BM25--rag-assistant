Difference between scaling just x or x and y in PCA / principle component regresseion

Before doing principle component regression it is important to scale the data. But which data exactly? Is it enough if I just scale X or do I have to scale the whole data set, containing X and Y (=regressor and regressand)? The advantage of scaling just X is, that I do not have to backtransform Y. But is this valid? Whats the difference between scaling just X and scaling the whole data set?
