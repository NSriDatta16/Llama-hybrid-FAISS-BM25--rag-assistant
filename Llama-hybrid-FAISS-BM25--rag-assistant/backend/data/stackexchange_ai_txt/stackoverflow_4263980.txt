good in training and bad in prediction

I've written a code for prediction in neural network... the error in training is good ( below 1 %) but for prediction the error is high ( about 20 %)...I think my network is over trained but i don't know a way to solve this problem...I've changed number of layers,number of neurons and training function but the result has not changed... so I put my code in this forum and hope to get an answer for it: link text this zip file contains 2 files: 1-an Excel file for datas : lines 1-4 for training input, line 5 for training output (line 6 is output but didn't use in this code), line 7-10 for testing input, line 11 for testing output. 2-matlab code after running the program 4 chart appear: first row is for trained data and second row for tested datas. if somebody knows the answer, please change my code and put it again. thanks a lot. EDIT: more description: I have 2 output and two code for each...for line 6 ( second output) this code has acceptable results but for line 5 no good result... please change my code and apply your suggestions on it and put it here if you think that your suggestion is useful...I have received some suggestions in other forums that are general solutions with no influence on results...
