It depends on the kind of noise you want to add. Here's an example: x Here's a plot of corrupted values against the original ones: You should substitute your own vector and the kind of noise. Edit: I've just seen your response to my question. To get a random value from 0 to 9, you use sample like so: noise and because you're replacing rather than adding, you then do: x[corrupt] Giving this on the same data as before, and with the same values replaced: If you wanted to replace a precise number of values (exactly 100 of 1000 values say, rather than an average of 100), you could sample to choose from a set of indices indicating which values to replace.
