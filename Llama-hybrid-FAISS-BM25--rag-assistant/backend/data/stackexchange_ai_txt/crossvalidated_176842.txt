Final Step: Prediction new values using model

I'm about to finish up a machine learning challenge, but I'm suck on the final part. Before running my model I did a simple power transformation ( $dependent ~variable^{1/4}$ ) on the dependent variable in the training set to make it look more like a standard normal distribution. Do I do the inverse transformation ( $predicted~scores^4$ ) to my prediction scores (my test set does not have the dependent variable)? I had negative values in my original dependent variable in my training set, will I not be able to predict these?
