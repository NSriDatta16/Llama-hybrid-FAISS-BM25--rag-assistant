Sorry for jumping into the discussion but I do not think 250KB is a huge bitstream in any way! I use a very small FPGA of 3500 Logic slices and it gives me a bitstream of 3MB. One important thing to consider here. If you are trying to initialize any of your RAMs then the bitstream is going to carry extra bits which are initialization bits of the BRAM Blocks in the FPGA. that can just add additional memory to the bitstream. But on an average, it is the whole FPGA matrix that is getting written with the bits stored in the Offchip/OnChip Flash where the bitfile is stored, So it should not change from run to run.
