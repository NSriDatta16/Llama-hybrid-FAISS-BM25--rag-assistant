Loop over Tokens in RapidMiner's Text Processing Plugin

is there any possibility to iterate over the tokens of a text document within RapidMiner? My first try was to window the document after tokenisation. But this seems very complicated. I'm doing this to simulate the creation of a language model like Katz Backoff and so on. Maybe there is a better way to produce language models but in the moment i can only think of iterating the tokens and calculate the values and store them into an example set. Thank you Andreas
