GWT "database" (client-side)

I'm looking for something like a database for GWT objects (inside the browser). It must work without HTML5 or Gears (or any browser plugins). It doesn't have to be capable of everything a database can do, but the most important features would be automated indexing , on multiple columns some kind of API or language to perform (a limited subset of) queries It could be a bit similar to Taffy DB , but it must have automated indexing, and it should provide a GWT API. I hope, it would be even smaller in download size than Taffy, if it re-uses code from the GWT library. (Maybe I should add, that I don't need permanent storage. It's ok, if the data has to be reloaded/regenerated when the user hits reload.)
