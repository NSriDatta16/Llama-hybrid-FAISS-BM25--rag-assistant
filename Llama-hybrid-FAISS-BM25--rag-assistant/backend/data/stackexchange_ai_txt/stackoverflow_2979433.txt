In an Android TextView, is it possible to insert paragraphs?

Below is an example of the type of problem that I have. I have data in a pojo that I need to display in a textview... the data has pseudo code that denotes each paragraph with [p] I would like to somehow parse the [p]'s into paragraphs when they are displayed in the textview. Can this be done? Is there something I can substitute for the [p] that will make a new paragraph in the textview? Question question = new Question(); question.setText("Here is the first paragraph.[p] And this should be the second."); TextView view = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.qtext); view.setText(question.getParsedText());
