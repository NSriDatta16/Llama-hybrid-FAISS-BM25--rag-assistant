Sticking to your example, here's an intuitive way to understand the linearity of expectation (at least to me): Consider the $i$ th-consecutive pair in the sequence of 9 cards of two different colors, 4 red and 5 black (see image below) and denote by $X_i$ the event that this pair consists of two cards of the same color, the expectation of $X_i$ by $\mathbf{E}[X_i]$ , and also: $$ X_i= \begin{cases} 1\text{ if i(th)-card and (i+1)th-card have the same color},\\ 0\text{ otherwise}. \end{cases} $$ The linearity of expectation says: $$ \mathbf{E}[X_1+...+X_n]=\mathbf{E}[X_1] +...+ \mathbf{E}[X_n], \hspace{2em}n= 8\ \text{ in this case}.\tag{1}\label{eq:eq1} $$ Intuitively, the expectation of $X_i$ can be interpreted as the proportion of times the event $i$ th-pair consisting of two cards with the same color happens when we perform a random assignment of 9 cards into 9 places (in the sequence) $N$ times ( $N\gg 0$ ). Notice that this proportion is at most 1 and equal to the probability of $X_i$ (in the frequentist interpretation) and this can be shown to be true for all indicator random variable. Summing up over all the expectations of $X_i, i=1,...,n$ , we end up at the quantity on the right-hand side of the equation \eqref{eq:eq1} and it's the proportion of times that all the (consecutive) pairs in the sequence having two cards of the same color after performing $N$ times of random assignments. Since $N$ is large, this proportion can be interpreted as the expected (or average) number of all pairs in the sequence consisting of both cards with the same color. This is denoted by the quantity $\mathbf{E}[X_1+...+X_n]$ that appears on left-hand side of the above equation. So, this explains why \eqref{eq:eq1} holds. For detailed calculation, Sextus Empiricus has provided a thorough answer.
