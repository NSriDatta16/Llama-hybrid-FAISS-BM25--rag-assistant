Automatically deleting objects older than n days in Amazon S3 (How ?)

I am storing many images in Amazon S3, using a ruby lib ( http://amazon.rubyforge.org/ ) I don't care the photos older than 1 week, then to free the space in S3 I have to delete those photos. I know there is a method to delete the object in a certain bucket: S3Object.delete 'photo-1.jpg', 'photos' Is there a way to automatically delete the image older than a week ? If it does Not exist, I'll have to write a daemon to do that :-( Thank you UPDATE: now it is possible, check the Roberto's answer.
