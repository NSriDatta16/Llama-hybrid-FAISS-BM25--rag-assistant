The approach you take depends on how different the subdomain is from the main site. If they are very similar and will be using the same codebase: $config['base_url'] = 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/'; If you need some settings to be different on a different subdomain, you could create a config file like so: switch($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']){ case 'www.example.com': // settings specific to www subdomain $config['foo'] = 'bar'; break; case 'apl.example.com': // settings specific to apl subdomain $config['foo'] = 'baz'; break; } Another approach would include setting up a separate application folder for the subdomain, but pointing at the same system folder. If you organize your filesystem like this: example.com common system application www htdocs application apl htdocs application You could then point the index.php file in each htdocs folder at the common/system directory. You could also put code you want to share between all subdomains in common/application and include them from your code.
