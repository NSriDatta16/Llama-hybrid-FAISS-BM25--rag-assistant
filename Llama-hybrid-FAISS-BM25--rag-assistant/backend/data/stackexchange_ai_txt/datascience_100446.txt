Non-Classification outputs in a classification problem

maybe this is a very stupid question, so please excuse me as I am a total beginner in Machine learning. I have a dataset divided into X (shape: 10000, 599), Y(shape: 10000,). Y is simply zero or one. I am getting good accuracy and validation accuracy for my model. However when I am predicting Y using testX, I am getting all kinds of values between zero and 1. Most are very close to zero or one. But still, this is not exactly a classification output, is it? Or am I doing something wrong? My model: # create model model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(60,input_dim = trainX.shape[1], activation = 'relu')) model.add(Dense(30,activation = 'relu')) model.add(Dense(1,activation = 'sigmoid')) # Compile model model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics = 'accuracy') history = model.fit(trainX,trainY, epochs = 200,batch_size = 128, validation_data = (valX,valY))
