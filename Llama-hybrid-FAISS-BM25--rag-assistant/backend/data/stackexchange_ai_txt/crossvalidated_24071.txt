It would be wise to study proper scoring rules, which will score continuous risk predictions. Also, make sure you want to do (expensive) leave-out-one cv instead of bootstrap or averaging multiple runs of 10-fold cv. Take a look at the following functions in the R rms package: lrm , validate.lrm , calibrate.lrm , val.prob (the latter is for external validation but provides a larger set of accuracy scores).
