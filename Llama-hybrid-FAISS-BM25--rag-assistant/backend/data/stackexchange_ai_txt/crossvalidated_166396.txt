Here is where you'll run into a lot of problems. The set of all functions $f : R \to R$ is very, very large and in no way countable (I don't even believe it's measurable). What you can settle for is a something like a mixing of activation functions: $$f(x, p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) = p_1 f_1(x) + p_2 f_2(x) + ... + p_n f_n(x)$$ $f_i$ are specific activation functions which all share a domain and range and $p_i$ are scalar values. This will not give you all functions, but then you might be able to aggregate your average over all p.
