The reason its failing is explained by your statement: and I'm not sure why 1) you've cited a fragment of the code used to generate the query - but we need to see the query which gets sent to the database and the structure of the table 2) we also need to see the error message that is returned after the query fails. 3) since you are using $_REQUEST, we also need to see your variables_order setting for both PHP installations to determine how $_REQUEST is populated I expect once you find the answers to these the solution will be obvious. But it's also worth noting that splicing user supplied data into an SQL query is a very bad idea - you're wide open to SQL injection attacks.
