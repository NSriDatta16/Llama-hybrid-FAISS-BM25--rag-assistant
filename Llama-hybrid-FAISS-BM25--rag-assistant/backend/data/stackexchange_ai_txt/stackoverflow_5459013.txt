The problem is that you are trying to use FileStream to access a resource that is embedded in your application's XAP file. FileStream is used for accessing the file system (e.g. isolated storage). To access a text file that is a resource in your XAP file, you can use the following code: string text; Uri uri = new Uri("("/AssembyName;component/DataMid/Bigram_MidWord.txt", UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute); StreamResourceInfo sri = App.GetResourceStream(uri); StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(sri.Stream); text= sr.ReadToEnd(); sr.Close();
