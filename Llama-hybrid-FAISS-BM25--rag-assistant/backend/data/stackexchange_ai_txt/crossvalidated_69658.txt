Testing if low-variance components in PCA contain any "signal"

My problem is similar to this one but I am looking for a different solution: (so if it should be merged just let me know). Measuring what's 'lost' in PCA dimensionality reduction? I my application we have a correlation matrix of dimension 30 upon which we conduct a PCA analysis and retain the first three eigenvectors on the basis that they typically contain 90+% of the variation. However this has always struck me as a little arbitrary, I would like to test whether these smaller eigenvectors do actually contain a "signal" rather than white noise. I suppose one very simple method would be to split the data up and see if these smaller eignevectors maintain a similar shape, but I would like to find a more scientifically robust way to test this hypothesis.
