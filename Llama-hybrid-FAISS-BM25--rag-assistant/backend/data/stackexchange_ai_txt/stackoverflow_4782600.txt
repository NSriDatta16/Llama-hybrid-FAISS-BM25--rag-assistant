How to apply XSLT transformation in LiveCycle form

I have a LiveCycle form where I am embedding a sample XML. I want to know hoe to map the field values to the sample XML so that when the user clicks on the submit as XML button the submitted XML should carry the values bound within the form field tags. Thanks. Bibhu.
