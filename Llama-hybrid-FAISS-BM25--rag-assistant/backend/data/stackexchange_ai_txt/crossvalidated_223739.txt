You are correct, adding Laplace noise means that to your variable $X$ you add variable $Y$ that follows Laplace distribution . There are multiple reasons why it is called noise . First, think of signal processing, where message is send over some channel and due to imperfect nature of the channel the received signal is noisy, so you have to isolate signal from the noise. Second, in cryptography we also talk about pseudorandom noise and differential privacy is related to cryptography. Third, in statistics and machine learning we also can talk about statistical noise , statistical models include noise or error terms etc. (there is even a book about forecasting names Signal and the noise by Nate Silver). So we use noise as a more precise synonym for ambiguous randomness . As about random generation, there is a number of ways how you can draw random values following Laplace distribution, for example: The inverse transform method described on Wikipedia: f If $U$ and $V$ are independent random variables following exponential distribution, then $Y = U-V$ follows Laplace distribution : g If $Y$ follows Laplace distribution, then $|Y|$ follows exponential distribution , so: h On the plots below you can see distribution of $10^{5}$ samples drawn using each of the functions with accompanying Laplace density (red line). To simplify the examples I use standard Laplace distribution with scale = 1, but you can easily change the outcomes by multiplying the results using different scaling factor.
