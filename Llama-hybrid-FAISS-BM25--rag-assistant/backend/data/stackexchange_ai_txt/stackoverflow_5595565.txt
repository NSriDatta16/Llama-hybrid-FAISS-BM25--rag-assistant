I installed PHPUnit on MAMP without PEAR, I think it works. Here's how: Chances are, you have git installed already. If not, http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/ Follow the instructions on this github page: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/ - copying from that page (8 April 2010): mkdir phpunit && cd phpunit git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/dbunit.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-file-iterator.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-text-template.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-token-stream.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-timer.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-mock-objects.git git clone git://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-selenium.git Copy and paste that to terminal. That should give you a phpunit folder with phpunit and all the dependencies inside. The next instruction is to copy all the folders into your php include_path . Find out where your include_path is in your php.ini file. You're using MAMP, so it should be something like /Applications/MAMP/conf/php5.3/php.ini . Usually the include_path for MAMP is this: include_path = ".:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5.3/lib/php" However you cannot just copy and paste the folder, you have to tediously figure out which folder to copy. You can know this by reading the package.xml file of each folder. Start with phpunit : ... ... ... So you copy the the PHPUnit folder, LICENSE , README.markdown , phpunit.php , phpunit.bat to your include_path . After this, move to dbunit folder, php-file-iterator folder, and so on and so forth. It's a bit tedious. Make sure you DON'T REPLACE ANY FOLDER, OSX really replaces each folder (instead of merging like any sane person would), so if the folder already exists, it copy only the new folder/files. You should be able to figure out which folder to copy easily by a bit of logic. After this, copy phpunit.php to any folder, then edit the first line: #!/usr/bin/env php to: #!/usr/bin/env /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5.3/bin/php Change the permission of phpunit.php so that we can execute it: chmod 744 phpunit.php You should be able to run it like this: ./path/to/phpunit.php testCase.php Hope this helps. If you wanted to upgrade PEAR or learn something about it's quirkiness when used in MAMP OSX, there's a good discussion here: https://serverfault.com/questions/184741/upgrading-pear-from-1-9-0-to-1-9-1-fails Old discussion on installing PHPUnit without PEAR: How do you install PHPUnit without using PEAR on Mac OS X 10.5?
