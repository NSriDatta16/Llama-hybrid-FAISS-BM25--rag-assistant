Spectral analysis how coefficient are aj and bj are found?

I'm reading chapter 4 on spectral analysis from the "Time series analysis and its application", and I hit a bit of a confussion when it comes to how coefficients $a_j$ and $b_j$ are found. It said that it uses regression results from previous chapter to imply that its from the form $\sum_{t=1}^{n} x_tz_{tj}/\sum_{t=1}^{n} z_{tj}^2$ Would be great if someone can explain the reason behind this section.
