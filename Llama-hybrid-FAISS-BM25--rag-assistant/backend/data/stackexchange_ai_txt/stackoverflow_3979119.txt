UITableView scroll smooth with certain speed?

I'm building a custom slot machine with a column that exists of a uitableview. When the user pulls a lever the tableview should scroll to a certain position with an index. I used the method: - scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated: But this method will make the table scroll with a constant duration. So you will not really recognize a long or short spin. I'm looking for a way to: A) Slow down the scroll animation. Or, B) Change the duration for the scroll animation to a self defined value. The normal scroll animation (with the finger) does show this effect. Maybe it is a stupid idea, but is it an idea to invoke a touchesBegan and touchesDidEnd method on my tableView? Thanks already
