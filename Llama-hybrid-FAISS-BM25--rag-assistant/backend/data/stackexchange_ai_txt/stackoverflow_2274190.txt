Why "Source > Organize Imports" does not work in Eclipse?

I am writning a Hello World SWT application in Eclipse (I follow instructions given by Eclipse). At some point I have to "Right click in the Java editor and select Source > Organize Imports". I did it in Eclipse installed on Ubuntu. This operation has generated import statements in the beginning of my code. But it was not sufficient to make my program to work. I needed to add some import statements by hands and after that my code worked fine. Now I am trying to do the same in Eclipse installed on Windows. In this case the situation is even worser. "Source > Organize Imports" does not change anything (it does not add any import statements to the beginning of the code). Does anybody has any ideas why it does not work properly?
