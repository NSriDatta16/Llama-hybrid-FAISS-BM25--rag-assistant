java.lang.AbstractMethodError This means that an abstract method which is declared in the API in the current classpath lacks in the concrete implementation in the current classpath. org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl.setFeature(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V This is introduced since Java SE 5.0 . Thus, this exception suggests that the API in the current classpath is at least Java SE 5.0 and the concrete implementation is incompatible with that. Xalan 2.7.0 was the first version to implement it. Thus, you've an older-versioned Xalan version somewhere in the classpath. If you cannot seem to locate it in the forest called classpath, I'd suggest to scan the disk file system locations which are covered by the classpath with a search tool which can search inside ZIP (JAR) files. I myself use WinRAR for this. Just associate the tool with JAR files and search for files matching filename TransformerFactoryImpl.class (if necessary including the path which represents the package). The results should contain information about the JAR file where it is found in.
