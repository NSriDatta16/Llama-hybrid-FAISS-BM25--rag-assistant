How does the Neural Network model is developed using lead times in forecast?

In most Neural Network (NN) forecasting studies on Sea Surface Temperature, they stated that they create different models for different lead times of 3,6,9, or 12 months. I still can not understand how is this done. And I need explanation of what does it mean b lead times and exactly how do we use it in the NN model.
