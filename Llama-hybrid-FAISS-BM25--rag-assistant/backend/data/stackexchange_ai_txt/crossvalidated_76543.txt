Why do PCA and Factor Analysis return different results in this example?

The following question is about an Exercise 14.15 from "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Friedman and Tibshirani. Generate $200$ observations of three variates $X_1, X_2 , X_3$ according to \begin{align}X_1 &= Z_1 \\ X_2 &= X_1 + 0.001 \cdot Z_2 \\ X_3 &= 10 \cdot Z_3 \end{align} where $ Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 $ are independent standard normal variables. Compute the leading principal component and factor analysis directions. Hence show that the leading principal component aligns itself in the maximal variance direction $X_3$, while the leading factor essentially ignores the uncorrelated component $X_3$, and picks up the correlated component $X_2 + X_1$ (Geoffrey Hinton, personal communication). Why? I thought that they are both "powered by" the same matrix decomposition? What have I missed?
