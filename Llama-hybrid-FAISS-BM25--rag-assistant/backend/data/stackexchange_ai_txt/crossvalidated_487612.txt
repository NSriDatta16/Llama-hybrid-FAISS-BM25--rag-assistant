Unit root connection with stationarity of time series

Let's take the equation below : $$y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$ Now if : (1) $\beta_1=1 \Rightarrow$ our time series contains unit root. It means that our time series $(y_t)$ is not stationary. (2) $\beta_1 our time series does not contain unit root, we can consider it as stationary. I have two question about it : (1) Is this true what I wrote in points (1) and (2) ? If yes, can you please share a mathematical proof of those facts ? (2) I've never read what happens when $\beta_1>1$ . I assume that we are even further from stationarity than in $\beta_1=1$ case. Am I right ?
