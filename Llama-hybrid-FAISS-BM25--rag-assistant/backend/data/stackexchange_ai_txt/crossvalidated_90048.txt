Separating Base and Promotional Volume

I am working on a project where I have to separate base and promotional volume from the sales data. I have sales data for the last 4 years at week level. How can I separate base and promotional volume from only this much data? Is it possible to do by regression or any time series approach? I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks.
