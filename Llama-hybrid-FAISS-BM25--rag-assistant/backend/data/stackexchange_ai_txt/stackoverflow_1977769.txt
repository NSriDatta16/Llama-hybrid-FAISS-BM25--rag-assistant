How do toolbars like the Meebo Bar work?

Meebo's new 'bar' service puts a floating bar with links and chat functions at the bottom of any given webpage with just a dash of Javascript and HTML. I'd like to build something like it, but I'm flummoxed as to how they got around the same origin issues. It looks like they're injecting an iframe and some script tags, but how they accomplish the rest of the functionality without a proxy is beyond me. Any ideas? You can check out Meebo's service http://bar.meebo.com/ there and Robert Scoble seems to have it setup over on http://scobleizer.com . NB: I don't mean to be a shill for either Meebo or Scoble, I'm just curious about the implementation.
