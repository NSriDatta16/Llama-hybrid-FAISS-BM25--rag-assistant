Since your outcome is categorical, I think that this case calls for a logistic regression . Since your predictors are also categorical, as far as I know, they should be coded, using dummy variables . See more details on dummy coding (in R ) on this page and on logistic regression on this website . Now, a couple of notes about performing logistic regression, using different statistical languages and environments. Since logistic regression is a part of generalized linear models (GLM) family, if you use R , you can use glm() function for the analysis: http://data.princeton.edu/R/glms.html . If you use SAS, you can use LOGISTIC procedure . If you use SPSS, this tutorial might be helpful.
