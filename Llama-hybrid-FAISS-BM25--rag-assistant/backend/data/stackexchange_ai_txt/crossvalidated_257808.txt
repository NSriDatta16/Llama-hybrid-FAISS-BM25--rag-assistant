Your second method, using complete(imp, "long") is what you need to do. You've probably read the Mitra & Reiter paper distinguishing between the "Within" and "Across" methods, since you mentioned wanting to average propensity scores. With imputed outcome data, you need to use the "Within" approach, and then combine and adjust your estimates using Rubin's rules. So, for each imputed data set, you will do the following: run matchit() , and then run your outcome regression model on the matched data set. Once you have done this for each imputed data set, you will recombine the model fits using as.mira() and then summarize your mira output. Here is some sample code: imp.data $.imp))), unique(imp.data$ .imp)) for (i in unique(imp.data2 $.imp)) { m.out .imp == i,]) fit.list[[i]] Hope this helps!
