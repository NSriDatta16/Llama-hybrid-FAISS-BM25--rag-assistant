Dependency Properties took a while. Here's a nice article , and another that helped me with this new concept. The second article contained the following paragraph that really clarified a few questions I had. A key value of the Dependency Properties system was the ability to build properties that automatically notify any registered interested party each time the value of the property changes. This free, painless and automatic implementation of the observer pattern is tremendously powerful and greatly reduces the burden on the client programmer (in fact, the data-binding system depends on it!). More generally, I have also found that prior experience with web development (browser UI in particular) to be very useful in "getting" WPF. It is more about the mindset it allows you to bring to WPF, compared with someone who has only ever worked with Windows Forms or other rich client applications. Some more obvious parallels from the web world are CSS, flowing layouts, jQuery animation, event bubbling/routing and just being comfortable with the extensive browser and DHTML object models.
