Limits of generative models

If I was to train a pixel rnn, by concatenating images with noise vectors, I should be able to get new images from that distribution by starting on the prediction with a new noise vector. Would it be possible to use medication packet leaflets instead of images or as the images, and generate new drugs complete with description this way? If so, how big a dataset would be required and if not, what are the limitations to this approach?
