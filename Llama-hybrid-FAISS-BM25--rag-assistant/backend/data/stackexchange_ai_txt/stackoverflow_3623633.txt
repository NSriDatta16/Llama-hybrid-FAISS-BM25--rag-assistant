Boost Thread ID Invalid

i have bunch of question regarding to boost thread ? How to initialize the boost thread ID with the thread constructor? Why the thread id becomes invalid after called join() function ? As usual, a class member function is copy to thread internal storage in order to execute the member function but i found out that someone just encapsulates the boost thread in a class. What is the purposes for this ? On the other hands, do we allow to inherit the boost thread ? Please help. Thanks.
