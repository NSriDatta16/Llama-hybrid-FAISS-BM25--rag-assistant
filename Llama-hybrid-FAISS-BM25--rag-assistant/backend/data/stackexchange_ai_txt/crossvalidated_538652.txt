What does the phrase "ensemble methods" mean in machine learning? What exactly is going on here?

I know this might be a newbie question, but I'm trying to make sense of this sentence. I understand that these are several algorithms that together give a good result. But I don't understand how this can be implemented and why it is called an ensemble method, perhaps because of consistency?
