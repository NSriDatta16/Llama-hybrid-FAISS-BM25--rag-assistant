According to the history provided in Schmidhuber, " Deep learning in neural networks: an overview ," Neural Networks (2015), auto-encoders were proposed as a method for unsupervised pre-training in Ballard, "Modular learning in neural networks," Proceedings AAAI (1987). It's not clear if that's the first time auto-encoders were used, however; it's just the first time that they were used for the purpose of pre-training ANNs . As the introduction to the Schmidhuber article makes clear, it's somewhat difficult to attribute all of the ideas used in ANNs because the literature is diverse and terminology has evolved over time.
