Interpretation of GAMM with Factor level Predictors

I'm running the following model in R using the package mgcv : gamm(richness ~ s(exp.time, by = expgroup) + expgroup, random = list(exp.call=~1),family = Gamma(link = "log"), data=df.snake) This model structure was selected after using AIC values to determine whether more complex random effects structures, the inclusion of a temporal autocorrelation term, or different distribution families produced a more efficient model fit The parameters included in this model are richness - Count data of the OTU richness of an animals microbiome exp.time - days since the experiment began expgroup - Treatment group (either inoculated with disease or sham inoculation) exp.call - subject ID Using the functions appraise and draw from the package gratia , please find visualizations of model fit and output below: Summary of the model is as follows: Family: Gamma Link function: log Formula: richness ~ s(exp.time, by = expgroup) + expgroup Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 4.59794 0.05050 91.041 I have two questions regarding intepretations of this model. Experimental group, as a parametric term, does not have a significant effect on richness. However, time has a significant effect on richness for both treatment groups. How can I interpet this result? Does this mean that there is actually no difference between the predicted trends for each factor level? The relative edf for the trendline for the sham treatment group is 1.000. My understanding is that this indicates the trendline approximates a linear trend. However, the p-value for this term is significant. My understanding is that the null hypothesis for this test is that the trendline is linear. Is this just a quirk of the somewhat arbitary nature of alpha values? Thank you greatly for any insight!
