Yes, you should use the two-sample t-test. Here is an example you can use the coverage of the confidence interval to determine the significance. Suppose you want to test if the IQ of man is different from 100, you can construct the confidence interval of male IQ and check if 100 follows in the interval. Here 100 is a CONSTANT, not a random statistic. If you want to use confidence intervals to determine the significance, you must check if there is any overlap between the two confidence intervals. If there is some overlap, they are not significantly different.
