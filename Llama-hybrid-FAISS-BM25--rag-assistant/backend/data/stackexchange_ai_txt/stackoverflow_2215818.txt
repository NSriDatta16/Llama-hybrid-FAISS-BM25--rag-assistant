Starting a thread for each inner loop in OpenMP

I'm fairly new to OpenMP and I'm trying to start an individual thread to process each item in a 2D array. So essentially, this: for (i = 0; i What I'm doing is this: #pragma omp parallel for shared(a,b,c) private(i,j) reduction(+:diff) schedule(dynamic) for (i = 0; i Does this in fact start a thread for each 2D item or no? How would I test that? If it is wrong, what is the correct way to do it? Thanks! Note: The code has been greatly simplified
