SVM decision boundary conditions : derivation problem

I was trying to understand the derivation of SVM decision boundary. Suppose my decision boundary is y-x-1=0 . Now in the book it was written that (y-x-1) = +/-(1) , are the equation of the maximum margins. But my question is why are we choosing a distance of 1 from the decision boundary ? How do we even know that we would be able to hit the support vectors just at the distance of +/-(1) from the decision boundary ? Moreover how can we say, that if we are able to hit a support vector at a distance of +1 from decision boundary then it will be there exactly at -1 (and not at -3, -5, -10... etc for that matter) ? i.e. how are we so sure that at exactly +/-(1) "on both sides" from decision boundary we will be able to hit support vectors.
