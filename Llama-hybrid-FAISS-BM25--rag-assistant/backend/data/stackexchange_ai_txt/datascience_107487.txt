The idea of deep supervision is to add, so called, companion objective functions at each hidden layer of a network and then compute the final loss as the output loss plus the sum of the companion losses. The idea was introduced in this paper: @inproceedings{lee2015deeply, title={Deeply-supervised nets}, author={Lee, Chen-Yu and Xie, Saining and Gallagher, Patrick and Zhang, Zhengyou and Tu, Zhuowen}, booktitle={Artificial intelligence and statistics}, pages={562--570}, year={2015}, organization={PMLR} }
