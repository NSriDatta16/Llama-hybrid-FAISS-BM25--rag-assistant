Since we observed that there is a traffic jam (i.e. $T=1$ ), how can we assume that $P(A=1,P=0)=P(A=1)P(P=0)$ ? You should decide observance based on asked probability. Although it's given in the question statement, $T$ is not observed when calculating $P(A,P)$ . $T$ is observed when calculating $P(A,P|T)$ . Bayesian networks, by their definition, enforce dependence relations. In this one, $A$ and $P$ are dependent if $T$ is given. If not, they're independent.
