Are there better clients for viewing System Monitor logs?

Does anyone know of a better GUI client for displaying Windows System Monitor log files? (System Monitor is sometimes called Performance Monitor .) I'm trying to track a long-term memory leak in a C# application running on Windows XP or 2K3 by comparing memory usages to run logs. Specifically I want a client that will allow me to see the following (because System Monitor is unable or difficult): Specify exact date time ranges for viewing data (or at least finer granularity than hours) Show time intervals along the horizontal axis Show max, min, average for the time range Somewhere show the interval on which source data was captured (1 sec, 5 min, etc.) (If no such thing exists I'm willing to hear recommendations for better long term performance/memory capturing tools.) Edit: I've done Google searches and haven't found anything except tutorials on how to create System Monitor logs.
