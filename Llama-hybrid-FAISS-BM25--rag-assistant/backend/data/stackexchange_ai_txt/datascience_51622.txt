There is no minimum or maximum amount of data that is necessary to construct any Machine Learning model. The general rule, however, is that the more data that you add to the model, the better it will perform and generalize . Depending on the frequency of your data, 34 months of data should be sufficient for some basic exponential smoothing models or ARIMA as well.
