Hastie et al.'s SVMPath explores the entire regularization path for C and only requires about the same computational cost of training a single SVM model. From their paper: Our R function SvmPath computes all 632 steps in the mixture example (n+ = n− = 100, radial kernel, γ = 1) in 1.44(0.02) secs on a pentium 4, 2Ghz linux machine; the svm function (using the optimized code libsvm, from the R library e1071) takes 9.28(0.06) seconds to compute the solution at 10 points along the path. Hence it takes our procedure about 50% more time to compute the entire path, than it costs libsvm to compute a typical single solution. They released a GPLed implementation of the algorithm in R that you can download from CRAN here . Using SVMPath should allow you to find a good C value for any given γ quickly. However, you would still need to do separate training runs for different γ values. But, this should be much faster than doing separate runs for each pair of C:γ values.
