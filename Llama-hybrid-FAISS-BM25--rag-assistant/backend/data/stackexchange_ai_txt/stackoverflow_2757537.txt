Help with MySQL Join Statement

I just built a website and have realised that I need to have a top 3 highest rated albums.. I haven't built in something that keeps track of the ratings. Ratings are stored separately. Can someone show me how to put these together please. SELECT id, name FROM albums LIMIT 3 SELECT rating FROM ratings WHERE url=CONCAT('albums/show/', album.id) Let me just flesh it out a bit. I need to get back the following: From the albums table. id, name. From the ratings table I need to get back the average rating. ROUND((rating+rating+rating) / total ratings) The ratings. Users can rate everything on my website so I have a generic ratings table. The rating is stored with the url of the page it applies to. Hence, to get album ratings I need to have 'albums/show/{album_id}'. In hind sight I should have had a type and id field but it is a bit late now with a lunch iminient. Any help is much appreciated.
