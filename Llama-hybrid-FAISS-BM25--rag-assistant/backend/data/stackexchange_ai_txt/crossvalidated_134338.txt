A question in proof from "Regression Quantiles" by Roger Koenker and Gilbert Bassett(Econometrica, 1978)

I have a problem in verifying the conclusion (3.5) in proving Theorem 3.3 as attached here. Particularly, from (3.4) \begin{align} 0& But how is this equivalent to (3.5) \begin{align} (\theta-1)\iota^{'}_{K} & For me, I can only get that the sum ranges over $((\theta-3/2)\iota^{'}_{K},(\theta+1/2)\iota^{'}_{K})$, which is wider than that of (3.5).
