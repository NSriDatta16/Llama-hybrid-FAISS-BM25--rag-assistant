Which independent variables are most important in predicting the response variable?

I'm a biologist, and I have a large dataset that I'm trying to analyze. Here are the variables I'm working with: levels of 211 different metabolites in 16 different blood samples (predictor variables) how well each of the 16 blood samples performed in a specific test (response variable) I am trying to figure out which variable(s) are the most important in predicting the performance of a blood sample in the test. I would like to make these data more manageable by doing a PCA, but I'm new to this sort of analysis. I understand that a PCA will create groups of principal components (it will group metabolites that covary with each other and label each of these groups a principal component), but I'm not sure how to take into account the response variable in this analysis. Any help would be much appreciated!!! Thank you. > summary(metabolites_princomp) Importance of components: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 Standard deviation 3.9608225 0.40128486 0.259868774 0.215004349 Proportion of Variance 0.9805072 0.01006435 0.004220736 0.002889179 Cumulative Proportion 0.9805072 0.99057153 0.994792267 0.997681446 [...]
