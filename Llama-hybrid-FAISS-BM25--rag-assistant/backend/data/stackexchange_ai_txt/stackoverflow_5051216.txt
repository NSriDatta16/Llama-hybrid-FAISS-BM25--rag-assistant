It's a bad idea to do this using a regex, unless you know that there will be no paragraph (or anything that might superficially be interpreted as a paragraph) inside of the vidwrapper. If you don't, writing a regex for something like this will be very hard: Hello there. Wee. Yoink. Hello there. Wee. --> Yoink. An easier (and more robust) way would probably be to parse the HTML with an HTML parser, and do a search on the DOM tree instead.
