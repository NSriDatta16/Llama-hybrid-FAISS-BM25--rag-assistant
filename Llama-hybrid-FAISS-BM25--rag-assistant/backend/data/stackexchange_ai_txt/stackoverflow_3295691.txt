Good resource for what to look for on Munin graphs?

I have installed Munin to provide some insight into server performance for a VPS server with some small rails and Sinatra applications. Is there a good resource for reading up on what to look for on the graphs Munin provides. Or a good resource on getting more details on specific measures (Fork rate, Swap in/out) - what they are telling me, what are signals that need to be looked into... Mainly I am trying to learn about what measures I should pay attention to on the server side as I try to work with some small ruby application for fun.
