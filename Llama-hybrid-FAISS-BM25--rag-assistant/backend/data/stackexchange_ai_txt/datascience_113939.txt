Are you saying you have this as the data? import numpy as np import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame() df['student'] = [f'student_{i}' for i in range (10)] df['maths'] = np.random.choice(['high score', 'low score'], size=10) df['chemsitry'] = np.random.choice(['high score', 'low score'], size=10) df['physics'] = np.random.choice(['high score', 'low score'], size=10) df i.e this: If yes then I dont think you can do machine learning as there are no features to train on. In this case all you could really do is take percentages of low/high for each and compare (or maybe do ratios).
