Is ROC supposed to be used in this way ? Yes, but usually for these purposes the Area Under Curve ROC (AUC) is used and not the distance to the point (1, 1). For example, in XGBoost the evaluation metrics are: rmse – root mean square error mae – mean absolute error logloss – negative log-likelihood error – Binary classification error rate (0.5 threshold) merror – Multiclass classification error rate mlogloss – Multiclass logloss auc - Area under the curve ROC Can this be called ROC ? Yes. Are there any pitfalls by using the ROC concept in this way to determine hyper parameters ? No, AUC ROC is one of the usual methods to optimize parameters in binomial models.
