How to modify variables to be significant in logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression analysis in a particular software. My objective is to study the behavior of the software with significant variables. However, with the data I have, there are no significant variables. It does not matter if I modify the data and forcefully make a variable to be significant. Any ideas how I can modify a variable so that it becomes significant? I tried a linear combination of the output variable with different random distributions for the two values. However it did not work. var1 = out * (random sample from distribution 1) + (1-out) * (random sample from distribution 2) out is a binary variable (0 or 1). Thanks
