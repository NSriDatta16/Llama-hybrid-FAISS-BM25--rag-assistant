GraphSage provides a solution to address the problem DeepWalk embedding technique. As we know that DeepWalk embedding technique use transudative learning to extract features from a graph. If a node is added in the graph then we gain re-run the algorithm to get embedding of all node. So, DeepWalk besed GNN is not suitable for dynamic graphs where the nodes in the graphs are ever-changing. To address the above-mentioned issue, GraphSage is introduced to learn the node representation in inductive way. Specifically, each node is represented by the aggregation of its neighborhood. Thus, even if a new node unseen during training time appears in the graph, it can still be properly represented by its neighboring nodes.
