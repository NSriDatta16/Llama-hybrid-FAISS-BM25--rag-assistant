YES You can prove this by using properties of the mean and variance of a transformation, but the intuition is that subtracting the observed mean gives you a a new mean of zero (centers your data) and the dividing by the standard deviation compresses or expands the distribution to give a standard deviation of one. Note that there is no requirement to standardize your data before you run PCA.
