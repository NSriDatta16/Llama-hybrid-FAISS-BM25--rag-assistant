Are you really so hard up for storage that 4 bytes will break the bank? Probably not. It might seem like a space saving feature, but once you run into urls that have no alias for a non-www site, you'll have to code around it. Then when you have urls that subdomains other than www you'll have to code around those too. In the long run it's probably just best to leave the url as it is and suck it up in raw storage unless you're going to be storing hundreds of millions of them.
