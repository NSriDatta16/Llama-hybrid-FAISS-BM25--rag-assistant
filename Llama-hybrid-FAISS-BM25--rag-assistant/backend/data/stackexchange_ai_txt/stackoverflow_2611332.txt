Technically, it is possible to bake sorting into a VIEW but it is highly discouraged. Instead, you should apply sort while selecting from the view like so: Select ... From MyView Order By SortByCol ASC If you really wanted to know (but again, I would strongly recommend against this), you can use the TOP command to get around the limitation of sorting in the view: Select TOP 100 PERCENT * Col1, Col2.... From Table1 Order By SortByCol ASC
