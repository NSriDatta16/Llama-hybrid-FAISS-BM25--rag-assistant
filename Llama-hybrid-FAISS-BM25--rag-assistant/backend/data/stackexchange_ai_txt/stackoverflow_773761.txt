I'm not satisfied. binaryworrier : Mind that if you use modulo, you will get fewer digits for numbers such as 1234123412340001 sshow : mind that, if you use substring(12), you will get fewer digits for numbers such as 0000123412341234 solution would be: UInt64 ccNumber; string s = ccNumber.ToString().Text.PadLeft(15, 'myString'); string last = "*"+s.Substring(s.Length-4); But on a more abstract note, is a credit card number actually a number? I think not; much more likely that you are going to want to manipulate it digit by digit than perform arithmetic on it. Your advantage of converting char[16] to UInt64 cuts storage space by 50%. No wait, 75% - stupid two-byte-chars!
