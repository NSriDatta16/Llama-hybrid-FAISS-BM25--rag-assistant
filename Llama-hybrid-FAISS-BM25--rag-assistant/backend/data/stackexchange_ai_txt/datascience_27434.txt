It is not dangerous if you have enough data. If you have enough data, you can somehow estimate the distribution of the phenomenon in hand. If you find the distribution of your sample and its parameters, it means that you know everything about your phenomenon under study. If you are familiar with statistics and probability, you may know that whenever you have enough data, you can estimate the expected value of the random variable using the mean of data samples and standard deviation of the sample will be equal to the standard deviation of the random variable, again if you have enough data. If you have enough data, it means that there will be no difference between the value of mean and expected value also standard deviation of the sample and standard deviation of the population. So if you extract enough data, these values may be so close together. Moreover, the reason we are using standardization of data is that we want to have features with same scale. This is the main reason, consequently there is no need to find the exact value of mean and standard deviation. You may see among machine learning and deep learning practitioners that they may not do this operation because it's a bit time consuming. They just usually divide each feature by the greatest value of the corresponding feature among data samples.
