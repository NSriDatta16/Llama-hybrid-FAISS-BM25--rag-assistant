You need to cast it to ValueStorage first. Also add virtual destructur to ValueStorageBase class, to have polymorphic class. Without it you can't runtime check if your casting is OK :). After it you can write: template Datatype Element_cast() { //throw exception for a wrong cast if(typeid(*StoredValue)!=typeid(ValueStorage ) ) throw exception; //we already checked, that our type casting is OK, //So no need for dynamic_cast anymore return static_cast (StoredValue)->value; }
