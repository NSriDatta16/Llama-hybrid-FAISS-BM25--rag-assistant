How to find the pdf of a time-dependent parameter in a linear regression model with drift?

Suppose there exists a simple linear equation, where the dependent variable y(time series; measurements available) depends on x1 and x2. If the parameter multiplier of x2 is time dependent and the multiplier of x1 is a deterministic variable. How to find the pdf of the parameter multiplier of x2. Given the time series observations of y, x1 and x2. Please tell me how to solve this. Kalman/particle filter?
