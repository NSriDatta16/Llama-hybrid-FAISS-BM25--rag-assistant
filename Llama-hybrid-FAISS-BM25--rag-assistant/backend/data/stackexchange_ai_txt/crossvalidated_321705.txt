Mean decrease in accuracy ranks variables differently than mean decrease in Gini Index?

I created a random forest model with 17 predictor variables and a categorical outcome with 3 classes (650 data points). When I look at the variable importance plot, I see that the ranking of variables is quite different depending on whether accuracy or gini index is used as the ranking metric. What might be the reason behind ranking discrepancies between these two methods?
