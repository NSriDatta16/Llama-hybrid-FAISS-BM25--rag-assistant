Blizzard's world of warcraft websites and their armory website have the only website I've ever seen that sends xml and uses client side xslt to display it. It seems to work quite well and they are pretty high volume sites. (Be aware that it looks at the user agent and does the transformation server side for some browsers, I know it does it client side for IE)
