The ZODB is an ACID compliant database storage written in (mostly) python, so in a sense the answer is yes. But I can imagine this is a bit overkill :) Either the OS has to provide this for you, or you'll need to implement your own ACID compliancy. For example, by defining 'records' in the file you write and, when opening/reading, verifying which records have been written (which may mean you need to throw away some non-fully written data). ZODB, for example, implements this by ending a record by writing the size of the record itself; if you can read this size and it matches, you know the record has been fully written. And, of course, you always need to append records and not rewrite the entire file.
