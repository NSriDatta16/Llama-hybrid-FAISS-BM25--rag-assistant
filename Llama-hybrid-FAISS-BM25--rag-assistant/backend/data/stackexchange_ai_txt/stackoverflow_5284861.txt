Format text to left

I am creating a format tool that strips content from articles for print. The demo can be seen here . The full source is avaliable here . Right now the tool strips formating and can also keep paragraphs by using nl2br What I would like to do is to be able to shift the content to the left and only have a paragraph if there is a break between the content. for example: This is the first paragraph Second Paragraph Becomes: this is the first paragraph Second Paragraph I tried this by using regex to check if there were two spaces at the end but that didn't work. Here is some sample code: HTML: Keep Paragraphs Remove whitespace after line unless it ends in two spaces PHP: $text= $_POST['textinput']; $p= $_POST['keep_paragraphs']; $lb= $_POST['shift_left']; if(get_magic_quotes_gpc()){ $text = stripslashes($text); // strip off the slashes if they are magically added. } $text = htmlentities($text); //if we should keep formatting if($p=="true"){ $text =nl2br($text); } if($lb=="true"){ $text = preg_replace('/\s+/', ' ', trim($text)); } echo $text; Any help on this would be great EDIT: include example POST textbox = "Hi Jane How are You doing today I hope all is well"; Most text will be coming from e-mails and other sources,basicly it needs to be super genderic.
