The fine-tuning of the penalization factor of Elastic Net during the cross validation has resulted in a penalty that shrinks all coefficients to zero. Without being mathematically exact this seems to indicates that none of your features is very helpful. In this case Elastic Net will always predict the mean of the data it was trained on. Your measure for accuracy is very problematic, as just predicting the mean can produce very high results. For example, given the standard normal distribution the average absolute error is close to 0.8. Given a large sample size the range is easily around 8, giving you an accuracy of 0.9. See here: > set.seed(123) > x 1-mean(abs(x-mean(x)))/diff(range(x)) 0.9056073
