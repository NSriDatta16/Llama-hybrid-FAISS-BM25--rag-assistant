Some algorithms and approach for identification of specific patterns?

I am working on a hobby project where I have a data related to financial trades(such as stock trades) . Now I want to analyse this data and extract possible suspicious patterns and trades. Since I am new to Data Science so I would love to get few suggestions regarding what are some effective algorithms( machine learning ) that can be relevant to such a scenario. One category that I think is using a possible outlier detection algorithm but I am unable to determine which one to use. I would also appreciate few pointers related to what my approach should be.
