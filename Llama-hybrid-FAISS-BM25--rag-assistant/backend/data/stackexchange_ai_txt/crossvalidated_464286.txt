What is the correlation between these two time series which I post here?

Here is the figure of the two time series $A_t$ and $B_t$ for a panel data. We can see that the silent time (value equals to zero) are the same and one of time series whatevter $A_t$ or $B_t$ somehow excites another time series, meaning that if the value of $A_t$ or $B_t$ is not equal to zero then another time series is not zero too. Basically I want to use one series to predict another, so at the very begining I was searching the method of causality testing like Granger causality. But every example I saw in the internet is a .. I think it's a normal time series without such a long silent time, thus I am not sure whether Granger causality testing would work well nor not. Is there any option to model this phenomenon? Thanks a lot!
