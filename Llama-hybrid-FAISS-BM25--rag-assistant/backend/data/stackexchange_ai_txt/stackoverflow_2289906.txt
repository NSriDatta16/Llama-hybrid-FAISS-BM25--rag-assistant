You are trying to set a load event on a paragraph. Only objects which load external data (window, frame, iframe, img, script, etc) have a load event. Some JS libraries implement an available event (such as YUI ) â€” but you know the paragraph is available, since you're setting an event on it, and you couldn't do that if it was unavailable.
