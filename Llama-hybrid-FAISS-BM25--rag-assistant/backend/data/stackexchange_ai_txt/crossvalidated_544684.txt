How To Estimate Number of COVID Cases In A Congregation

I have been estimating the number of COVID cases in my church congregation using a few basic things: Get the 7-day average daily COVID case count for my county Multiply #1 by fourteen to estimate how many people in my county are currently sick with COVID Divide #2 by the population of my county Put #3 into a binomial distribution as the probability of a successful trial, with 250 trials (my guesstimate of my congregation's typical weekly size) and looking for P(x>=1) (at least one positive COVID case in my congregation). I see multiple places where I take a number and extrapolate from it without justification and without quantifying the possible error my extrapolation might introduce; I can remedy those as I think on this more. Questions: #1 relies on tests, and thus limits my estimation to those who tested positive with COVID. I think that if someone took the time to get tested, they are probably not attending the congregation while sick, and so I cannot use their positive test result to quantify the probability of COVID in my congregation. My congregation is not a random sample from the county, nor is weekly attendance a new sampling â€” attendance is "sticky," in that most attendees are repeat attendees. Does that invalidate my use of a binomial distribution? Perhaps my use of #1 is permissible so long as I view it as the minimum number of COVID cases in my county. How, then, would one estimate a maximum number of COVID cases? (This might require I learn a lot more stats theory because I know there have been numerous scholarly articles written trying to estimate the "true" COVID case count.) How can I, as a layperson with basic statistics knowledge and access to easily-accessible data, fix this estimation? (Also welcome are suggestions of, "You should probably read this article: ...") Updated to state my questions more clearly.
