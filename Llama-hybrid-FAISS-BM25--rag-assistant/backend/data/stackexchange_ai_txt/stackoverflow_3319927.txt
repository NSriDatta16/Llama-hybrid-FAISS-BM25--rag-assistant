Wix - Keeping track of installed applications

This seems like a fairly straightforward question but I've been unable to find an answer: Let's say I have two products: A and B created by MyCompany. Both products A and B will have shortcuts in the start menu in this fashion: MyCompanyFolder->Product_A_Folder->A.exe and MyCompanyFolder->Product_B_Folder->B.exe If I uninstall "Product B" I don't want it to delete the "MyCompanyFolder" unless it is the last product left. I would just check to see if "Product A" exists or not (through a component or registry search) but it is impossible for me to know at this time how many future applications will be added to this folder. The only solution I came up with was to create a registry key that simply contains an integer denoting the number of apps installed - but that seems a bit inelegant (not to mention I don't know how to increment registry values in Wix either). Any thoughts? Thanks.
