Preventing active stealing is very hard. Since hiding data is easy. Encryption, packing, password protected archives, obfuscation, steganography,... To prevent all that you'd need to lock down the computer very much, and only allow trusted code to run. But then programming on that computer won't be possible either. Since programming introduces new code by definition. The best you can achieve in practice without too many restrictions on the user is preventing accidental leaks.
