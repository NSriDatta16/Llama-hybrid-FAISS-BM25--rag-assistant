Regular expressions, while elegant if done right, are not fit for all purposes. I would suggest that this is one of the cases it is not suited for. Don't get me wrong, you can do it with a single RE, but it's likely to be far more complex and hard to maintain than some simple procedural which checks the length and character classes.
