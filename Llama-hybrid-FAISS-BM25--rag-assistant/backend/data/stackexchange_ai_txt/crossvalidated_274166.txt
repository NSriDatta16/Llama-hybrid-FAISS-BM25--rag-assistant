The problem you have is, that variable timediff doesn't affect the value of conditional mean by much: $$E(\hat{y}|x_1,...,x_p) \approx E(\hat{y}|x_1,...,x_p,x_{timediff}) $$ You said bikes_before is the most predictive variable. This is to be expected. In all likelihood the expected value of bikes_after is equal to the value of bikes_before . What changes with time or timediff is variability around this expected value. And this variability changes with timediff . Intuitively this is easy to understand: if we observe 7 bikes on a stand in time $t$, there will probably still be 7 bikes there in a minute or two. But in two hours the number could easily be completely different like 2 or 12 bikes. The variability changes but the expected value probably doesn't. In two hours the average number of bikes on the stand is probably pretty close to 7. The problem is regression and tree models are meant to model expected values. When timediff gets larger accuracy of your prediction will get worse. To get around this problem you can regress a chosen variance measure on timediff (and other variables) and use this information in setting the confidence regions for predictions. Variability of prediction is a direct measure of quality of prediction. Don't forget to validate results with training data.
