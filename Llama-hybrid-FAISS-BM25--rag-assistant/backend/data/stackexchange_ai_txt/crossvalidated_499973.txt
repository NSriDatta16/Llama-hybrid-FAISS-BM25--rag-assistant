$p(x|\theta)$ in predictive distribution vs likelihood function in bayes

I have doubts over the use of $p(x|\theta)$ in the bayesian context which I would like to clarify. In baye's theorem, the likelihood is considered a function of $\theta$ , this means that $x$ is fixed and $\theta$ varies. In the predictive distribution, $x$ is random and $\theta$ is fixed since the predictive distribution tries to average the distribution of $x$ over all possible values that $\theta$ can take. Is my understanding of $p(x|\theta)$ in these 2 context correct ?
