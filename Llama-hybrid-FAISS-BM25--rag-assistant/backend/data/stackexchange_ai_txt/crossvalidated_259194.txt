You should test for cointegration on stock prices . It's typical for prices to be integrated and for returns to not be (as you've noticed), so you would not need to test for cointegration on stock returns . If a cointegrating relationship exists between the prices, it can be interpreted as a specific portfolio whose value process is stationary. Such a portfolio is sometimes used in a strategy called pairs trading or statistical arbitrage .
