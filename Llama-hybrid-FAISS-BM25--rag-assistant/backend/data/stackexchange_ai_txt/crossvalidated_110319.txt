Another option is the multgee package. The included example of a nominal (there's also an ordinal example) multinomial logistic GEE-solved marginal regression model predicts housing status ( y = 1 for "street living", 2 for community living, and 3 for independent housing) from time in months and Section 8 rent certificate status ( sec , binary). Here's the code: require(multgee);data(housing) summary(nomLORgee(y~factor(time)*sec,data=housing,id=id,repeated=time)) And selected output: Link : Baseline Category Logit Local Odds Ratios: Structure: time.exch Model: 3way Homogenous scores: TRUE Summary of residuals: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.585900 -0.278000 -0.128700 -0.002166 0.421200 0.908800 Number of Iterations: 3 Coefficients: Estimate san.se san.z Pr(>|san.z|) beta01 1.66073 0.25026 6.6359 See the following reference for background and interpretation of this model. Also, here's the structure of the housing dataset (using str(lapply(housing,factor)) ) in case it helps you organize yours: List of 4 $ id : Factor w/ 362 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 ... $ y : Factor w/ 3 levels "0","1","2": 2 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 1 3 ... $ time: Factor w/ 4 levels "0","6","12","24": 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ... $ sec : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
