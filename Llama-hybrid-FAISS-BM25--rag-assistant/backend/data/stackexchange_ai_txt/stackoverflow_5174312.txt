How do I allocate contiguous disk space?

I am developing a system which works with lots of files and doing some google searches I read about improving the speed of information retrieval by the hard disk. But since I work with Java, I can't find any library to work with this issue. I have a very vague knowledge in C++, and found something about hard disk information retrieval with IOCTL . Apparently there is no way of getting specific information like how many contiguous free blocks can I get from my hard disk or the maximum of contiguous free blocks it have. I am currently working with Windows 7 and XP. I am aware of the use of JNI but I have strong problems with C++. But even searching for C++ solutions I can't find anything. Maybe I am doing some wrong queries on Google. Could someone please give me a link, suggestions of study or anything? I am willing to study C++ (although I have almost no free time). Thank you very much! PS-Edit: I know it would practically make no difference. But I really need to learn about this. But thanks to everyone giving advices.
