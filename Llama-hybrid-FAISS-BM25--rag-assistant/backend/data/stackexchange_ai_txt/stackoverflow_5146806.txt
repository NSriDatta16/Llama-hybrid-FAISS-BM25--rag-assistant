Creating then Canceling multiple alarms set with AlarmManager

I have an app that allows the user to pick a pool of minutes. So, they may pick 5, 15, 30 and 50 minutes. Then, an alarmmanager alarm is set for each one of those at the same time with the following code (this block of code works great): //SET ALL ALARMS for(int i = 0; i I want the user to be able to clear all the alarms and start over, even after setting them and hitting go. I'm trying the AlarmManager.cancel class but it isn't working. The documentation says if the intent is the same as the intent used to set the alarm then it will cancel it. So, I use this block of code to cancel it: String[] spCANCELS = intent_ids.split(";"); //Cancel all previous set alarms for(int i = 0; i Alas, the alarms keep coming. I test by putting in 10 different alarms at 5 seconds apart. I let the first 3 or 4 alarms go off then hit my cancel button but the alarms keep coming (while all the field clear that are inside the click, so I know the click listener is working). EDIT: Nevermind, I need to pay more attention when looking over my syntax. This line: intent_ids += "intent_id;"; should not have had the variable intent_id in quotes.
