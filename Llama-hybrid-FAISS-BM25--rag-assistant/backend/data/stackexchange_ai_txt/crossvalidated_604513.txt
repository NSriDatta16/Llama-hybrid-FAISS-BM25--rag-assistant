I would use a Bayesian Hierarchcial model. Hierarchical because your data are nested within individuals. The model can be defined as follows: $$y_{i} \sim \text{N}(\mu_{h[i],p[i]}, \sigma^2)$$ where $y$ is the target variable (e.g. dexterity), $\mu_{h[i] = 1,p[i]}$ is the effect of healthy hand, and $\mu_{h[i] = 2,p[i]}$ is the effect of unhealthy hand for person $p[i]$ on his/her target variable. Then we assume there is an effect for healthy hand and another effect for unhealthy hand in the population and person specific effects are drawn from the distribution of the population effects like below: $$\mu_{h[i],p[i]} \sim \text{N}(\mu_{healthy[i]}, \sigma^2_{healthy[i]})$$ $\mu_{healthy[i]}$ , and $\sigma^2_{healthy[i]}$ are the parameters of the population distribution that we are interested in. Note that $healthy[i]$ can take two values 1 and 2 associcated with healthy and unhealthy hand respectively. So we will have two different population distribution associated with each condition. And finally we need to specify some hyperpriors on the parameters. Since each person has only two person and the number of individuals are only 30, you better choose informative priors distributions. For this toy example I simply chose the below priors: $$\mu_{healthy} \sim \text{N}(7, 3^2)$$ $$\sigma_{healthy} \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 5)$$ Now let's fit the model in R using R2jags package: # ----- Simulating some data ----- healthy = 10 # Average effect in the population for healthy hand unhealthy = 5 # dito dito unhealthy hand df = data.frame() x = c() set.seed(123) for (j in 1:30){ #loop over individuals for (i in 1:2){ #loop over hands x[1] = rnorm(1, healthy, sample(1:3,1)) x[2] = rnorm(1, unhealthy, sample(1:3,1)) z = sample(1:2,2, replace = T) y = x[z] id = rep(j,2) df_temp = data.frame(y = y, id = id, health = z) } df = rbind(df, df_temp) } # ------------------ JAGS full model -------------------- library(R2jags) mod_string = " model { for (i in 1:length(y)) { # Likelihood y[i] ~ dnorm(health[type[i], person[i]], tau) # tau = 1/sigma } # ------- hierarchical priors ------- for (i in 1:max(person)) { health[1,i] ~ dnorm(mu_pop_health[1], sigma_pop_health[1]^-2) health[2,i] ~ dnorm(mu_pop_health[2], sigma_pop_health[2]^-2) } # --- hyper priors ------ for (j in 1:2){ mu_pop_health[j] ~ dnorm(7,3^-2) sigma_pop_health[j] ~ dunif(0,5) } tau ~ dgamma(1.0E-3, 1.0E-3) } " data_jags = list(y = df $y, type = df$ health, person = df$id ) params = c('mu_pop_health') set.seed(123) # Run the model model_run And here are the results: > print(model_run) Inference for Bugs model at "8", fit using jags, 3 chains, each with 2000 iterations (first 1000 discarded) n.sims = 3000 iterations saved mu.vect sd.vect 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat n.eff mu_pop_health[1] 9.413 0.248 8.923 9.242 9.415 9.579 9.889 1.001 2700 mu_pop_health[2] 5.029 0.269 4.504 4.845 5.025 5.210 5.562 1.001 3000 In the above table, mu.vect gives the average values of the target variable in the population associated with 1 = healthy and 2 = unhealthy hands. As you can see, the model accurately estimated the average effect associated with each condition for a hand and it also gives the 95% credible interval for its estimates.
