I do love code, and never had any course in my live about anything related to informatics I started very bad and started to learn from examples, but what I always remember and kept in my mind since I read the "Gang Of Four" book was: "Everyone can write code that is understood by a machine, but not all can write code that is understood by a human being" with this in mind, there is a lot to be done in the code ;)
