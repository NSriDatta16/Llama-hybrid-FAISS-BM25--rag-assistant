Perhaps, one should view the optimization process taken over the space of functions span by the admissible policies, however explicitly described by the MDP definition. probabilities could always be forced to follow the strict more explicit notation of functions of many variables from general mathematics. All moments could also always be made explicit integrals of many variables (or discrete versions of it). But, the probability space does add some extra structure into the set of such multi-variable functions. And since whatever mathematical object in the space of dependent variables is the focus of all this machinery, you could bet that you might have to consider various partial integrals, probability oblige, unless you want to forgo the extra structure that Bayes theorem provides. It is a bit like the complex plane: would look like R2, if there was not that quirky relationship between the dimensions. this is just an analogy. my point, is that given the multivariate interactions, some shortcuts become inevitable for the sake of readability. However, care should be taken to systematically be aware and make the readers aware that shortcuts have been taken, in notations, specially when communicating with multidisciplinary audiences, and various notation expectations or fluency that come with that. (or just to not get lost oneself...) I am not finished, there is an additional twist that I need to mention to make the above relevant to this thread: MDP are considered to answer a restricted class of mathematical problems, they impose the question of finding some non-empty subset of optimal policies in the valuation sense. So we are going to be optimizing of space of policies (they become points, variables themselves, hence the confusing subscript, compress into one symbol meaning not a value, but a function as conditioned variable. Does this make sense? Maybe some body should tweak what I tried to say. if too bad, I could make it wiki, for those who get my intent, that is. I just thought this was relevant because I sensed that part of the difficulty lies in different notation assumptions/expectations per individual involved (include original authors). I may be wrong. let's see.
