Visualising data from glm/ glmer

Sorry if this question sounds very amateurish, but I am completely new to R and this website. So, I have a data set with counts of infected organisms as a response variable (for three different species) and 5 different predictor variables. The infected organism count data is from over 200 surveys where they did not collect the same number of organisms each time. Some variables were measured for the entire site (constant across all surveys), some are unique to each survey. An example of how the data is structured: So, I used the cbind() when creating the glm to account for the fact that this is proportion data. Disease_glm Then I used DHARMa to test for dispersion testDispersion(simulateResiduals(Disease_glm)) There was significant overdispersion so I created a unique ID for each survey Disease$survey_ID = c(1:dim(Disease)[1]) So the data now has a survey ID column tucked in at the end. And then I used it as a random effect in my model: Disease_glmer This solved the overdispersion issue. I just wanted to visualise the results for each species. How much impact does var1, var2 ... have on infection numbers in Species 1, for instance. This is where major issues started cropping up. At first, I tried ggplot(data =Disease D) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = var1+var2+var3+var4+var5, y = (cbind(n_infected, not_infected)), color = species)) But I got the error message "Error in check_aesthetics() : ! Aesthetics must be either length 1 or the same as the data (225): y" Since I am so new that I do not know how to interpret this at all, I just abandoned it and tried a different route: par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) with(Disease, plot((cbind(n_infected, not_infected)) ~ var1 + var2 + var3 + var4 + var5, pch=16, color = MergedChytrid$species)) curve(exp(cbind(1,x)%*%coef(chytrid_glmer)), add=T, col = "goldenrod", lwd=3) The first bit gives me the error: Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : 'x' and 'y' lengths differ Trying to run the curve function gave me: Error in cbind(1, x) %*% coef(chytrid_glmer) : requires numeric/complex matrix/vector arguments Could you please help me understand where I am going wrong? It seems like such a basic thing. Any help would be appreciated
