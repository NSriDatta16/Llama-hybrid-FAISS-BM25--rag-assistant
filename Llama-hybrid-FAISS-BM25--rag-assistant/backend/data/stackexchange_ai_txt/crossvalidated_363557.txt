So this does not go unanswered this brings together comments by Wolfgang and me. The issue is that when there is heterogeneity and a random effects model is used them the weights become more equal. The fixed effects model estimates the hypothesised underlying effect whereas the random effects model estimates the mean and variance of the distribution of true effects. Note also that the assumption of normality is unlikely to be justified here and as Wolfgang suggested a more appropriate model would be a mixed effects logistic one.
