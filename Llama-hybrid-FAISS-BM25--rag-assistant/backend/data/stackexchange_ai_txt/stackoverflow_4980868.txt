CAShapeLayer hitTest touch

I can't understand why a CAShapeLayer does not respond to hitTest This function always goes to // touches is outside How do I detect a touch on a CAShapeLayer? -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { currentPoint = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; for (CAShapeLayer *layer in self.layer.sublayers) { if(layer == shapeLayer) { if([layer hitTest:currentPoint]) { // touche is on the layer } else { // touche is outside } } } }
