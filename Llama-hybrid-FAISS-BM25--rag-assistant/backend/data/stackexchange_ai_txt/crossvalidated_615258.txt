Time series analysis: how to rank the ability of predictors to predict physically-based model outputs

I have a complex physically-based biological model which solves partial differential equations to predict the number of individuals in a certain community as a function of temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentration. Therefore I have 20 years of daily data for the number of individuals N (i.e., the model output) and measured temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentration (i.e., the model inputs). We would like to rank the predictors based on how much they affect the model output. Note that we cannot add and remove predictors from the physically-based model. It will be both unphysical and too computationally expensive. See below a quick drawing of the model output (N, first plot), and one of the predictors (temperature, T, second plot) for reference. They vary seasonally and there is a clear lag between the two time series.
