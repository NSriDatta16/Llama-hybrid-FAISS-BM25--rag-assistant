Not sure of the purpose of this. But the variable link1 is a reference to a DOM element. you need to get the text (depending on what type of control someURL is in your ASP page) value of that DOM element in order to pass it to the other script. This is by no means elegant or recommended but will work C# - in your codebehind page public string nextURL = "http://yourdomain.com/yourpage.aspx" ASP.NET - in your aspx page var myLink = ' '; function newPage() { window.open(myLink); }
