Computer Vision: Simple Noise Reduction

In computer vision, we often want to remove noise from an image. We can do this by getting an image and replacing distorted pixels with an average of its neighbours. I have no trouble understanding this but what are all the variables in the following equation meant to be? I've just found it in some slides but it doesn't come with any explanation: The (i,j) is probably a given pixel and its neighbour, but what is the function f, the Omega, and the w? Any guesses?! Cheers guys.
