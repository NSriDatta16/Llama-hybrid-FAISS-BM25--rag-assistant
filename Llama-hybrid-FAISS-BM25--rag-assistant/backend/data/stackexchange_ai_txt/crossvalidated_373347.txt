power analysis for multilevel model with significant finding

I am working on a study where data collection is still in progress. I have done preliminary analysis with a multilevel model on a small number of people (n=19), and there is a statistically significant treatment effect. There is interest in doing a power analysis now to determine how many additional people to collect data from. Note- I realize power analysis should have been done before data collection began but that wasn't done in this case. I'm wondering is there any point in doing a power analysis if the results are already statistically significant? If there is, what is the point? 19 seems like a small total number. thanks!
