Role based authentication using LDAP in ASP.Net

I need to implement Role/Group based authentication in my ASP.Net web application using Active Directory Domain Services and LDAP. i want to use userâ€™s windows logon identity credentials for authentication. I have no clue where to start. If anybody have implemented the similar requirement, please reply with some pointers. Also, please let me know, how i can test this in my organisation network and What should be the LDAP server credentials? Can i add our custom groups? Please reply asap.
