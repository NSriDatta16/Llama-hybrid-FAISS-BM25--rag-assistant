Upper memory limit?

Is there a limit to memory for python? I've been using a python script to calculate the average values from a file which is a minimum of 150mb big. Depending on the size of the file I sometimes encounter a MemoryError . Can more memory be assigned to the python so I don't encounter the error? EDIT: Code now below NOTE: The file sizes can vary greatly (up to 20GB) the minimum size of the a file is 150mb file_A1_B1 = open("A1_B1_100000.txt", "r") file_A2_B2 = open("A2_B2_100000.txt", "r") file_A1_B2 = open("A1_B2_100000.txt", "r") file_A2_B1 = open("A2_B1_100000.txt", "r") file_write = open ("average_generations.txt", "w") mutation_average = open("mutation_average", "w") files = [file_A2_B2,file_A2_B2,file_A1_B2,file_A2_B1] for u in files: line = u.readlines() list_of_lines = [] for i in line: values = i.split('\t') list_of_lines.append(values) count = 0 for j in list_of_lines: count +=1 for k in range(0,count): list_of_lines[k].remove('\n') length = len(list_of_lines[0]) print_counter = 4 for o in range(0,length): total = 0 for p in range(0,count): number = float(list_of_lines[p][o]) total = total + number average = total/count print average if print_counter == 4: file_write.write(str(average)+'\n') print_counter = 0 print_counter +=1 file_write.write('\n')
