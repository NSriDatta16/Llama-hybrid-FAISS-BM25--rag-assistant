Multivariate Time Series Anomalous Entry Detection

I have a multivariate data set of the following structure. It is a time series sequence of logs with additional string attribute columns id1 and id2. If too many entries come in a sequence that have similar values for either id1 or id2, I want to classify them as anomalies and flag them. I tried using LSTM, but I'm confused in how to use it for textual data, specially when the values that can come in as inputs are not always the same (one time window might have more entries than other). The similar entries may not always be together but may be very frequent in a specific time window. I am going to be classifying anomalies at the end of every day in a batch, so I'd like to feed the trained model a bunch of log entries and then find anomalies in it. I'd appreciate any help w.r.t. to what direction to look in and if LSTM is even required for this.
