Best GUI control(s) to describe a time range

I need to let end users specify a time range, to be stored and used internally as a starting date/time and ending date/time. The range could be minutes or it could be days. Has anyone discovered an interactive control that can handle this elegantly? Most GUI toolkits have a calendar control, so I could specify "start" with a calendar for the day and a text field for the time...and the same for "end". I could also replace the "end" controls with a single text field or slider that simply describes how many seconds/minutes/hours after start "end" is. What I don't like about these ideas is how much clicking, typing, and more clicking is required to describe such a simple concept. Also I have to slap the user's hand if a time is typed in that isn't recognizable as a time. Is there a cleaner implementation that I'm overlooking?
