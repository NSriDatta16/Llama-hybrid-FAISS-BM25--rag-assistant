Well, you should use an XML parser, like SimpleXML or XMLReader . However, if you want to hack something up, the following will work: $string = str_replace(" ", "", $string); $string = str_replace(" ", "", $string); $paragraphs = explode("\n", $string); This will work as long as you have one item per line. If you have everything on one line, replace the second line of code above, with: $string = str_replace(" ", "\n", $string); Good luck!
