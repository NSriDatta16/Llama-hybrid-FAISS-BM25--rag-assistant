Yes, but it does not use the idea of "significance." Indeed, it is not clear at all that zero being inside the interval is meaningful in Bayesian methods as an idea. For Frequentist models the null is held to be true and so if $\beta=0$ then that implies that if the null is not falsified then the null can be treated as provisionally true. Instead, in Bayesian methods, model selection is the rough equivalent to variable significance testing. Consider, for example, three variables $\{a,b,c\}$ being used to estimate $y$. Assuming some simple form, the possible combinations of variables that matter are $\{(a),(b),(c),(a,b),(a,c),(b,c),(a,b,c)\}.$ For simplicity, let's assume the $P(Model=(a,b)\to{y})\gg{P}(Model\ne(a,b)\to{y})$ so $P(Model=(a,b)\to{y})\gg{P}(Model=(a,b,c)\to{y})$. The difference is that $c$ is missing from the best model, so this is similar to saying $c$ is not significant. Notice that there is no requirement that $c$ is near zero.
