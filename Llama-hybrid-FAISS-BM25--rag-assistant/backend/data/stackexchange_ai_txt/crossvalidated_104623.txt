Here are a couple of things to make you stand out from the crowd: Understand the application domain or domains. That is, the business environment or other context. Understand the big picture. This is very important! People who study machine learning often get lost in the details. Think about the overall picture that your ML models will fit into. Often the ML part is just a small segment of a much larger system. Understand the whole system. Study utility and decision theory and Bayesian inference, not just whatever is now considered "the usual" ML models. Bayesian inference is just a way to formalize the notion of bringing all contextual information to bear on a problem. Utility and decision theory is about bringing values into the picture. The overall message that applies to all three points: Look at the big picture, don't get lost in the details.
