This is more of a programming than a data science question, and would therefore be better suited for stackoverflow, but this can be achieved relatively easily using a combination of sorting and grouping: ( df # sort such that the first row is within each group is the one you want .sort_values(["A", "B", "C"], ascending=[True, False, False]) # group based on column A .groupby("A") # select the first row within each group .first() # reset the index such that A is a column instead of the index .reset_index() ) Which gives the following result: A B C 1 3 85 2 3 70 3 4 90 4 5 85
