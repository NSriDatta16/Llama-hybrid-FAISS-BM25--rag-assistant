Cross-Validated Resampling Statistics in Caret

I'm confused about the resampling statistics obtained via the train() and trainControl() functions in R's Caret package. My goal is to perform cross-validation on a machine learning model for a time series by splitting the series into adjacent training/testing sets, ultimately enabling me to tune individual models and compare the different models I create. I also would like to access the model results for the individual hold out sets (that is, the testing windows during cross validation) - which is what I thought Caret saved in the model$resample object. However, when I look closely at that object, it seems that Caret is saving the in-sample results, possibly from the final model (trained on the entire data set) with predictions corresponding to the indexes of the individual hold-out sets. My questions are: Is this (the saving of in-sample rather than hold-out results) the intended behavior of the package? If so, is there a way to access the hold-out results I am looking for? Here is an example (apologies for the verbosity): ## Libraries library(caret);library(quantmod);library(TTR);require(ggplot2);require(reshape) ## Data Acquisition and Wrangling # download data from yahoo/google getSymbols("^GSPC", from="2010-01-01") # create returns series and some indicators ret
