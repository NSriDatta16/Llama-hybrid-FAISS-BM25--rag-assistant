I have heard of Microsoft Dynamics , Highrise & Zendesk CRMs as well, but how much are they manageable through Magento extensions is my major concern. Also as " Josh " said, there are extensions for SugarCRM . There are also extensions for other famous CRMs as well like Salesforce & viger in Magento. May be this post is old, but still I'm interested in knowing the details of the possibility of the integration as well. Hope it helps.
