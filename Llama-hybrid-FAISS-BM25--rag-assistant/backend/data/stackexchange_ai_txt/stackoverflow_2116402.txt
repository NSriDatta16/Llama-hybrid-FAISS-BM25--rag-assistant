I ran into this problem myself today, and read somewhere that non-integer values for the origin and size of the UILabel's frame can cause this (I know they're floats, but you know what I mean). There has got to be a more elegant solution, but this quick hack appears to have solved the problem for me: self.valueLabel.frame = CGRectMake((int) frame.origin.x, (int) frame.origin.y, (int) frame.size.width, (int) frame.size.height); If you find a better solution, please let me know, I'd love to replace this hack with something a bit more tasteful.
