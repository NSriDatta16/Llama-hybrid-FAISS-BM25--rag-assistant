I'm confused as to why you are using a grouped product for this. A grouped product should be a set of different products, such as a computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. When you have something that has sizes and colors, but is essentially the same product, you really only need to make 1 configurable product. You can create a configurable product with any number of attributes that it's based off of. If you make a configurable product based on size and color, then create all your options (simple products), Magento will be smart enough to make it work. You'll see two dropdown menus to select on the product view page, and after you select the first, the second will update accordingly. Hope that helps.
