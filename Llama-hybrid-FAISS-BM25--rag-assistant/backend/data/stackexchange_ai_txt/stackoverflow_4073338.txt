First, I assume you actually use the same code in both cases. Otherwise, start looking where the code differs. If your program gives different result on different architectures, then there's a chance that you're not being dealing with some things the right way. First thing I'd do is to turn on all possible compiler warnings and pay attention to them. If that yields nothing, I'd try a static code analysis tool. I've used coverity (commerical product), but there are also others . These tools will sometimes help you with finding errors in your programs that the compilers don't spot. When those automated options were exhausted I'd might try comparing all variables in the whole program. Depending on your program size, that could be really time-consuming.
