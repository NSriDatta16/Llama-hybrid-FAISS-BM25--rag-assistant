@MvanGeest - doing a for..in on an array is technically allowed. Arrays are still objects in javascript. The index of the array will be the key if iterated using a for..in loop. Obviously not the point of using an array in that case, but thought I would clarify. @Anurag - the forEach method is not supported in IE8 (not sure about 9) so that might not be a reliable method to use until later on in the future.
