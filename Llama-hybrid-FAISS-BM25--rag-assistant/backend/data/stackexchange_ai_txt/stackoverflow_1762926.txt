The netmask defines, which part of the IP-address is used as address for the network and which part is used for the workstations. First Example: IP1: 192.168.20.4 IP2: 192.168.192.4 NM: 255.255.0.0 Both IPs are in the same net. They can communicate with each other without needing a router. That's because the IP-addresses will result in the same bitmask when you or it with the netmask. Second Example: IP1: 192.168.20.4 IP2: 192.168.192.4 NM: 255.255.128.0 Now both IPs are in different networks because when you or the IP-addresses with the Netmask, the resulting bitmask will be different and they wont be able to communicate with each other without a router that routes between the two networks. You can test this by yourself with ipcalc .
