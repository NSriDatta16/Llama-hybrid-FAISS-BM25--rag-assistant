If I want to tell you, both are based on a same concept, and that is weight sharing . It is better to think about them in this way. In CNNs, we try to find similar patterns throughout the input which can be image, text, or other things. This can be done by sliding a same filter that its parameters do not change while scanning the image to find similar patterns. Due to the fact that an image can have multiple patterns, we employ this idea with multiple filters. On the other hand, In RNNs, the idea is that we want to find a similar patterns throughout the sequence. For instance, wherever you see a cat in a sentence, it is still a cat. Consequently, it should not matter where you see it. RNNs also employ the idea of weight sharing. They use a network that faces each input in the sequence separately to see whether a similar pattern is observed or not. However, there is a difference between CNNs and RNNs. The input of RNNs is a sequence, and the order matters . Consequently, at each time step, the RNN encounters the input of that time step, and it also receives some information from the past. You can see that these intuitions are different than yours.
