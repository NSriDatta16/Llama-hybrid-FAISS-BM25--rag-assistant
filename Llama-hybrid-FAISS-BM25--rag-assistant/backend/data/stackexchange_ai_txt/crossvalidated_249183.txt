ROC Curve - Mixed Model

I would like if it was possible that the Lord would help me in a review, lest it incur in error. If it were a simple logistic regression, I could use The Area Under an ROC Curve, but since I'm using a generalized linear mixed model with reply Binaria, can analyze the same way this output? I'm using the GLMER function with two models. One with (1 / g) (Random intercept with fixed mean ) and the other with x + (x | g) (Correlated random intercept and slope ) If not, what would you suggest to check the adjustment of the model? Thank you
