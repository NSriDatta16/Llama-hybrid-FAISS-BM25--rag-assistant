TSQL equivalent of an MS Access Crosstab query

What's the equivalent of an MS-Access crosstab query in TSQL? And Is there a better way? I have a data organised like this: Fish ID Name ---- --------- 1 Jack 2 Trout 3 Bass 4 Cat FishProperty ID FishID Property Value ---- ------ -------- ----- 1 1 Length 10 2 1 Girth 6 3 1 Weight 4 4 2 Length 6 5 2 Weight 2 6 3 Girth 12 I have a number of users who need to do reporting on the data and (obviously) it would be easier for them if they could see it like this: Fish ID Name Length Girth Weight ---- --------- ------ ----- ------ 1 Jack 10 6 4 2 Trout 6 2 3 Bass 12 My plan was to create a crosstab-like view that they could report on directly.
