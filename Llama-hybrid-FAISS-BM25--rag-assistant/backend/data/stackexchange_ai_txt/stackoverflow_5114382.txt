Without more detail, the problems posed seems to be fairly classic BI problems, where the solution is usually to prematerialize aggregate data, optimizing for query than insertion. I'd ask a simple question 1st - do you need all the data in the DB? I'd be tempted to just cook the different aggregates - all, record type etc. by time range e.g. by day or hour into a simpler, smaller rowsets using simple console apps to read rows, compute aggregates, then dump them into SQL for access by query. While it's cool to select * across all rows - unless there's real business need, resist it. With aggregate queries in mind, the No-SQL storage is a distraction, plain ol' files would be great for retaining your raw row storage, and tools like SQL are more than enough for the aggregate queries.
