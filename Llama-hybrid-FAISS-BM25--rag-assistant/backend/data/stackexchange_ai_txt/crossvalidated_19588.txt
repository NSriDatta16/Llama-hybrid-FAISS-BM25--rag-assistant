How to test homoscedasticity when the errors are DEPENDENT?

I have done a linear regression and plot the residuals. I noticed that the errors are dependent (autocorrelated), how could I test homoscedasticity of this series? I read that Breusch-Pagan test only work with independent errors. What test could I use to test if the variance is constant in this case?
