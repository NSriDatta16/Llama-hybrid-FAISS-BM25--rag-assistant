Is adding a function of time to a ARMA model still a linear time series model?

I wonder if the following model is a linear or nonlinear time series model: $$ X_t = d(t) + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i X_{t-i} + \sum_{i=0}^q b_i e_{t-i} $$ when $d(t) = ct$, $d(t) = e^t$, $d(t)=sin(t)$, and $d(t) = t^3$? According to the definitons in Tsay's Financial Time Series, I guess they are linear because $E(X_t|F_t), F_t=\{X_{t-1}, \dots, X_0\}$ is linear in $X_{t-1}, \dots, X_0$, and $Var(X_t |F_t)$ doesn't depend on $t$. But $X_t$ may be not linear in $t$, so I am not sure. p.s. There are two definitions from the book (I just used the second one), which I guess are equivalent? Definition 1: Definition 2:
