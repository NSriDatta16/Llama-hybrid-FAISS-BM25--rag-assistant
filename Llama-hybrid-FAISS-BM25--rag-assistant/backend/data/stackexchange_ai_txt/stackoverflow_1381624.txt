You use a random number generator to pick which path you go down. You have to save each state (which is really a history of N previous items) and the probabilities for that state. Then you pick a random number and decide based on it what the next state you transition to is. In your example you have a Markov chain with an N of 1 you would have a chain structure that looked something like this: -> Hello : 1.0 Hello -> World. : 0.66666 Hello -> Dolly. : 0.33333 Dolly. -> Hello : 1.0 World. -> : 0.5 World. -> Hello : 0.5 If your current state is Hello, then your next possible states are World. and Dolly.. Generate a random number between 0 and 1 and choose World. if it's less than 0.666666, otherwise choose Dolly. With an N=2 Markov chain, you get almost deterministic behavior with that input: -> Hello : 1.0 Hello -> Hello World. : 1.0 Hello World. -> World. Hello : 0.5 Hello World. -> World. : 0.5 World. Hello -> Hello Dolly. : 1.0 Hello Dolly. -> Dolly. Hello : 1.0 Dolly. Hello -> Hello World. : 1.0
