Alchemi ".NET Grid Computing Framework" http://www.gridbus.org/~alchemi/publications.html http://sourceforge.net/projects/alchemi/files/ Alchemi is a .NET grid computing framework that allows you to painlessly aggregate the computing power of intranet and Internet-connected machines into a virtual supercomputer (computational grid) and to develop applications to run on the grid. Quick Notes: Stopped being updated in 2007 version 1.0.6 (.NET 2.0). Well documented formally done so. Uses XML to define jobs. (It was all the rage in 2007 to use XML for everything) Relatively complex compared to MPAPI, but don't take this as a big negative. Would take a good bit of time to get up to speed. Is Open Source =). Is Extendible and can be used in conjunction with other cluster technologies via a Gridbus broker ( http://www.gridbus.org ) Seems widely used (see publications http://www.gridbus.org/~alchemi/publications.html ) =)
