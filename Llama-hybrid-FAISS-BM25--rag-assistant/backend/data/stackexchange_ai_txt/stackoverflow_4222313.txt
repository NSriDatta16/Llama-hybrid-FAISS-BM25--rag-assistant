I would not do it this way, even with malloc because of memory fragmentation once the array becomes big. And with shmget you will get an issue also with fd's (one fd per shmget is used). I would recommend doing it this way (uncompiled since no C compiler is close) double* matrix = malloc( sizeof(double)*numrows*numcols); double value = matrix[actrow*numrows+actcol]; free ( matrix); You have to remember numrows throughout your app, but this way it is much more clean from the memory side. Also, now it is one big chunk and you can do the same thing with shmget/shmat.
