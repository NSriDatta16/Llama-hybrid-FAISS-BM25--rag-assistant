How to Bayesian update on two events which occur with measure zero?

To illustrate what I mean please consider the following hypothetical scenario: A person's favorite number $x\in[-1,1]$ is randomly distributed with atomless density function $f(x)$. Furthermore, suppose that this person (after realizing what their favorite number $x$ is) calls out the absolute value of this favorite number i.e. $|x|$. As an observer you know the structure, i.e., distribution of $x$ and the behavior of the person. Thus, after observing say $|x|=0.5$ you know that the person's favorite number is either 0.5 or -0.5. But as a Bayesian updater what should you belief be? Does it make sense to say that you believe the persons favorite number is 0.5 with probability $$\mathbb{P}[x=0.5 \, |\, |x|=0.5]=\frac{\mathbb{P}[|x|=0.5 \,|\, x=0.5] \, f(0.5)}{f(0.5)+f(-0.5)}=\frac{ f(0.5)}{f(0.5)+f(-0.5)} ?$$ I suspect not, since any distribution is equivalent (in various senses) to changes on events of measure zero. But what should be done in such a scenario? I would have thought such a problem would arise in economic theory (signaling games)but I have yet to find an reference dealing with this issue (any suggestions here would also be much appreciated).
