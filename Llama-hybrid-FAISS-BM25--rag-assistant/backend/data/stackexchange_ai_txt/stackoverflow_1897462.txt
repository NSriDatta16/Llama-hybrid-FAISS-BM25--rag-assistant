Your reasons behind the design are insane, but they're not yours :) NTFS can handle what you're trying to do. This shouldn't be much of a problem. Yes, you might eventually have fragmentation problems if you run low on disk space, but make sure that you have copious amounts of space and you shouldn't have a problem. If you're a Windows shop, just use IIS. I really don't think you will have much of a problem with this architecture. Just keep it simple like you're doing and things should be fine.
