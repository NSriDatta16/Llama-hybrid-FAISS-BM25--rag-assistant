In the end I used #pragma warning disable [warning no] some code that triggers a warning #pragma warning enable [warning no] in my code, as per http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/441722ys.aspx . This works fine and although needs entering once for each compiler warning, it seems to be the best fit.
