With MySQL (and maybe other DBMS ?), you can execute queries across several database schemas . Example: Schema sales : table product Schema common : tables person, country Query example : SELECT * FROM sales.product prod LEFT JOIN common.person pers ON prod.customer_person_id = pers.id LEFT JOIN common.country c ON pers.country_id = c.id etc. This way, you can organize your tables into schemas, avoiding hundreds of tables with unnecessary long names (due to uncomfortable prefixes) into one single schema. Plus, when you have to query on a single schema, you don't need to prefix tables, provided that you have selected that schema with USE myschema or mysql_select_db() if you use PHP.
