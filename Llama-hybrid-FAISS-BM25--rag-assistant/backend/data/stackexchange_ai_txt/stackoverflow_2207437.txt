If you need to optimize this query specifically in MySQL, why not add istrial to the end of the existing index on Store_ID and Feature_ID. This will completely index away the WHERE clause and will be able to grab the COUNT from the cardinality summary of the index if the table is MyISAM. All of your existing queries that leverage the current index will be unchanged as well. edit: also, I'm unsure of why you're doing COUNT(viewed_date) instead of COUNT(*) ? Is viewed_date ever NULL? If not, you can just use the COUNT(*) which will eliminate the need to go to the .MYD file if you take it in conjunction with my other suggestion.
