A2: If you create a derivative work from your data and OSM data then IF you distribute it you have to do it under a GPL license. You can keep it all to yourself if you like, or use it internally in an organisation (possibly). Distribution is the thing the GPL really covers. So suppose you have traffic incident data (which is yours) and you use OSM data (GPL) to create a web map with your incidents on top of a road map, your data doesn't become public domain. You're not distributing a new derived product. But if you use your traffic incident data to create a new data set you can't put that on the internet with a license that restricts copying and distribution (because the OSM component 'infects' the whole data set). As I understand it, I am not a lawyer etc. Although I did have a girlfriend doing a PhD in Law and I read some of her textbooks...
