How can my shell script control the placement of a zenity window?

I'm using zenity to post a simple notification when my spam-filter daemon filters a group of messages. Currently this message is posted to the middle of the screen, which is obtrusive. I want to post it to the upper left corner. However, zenity does not honor the -geometry option which is supposed to be standard for all X applications, and its documentation gives options for controlling window height and width, but not placement. Is there a way to control the (x,y) coordinate at which a zenity window is posted? If not, is there a way to solve this problem by tinkering with X resources or the window manager (I'm using the fvwm )? EDIT : The following do not work in ~/.fvwm2rc ( fvwm version 2.5.26): Style "Information" PositionPlacement -0 -0 Style "Zenity" PositionPlacement -0 -0 They also don't work with the -0 -0 dropped, as suggested in the man page. (The window title for zenity --info is "Information".) Interestingly, zenity was ignoring my earlier window-manager directive that windows should be placed manually by default. EDIT : Among many other fascinating pieces of information, xprop(1) reports this about the zenity window: _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS): program specified location: 0, 0 program specified minimum size: 307 by 128 program specified maximum size: 307 by 128 window gravity: NorthWest WM_CLASS(STRING) = "zenity", "Zenity" WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "Information" WM_NAME(STRING) = "Information" Despite this apparently encouraging report, the window is not in fact posted at the location 0,0 :-( I know the Style command is taking effect because I added the !Borders option, and sure enough the zenity window posts without borders... but still in the center of the damn screen!
