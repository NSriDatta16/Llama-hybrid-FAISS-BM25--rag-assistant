The problem was the BitmapCacheOption option, changing to BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad works. With BitmapCacheOption.None the BitmapSource isn’t decoded until the image is rendered, but the stream with the png in it is already disposed at that point. If you cache OnLoad, it’ll decode right away and cache the results, rather than trying to decode later when the stream no longer exists.
