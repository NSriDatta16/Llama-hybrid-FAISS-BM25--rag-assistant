System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionInternal..ctor: Unspecified error

After several hours (~6 hours Win7 64bit, ~24hours WinXP) of running multi-threaded (.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 WinForms) desktop application using .mdb files as backend I'm getting the following runtime error: Exception -> Unspecified error StackTrace -> at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionInternal..ctor(OleDbConnectionString constr, OleDbConnection connection) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionFactory.CreateConnection(DbConnectionOptions options, Object poolGroupProviderInfo, DbConnectionPool pool, DbConnection owningObject) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.CreateNonPooledConnection(DbConnection owningConnection, DbConnectionPoolGroup poolGroup) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.GetConnection(DbConnection owningConnection) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionClosed.OpenConnection(DbConnection outerConnection, DbConnectionFactory connectionFactory) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection.Open() at NetworkManager.SearchInputFileHandler.GetInputRows(SearchProgramTypeEnumeration programType, Int32 startRowNum, Int32 rowsQty, Boolean setupInProgress, Boolean filterOutUninitializedRows) It looks like this is an OleDbProvider bug. Have you seen/experienced something like that? Context: (1) I do exclusively use using (OleDbConnection cnn = new OleDbConnection("{{mymdbConnectionStringHere}}")) { cnn.Open(); ... } (2) I do use IN clause in some select SQL expressions to point to external MDB tables. I guess the issues is caused by case (2). Although that's still a hypothesis here to check (some code fixes are needed in the core code of my application, and I'm considring now will that be worth fixing, or I should better switch to MS SQL backend.) Thank you.
