Tracking/monitoring File/Folder copy activities on windows

I would like to know if there are any ways to programmatically detect or monitor the file or folder being copied either by copy command(like on command prompt-- copy a b) or by using drag/drop(ctrl+c and ctr+v). It would be helpful if you could give some pointers( preferably some APIs in vc++) thanks and regards Dinakara K
