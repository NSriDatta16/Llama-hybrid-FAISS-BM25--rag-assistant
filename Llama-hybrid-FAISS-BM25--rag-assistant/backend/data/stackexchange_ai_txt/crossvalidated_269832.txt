To address your query on the logistic regression first, the only time this would be the case is if you wanted to model age as a binary variable, e.g. 1 for people over a certain age, 0 for those under. If this is not the case, then your variable is not nominal and therefore would not be a binary dependent variable. While one would need to see your data up close in order to make a determination, the normal distribution would seem appropriate. You could test for the same using a test such as Shapiro-Wilk. The linear regression you have specified seems fine. With that being said, given that your model is incorporating age as a variable, there is a possibility that your data will show unequal variance across this variable and thus your model should be tested for heteroskedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test. Also, test your model for multicollinearity with a VIF test to ensure your independent variables are not showing strong correlations with each other.
