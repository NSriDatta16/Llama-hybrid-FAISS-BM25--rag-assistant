php object oriented visibility

I'm a little confused about this paragraph on OO visibilty in PHP. was curious if someone could explain it to me. examples would be GREAT! my brain is not thinking clear. http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php The first paragraph reads The visibility of a property or method can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private. Class members declared public can be accessed everywhere. Members declared protected can be accessed only within the class itself and by inherited and parent classes . Members declared as private may only be accessed by the class that defines the member. how can a parent class access a childs class member?
