If you want to see how cholesterol is affected by the different variables (sleep, exercise, and calorie intake), I would run a multiple regression with cholesterol as your dependent variable. After running your regression, you will be able to interpret the independent variables. These interpretations will tell you how each of the independent variables affects cholesterol. PCA is generally used as a variable reducing technique. It is used when you find multicollinearity between variables in your regression. Thus, it will reduce the collinearity and make your regression coefficients more reliable. Since you will only have 3 variables in your regression, collinearity should not be a problem (at least I would hope not as the variables are all somewhat different). I hope this helps!
