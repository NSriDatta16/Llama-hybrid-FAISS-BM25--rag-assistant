I have used Metrologic's barcode scanner in one of the projects of the company I worked for. We found keyboard wedge as the most elegant and flexible solution. The scanner will send you specific key (I can't remember which one, I think you can also set it to your own pleasure) before and after sending the exact barcode number. So, just wait for the specific key from the keyboard and read barcode number until you hit ending key. Once again, we found this most elegant solution for our needs and this approach was rather easy to implement.
