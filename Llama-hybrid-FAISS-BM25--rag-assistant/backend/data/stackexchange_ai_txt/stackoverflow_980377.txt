Find the lowest unused number

I've setup a std map to map some numbers, at this point I know what numbers I'm mapping from an to, eg: std::map myMap; map[1] = 2; map[2] = 4; map[3] = 6; Later however, I want to map some numbers to the lowest number possilbe that is not in the map, eg: map[4] = getLowestFreeNumberToMapTo(map); // I'd like this to return 1 map[5] = getLowestFreeNumberToMapTo(map); // I'd like this to return 3 Any easy way of doing this? I considered building an ordered list of numbers as I added them to the map so I could just look for 1, not find it, use it, add it etc.
