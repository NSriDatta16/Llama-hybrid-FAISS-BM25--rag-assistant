Is autocorrelation of residuals a problem in machine learning?

Let's assume I have a random forest model and the residuals of the model are autocorrelated. Is this a problem? As an example, let's assume I have two different random forest models, A and B, with a similar predictive performance. The residuals of model A are less autocorrelated than the residuals of model B. Should I prefer model A?
