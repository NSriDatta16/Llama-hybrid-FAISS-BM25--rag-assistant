Alright, I got it! The Zend Framework with Magento isn't really broken... but they are doing things a little different than normal.: 1) It is normal to comment out the require_once() statements in Zend when you enable "lazy loading" with the Zend Loader. It's a performance thing: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html 2) It is not normal to comment them out in the Application.php and Loader.php classes, however: [keep the] require_once() calls within Zend_Application and Zend_Loader_Autoloader, as these classes will fail without them. So, the answer is to just add the 3 missing require_once() statements yourself when enabling Loader.php. Here is my new code that works (in my apps index.php): bootstrap() ->run(); Now I am off and running! The problem was that I just didn't really know how the auto-loader was set up. I hope this helps someone!
