Logistics regression with polynomial features vs neural networks for classification

I am taking Andrew Ng's Coursera class on machine learning. He mentions that training a logistic regression model with polynomial features would be very expensive for certain tasks compared to training a neural network. Why is that though? I mean, when we talk about neural networks we're usually looking at a model with a very large number of parameters so why would logistic regression be more computationally expensive? PS: Here's some context (at the beginning of an exercise on neural networks): In the previous part of this exercise, you implemented multi-class logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits. However, logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier (You could add more features, such as polynomial features, to logistic regression, but that can be very expensive to train).
