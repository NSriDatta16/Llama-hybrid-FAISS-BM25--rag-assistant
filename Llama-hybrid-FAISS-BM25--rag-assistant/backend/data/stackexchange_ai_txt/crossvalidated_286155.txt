I would approach your problem as a time series prediction using supervised learning. It means: Every hour I would create a feature vector from a fixed size history time window (for example past 24 hours). Features could be the income (24 times), sum of income for past 1 hour, 2 hours, etc. Differences between incomes, is a working day, is a holiday, day of the week feature, hour, etc. More about feature engineering for time series Make predictions for next 24 hours I think there are 2 ways. a) One model would give you 24 numbers b) Model would give you just the prediction for the next hour. The result can be used as input for predicting next hour. You would get income prediction for the end of the day be summing all hour income predictions (and historical incomes) for the particular day. Another useful link and other about the time series on the same web.
