The very fact that the Markov chain can be characterized by a constant transition matrix means that it is homogeneous. It may be easier to understand the concepts that you're struggling with with a simpler matrix. Consider $$A=\frac 1 3\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1 &2 \\ 2 & 1\end{array}\right)$$ This matrix will switch the relative sizes of the two states: if we have $v_2 = Av_1$ , the first entry of $v_2$ will be greater than the second iff the first entry of $v_1$ is smaller than the second. So which entry is greater depends on the parity of the power of $A$ . However, remember that homogeneity is about conditional probability. While the behavior of a particular starting state depends on the parity of the power, the conditional behavior doesn't: if the first entry of $A^nv_1$ is greater than the second, then the second entry of $A^{n+1}v_1$ is greater than the first. That statement is true regardless of the parity of $n$ . Homogeneity is what we can say about $A^{n+1}v$ conditional on $A^{n}v$ . Since $A^{n+1}v$ is by definition equal to $A(A^{n}v)$ , we know that the transition probabilities from $A^{n}v$ to $A^{n+1}v$ are constant, and given by $A$ .
