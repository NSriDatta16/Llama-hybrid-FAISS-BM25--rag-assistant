In general, the actual coverage probability will never be equal to the nominal probability when you are working with a discrete distribution. The confidence interval is defined as a function of the data. If you are working with the binomial distribution, there are only finitely many possible outcomes ($ n+1$ to be precise), so there are only finitely many possible confidence intervals. Since the parameter $ p $ is continuous, it's pretty easy to see that the coverage probability (which is a function of $ p $) can do no better than be approximately 95% (or whatever). It is generally true that methods based on the CLT will have coverage probabilities below the nominal value, but other methods can actually be more conservative.
