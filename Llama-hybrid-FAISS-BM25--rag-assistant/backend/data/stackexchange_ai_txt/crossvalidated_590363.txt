Next to Dave's +1 numerical example, consider an applied one, explaining wages as a function of covariates like ability, gender etc. It is well-documented that ability and gender both have an influence on wages (i.e., $\beta_1,\beta_2$ both are nonzero), because being more able is good for your earnings and there is such a thing as wage discrinimation. Also, we may assume that gender and ability are independent - women are no more/less able than men in general/on average. That, however, does not rule out that there is an interaction with ability ( $\beta_3\neq0$ ). For example, there might be more wage discrimination for high-skilled women than for low-skilled women, where wages for the latter group may involve less individual negotiation due to wage-setting negotiated via unions and smaller glass-ceilings effects etc.
