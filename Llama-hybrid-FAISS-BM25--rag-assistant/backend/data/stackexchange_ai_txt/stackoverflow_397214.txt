How many types should be implementing the Repository pattern?

I am trying to use the repository pattern in an instance of storing pictures. What I do is save the actual pics in a directory on disk but save data about the pics and what pics go with what object in a database. I was wondering if I should use 2 interfaces for the storage, like IStorePicRepo and IStorePicDataRepo or have 1 interface and implement it in 1 class. Sounds to me like it should NOT be implemented by the same class since we are dealing with 2 different storage mechanisms. Any thoughts?
