How to apply Bayesian Optimization to a function depending only on categorical variables?

I would like to apply Bayesian Optimization (BO) to a black-box function depending only on multiple categorical variables. In my application, each categorical variable has 3 possible categories. I have 2 questions: BO usually utilizes a surrogate function based on Gaussian Processes that approximates the true black-box function to minimize. How this should be adapted to deal with purely categorical variables? BO is known to be less effective for variable space of dimension larger than 20. I understand that this threshold is only a rough estimate, but can I expect BO to still be effective for a function with more than 20 arguments, given the fact that these variables are all categorical (with 3 possible categories)?
