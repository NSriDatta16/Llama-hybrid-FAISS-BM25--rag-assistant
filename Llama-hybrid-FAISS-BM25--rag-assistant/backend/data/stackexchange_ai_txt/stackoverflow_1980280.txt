Tomcat does not have a built-in JTA implementation, and so Spring will fail if you try and use JtaTransactionManager . However, you can use JOTM , which is can be used within Tomcat to provide such functionality. I have to ask, though - why do you want JTA to begin with? Isn't the hibernate transaction manager sufficient? If you find yourself needing JTA support, then you may want to consider using a full JavaEE app server (JBoss would be the obvious choice, since it includes Tomcat as its servlet engine), and make use of the proper, fully-supported JTA implementation there.
