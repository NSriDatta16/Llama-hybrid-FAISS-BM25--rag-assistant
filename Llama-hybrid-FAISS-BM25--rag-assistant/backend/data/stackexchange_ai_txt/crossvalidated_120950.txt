Data point that minimizes all four parameters

First of all, I must say I'm in no way a data scientist or anything; I just happened to come across a problem, and I am attempting to use statistics to find the best solution. The problem is about splitting each of six sets of items in two , with each combination having four parameters, and finding the split that minimizes four parameters . Specifically, I'm trying to optimize the book schedule, so that my desk mate and I can bring the required schoolbooks to school with the least effort - that is, with minimal total weight for me $W_m$, minimal total weight for my desk mate $W_d$, minimal swapped books for me $S_m$, and minimal swapped books for my desk mate $S_d$. How should I seek the best splitting, i.e. the combination that minimizes all four parameters? My first thought was simple weighted Euclidean distance: simply assign a score $S = \sqrt{\alpha(W_m^2+W_d^2)+\beta(S_m^2+S_d^2)}$ to each combination, and then evaluate the $n$ lowest scores for some weights $(\alpha,\:\beta)$. However, my concern is that such a score would possibly give too much weight to suboptimal solutions, no matter the choice of weights. This seems especially true considering that [I read somewhere that] the Euclidean distance tends to favour closer points much more than farther ones. Perhaps an improvement could be computing the average weight $W=\frac{W_m+W_d}2$ and the average swap number $S=\frac{S_m+S_d}2$, and then computing the weighted Euclidean distance between these, $S=\sqrt{\alpha W^2+\beta S^2}$. Any thoughts?
