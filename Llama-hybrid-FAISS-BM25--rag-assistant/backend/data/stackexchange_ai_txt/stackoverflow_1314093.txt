This is maybe not the answer you were hoping for, but it's a thought that might help you out... Question: Must you really use merge modules? The idea of MSMs is great, but in practice they don't work as well as you might wish. Instead, embedding full MSIs is often cleaner, because (a) they can successfully install and commit before your app installion begins, (b) they retain control of their own versioning (so you can have them update the files in the next version), (c) you can uninstall them (and all their files) with your uninstallation process, and more. For the Microsoft libraries that they provide as MSMS, there's always an MSI version of the redistributable that you can use instead. Or did you make the merge modules yourself/ves, for this app? In that case, they would be better as Components in your MSI, as they would follow the same install and uninstall process as the rest of it. And if you have multiple apps that use the same component(s), you can give them the same component IDs and they end up sharing (e.g. when you have 2 apps with a shared component installed and you uninstall one of them, the shared components will remain as long as the other app remains installed).
