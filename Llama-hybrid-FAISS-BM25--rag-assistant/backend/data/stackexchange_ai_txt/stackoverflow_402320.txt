I think that would depend a bit on the problem domain. You might want to store learned "facts" or "relationships" in a DB so that they can be easily searched. If you are training a neural network, then you'd probably just dump the network state to a file. In general, I think once you have a mechanism that does the learning, the appropriate storage representation will be relatively apparent. Maybe if you can flesh out your plan on what kind of learning you'd like to implement, people can provide more guidance on what the implementation should look like, including the state storage.
