This looks like a good problem for machine learning, so I'll concentrate on this group of methods. First and the most obvious idea is the kNN algorithm. There you first calculate the similarity among viewers and then predict the missing votes with the average vote on this picture cast by similar users. For details see Wikipedia . Another idea is to grow unsupervised random forest on this data (either way, with attributes in images or people, whatever is better) and impute missing data based on the forest structure; the whole method is implemented and described in R randomForest package, look for rfImpute function. Finally, you can restructure the problem to a plain classification task, say make an object of each zero in matrix and try to think of some reasonable descriptors (like average viewer vote, average image vote, vote of a most, second most, ... similar viewer, same with image, possibly some external data (average hue of image, age of voter, etc). And then try various classifiers on this data (SVM, RF, NB, ...). There are also some more complex possibilities; for an overview you can look for Netflix prize challenge (which was a similar problem) solutions.
