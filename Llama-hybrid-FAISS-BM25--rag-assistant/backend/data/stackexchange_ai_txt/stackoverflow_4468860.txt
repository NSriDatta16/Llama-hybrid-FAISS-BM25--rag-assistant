I'm solving a very similar problem for myself right now, using Nucular , which might suit your needs. It's a file-system based storage and seems very fast indeed. (It comes with an example app that indexes the whole python source tree ) It's concurrent-safe, requires no external libraries and is pure python. It searches rapidly and has powerful fulltext search, indexing and so on - kind of a specialised, in-process, native python-dict store after the manner of the trendy Couchdb and mongodb, but much lighter. It does have limitations, though - it can't store or query on nested dictionaries, so not every JSON type can be stored in it. Moreover, although its text searching is powerful, its numerical queries are weak and unindexed. Nonetheless, it may be precisely what you are after.
