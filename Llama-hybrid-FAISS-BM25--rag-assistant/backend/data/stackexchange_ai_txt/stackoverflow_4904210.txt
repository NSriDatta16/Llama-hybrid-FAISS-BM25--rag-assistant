I believe the "most optimized" approach is to embed Perl in your application. Your second option is not really feasible, AFAIK. Since Perl is not compiled, your only other option would be to invoke the interpreter (e.g. through a system() or exec() -family call), as per your first option. Now, there is quite a difference between embedding an interpreter in your code, and writing one line of code to call an external program, so you have to consider exactly how much optimization you need. The performance difference might even be minimal, so I strongly suggest that you try the easy way first, measuring your success.
