Magento : create ajax dropdown populated with labels of 3 product's attributes.

Greetings, I'm, unluckily in need of having this : Product has (lets say) 6 attributes with "Yes/No" values. I need a dropdown on that product's page that will populate with attributes with "yes" value. attributes are :bundle1,bundle2....,bundle6. When selection is made - I need to know whats have been selected to pass that to php on that page. I have no idea what preexists in Magento (in terms of Ajax snippets) that could be used for this, searching for solution... I used additional request.js and pulled attributes from a newly created table in DB (manually, for 1 product, just for test) and it works. But, thats not idea, I dont want to do it manually everytime. Syntax is killling me. Thank you.
