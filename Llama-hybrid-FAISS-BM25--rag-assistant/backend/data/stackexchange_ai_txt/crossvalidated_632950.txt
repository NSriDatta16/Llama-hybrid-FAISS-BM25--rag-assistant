Is the use of logistic regression with 'ordered entry of variables' in this paper statistically meaningful?

I'm reading a paper which says: In performing the logistic regression analyses, the order of entry of predictor variables was guided by our theoretical rationale and our major hypotheses . In each analysis, control variables reflective of selection effects (income-to-needs ratio, beliefs about the benefits of maternal employment) were entered into the regression equation first, and then the main effect of a mother or child characteristic was tested. The main effect of a child-care variable was tested next, and then the interaction between (i.e., the product of) the mother/child variable and the child-care variable. I don't understand what's happening here. I think they are running three separate logistic regressions, each with more predictors, and using different regressions to test the significance of different terms. Is this statistically meaningful? What advantage is there to this approach, compared to just throwing all the variables into a single logistic regression? NB There are actually 5 mother/child vars & 5 childcare vars -- but they are running 25 separate analyses, looking at each possible pair, so only look at one variable of each kind in each analysis.
