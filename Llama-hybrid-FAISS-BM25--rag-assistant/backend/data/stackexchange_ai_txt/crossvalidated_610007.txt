If sample average converges a.s. in an iid sample, must it converge to the mean?

SLLN tells us that if $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid, with $X_1$ having finite mean $\mu$ , then their sample average converges almost surely to $\mu$ . Suppose instead we know that $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid and their sample average converges almost surely to a constant. Can we argue that the $X_1$ has a finite mean and hence that such a constant must be the mean of $X_1$ ? Note this is a follow up to this question.
