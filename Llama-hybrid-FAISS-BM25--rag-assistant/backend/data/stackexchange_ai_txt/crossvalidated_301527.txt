classification based on evolution of features in time

I have signals, from this signal I do windows analysis and extract features. So from 1D signals of 882000 points I get 200 vectors (200 windows of analysis) of 3 values (200*3 matrix, Let's call "InputMatrix"). I would like to make classification (in an objective of machine learning, with supervised learning), to separate 6 types (6 classes) of signals. The differences are the time evolution of my extracted features. What would be a good methods for this ? SVM ? Artificial neural network ? My main question is about taking in account time evolution 2nd question : what if I get different size of "inputMatrix" for each sample ?
