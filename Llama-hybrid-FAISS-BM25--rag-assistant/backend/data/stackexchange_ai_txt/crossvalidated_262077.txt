what should be done first optimization or feature selection?

I would like to know whether hyperparameter optimization should be done before feature selection or after. If I do it before feature selection, I guess, I will choose better features (as the classifier is tuned). But most pipelines on internet (google for machine learning pipeline) always put optimization at the end. So, what is it recommended? What is a better procedure to do?
