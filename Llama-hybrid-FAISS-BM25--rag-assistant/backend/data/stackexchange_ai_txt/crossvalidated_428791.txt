Why forecast::accuracy() mape is working with 0/0?

I'm learning now some metrics of goodness about time series forecasting, using the forecast package, but I'm stuck in something that surely I've not understood well. I have two vectors, of real data, and forecast data, and I'd like to calculate MAPE. real So I decided to try to calculate myself the MAPE, using the docs , so: mean(abs((real-pred)/real*100)) [1] NaN And clearly I got NaN , because I have a (0-0)/0 . My question is: am I calculating wrong manually the MAPE, or the function has a kind of na.rm = TRUE ?
