Yes, you can use CSS obviously, but you can also leverage the Theming API in Drupal. You can override a node type output with node-(type).tpl.php, and do a lot more. http://drupal.org/node/17565 http://drupal.org/node/11816 Create your file, and do var_dump($node); to see what you have to work with.
