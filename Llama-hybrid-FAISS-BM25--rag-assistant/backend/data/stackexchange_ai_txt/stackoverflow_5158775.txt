I suppose one option would be to use the TouchesXX event(s). For instance you could pick up on touches dragged and in code you could fire the button event handlers (the IBActions). Of course you would have to know the locations of the other buttons to determine if they have been dragged over. I'm not sure if that is what you are looking for but that would be one option.
