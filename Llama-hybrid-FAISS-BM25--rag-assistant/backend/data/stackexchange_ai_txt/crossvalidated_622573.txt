How to interpret autocorrelation charts?

Provided the following examples of data, p-value and autocorrelation charts: How are we supposed to interpret the charts on the rightmost column? Just by looking at these charts, what can we say about the data? In some articles it is mentioned that what is inside the confidence intervals is "statistically insignificant". This is counter intuitive to me provided that my understanding of a "confidence interval" is that we can trust whatever value is inside it. What do these confidence bands mean? Disclaimer: I have a very weak background on statistics so if you answer please try to not go too deep into underlying statistics concepts if possible.
