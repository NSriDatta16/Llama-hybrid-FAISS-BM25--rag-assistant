How to embed ics file into google calendar

I'm new to using the Google Calendar API. I can create .ics calendars using a php app. I would like to know if it is possible for Google Calendar to allow embedding of those calendars on to my website without having to add it to an account. I really like the google interface, and if this could work in any way, that would be great.
