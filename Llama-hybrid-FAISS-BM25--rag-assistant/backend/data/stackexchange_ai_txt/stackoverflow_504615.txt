I would have chosen to use a DB. You describe a scenario where you are going to store a large quantity of messages. You do not provide much information about the system, but i would guess that you probably would like to sort, group and apply several other properties to the messages. It would be much easier and probably faster to keep the message with its attributes in a DB instead of using file storage. When it comes to compression I do not know which of the methods is most effective. You should probably try both before choosing.
