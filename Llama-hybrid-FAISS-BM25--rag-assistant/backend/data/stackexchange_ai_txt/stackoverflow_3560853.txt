I usually get this errors when I'm trying to echo something that is not defined. It's not an PHP error, only a notice. This is produced by the function error_reporting(); on the main index.php. If you open this index.php file, you will see: /* |--------------------------------------------------------------- | PHP ERROR REPORTING LEVEL |--------------------------------------------------------------- | | By default CI runs with error reporting set to ALL. For security | reasons you are encouraged to change this when your site goes live. | For more info visit: http://www.php.net/error_reporting | */ error_reporting(E_ALL); You've two options: Don't print a variable that is not defined. Change the error_reporting(); with a non-notice prints. Like: error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE); . Wish this helps you!
