I see issues with your reasoning before even getting to the Bayesian setup. We absolutely do have to make assumptions when we use the central limit theorem! At the very least, we assume that the variance is finite. Perhaps we’re usually willing to make this assumption, but finite variance is not a given; it is an assumption. We shouldn’t have to rely on the central limit theorem to test a mean. That allows us to use z-tests and t-tests, but there are many other tests. Means aren’t always the values of interest, and if we want to test the variance, for instance, the central limit theorem is not as helpful since we aren’t testing the z-stat that the CLT says is asymptotically normal.
