different results with MEKA vs Scikit-learn!

I have a multilabel data which I've trained using different classifiers with MEKA (multilabel version of WEKA ) and the evaluation results (e.g. accuracy) that MEKA gives me are different from those I get from the same classifiers of scikit-learn . I am using Binary Relevance method (which is both in MEKA and scikit-multilearn), because of my data being multilabel. And for instance, I am using SVM which is SMO in MEKA (and WEKA) and linearSVC in sklearn. Now the accuracy I get from 10-fold cross-validation with BR>SMO in MEKA is about 50% where I get something around 20% accuracy from BinaryRelevanvce>LinearSVC . Other evaluation measures (e.g. f1-score, hamming loss etc.) don't match as well. I tried to give all the parameters I could find in the input of LinearSVC , the same value as those of SMO but there's no luck. My Python code would be like this: from skmultilearn.problem_transform import BinaryRelevance from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC my_classifier = BinaryRelevance( classifier=LinearSVC(C=1, random_state=1, tol=0.001, max_iter=10000, dual=False), require_dense=[True, True]) I must add that using BR>SMO in MEKA to train and evaluate the model would take almost an hour on my data, but sklearn's linearSVC (with skmultilern's BinaryRelevance ) takes less than 10 minutes on the same data (hence the lower accuracy). And by the way, I'm using accuracy_score method in sklearn.metrics for accuracy. So my question is what am I missing? How can I get the same accuracy from SVM in MEKA and scikit-learn ?
