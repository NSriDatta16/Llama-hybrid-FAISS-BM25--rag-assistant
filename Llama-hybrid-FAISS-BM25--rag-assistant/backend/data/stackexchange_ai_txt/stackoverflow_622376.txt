The file /proc/loadavg has the systems current load. You can just write a bash script to check it, and if its low then run the command. Then you can add it to /etc/cron.d to run it periodically. This file contains information about the system load. The first three numbers represent the number of active tasks on the system - processes that are actually running - averaged over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. The next entry shows the instantaneous current number of runnable tasks - processes that are currently scheduled to run rather than being blocked in a system call - and the total number of processes on the system. The final entry is the process ID of the process that most recently ran. Example output: 0.55 0.47 0.43 1/210 12437
