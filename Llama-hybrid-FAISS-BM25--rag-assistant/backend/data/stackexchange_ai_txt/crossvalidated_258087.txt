How do I compute the correlation between two features and their output class?

I just read these two quotes in a paper and wondered how I do this. For each classifier, one selects a subset of the input features according to their correlation to the corresponding class. and Compute the correlation between each feature and Yi the output for class i. Source: Dimensionality Reduction Through Classifier Ensembles Can you tell me how to accomplish that?
