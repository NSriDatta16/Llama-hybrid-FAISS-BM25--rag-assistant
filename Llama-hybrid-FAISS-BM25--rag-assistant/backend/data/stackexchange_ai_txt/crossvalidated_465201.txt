With LDA, documents are represented as bags of words. Each word contributes to a distribution over topics for the document which you can treat as a sort of document embedding. The contribution of the single words (or topic distribution for a single-word document) can be interpreted as a word embedding. However, I am not aware of anyone using LDA in this way.
