There are several ways of interpreting random forest predictions. ELI5 package ( http://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html ) implements a number of those. The most relevant ones for random forests would be TreeInterpreter ( http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-random-forests/ ) and LIME ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938 ) Those will not give you split thresholds, but they will tell you which features were most important for classifying a particular example. These should be taken with a grain of salt, as the results can be counter-intuitive in some cases (e.g. if you use a decision tree to learn the XOR function).
