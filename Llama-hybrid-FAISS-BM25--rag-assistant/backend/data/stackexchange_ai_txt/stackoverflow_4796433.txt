What should be the optimal way to find the average of a large number of integers?

Each of the integers can be as large as the size of an integer itself (Java int-32 bits), so storing the sum of the integer numbers in an integer variable isn't an option. I'm afraid using Java BigInts might affect the performance badly. Right now I'm trying divide and conquer while using long to store the sum. Are there any better solutions?
