Statistical test for boolean value groups

Intro This question is somewhat of a prequel to this one - but can be seen also as a standalone! I have two distinct populations/measurements of boolean values: $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{m_1},x_i \in \{0,1\},|x|=m_1$ and $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^{m_2},y_i\in\{0,1\},|y|=m_2$ . Each $x_i$ (and $y_i$ ) is independent of the other boolean values. These numbers represent activity values ( $1$ = active , $0$ = inactive ) of two different group of models, namely the good ones ( $x$ 's) and the bad ones ( $y$ 's). I wanted to find a measurement of how much the (mean) activity of the good models is different than the bad models' activity . So, I started with the average values $a_1=mean(x)$ and $a_2=mean(y)$ and took the difference: $d=a_1-a_2$ . Then I wanted to include a penalty related to the amount of models $m_1,m_2$ and this was solved in this question by introducing a proper scaling function for the difference $d$ . The problem I was considering that if I had two populations of continuous measurements, then I would probably do a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (use wilcox.test in R for example) and get also a p-value + location parameter shift estimation (a kind of $d$ as is in the respective implementation) for this (for the boolean case, ranking methods are useless right?). So, the p-value would tell how sure I am about this difference - which is kind of what I wanted to solve numerically (by let's say inserting the uncertainty in the final formula) in this other question . All in all, I need a statistical test that would compare boolean values and get me as a result a p-value and the d difference (or similar) so to speak. What I tried So, since I work with two different and independent set of boolean values $\{x_i\}$ and $\{y_i\}$ the words binomial distribution and bionomial test came into my mind (from loooong ago :) But after reading about them for a while and playing with the respective R functions, it turned out not I wanted this to be. The most significant problem for me was that I do not know the probability of success , i.e. $p=P(x_i=1)$ (or $y_i$ for that matter) - actually that's what I want to know for each model category! I tried to use the average $a_1=mean(x)=p$ and then to take a value of the cumulative distribution but it does not give results representative to what I want (the average activity). And the binomial test does not come close to what I want either. For example: $x=\{0,0,0,0,1,0\}, m_1=n=6,p=1/6=0.1667$ and then I would calculate the $P(X\geq 1)=0.665$ , which is way higher than expected. Maybe I am overthinking it, but I believe there should be something close to what I want to do with this boolean dataset that I have. Any directions for distribution(s) or statistical tests that can accommodate my case are welcome!
