Go for iframes. Fiddling with object embeds for HTML is absolutely not worth it. It is in any case not well-defined what ‘target’ does for embedded objects (the standard only talks about frames). iframes are just as valid in XHTML as they are in HTML: the two are just different serialisations of the same content model. Use XHTML 1.0 Transitional or HTML 4.01 Transitional. (Having said that, I don't see what exactly on your site needs iframes at all. You are just making your site less SEO-friendly for no obvious reason. If you're just trying to improve code organisation, use server-side includes rather than burdening the client side with the problem.)
