Keep in mind there is no real $R^2$ for logistic regression. There may be a variety of pseudo-$R^2$s, but their mileage can vary. For your first model, the baseline model for the pseudo-$R^2$ is logit=0, i.e., prob $Y_i=1$ is 0.5. For nearly any data, this is an awful model, so no wonder than adding anything shows a big improvement. For your second model, the baseline is logit = const, not necessarily 0, so prob $Y_i=1$ is const not necessarily 0.5. If your actual proportion of ones is say 0.1, with $X_i$ having a moderate amount of explanatory power, then your second model will show a modest $R^2$, while the first model only works to the extent that it uses $\bar X$ as a crutch in place of the intercept to move the predicted probabilities towards 0.1.
