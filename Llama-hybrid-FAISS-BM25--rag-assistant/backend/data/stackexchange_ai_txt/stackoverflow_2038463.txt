Yes, they are equivalent. You do not have to call free() if allocation did not succeed. Pay attention, that memory is pointer to int and you have to dereference it to assign something to its memory block; int* memory = NULL; memory = malloc(sizeof(int)); if (memory) *memory=10; free(memory); memory = NULL;
