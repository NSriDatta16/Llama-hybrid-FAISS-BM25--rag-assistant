Is it possible to know if relation R, is true about two sets of input using neural networks

I have just seen an introduction video to neural networks, and I was wondering, are neural networks only useful for when you want to say that "A based on it's features matrix, belongs to category C", or can it also be used to detect relations as well. What I mean is, is it possible to say that "if you (the computer) see these numbers for A [1 (male), 4 (blood type B+), 78 (weight), 23 (age)] and you see this type of matrix for B [1 (male), 5 (blood type B-), 82 (weight), 25 (age)], then 'learn' that they have the relationship R (1 = are brothers), else they are not related (0) and if I give you new sets in the future, decide if they are related or not based on what you have learned"? In other words, is it possible to detect relationship between two sets of input samples, in a manner that the relation X is true only about these people from group A and these people from group B; based on their matrices? If neural networks are only for classification of only one group, what machine learning method can be used to train the computer (or make a model) to detect if relationship R is true about two streams of input or not? Because even clustering that seems a bit close, decides if one items belongs in a category or not. I know that probably these two groups can be combined into one huge group, and be arranged randomly, to see if they are brothers or not, but other than that method, which seems pretty expensive, are there any other methods?
