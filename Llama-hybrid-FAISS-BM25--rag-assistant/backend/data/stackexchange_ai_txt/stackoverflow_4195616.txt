How to set the focus on a javascript modal window?

Our website involves some javascript that produces overlay modal windows. There is one accessibility problem with this though, once the modal is triggered, the focus is still on the trigger element and not on the modal itself. These modals can include all sorts of html elements, headings, paragraphs and form controls. What I would like is the focus to begin on the first element within the modal, so most likely to be a h4 tag. I have explored using the focus() function however this does not work with a number of html elements. One thought was to add an empty a tag in the window which could gain the focus, but I am unsure about this method.
