I concur with Jon. 2 things will make extraction faster: Decreasing compression level. Increasing the buffer sized used when copying/extracting. I am supposing the need to extract is due to a requirement to write/re-read from the file. If the files are small enough, memory is large enough and the persistent nature of files isn't a requirement; you might consider mapping the entire resource to memory instead of using the disk as storage.
