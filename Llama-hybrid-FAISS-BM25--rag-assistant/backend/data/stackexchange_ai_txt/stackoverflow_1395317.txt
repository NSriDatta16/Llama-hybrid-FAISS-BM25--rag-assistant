First off, everyone who think that apache isnt setup to parse the PHP and has wasted great effort in trying to prove and reoslve that, go back to the second paragraph where he clearly states "They are presented with a finished product on their screen (output.php)" and notice that it's processed the PHP fine on his form and sent the e-mail. PHP is obviously working correctly. Without seeing any code, what I am able to identify as the issue here is you are emailing the output.php file and not the new unique .html file. The next steps to get you on the right path to a solution will be to answer these questions: Is the new unique .html file being created properly? (you never mentioned a file name for it) When inspected, are the contents of it as expected? (not your output.php, you already said you don't want that, so don't look at output.php) If so, what is the Path/URL to this new unique file and how does it compare to what you are using to the Path/URL for the e-mail?
