Issues in Testing SMO SVM

I am new be in SVM and SMO algorithm, I implemented SMO using the pseudocode provided in : “Fast training of support vector machines using SMO” by John platt. I am finding issues testing my implementation. Can anyone provide me with data sets having small features, can you also provide me their optimal SMO (C and tolérance) parameters. I am also finding issues tuning these parameters. Thank you regards Fast Training of Support Vector Machines using Sequential Minimal Optimization
