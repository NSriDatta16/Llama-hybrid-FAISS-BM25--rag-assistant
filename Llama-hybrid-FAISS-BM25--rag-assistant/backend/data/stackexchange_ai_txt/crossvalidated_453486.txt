In addition to what might be a recurring seasonal effect , you have what appears to be a possible level/step shift in your data. Software like the human eye should be able to pick up that effect , if not then you might need another "eye" . if you wish to post your data , I may be of more help. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OR YOUR 147 WEEKLY VALUES starting at week 1 of 2010 Model identification looks to detecting systematic behavior in the data. Latent deterministic structure was identified here using Intervention Detection schemes http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . I used AUTOBOX , a piece of time series software that I had helped to develop an obtained. An XMAS week indicator was suggested along with a level/step shift variable commencing at the beginning of 2013 . The 51st week and the 103rd week showed similar activity ( matching Christmas weeks) suggesting a seasonal dummy typical for anthropomorphic effects involving sales data driven by human habits.. This lead to the Actual/Fit and Forecast using week 51 as a predictor variable . The final equation is here and here The Residual PLot look clean with confirming ACF/PACF I would suspect that there may be omitted variables such as special price promotions whose effects are being artificially proxied by the pulse indicators .
