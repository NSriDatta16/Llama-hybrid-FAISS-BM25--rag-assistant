What I understood is, since your sales person skipped the customer meeting you want to display details or send a notification like: Last date of conversation Discussion points and so on. such that sales person decide her/his priority based upon the importance of discussion. If so, I'm not sure how much it's possible with ML. But one thing is possible, where you can trained RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) based time series model. This model will predict the next meeting time, which is based upon the pattern of historical meeting data. In that way you can book sales person calendar along with the last meeting Key-Discussion points or send an update in case sales person hasn't attended that person.
