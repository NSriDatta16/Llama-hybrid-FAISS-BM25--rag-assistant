How exactly do I extract the important features from strings for machine learning?

Forgive me for my ignorance. Linked below is an image of my dataset with 1000 tuples. https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHIlx.png I have the following questions (1) How exactly do I go about extracting information from the Ad topic line? (2) How should I approach the categorical variables Country and City? ( I've heard about encoding but won't the large number of countries/cities be a problem?) Thank you so much for your time. All help is greatly appreciated.
