A standard, general composite score from a linear model for a particular case is the linear-predictor value based on the covariate values (biomarkers) for the case and the model's regression coefficients: $$ \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^N \beta_ix_i,$$ where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_i$ is the coefficient for biomarker $i$ , and $x_i$ is the value for biomarker $i$ for the case in question. That form of the linear predictor is the same for generalized linear models like logistic regressions or for Cox proportional-hazards models, although the link from the linear-predictor value to outcome is different in those types of regression from the direct relationship in a standard linear regression. That's close to what you are producing in your code as.numeric(X[,1:5]%*%coeff_lr[2:6]) except that you have omitted the intercept. Note that your formulation of the design matrix $X$ forces the intercept to be 0, which is not generally a wise choice for linear regression (although it is correct for a Cox proportional hazards model penalized via glmnet() ). I don't really see what is to be gained with a generic composite score based solely on the regression coefficient values. The coefficients tell you nothing about how a set of predictors is related to outcome unless you also know the values of the predictors. If a predictor's regression coefficient is negative then you certainly want a decrease of its value to be associated with an increase in the outcome variable. If you want to report a general measure of how well your model works, look more directly at a measure of its predictive performance. ISLR is one very good introduction to these issues, including application of penalized methods like ridge regression. Including a biomarker score with other clinical covariates If your biomarkers are correlated with clinical covariates that are in turn associated with the outcome, then you run a risk of omitted-variable bias by separating the biomarker analysis from the clinical analysis. The problem is even greater if your regression is logistic or Cox; then the clinical covariates don't even need to be correlated with the biomarkers to bias the coefficients for the biomarkers. A more reliable approach would be to analyze the biomarkers and the clinical covariates together in a model of outcome. You could choose to use a ridge penalty on the biomarkers while not penalizing the clinical covariates, or penalize all predictors if you wish, via parameter settings in glmnet() . If you would like to report a score related to the biomarkers specifically, you could use their contribution to the linear predictor.
