This code should do what you want, all jQuery style. Basically it uses a bit of recursion to get it done. Pass options to the loadmultiples function to set up what you want to do, and JSON responses are pushed onto an array. You could easily change it if you instead wanted to merge the JSON responses into a single structure, but I wasn't sure if that was what you wanted. var loadmultiples = function(options) { var settings = $.extend({ //set the url to get url : '/response.json', //this function is called when everything is done callback : function() {}, //set this option to define how many loads to do numbertodo : 10, //these two are just used for //storing data while we recurse, //and keeping track of the current position //however you can change them if you want to start //from a different point, or have existing data numberdone : 0, data : [] }, options || {}); //load the json, passing up the current 'number' //of the content to load $.ajax({ url : settings.url, data : { 'number' : settings.numberdone }, dataType: 'json', success: function(result) { //add the response to the data settings.data.push(result); //increment the counter of how many files have been done settings.numberdone++; // if(settings.numberdone
