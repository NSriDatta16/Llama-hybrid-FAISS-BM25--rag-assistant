The variogram is a function of the correlation function, inter alia. The correlation function is affected by data averaging. Check out the Slutsky-Yule effect. This is an old result in time series analysis to the effect that if you do a moving average on white noise, you induce autocorrelations into the transformed series. Visually, the moving averaged white noise appears to the imaginative to have quasi-periodic effects. It is tempting to take a moving average of the data in the hope of allowing genuine features to appear, but Slutsky-Yule warns you that the averaged data will have features that are an artifact of the smooth. I would imagine that a similar thing would happen to the variogram of spatial data.
