Java does have short circuit evaluation. Perhaps entry is null and so entry.getKey() is causing the NullPointerException . Another possibility is that getAddress() either returns null or has a NullPointerException happening inside somewhere (if it's more complicated than a simple return statement). EDIT: I see your edit where you claim this: More to the point, it is impossible to execute perfectAgent.getAddress() ... But what if perfectAgent.getAddress() is successfully executed and returns null ? See what I mean...
