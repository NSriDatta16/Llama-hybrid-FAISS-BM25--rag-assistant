The group by will not be getting every Nth row; it looks like it's meant to sum or average every N rows (where N is presumably an even divisor of 60). If you actually want every Nth row, that may be a lot faster; replace the group by with an order by RecDate and add a where (second(RecDate) \% %d) == 0. But please show us the actual fields being selected.
