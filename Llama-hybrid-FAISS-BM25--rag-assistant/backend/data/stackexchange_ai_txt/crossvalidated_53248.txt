Hypothesis testing using different methods

I have a question related to hypothesis testing. I cannot seem to find error in my reasoning. Initial question: We have 230 patients: 157 males and 73 females. 142 males are sick and 69 females are sick. Can we say that females are sick "statistically significantly" more? My method: Assume that females and males come from binomial distributions. Females are sick with probablity $p_\text{female}$, males - $p_\text{male}$. We want to test that $p_\text{female} = p_\text{male} = p_\text{overall}$ Given that null hypothesis is true, the probability of observing such "extreme" results (so many females and so little males being sick) is: cdfbinom(69, 73, prob=211/230)) * (1-cdfbinom(142, 157, prob=211/230) Which is equal to 0.04351274, therefore we reject the hypothesis that they are the same. I cannot understand where is my mistake, as all of the other methods: chi-square test, t-test, even running logistic regression where I include gender indicator as a variable, do not reject the null hypothesis.
