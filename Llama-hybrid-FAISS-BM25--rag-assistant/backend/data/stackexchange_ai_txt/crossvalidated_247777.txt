If you did center the data in the first step (which is required), then PCA with all dimensions is "only" a rotation of the dataset without loss of Information. After the rotation (if you sort the eigenvectors descending regarding their Eigenvalues) the first Dimension is the one with the highest variance of data. If it does make sense depends on what you expect. An example could be the picture from the german Wikipedia site for PCA
