What's the benefit of postfixing arrays with "List" for variables?

I have seen numerous developers postfixing variable names with a "List" when it's an array. What's the point of this and would you encourage this style? For example: // Java String[] fileList; String file; // PHP $fileList = array(); $file = ''; The idea applies to any language with support for arrays.
