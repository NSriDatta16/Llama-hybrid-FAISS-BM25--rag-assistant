Naive Bayes Binary Classification with Binary Features

I have a dataset with two classes $C_0$ and $C_1$. I have around $10$ to $20$ features that take binary values (either $0$ or $1$). My dataset has around $10000$ instances, with only a hundred of these belonging to class $C_0$ and all the others to class $C_1$. I would like to apply some dimensionality reduction technique, actually not to get rid of dimensions but to assess how relevant (distinguishing) are for my problem. I considered applying PCA, but I've read a lot about the topic and seems the community is divided on whether it is legitimate or not to apply PCA on binary data. What would your recommend in this case?
