Data analysis on multiuser environment

I have following environment that I'd like to analyze. My company is divided in two teams: Insert Team (composed by 150 persons) Quality Check Team (composed by 10 persons) Suppose that all people of first team compile a form with 10 text boxes, for example: name, surname, address, category, studies, preferences, hobbies, etc., and the second team (quality) analyzes a variable percentage of the data which are inserted. Now I'd like to know which method could I apply to find good or poor members of first team, as analyzed by second team, captured using historical feedback of all of the analysis made before . An example to understand better: If the first team inserts 10 data points for the users, then we'll have 1500 data points to analyze. Suppose we define 10% of those data to pass to the second team. After their analysis and feedback, I'd like to use it to influence the next 10% of data capturing, for example, to focus attention on users that are less precise or on text box where there are more errors (which is the approach of major companies like Facebook or Twitter).
