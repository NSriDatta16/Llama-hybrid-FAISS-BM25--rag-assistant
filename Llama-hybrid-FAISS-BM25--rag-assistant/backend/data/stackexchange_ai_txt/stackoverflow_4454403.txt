Surrogate key in 'User' / 'Role' tables for desktop app? Whats the purpose?

I have to add some security for a C#/.NET WinForms/Desktop application. I am using Oracle DB back-end. The tables are simple: User (ID,Name), Role(ID,Role), UserRole(UserID,RoleID). I am using the windows account name to populate User table. Role table will for now just be simply 'Admin','SuperUser','BasicUser'... Since no two people could ever possible have the same windows account name... even when I do not control these name management (netops does, hence why I want to use windows accounts so I don't have to manage it ;)). For Role table, I should again never have dupe value - I control the input, there will only be 3 (tactical app going away within year). UserRole is a join table to represent the Many-To-Many relationships of users and roles, so no surragate key is justified. Simple question - Why bother with 'ID' (int) in the User and Role table? Any point or advantage here? Is this one of those 'I've always done it this way' type things? Or have I just not done this in awhile and forget the reason?
