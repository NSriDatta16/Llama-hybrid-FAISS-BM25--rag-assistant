I don't know very much about HTML5 compliant browsers for Windows Mobile. Opera Mobile or Mini don't support offline HTML5 features. Skyfire is a browser based on Webkit, but no information is present on what kind of HTML5 features it supports. Today the real offline storage support for Windows Mobile is not HTML5 compliant and is Google Gears .
