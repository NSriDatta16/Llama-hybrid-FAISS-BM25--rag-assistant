identifying input sequence using neural network

I fount simple neural scenario sayinh : network having 3 layers, 3 inputs and 2 outputs. It should be trained to recognize a simple pattern - if inputs are correspondingly 6.0,7.0 and 8.0 then outputs should be 3.0 and 4.0, otherwise outputs should be 23.0 What I understand is, hidden layer should Check input pattern in sequence with simple if else condition. if in1 == 6 and in2 == 7 and in3 ==8: out1, out2 = 3, 4 else out = 5 Do I understand the problem correctly or something I am missing?
