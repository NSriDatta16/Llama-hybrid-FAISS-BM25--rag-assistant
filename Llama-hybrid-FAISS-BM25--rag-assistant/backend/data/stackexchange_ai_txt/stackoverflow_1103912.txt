I have found a way to do it, but it's not a very elegant solution: Write an [AutoExpand] entry for the member type which includes the directive. Then when you display the member with it will show the same information as it does for the member type on its own, including its type name. It's not a great solution, because I don't really want to have to dispay the type information every time when the member type appears on its own, but it does give me the information I was after.
