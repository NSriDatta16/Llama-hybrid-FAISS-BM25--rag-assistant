From Wikipedia (emphases mine): A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, and that it was not altered in transit. Digital signatures are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery and tampering. and In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key with an identity â€” information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual. So if I understand the above correctly, a digital signature just proves that a document hasn't been tampered with whereas a digital certificate proves that the document actually came from you.
