What is the spectral domain?

From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08097.pdf , "Geometric deep learning: going beyond Euclidean data". Here are some uses: "methods of signal processing on graphs, which have previously been reviewed in this Magazine [43], can be applied to this setting, in particular, in order to define an operation similar to convolution in the spectral domain " "The first formulation of CNNs on graphs is due to Bruna et al. [52], who used the definition of convolutions in the spectral domain ." The key difference between these approaches is in the way a convolution-like operation is formulated on graphs and manifolds. One way is to resort to the analogy of the Convolution Theorem, defining the convolution in the spectral domain . What is the spectral domain, and what does it mean in these contexts?
