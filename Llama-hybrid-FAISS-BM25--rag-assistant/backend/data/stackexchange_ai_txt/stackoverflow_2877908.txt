Using jQuery to change all instances of to for IE support

I am wondering if it is possible to use jQuery to switch out all tags on a site for tags when loading on IE 8 and below. In essence, this would allow the page to be XHTML 1.1 valid and not have to be double-coded all the time, eliminating the need to spend so much time focusing on non-standard browsers. The data= attribute would need to be changed to src= , I'd like to insert frameborder="0" , and all of the style values for the tag would also need to be set for the tag. My goal here is not to create a debate on s vs s, I just think that this would be a huge tmie saver, and encourage proper, strict xhtml coding practices. Thanks for any input!
