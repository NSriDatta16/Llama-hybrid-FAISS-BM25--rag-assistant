This is of course a frequentist 0.05 level test - the null hypothesis is rejected less than 5% of the time under the null hypothesis and even the power under the alternative is great. On the other hand prior information tells us that the sun going supernova at a by particular point in time is pretty unlikely, but that getting a lie by chance is more likely. Bottom line: there's not really anything wrong with the comic and it shows that testing implausible hypotheses leads to a high false discovery rate. Additionally, you probably want to take prior information into account in your assessment of offered bets - that's why a Bayesian posterior in combination with decision analysis is so popular.
