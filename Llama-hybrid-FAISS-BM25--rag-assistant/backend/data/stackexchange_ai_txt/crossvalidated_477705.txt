How would econometricians answer the objections and recommendations raised by Chen and Pearl (2013)?

In their article, Chen and Pearl (2013) , critically examined 6 econometric textbooks, among these the textbooks written by Wooldridge (2009) {the introductory book}, and Stock & Watson (2011). These last 2 books are either the core textbook or at the top of the list of suggested readings for many introductory econometrics courses out there. I think that somebody just about to start their introductory econometrics class using one of these books would be well served to know which material in their textbook is contested as potentially incomplete/unclear/misleading (as Chen and Pearl argued) and if it is not incomplete/unclear/misleading then a response to these accusations would give the student renewed confidence that his/her textbook will not lead him/her astray, and will alert the student to the complete/accurate picture. Ideally the response to Chen and Pearl would come from these 6 (sets of) authors themselves. Did they respond? In the 7 years since the article, did any of the 6 (sets of) authors make any changes to their books which are in line with the recommendations by Chen & Pearl (2013)? For example, I see that Wooldridge released a new version of his introductory textbook in 2019; in it did he make any changes in line with Chen & Pearl's recommendations? More broadly, through this imperfect device I am trying to get a sense for whether econometricians, as a whole, found anything useful in Chen & Pearl's critical review and made any changes/improvements as a result. Absent a response from the 6 (sets of) authors themselves, a response by the econometricians/statisticians on this forum might be the next best thing. My hope is that people can respond to the issues raised by Chen & Pearl (repeated by me below) and hopefully a consensus view will emerge that can be of use to students using these textbooks. Below, I restrict the scope to 2 of the analysis to Wooldridge (2009) and Stock & Watson (2011) and only to the questions where Chen & Pearl objected with either of these books (see table below with disagreements highlighted). Q2. Does the author present example problems that require prediction alone? Wooldridge does not present any examples that require prediction alone. Q4. Does the author define $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ by the equality, $\boldsymbol{\beta X = E[Y|X]}$ ? "... Haavelmo shows that $\beta X$ is not equal to the conditional expectation, but rather to the expected value of $Y$ given that we intervene and set the value of $X$ to $x$ . This "intervention-based expectation" was later given the notation $E[Y|\text{do}(x)]$ in (Pearl, 1995)" (page 2 of the Chen & Pearl article). “The first part of Equation (4.5), $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i}$ , is the population regression line or the population regression function. This is the relationship that holds between $Y$ and $X$ on average over the population. Thus, if you knew the value of $X$ , according to this population regression line you would predict that the value of the dependent variable, $Y$ , is $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ .”(Stock and Watson, 2011, p. 110)" (page 20 of the Chen & Pearl article). My commentary: Strictly speaking, both authors define $\beta$ by the equality, $\beta X = E[Y|X]$ , however Wooldridge does so in the context of a randomized experiment (randomizing fertilizer to be applied to plots) and he gets a pass, while Stock & Watson do so in the context of an observational study and they get flagged. If I understand it correctly, Chen & Pearl correctly interpret the context of Wooldridge's model as causal and they see $\beta X = E[Y|do(X)]$ where Wooldridge writes $\beta X = E[Y|X]$ . However in the Stock & Watson case they deem the context of the model to be causal (which seems questionable, see below) and thus flag them for writing $\beta X = E[Y|X]$ . Stock and Watson motivate their simple regression model with the following statement. "If she reduces the average class size by two students, what will the effect be on standardized test scores in her district?" There also is no "ceteris paribus" statement, which in my mind suggests that the model is intended to be merely predictive rather than causal. In Chen & Pearl's defense, Stock & Watson's introduction to this chapter "Linear Regression with One Regressor" is unclear, as they dance around with both casual and predictive contexts. They start by asking 3 causal sounding questions and then state that "Just as the mean of $Y$ is an unknown characteristic of the population distribution of $Y$ , the slope of the line relating $X$ and $Y$ is an unknown characteristic of the population joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ ". (Stock & Watson, page 155) Q7. Does the author state that each structural equation in the econometric model is meant to capture a ceteris paribus or "everything else held fixed" relationship? My commentary : It seems to me that Stock & Watson introduced both simple linear regression and multiple linear regression in a predictive context, which is why they did not mention ceteris paribus. Is that accurate? Q8. Does the author assume that exogeneity of $\mathbf{X}$ is inherent to the model? My commentary : I don't fully understand this point but to me this seems like a potentially fair criticism of Wooldridge's exposition. His entire book has a causal context and yet he states that "The crucial assumption is that the average value of u does not depend on the value of $x$ ". (page 25) However, on the very next page he says "In the fertilizer example, if fertilizer amounts are chosen independently of other features of the plots, then (2.6) $\{E(u|x)=E(u)\}$ will hold: the average land quality will not depend on the amount of fertilizer. Seems like a flaw to call it the crucial assumption without further clarifying in what contexts it is crucial and in what contexts it is trivial. Hopefully someone can clarify and correct me if I am wrong. Q10. Does the author use separate notation for $\boldsymbol{E[Y |\textbf{do}(X)]}$ and $\boldsymbol{E[Y |X]}$ ? Q11. Does the author use separate notation for the slope of the line associated with $\boldsymbol{E[Y |X]}$ and that associated with $\boldsymbol{E[Y |\textbf{do}(X)]}$ ? These last 2 are about notation, and while I think Pearl effectively pointed out the problems stemming from the lack of something like this notation $E[Y |\text{do}(X)]$ , I am not sure there is agreement yet on whether this is the way to go, so would seem unfair to flag any econometrics book for not using this notation. Is [Gelman] saying he is against such notation? "Setting aside any problems I have with such models (I don’t actually think the “do operator” makes sense as a general construct, for reasons we’ve discussed in various places on this blog from time to time), the point is that these are qualitative, on/off statements. They’re “if-then” statements, not “how much” statements." Absent responses from these authors to Chen & Pearl and given how widely used these textbooks are, I think this thread could be of great interest to an army of future econometricians/statisticians/data analysts that are currently studying from these textbooks. Carlos Cinelli's answer here could help provide further context.
