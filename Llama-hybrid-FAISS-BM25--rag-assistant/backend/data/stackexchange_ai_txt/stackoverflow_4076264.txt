You can allow the programmer to create values of type element_i inside Semiring by not hiding the constructors of this type, as you are currently doing. Instead, define the signature ELEMENT as: module type ELEMENT = sig type element_i = N of int | CNN of cnn end This makes your functor Semiring expect more of its Element argument: instead of any type Element.element_i , it now only accepts a type with exactly these constructors. But on the plus side it can now apply the constructors to build values of this type, for instance Element.N 12
