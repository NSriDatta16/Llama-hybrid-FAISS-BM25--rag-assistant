to implement a advanced login functionality help needed

I'm developing a system with codeigniter, php and jquery these days, still in the login form, in my login scenario i have a advanced situation i think. i have different kinds of users in my system,this is a hospital system, first of all there is a person to register people, a person to search old records(files), a person to check eye sight of the people, and a nurse to instruct the patients after they visit the doctor. so i have to give permission to all these people in my system. now i will tell you about the complication i have, there are 4 doctor units, each separate doctor unit have 2 doctors, a junior one and a senior one. so altogether there are 8 doctors in my system. patients are divided to these 4doctor units, so i have to provide each doctor with a UI that is capable of handling people registered to his or her unit. as i think form the login if i can redirect the doctors to relevant UI's is will be better. so i need to create a login where a person come enter user name and password, then select the user type, after the selection of that user type, if the user is a doctor ,then another combo box should appear dynamically and he should be given the opportunity to select his relevant doctor unit. can you guys help me to achieve this functionality?reference links or tutorials to such kind of implementations, instructions about implementing this functionality? all are welcome! :) regards, Rangana
