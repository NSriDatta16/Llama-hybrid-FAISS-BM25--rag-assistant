Designing a CNN for object position recognition in images

I'd like to detect the position of an object (e.g. a book's cover) into an image taken from a webcam. I would only need to output 4 points corresponding to the cover's corners into the image. I was thinking of using CNNs (perhaps a variant on vgg-16?) and output 5 neurons: one for the probability of the cover being there (trained to be 1 in case there is, 0 in case there isn't) and the other 4 being the 2D-coordinate corners in the image. Is this a decent approach to detect an object's position within an image?
