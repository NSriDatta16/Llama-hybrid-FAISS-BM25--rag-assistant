Pay attention that you can not use -cp and -jar at the same time. When you do java -jar, java expects the referenced jar to be declared inside the MANIFEST.MF file. I think your command line should work putting your jar inside "cp", and calling explicitely the main class on the command line. Another solution if you are concerned with the size is to deploy your application with JNLP and compress your jars with Pack200 .
