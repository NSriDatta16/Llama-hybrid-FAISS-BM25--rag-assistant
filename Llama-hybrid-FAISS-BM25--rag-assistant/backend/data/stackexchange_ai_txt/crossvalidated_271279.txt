A linear model wont in the general case make your features sparse, unless you eg choose a loss function that encourages sparsity, such as L1/Lasso. MSE loss on a linear model will not encourage sparsity, or one feature to dominate another, in general, for example. In the case that you are using Lasso/L1 loss, then some of your features are likely to be driven to zero. You can then use eg the correlation matrix, $X^TX$, to look at correlations between the non-zero features and the zero features.
