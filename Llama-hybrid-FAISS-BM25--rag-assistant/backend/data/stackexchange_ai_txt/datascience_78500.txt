By looking at your datasets, it resembles a multivariate time series problem , not sure why you are opting for Random Forest classifier ? I would suggest you to start implementing simple statistical algorithm first here is the link Then explore on complex Deep Learning algorithm based on the data set size , please find the referenced link Thanks, Durga
