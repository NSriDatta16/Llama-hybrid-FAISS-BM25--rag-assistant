Are there any power calculation formulas for ML methods beyond Logistic Regression?

Are there any power calculation formulas for ML methods (for binary classification) beyond Logistic Regression? (also well beyond the laughable rule of thumb 10 instances per variable) I've done a naive google search and can't find anything. I'd expect there to be a different calculation for but maybe there is a kind of general analysis based simply on number of features. Maybe linear SVMs, no kernel, have a comparable power calc formula? I'm interested in anything, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, etc. As complex as Deep Neural Networks seem to be, with the multiplicity of parameters they have, maybe they can be analyzed as a network of stacked Linear Regression?
