Handling null values when taking averages

I am currently working with a universe of 100 companies and interested in how they compare on certain metrics. Some companies do not report all metrics that I am interested in so I am reporting them as null vs inserting a 0 value. In the extreme case that I only have one company reporting a metric, is it statically accurate to report that lone value as the average of the entire universe? Or is it more appropriate to divide that lone value by 100 even if the other 99 are null values?
