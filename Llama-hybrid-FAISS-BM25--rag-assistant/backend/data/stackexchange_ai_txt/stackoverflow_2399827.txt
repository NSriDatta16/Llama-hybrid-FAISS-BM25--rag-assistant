Simple. When the extension first runs, the localStorage is empty. On first run, you can write a flag there to mark all consequent runs as non-first. Example, in background.htm: var first_run = false; if (!localStorage['ran_before']) { first_run = true; localStorage['ran_before'] = '1'; } if (first_run) alert('This is the first run!'); EDIT: To check whether the extension has just been updated, store the version instead of a simple flag on first run, then when the current extension version (get it by XmlHttpRequest ing the manifest) doesn't equal the one stored in localStorage , the extension has been updated.
