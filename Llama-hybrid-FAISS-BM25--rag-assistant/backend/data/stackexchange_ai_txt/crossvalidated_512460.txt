I am not quite sure whether I understood all details correctly but regarding your logistic regression: From the description I assume that the response variable in your model ("OutcomeClassFac") stands for a factor with the two levels "successful stop" and "unsuccessful stop". Since you fit a logistic regression with no intercept, the 4-level factor "ethnicity" is represented in the model with four dummy variables, one for each ethnicity. Therefore, each ethnicity gets its own coefficient, which represents the log-odds of the associated ethnic group. As you correctly state, the estimated Asian log-odds are for example higher than the Whites log-odds which would indicate that there is a higher probability of a successful stop in Asians. You then proceed to investigate whether these differences are statistically significant by using Wald-tests. In general I think this procedure is okay. Still, if you are mainly interested in the differences between the groups, then I think it would be easier to fit a logistic regression including an intercept. The reference level, in your case "White", would be represented by the intercept. The three coefficients "Asian", "Black" and "Other" would describe the differences in log-odds when moving from "Whites" to the respective group. Like this you get the differences (with regard to the reference level) and their statistical significance in one go. Also, this would easily allow you to include potential confounders in your model in order to "adjust" the differences between ethnic groups by controlling for these confounder variables. Perhaps I'm wrong but it sounds a bit like you want to give the shown effects somewhat of a causal meaning. Even though this is a very difficult endeavor with observational data in general, one should at least try to statistically control for potential confounders when trying to suggest causal links.
