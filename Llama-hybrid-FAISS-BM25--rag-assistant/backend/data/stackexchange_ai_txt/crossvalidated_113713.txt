what to chose for prior and proposal function for MCMC of a mixture

I generated some data according to a mixture of two lognormals: $f(x) = p \cdot \mathcal LN(\mu_1, \sigma) + (1-p) \cdot \mathcal LN (\mu_2, \sigma)$ Now I want to use MCMC to find the parameters $p, \mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma$ but I'm unsure what to chose as the prior and the proposal function. For the prior I chose: $p \sim Beta$ but what hyperparameters are best? $\mu_1, \mu_2 \sim Normal$, again, what hyperparameters? $\sigma \sim Inverse~Gamma$; hyperparameters? the proposal is a bit more difficult because $p$ has to be drawn of the $[0,1]$ interval. So $p \sim truncated~Normal$ in $[0,1]$; does this make sense? $\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma \sim Normal$ but how do I avoid negative $\sigma$ ? Is there an R MCMC package that allows custom proposal functions?
