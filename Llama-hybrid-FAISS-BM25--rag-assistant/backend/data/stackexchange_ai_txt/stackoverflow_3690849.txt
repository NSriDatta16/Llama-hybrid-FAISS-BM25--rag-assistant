Cheap development board for Windows CE

I'm looking for a development board for WinCE, preferably with the following connectors: VGA/DVI for screen USB for kb/mouse Ethernet (10Mbit is OK, 100 would be even better ;-) ) Storage (eg: SD/MMC/CF cards) I'm looking for this, because I want to attend the Imagine Cup , Embedded Systems design. And I'm looking for a challenge, ofcourse ;-). I found a board called HawkBoard ( http://www.hawkboard.org ), but I want to know if there are alternatives for about the same price (max $200 incl. shipping/customs/taxes). I need the BSP, ofcourse ;-). Thanks! Yvan
