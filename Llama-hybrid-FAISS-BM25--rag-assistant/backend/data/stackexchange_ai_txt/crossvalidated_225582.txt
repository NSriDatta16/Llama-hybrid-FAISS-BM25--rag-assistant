This link answers your question clearly, I guess: http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html I quote a small piece: Z-score standardization or Min-Max scaling? “Standardization or Min-Max scaling?” - There is no obvious answer to this question: it really depends on the application. For example, in clustering analyses, standardization may be especially crucial in order to compare similarities between features based on certain distance measures. Another prominent example is the Principal Component Analysis, where we usually prefer standardization over Min-Max scaling, since we are interested in the components that maximize the variance (depending on the question and if the PCA computes the components via the correlation matrix instead of the covariance matrix; but more about PCA in my previous article). However, this doesn’t mean that Min-Max scaling is not useful at all! A popular application is image processing, where pixel intensities have to be normalized to fit within a certain range (i.e., 0 to 255 for the RGB color range). Also, typical neural network algorithm require data that on a 0-1 scale.
