First, the others explained quite well the roots of your problem. But for the record, answering your original question, what you need is addEventListener . This is a non-obtrusive, nice and modern way to attach events in Javascript. Works in every modern browser (so not under IE9, for those IEs you need attachEvent ). So for example, using addEventListener, you assign events like: var elem = document.getElementById("fos"); elem.addEventListener("keydown", whateverFunction, false); You can also use the simple way ( elem.onkeydown=whateverFunction; ), but I discourage you to do it. With addEventListener, you can assign several handlers to the same event, and you cannot accidentally overwrite another event you or a library/3rd party script assigned.
