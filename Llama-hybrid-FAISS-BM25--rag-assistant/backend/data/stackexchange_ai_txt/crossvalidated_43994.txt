How can I tell whether my data is skewed due to sampling error?

I have some psychological data (N=100, 2 conditions) in which across 55 questions participants made an estimate, and then after a manipulation they made an additional estimate. I then calculated how much their estimate gained or lost on the second round. There were two manipulations that occurred before the second round, and each participant received one of them. I found that in both conditions estimates (on average) improved in the second round compared to the first. However, the median 'improvement' from round 1 to round 2 was negative. This was true across both conditions. It's been suggested to me that the reason for this was just sampling error. Is there a way for me to investigate the plausibility of this suggestion without re-doing my study? In response to Erik's question, here is a link to the raw data: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53771404/estimation_data.xlsx . Column 1 = Mean error of original estimates. Column 2 = Mean error of second estimates. Column 3 = Median error of original estimates. Column 4 = Median error of second estimates. This is just manipulation condition 1, but the second condition had very similar results.
