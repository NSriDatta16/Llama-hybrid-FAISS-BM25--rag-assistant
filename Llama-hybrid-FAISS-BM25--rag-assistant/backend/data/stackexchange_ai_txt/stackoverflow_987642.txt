My publisher requires the same thing (so the suggestions as not-indenting no paragraph or not doing such a strange thing is out of question). \ I did not find any automatic solution. Instead, I placed as many figures as possible to top or bottom of the page and then manually inserted \noindent after all figures that are placed inline Unfortunately, since the 'h' flag is only a recommendation one has to compile, check output, place indent, compile, check output not place indent, took me about 1 hour for a book of 300 pages.
