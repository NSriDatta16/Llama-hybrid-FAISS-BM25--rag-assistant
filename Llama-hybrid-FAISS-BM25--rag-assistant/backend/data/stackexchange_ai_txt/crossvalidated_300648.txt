How to handle dependent, multidimensional output in machine learning

I have some data where X is n x p and Y is n x d, where d = 36. To recreate it I am currently training 36 independent models to take X and recreate Y one column at a time. It works okay, but it strikes me that the columns of Y are not perfectly independent. Y describes the radii around some center point of a somewhat smooth shape, so I should expect neighboring columns of Y will have a relationship and be more related than columns farther apart. Is there a way to exploit this extra information to make my model better at reproducing Y?
