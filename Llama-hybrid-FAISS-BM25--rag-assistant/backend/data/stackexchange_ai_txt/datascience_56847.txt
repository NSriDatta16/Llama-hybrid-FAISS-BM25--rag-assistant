choosing classifiers

For what I read the 5x2cv t test is "a procedure for comparing the performance of two models (classifiers or regressors) that was proposed by Dietterich to address shortcomings in other methods such as the resampled paired t test and the k-fold cross-validated paired t test" . I am currently making some experiments with an unbalanced data set, which I balanced using SCUT and trained a set of different classifiers. The problem is a multiclass with three different classes to choose. I am applying a Multilayer Perceptron, a Decision Tree and a Random Forest and the results, after a 10-fold cross validation, are the following: Multilayer Perceptron: 0.95 acc Decision Tree: 0.93 acc Random Forest: 0.935 acc When I apply the 5x2cv t test I got the following results: MLP and DT: t-statistic 4.75 p-value 0.005 So, if I assume that for the tests I will have a value of alpha of 0.05 for rejecting the null hypothesis, which is that both algorithms perform well with the same database, then from the p-value I got I could reject the null hypothesis. This would mean that both models do not perform equally well, so it would be better to use MLP over the DT because of its higher accuracy. When I do the same with the MLP and the RF I got the following results: t-statistic: 2.46 p-value: 0.055 Here, I suppose that I can conclude that using MLP or RF for the current dataset is almost the same, because I failed to reject the null hypothesis. The question that I have here is if should I choose the RF even though the accuracy was lower? The comparison with the DT and RF has the following values: t-statistic: -2.49 p-value: 0.054 So I can reject the null hypothesis and said that there is difference between the use of the DT over the RF. Are my conclusions correct? Thanks
