Network Packet Inspector in Mac OSX

I'm trying to create a network packet inspector. I know you can do this with libpcap, but it's not a sniffer, i need to forge network packet, before it was sent on network. (sending via socks server) I found 2 ways to do this : Using an NKE. (Network Kernel Extension) Using a DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to insert a library to hook network function. Which method do you think is the best ?
