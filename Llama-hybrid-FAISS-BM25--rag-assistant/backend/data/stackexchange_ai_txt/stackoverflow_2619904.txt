On any well trafficked web site you'll get numerous 404 errors from badly written crawlers, badly written caching servers anti-virus software and browser toolbar add-ons as they each try to second guess what URLs lead off a page. Often they will misinterpret embedded Javascript trying to figure out what pages it might be linking to. BUT I've never seen one with a ~ character in it. That implies you had a ~ on a page which implies that you have a literal ~/Default.aspx occurring somewhere on a page. Can you find the page in question and do view source on it to see if there's a ~ somewhere on it? If you vary the page contents according to user agent, can you replay the same request and look at the source? Have you run a link checker against you site?
