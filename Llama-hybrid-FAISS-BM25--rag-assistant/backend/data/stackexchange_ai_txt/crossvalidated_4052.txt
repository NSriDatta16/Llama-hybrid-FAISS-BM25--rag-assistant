How does the power of a logistic regression and a t-test compare?

Is the power of a logistic regression and a t-test equivalent? If so, they should be "data density equivalent" by which I mean that the same number of underlying observations yields the same power given a fixed alpha of .05. Consider two cases: [The parametric t-test]: 30 draws from a binomial observation are made and the resulting values are averaged. This is done 30 times for group A (which has a binomial Pr of .70 of occurring) and 30 times for group B (which has a binomial Pr of .75 of occurring). This yields 30 means per group that represent a summary of 1,800 draws from a binomial distribution. A 58df t-test is performed to compare the means. [The logistic regression]: A logistic regression is performed with a dummy coded slope representing group membership and each of the 1,800 draws. My question has two parts: Given a set alpha of .05, will the power of these methodologies be the same or different? Why? How can I prove it? Is the answer to question 1 is sensitive to the sample sizes going into the t-test, sample size of each group in the t-test, underlying binomial probabilities, or some other factor? If so, how can I know (without simulation) that the power is indeed different and what sort of changes will produce what sort of changes in power? Alternatively, provide worked out R code that solves the issue using simulation.
