What is exactly meant with linear relations and non-linear relations in the data?

I often read the statement that for example logistic regression is a good model for easy understanding the linear relations in the data. While for example classification trees are better to understand non-linearities. I'm struggling a little bit with the term "linear relations in the data". I know that the logistic regression model is linear in the parameters but non-linear in the covariates / features. How is this linear relations in the data to understand? The following sources / papers used the terms as described above: Link1 On page 40 (3.4.1); The author states: The logistic regression models lend themselves to easy understanding the linear relations in the data Link2 On page 6; The author states: Machine learning offers a set of tools that can usefully summarize various sorts of nonlinear relationships in the data
