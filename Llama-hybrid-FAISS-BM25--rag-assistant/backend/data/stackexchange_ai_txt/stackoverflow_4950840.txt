To make drag and dropping in 3D easier you might implement an (optional) snapping system. To check whether or not a box contains another box simply check all corners of a box. Test each corner to see if it is on the 'inside' (or outside) of the faces of the other box. If all corners are inside, the box is inside. This will work for all boxes, not just axis aligned boxes.
