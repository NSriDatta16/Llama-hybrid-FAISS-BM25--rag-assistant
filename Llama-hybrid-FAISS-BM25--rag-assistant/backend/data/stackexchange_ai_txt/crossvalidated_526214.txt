Metrics for Explanatory Power of Machine Learning Classification Models

I am interested in finding metrics that assess the explanatory power of machine learning models involving binary classification. I know that for logistic regression, McFadden pseudo R squared, AIC, and deviance can be used. I understand that with Neural Networks, it is difficult to determine anything about explanatory power. But what are some quantifiable metrics that can evaluate the explanatory power of models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), or other models that are typically used primarily for prediction, specifically in the case of binary classification?
