The Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 template was build from the ground up to support Scrum, using Scrum terminology as much as possible. It is being developed in coordination with Scrum.org and the Scrum Professional Developer program. If you are using Scrum, the VSS 1.0 template will offer you less friction than the Agile template. That said, you should be scrummy and question if adopting TFS and the VSS 1.0 template could provide you better value than using the current tool you are using now. Questions to ask here are: will you gain benefit from the integration of Product Backlog Items, Sprint Tasks, Code Checkins, CI builds, Manual Tests, Coded Tests, Unit Test Results, etc. Perhaps some of the standard reports allow you to gain a better insight in the Quality of the Product Increment. E.g. Are you Done? Unit Tests & Code Coverage reports, Test Reports, Build Reports. Do these help in answering that question better? Perhaps none of this is applicable and using your current solution is the best way for your team to improve. Its up to you to experiment and decide. (Or you can hire me, and I'll gladly help you decide after having worked in the team and finding out what issues could possibly improve your team ;-)
