The answer depends a lot if you're working alone or on team, and the method used to share and transfer files (Subversion, Git, SMB, FTP, ...) In the past we used to have a shared local developement server (Debian/apache), access files via windows shares (samba), and publication to remote (pre)production servers with FTP. But, that was dreamweaver time and we had a lot of issues working together on same project. The worst case was sharing work with remote teams, painfull version management accross FTP clients. Now, we tend to use apache on windows (wampserver) ans SVN to share and publish files. It appear to complexify the thing when working alone, but for teamwork it has no comparison with the old way of working. The issues with php/mysql on windows are known : - less stability and responsiveness - Paths must be written unix-way to avoid troubles switching to linux servers (C:/dir/file.php instead of C:\dir\file.php) - You must pay attention to mysql table names and filenames case, because if an error in case happens it won't throw an error on windows. You get the slap when you switch to production server - Command line tools / Apache or PHP extensions that are inexistant in windows world We work sometimes with people using Macs ou linux workstation to get rid of theses problems. If your developement process requires Passenger on the developement station, I think you'd better use a linux workstation or run a lightweight apache server inside a VM.
