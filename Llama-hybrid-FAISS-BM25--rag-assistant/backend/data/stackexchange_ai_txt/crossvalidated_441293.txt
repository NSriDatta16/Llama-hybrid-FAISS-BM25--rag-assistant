No, deviance is different from the Brier Score. Deviance here is the standard definition, i.e. twice the difference between the saturated log-likelihood and the fitted log-likelihood ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(statistics) ) whereas Brier score is the average squared difference between the observed outcomes and the fitted probabilities ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score ). If you want to use Brier score as your measure, use type.measure = mse If you want to see the difference programmatically, inspect lines 42-52 of glmnet:::cv.lognet
