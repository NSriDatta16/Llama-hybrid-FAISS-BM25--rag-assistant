Indeed, what you want is an abstract factory. The ease of implementing the factory depends on the language you are using. php allows for variable class names, for example, so you can just send in the class name and get new $classname back. Other languages do not allow this, however. In fact, if your language does not do this, you have already created a factory class! There is not really anything more elegant you can do unless you want to use reflection to simulate what php does.
