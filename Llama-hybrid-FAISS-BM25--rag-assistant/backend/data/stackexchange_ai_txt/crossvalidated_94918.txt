Regression Discontinuity Group Level Program Evaluation

I'd like to use a regression discontinuity design to evaluate a program where the discontinuity/assignment to treatment occurs at the group level. However, I'd like to measure the outcome at the individual level (as opposed to measuring the outcome as an average at the group level). I have three questions (feel free to answer any): What are the criteria/assumptions for doing an RD with assignment at the group level? Would using HLM be appropriate? Do you know of any studies that do this? For example, consider a very large firm where workers make widgets independently, but are divided into teams where they can consult with each other or ask for advice a few times a week. The firm calculates how long it takes each worker to make a widget on average, and then calculates an average widgets per hour for each team. They provide additional training for groups where the group average is below a certain threshold and no additional training for groups above the threshold, hence the discontinuity. The firm then wants to evaluate the effect of additional training on an individual.
