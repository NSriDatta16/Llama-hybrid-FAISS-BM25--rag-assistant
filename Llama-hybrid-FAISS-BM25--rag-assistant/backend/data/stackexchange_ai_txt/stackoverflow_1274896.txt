Connor McDonald is a very good Oracle developer, and his book "Mastering Oracle PL/SQL" has some nice ideas/approaches. Many of the Gang of Four's structural patterns are directly applicable: facade, proxy, adapter, bridge. Then go to asktom.oracle.com and click on "Resources" and "Links" at the top of the page. Tom Kyte's books are very good.
