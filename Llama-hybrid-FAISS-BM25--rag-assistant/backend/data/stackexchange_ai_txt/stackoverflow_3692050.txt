Basically, the files just need to be copied into the main bundle In that case just add a folder reference to the project (Create a folder in your project folder and then drag it into your projects "Resources" group (in the "Files & Groups" list; then in the sheet that appears select the "Create Folder References for any added Folder" radio button) and Xcode will copy the folder and all of its contents into the target bundle at build time. Just an additional note: If you use this method to add image subfolders you'll have to prefix the image name with the subfolder name to use '[UIImage imageNamed:]'. For example if you have an image named "Rendezvous.png" in a subfolder named "MyImages": ` // this won't work UIImage * image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Rendezvous"]; if (image) { NSLog(@"Found Rendezvous!"); } else { NSLog(@"Didn't find Rendezvous."); } // but this will! image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"MyImages/Rendezvous"]; if (image) { NSLog(@"Found MyImages/Rendezvous!"); } else { NSLog(@"Didn't find MyImages/Rendezvous."); } `
