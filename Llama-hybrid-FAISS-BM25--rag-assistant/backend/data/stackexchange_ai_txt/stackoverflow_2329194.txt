Use of Hibernate 3.0 with EJB 3.0 & JPA

Where I'm working the guys that are sitting across from me are working on a project. This is a JavaEE app which uses Struts, Spring, EJB 3.0, JPA, and Hibernate 3.0. They are using EJB 3.0 entity beans with annotations. I've been asking them why Hibernate 3.0 is in this mix and noone can seem to tell me. It feels like they've included Hibernate 3.0 because they were told to but are not using it for anything that they can't get from EJB 3.0 entity beans/JPA. They're using CMP and accessing all of the database functions via EJBs. Can Hibernate give you anything in this setup that can't be provided by EJB 3.0/JPA?
