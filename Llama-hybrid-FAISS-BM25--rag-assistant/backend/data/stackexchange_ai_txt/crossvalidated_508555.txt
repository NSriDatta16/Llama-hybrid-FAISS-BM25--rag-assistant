Predict Longitude and Latitude time series

I have a dataset that describes location (latitude longitude) in different times of day. The dataset is for one day and has 10 minute intervals (so 144 observations). I need to predict the location at some specific point in time in the future. Can anyone please point me to the right direction? Thanks
