Sharing a model trained on confidential data

I have a regularized logistic regression model using scikit-learn and would like to share it with others, however the data it is trained on is confidential and must remain protected. The model uses bag-of-words style features to automatically classify texts describing injuries, and would be useful for a broad variety of injury surveillance tasks. Is it possible to share a fully trained model like this without revealing potentially protected information, such as the words that occur in the texts it is trained on? If so, how would I do this, and how strong would the confidentiality protection be?
