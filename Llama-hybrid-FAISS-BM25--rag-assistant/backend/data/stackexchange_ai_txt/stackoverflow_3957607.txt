All rails applications benefit from a good coverage of unit and functional tests, whether you use rspec or shoulda etc, is mostly a matter of personal preference. I'm a fan of shoulda mostly for the context blocks it provides, making setting up test scenarios much easier and clearer to understand. I don't think browser simulators/automators are needed unless your application is quite javascript heavy. I'd recommend only using them to test javascript, and for that purpose it's definitely better to go with driving a real browser than to simulate. The app I'm working on now is quite javascript heavy and we're using cucumber along with watir / firewatir to run our cucumber tests in firefox for the javascript driven functions on our site.
