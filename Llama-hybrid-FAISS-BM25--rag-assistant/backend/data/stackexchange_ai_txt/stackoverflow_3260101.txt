[Disclaimer: I'm on the Akka team] A Clojure Agent is a different beast from a Scala actor, most notably if you think about who controls the behavior. In Agents the behavior is defined outside and is pushed to the Agent, and in Actors the behavior is defined inside the Actor. Without knowing anything about your code I really cannot say much, are you using the same JVM parameters, warming things up the same, sensible settings for Actors vs. sensible settings for Agents, or are they tuned separately? As a side note: Akka has an implementation of the ring bench located here: http://github.com/jboner/akka-bench/tree/master/ring/ Would be interesting to see what the result is compared to your Clojure test on your machine.
