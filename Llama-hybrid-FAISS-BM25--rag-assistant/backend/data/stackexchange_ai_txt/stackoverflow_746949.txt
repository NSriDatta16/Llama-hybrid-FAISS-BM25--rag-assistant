Sorry, you're picking the wrong server for your goals. Using an authentication & directory server for data storage makes about as much sense as using an email & calendat server for that purpose. Furthermore, consider ( nicking a Raymond Chen argument ) what would happen if it was possible to store 1 file per user in an LDAP server. Now imagine we have two applications that try to save to that one file. So, the logical conclusion is that you can't have one file, but you would need a filesystem in LDAP.
