When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for logistic regression are surprisingly unstable. Coefficients may go to infinity. LDA doesn't suffer from this problem. Disclaimer: What follows here lacks mathematical rigour completely. In order to fit a (nonlinear) function well you need observations in all regions of the function where "its shape changes". Logistic regression fits a sigmoid function to the data: In the case of well-separated classes all observations will fall onto the two "ends" where the sigmoid approaches its asymptotes (0 and 1). Since all sigmoids "look the same" in these regions, so to speak, no wonder the poor fitting algorithm will have difficulties to find "the right one". Let's have a look at two (hopefully instructive) examples calculated with R's glm() function. Case 1: The two groups overlap to quite some extent: and the observations distribute nicely around the inflexion point of the fitted sigmoid: These are the fitted the parameters with nice low standard errors: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -17.21374 4.07741 -4.222 2.42e-05 *** wgt 0.35111 0.08419 4.171 3.04e-05 *** and the deviance also looks OK: Null deviance: 138.629 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 30.213 on 98 degrees of freedom Case 2: The two groups are well separated: and the observations all lie on the asymptotes practically. The glm() function tried its best to fit something, but complained about numerically 0 or 1 probabilities, because there are simply no observations available to "get the shape of the sigmoid right" around its inflexion point: You can diagnose the problem by noting that the standard errors of the estimated parameters go through the roof: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -232.638 421264.847 -0.001 1 wgt 5.065 9167.439 0.001 1 and at the same time the deviance looks suspiciously good (because the observations do fit the asymptotes well): Null deviance: 1.3863e+02 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 4.2497e-10 on 98 degrees of freedom At least intuitively it should be clear from these considerations why "the parameter estimates for logistic regression are surprisingly unstable".
