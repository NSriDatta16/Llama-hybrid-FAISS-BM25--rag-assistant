The W3 validator points out that you need to escape those ampersands. We mostly get away not escaping them, but who knows, maybe that's the issue. So: http://192.168.200.32:9999/USER_STORAGE?user=bt&amp;token=bEVfjg%2FGHoHHU2CxmAWyiTXFUgN9kN2o8pEKgCFV5Fw%3D&amp;nonce=9jJgj4qGXB4U7m%2FJXjjsmbfreH2J2nT8D789jHY6zro%3D&amp;parent_session=cjDEN3PvltsAqjiagynS8mN6HKeAgqWv82WJqxWiXD8%3D&amp;method=download&amp;filename=Testdokument2 ..although I tested those params unescaped and they worked fine on IE7, IE8, Chrome4, Safari4, and Firefox3.6 on Windows. (See test page below) If that's not it: Are you testing it by navigating to that point in the desired browser, rather than copy-and-paste? (E.g., does the session mechanism rely on a cookie, or disregard attempts from a different user agent, or...?) If there are cookies involved, does this link use a different port from the response that set the cookie? My unescaped test page, worked as expected despite being invalid: Test Page body { font-family: sans-serif; } the link Escaped test page, also worked as expected: Test Page body { font-family: sans-serif; } the link
