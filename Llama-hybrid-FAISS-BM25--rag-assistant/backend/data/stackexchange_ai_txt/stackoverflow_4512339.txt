As Evan commented on the question, this will probably work in most cases (again, probably best if you use #pragma pack to ensure their is no padding) assuming all the types in your struct are the same type as your array. Given the rules of C, this is legal. My question to you is "why?" This isn't a particularly safe thing to do. If a float gets thrown into the middle of the struct, this all falls apart. Why not just use the struct directly? This really ins't a technique that I'd recommend in most cases.
