I'd also recommend as very useful a group function after your tables are structured / normalized in the manner that Klaus has designated. What's nice about this is you can actually have the db calculate stats like an average price, amongst discounters, for each product. I'll also point out that you can sort the final result (even after grouping) by the product name to keep everything interface-friendly when displayed. SELECT p.product_name, pd.discounter, Avg(pd.price) as `Average Discounter Price` FROM Product p LEFT JOIN ProductDiscounter pd ON p.product_id = pd.product_id GROUP BY p.product_id ORDER BY p.product_name
