Best practice for organizing JavaScript coming back from Ajax calls

I am writing an application (Asp.Net MVC) that contains a lot of reusable components. I am currently loading these components with Ajax calls, using the jQuery library of course. These components will be calling other sub-components as well, and so there are all these JavaScript coming back. So question is, where should I put the "callback" JavaScript? I currently have something like this: The page: blah $(document).ready(function() { $('#Container').load('SomeCrazyDomain.com/SomeComponent'); }); The Component: Load sub components function GetSubcompent() { $('#SubcompentContainer').load('SomeCrazyDomain.com/SomeSubComponent'); } The sub component: I am a sub compent function ToBeLoadedForEachAjaxCall() { //do something } If, I leave it as it is, what's the effect of loading ToBeLoadedForEachAjaxCall() for each ajax call? Will the broswers kill the last ToBeLoadedForEachAjaxCall() and replace with the "newer" one? Thank you,
