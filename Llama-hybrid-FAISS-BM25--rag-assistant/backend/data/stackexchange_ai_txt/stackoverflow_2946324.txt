How to integrate Facebook the new Graph Api with Authlogic in Ruby on Rails?

Edit : What I recommend now with any Ruby application to use omniauth gem to get access_token , etc. and to use koala gem for Facebook Graph API. I've began with a new project using Authlogic system for Authorization. And I'm now wondering how could I connect Facebook oAuth sessions with my Authlogic session! First of all I want to use and Authlogic-oAuth Gems/Plugins, I what I want to use are just http://github.com/intridea/oauth2 and the interesting http://github.com/nsanta/fbgraph and associate them all with Authlogic. I tried using Authlogic with authlogic-connect extension, but It didnt fill up my needs. And I think the three of the amazing gems above togother will make things done in quality and as I want. Thanks in advance.
