Webcam and Microphone support is not a feature of the HTML 5 spec New APIs In addition to specifying markup, HTML5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces (APIs). Existing document object model (DOM) interfaces are extended and de facto features documented. There are also new APIs, such as: The canvas element for immediate mode 2D drawing Timed media playback Offline storage database (offline web applications) Document editing Drag-and-drop Cross-document messaging (web messaging) Browser history management MIME type and protocol handler registration. Microdata Some of the new features are part of HTML5 mainly because there are no volunteers to split HTML5 and maintain separate specifications of these features.
