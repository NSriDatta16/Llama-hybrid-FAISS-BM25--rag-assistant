I tended to not use them for a few reasons: They introduce another level of state to be managed. The relational model of the system doesn't always directly map to the object model. Keeping them decoupled lets me optimize the relational model independently of the object model. I'm ok with having sql queries strewn throughout the code though I may be in the minority on this. SQL is very simple, has wonderful bindings in most languages and is often programmatically constructed (I'm not talking sql-injection here, I always use bind variables where they can be used). I think datasets were mainly intended as a way to support drag and drop data access in the forms designer. I love the table designer and the query designer but have found the extra overhead of datasets to but not worth the effort.
