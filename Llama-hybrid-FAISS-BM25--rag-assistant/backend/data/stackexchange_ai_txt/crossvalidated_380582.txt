Is variance the only cause of overfitting in any Machine Learning Algorithm?

I am used to associating high variance with overfitting - I don't know how else to think of the physical manifestation of variance wrt an algorithm. Also, the only cause of overfitting seems to be high variance. Is there a causal relation between both of these, do they mean the same thing or am I missing something?
