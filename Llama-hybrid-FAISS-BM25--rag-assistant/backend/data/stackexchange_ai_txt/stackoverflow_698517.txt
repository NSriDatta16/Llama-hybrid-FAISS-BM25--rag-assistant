My favorite R book is R Programming for Bioinformatics , by Robert Gentlemen. It doesn't try to teach you statistics at the same time as you learn the language, but rather presents the language from a programmer's viewpoint. I thought the book gave much better background than any of the online resources did. This is from the perspective of a biologist/programmer who didn't know much statistics when first learning R.
