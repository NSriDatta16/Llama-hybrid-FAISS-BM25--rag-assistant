Class Member variables and OpenMP

I have a scenario like the following: //class somemethod contains the member variables(declaration) val1 and val2, //and is defined in somemethod.h. #include void abovefunction(x) { //code that could be made parallel if val1 and val2 is declared private() } //abovefunction() is in somemethod.cpp, where the methods of class somemethod //are described The function is later called by some object like obj.abovefunction(x). Since val1 and val2 are declared/initialized in somemethod.h, so I cannot use them as private (val1, val2), and something like private (this->val1, this->val2) is also not possible. Can anyone please let me know the best way to parallelize using OpenMP in cases like this where the variable is a part of class and declared not in the immediate scope of the code block where OpenMP pragmas are applied ? I have asked the same question on the OpenMP forum - http://openmp.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=886#p3516 Thanks, Sayan
