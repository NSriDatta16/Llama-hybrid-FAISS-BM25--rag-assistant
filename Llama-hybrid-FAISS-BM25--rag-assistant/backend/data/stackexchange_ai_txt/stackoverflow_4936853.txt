I believe that your application can change the unix permissions of its local storage data files such that they become accessible to other applications and to adb. However, your application cannot change the lack of list permission on the /data directory of a secured phone. As a result, you would have to grab the file with 'adb pull /full/path/to/file' - you cannot browse to it since you cannot generate a listing of /data or likely several other intermediate directory parents of your file.
