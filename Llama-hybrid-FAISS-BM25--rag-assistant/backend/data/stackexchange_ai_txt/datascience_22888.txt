Is web analytics similar to data science?

I just finished PhD and initially wished to work on data science and deep learning. However, after some rounds of interviews, I have been offered a job of web analytics and business intelligence at a medium size company. Is there any similarity with data science, and is there a future in it? Because of some precarious situation, I have to accept this job, but should I keep looking for another job meanwhile, or will the experience be helpful to rise up the ladder or join a big brand?
