This reminds me of an organizational concept called a "knowledge tree" where you can easily setup "destination leaves" which contain valuable documentation and you can provide a simple yes/no or multiple choice traversal based on a given situation. There is a company called Knowledge Tree that offers a free version of their software (since there is no formal testing or tech support) that may give you a springboard in which to work with.
