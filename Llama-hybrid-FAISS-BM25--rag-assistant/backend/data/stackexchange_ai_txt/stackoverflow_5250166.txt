We usually have the first process create a flag file (and empty text file with an .flg suffix) after it finishes copying the large file. So your process checks for the presence of the flag file. One reason why it is good to have the flg file from the organization sending the file, is that they consider it to be finished. Without it we have loaded a file that was somehow stopped before it was finished on their end and eliminated half their sales force from access to our site. This is NOT a good thing. Another use of flag files that we do with some customers is that they put the number of records in it that the main file should have, now we can check to make sure the main file actually has that number of records or stop the process.
