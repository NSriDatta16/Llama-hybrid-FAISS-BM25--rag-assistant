Why is passenger hitting my index page so aggressively

I just moved my apache/mongrel setups to use passenger and I started noticing my index page is getting hit pretty aggressively (approx 5000 hits a day) I chucked in some logging and it turns out the ip address (REMOTE_ADDR) is showing up as "::1" for these hits. Has anyone seen this kind of activity? There must be a reason for it. Is there any setting I forgot to configure or set? EDIT Thanks Gavin, it looks like this is the dummy connection. Now the question is how I go about disabling it , Passenger conflicts with mod rewrite I just posted a question on the passenger news group (may take a few mins to show up), will update this as soon as I hear back. UPDATE 2 These 3 lines in my Apache configuration solve the issue: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*internal\ dummy\ connection.*$ [NC] RewriteRule .* - [F,L] I am trying to find out if this belongs in passenger or is a bug local to my setup.
