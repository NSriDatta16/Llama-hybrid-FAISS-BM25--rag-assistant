(Farrel Buchinsky brought this to my attention. It is often best to contact a package's author/maintainer if there is a problem as we don't necessarily follow both R-help and SO.) Noah is right in saying just deleteDoc() and the uploadDoc(). We can do this in the uploadDoc() also. I've just added a replace parameter to uploadDoc() (default is TRUE) and that will (when I solve a possibly related bug) a) move the current document, if it exists, to a temporary name b) upload the new document to the target name, c) delete the temporary document if the upload was successful or, if not, move the temporary document back to the original name. Something is up internally when testing this, but this should be in the next release.
