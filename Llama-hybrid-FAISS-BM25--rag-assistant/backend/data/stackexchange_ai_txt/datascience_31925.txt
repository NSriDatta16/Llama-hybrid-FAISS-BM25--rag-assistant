Predict words in a given corpus from jumbled incomplete characters

A complete newbie to data science. I have to predict the word using characters given. But the characters given can be in any order, and some might be missing or wrong. The problem is I get too many suggestions that arent right. Trial 1: I have tried permutating the given characters and checking if it is a valid english word : https://pastebin.com/ZUZDZPPa This does not take into account autocorrect like features. With autocorrect: https://pastebin.com/mDjVn0Rz Trial 2: Tried limiting editdistance (levenshtein distance) to 2 and used my custom corpus that I built as I knew the context of the word (Occupations or hobbies). https://pastebin.com/iC5TYxzS The problem is that the predictions I get arent close to the answer. I got pretty good results in Trial 2, but I am wondering if there was a better approach as edit distance of 2 is pretty limiting.
