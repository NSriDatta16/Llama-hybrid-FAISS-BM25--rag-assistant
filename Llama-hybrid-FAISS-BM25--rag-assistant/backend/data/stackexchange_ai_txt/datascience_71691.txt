I would call this bad feature engineering, I'm afraid: as the designer of a ML system, one is supposed to analyze their data and find the best way to make the ML system perform as well as possible. In this case by adding a simple feature x % 2 for every instance the decision tree can perform perfectly. [added] Even in the case of a more complex pattern, if there are such "clusters" of numerical values then there must be a logical explanation why this happens, i.e. something which depends on the task that an expert in this problem can analyze and understand. In most real cases this implies that there are some hidden/intermediate variables, and designing the system so that it represents these variables is key. In other words, the numeric variable is not directly semantically relevant for predicting the response variable, because the assumption when using numeric values is that their order matters (here the numeric value behaves more like a categorical variable).
