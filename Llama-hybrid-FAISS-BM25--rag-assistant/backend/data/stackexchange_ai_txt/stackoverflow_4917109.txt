Moving 10 lines up and down might not suit your task as well as other options. Consider other movements: Ctrl f , Ctrl b page forward and back. } , { move forward and back by one paragraph. You can write rules in your vimrc to bind 10j to a key, say J to move down 10 lines by adding the following line to your vimrc file: map 10j However you'd be overwriting the useful existing J command (join two lines). Finding a well positioned unused key combination for 10j / 10k might be difficult, so I suggest using the existing movements that I mentioned. You may also want to know that you can move backwards to a word that you see by doing: ?someword and forward to a word you see by doing /someword . These are going to be faster than trying to move up/down 10 lines and then repositioning your cursor to the exact location. If you cant think of a simple search string for the line in question, you can always go to the line number as you said ( xgg ).
