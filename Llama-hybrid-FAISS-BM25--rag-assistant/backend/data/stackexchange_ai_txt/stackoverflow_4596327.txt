The workaround I use (works in Hudson 1.391) is to configure cobertura in separate Maven profile and run it in a Hudson job as a post-build step. Mode detailed instructions: Add cobertura to your project pom in a special profile (so it won't run while default lifecycle) and configure it to create report in xml format. Install "Hudson M2 Extra Steps Plugin" Configure your Hudson job as Maven 2 project In your job configuration in the "Build" section configure usual clean/install goals In "Build Environment" section select "Configure M2 Extra Build Steps" and add Maven post-build step. Configure it to run "cobertura:cobertura -P your_cobertura_profile_name" In "Post-build Actions" select "Publish Cobertura Coverage Report" and configure proper xml report pattern (default should work just fine)
