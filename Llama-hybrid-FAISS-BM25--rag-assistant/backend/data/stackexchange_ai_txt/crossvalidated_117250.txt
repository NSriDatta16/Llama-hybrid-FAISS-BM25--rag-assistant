Calculating Standard Deviation of Lognormal Returns with Partial Information

I’m using a stock market portfolio simulation program that unfortunately only provides annualized standard deviation and CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) for the simulated strategy. I would like to do Welch’s test, the two-sample t-test, to determine if the simulated portfolio returns are statistically different from the benchmark’s returns. The key inputs I need for this test are the average and standard deviation. Since log returns LN(1+r) are supposed to be closer to a normal distribution than simple returns (r), I would like to perform the 2-sample t-test on the log returns. However, all the program provides is the annualized standard deviation of the simple returns (r) and the CAGR. So to summarize, I know CAGR and annualized standard deviation of simple returns (r). Is there a way to use this info to calculate the arithmetic average and standard deviation of the corresponding log returns, i.e. LN(1+r) given what I know? Note: I believe I can probably calculate the average of the LN(1+r) return stream with this formula: LN(1+(1+CAGR)^(1/251)-1). I used 251 in the exponent because there are 251 trading days in a year. So, I probably can get the mean of the log returns. So, all I'm really trying to figure out is how to get the standard deviation of the log returns (LN(1+r)) given what I know. Thanks!
