In layman terms, the main difference with the classic Neural Networks is that they have much more hidden layers. The idea is to add labels to the layers to make several layers of abstraction: For example, a deep neural network for object recognition : Layer 1: Single pixels Layer 2: Edges Layer 3: Forms(circles, squares) Layer n: Whole object You can find a good explanation at this question in Quora . And, if you are interested in this subject I would reccoment to take a look at this book .
