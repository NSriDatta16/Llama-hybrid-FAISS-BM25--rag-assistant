This is a bit tricky. Note that you are interested in $log \ q_{\mu}(\mu)$ , therefore you can neglect any additive constant that does not depend on $\mu$ , no matter if they contain $\lambda$ over which you are averaging. Additive constants not depending on $\mu$ , after exponentiation, would just lead to a normalization factor that in this case you can control easily. These terms go therefore in the $+const$ contribution. The only difference I think is that in the first case ( $E_{q_{\lambda}}$ ) you are explicitly saying what is the distribution of $\lambda$ over which you are averaging. Of course you cannot integrate over $\lambda$ if you do not specify a distribution but if it is clear from the context than you can use the notation $E_{\lambda}$ . Anyway I think you may find many different notations going around, which does not help learning...
