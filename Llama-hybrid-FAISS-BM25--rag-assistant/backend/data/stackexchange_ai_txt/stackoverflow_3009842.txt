UPDATE2: Spoke too soon. browsershots.org shows that it barfs on Opera 5 (I used an earlier version) and some editions of Safari, and (of course) IE7 and below (IE8 is OK). UPDATE: The following code, shamelessly tweaked from Dan M's answer, seems to work in modern browsers. Nice Sidebar Box .wrapper { width: 500px; margin: 0 30px; line-height: 1.5; padding-top: 250px; } .content { margin: 0; margin-top: -250px; } .relatedLinks { height: 300px; width: 240px; margin: 0 1em; background-color: red; float: left; } Related links content here... Do not argue with a spouse who is packing your parachute. Three weeks ago, she learned how to drive. Last week she learned how to aim it. How, if they can't see their reflections, do vampires always get their hair so nice? My wife will buy anything marked down. Last year she bought an escalator. Sign in a men's room: "This is not urinal, it's ourinal, so please flush." She was at the beauty shop for two hours. That was only for the estimate. For those of you who've never been to Las Vegas, there the "G string" is known as the gownless evening strap. Hollywood's a town where they shoot entirely too many movies and not enough actors.

Consider this page: Nice Sidebar Box .content { width: 500px; margin: 2em; line-height: 1.5; } .relatedLinks { position: relative; top: 250px; height: 300px; width: 240px; margin: 1em; background-color: red; float: left; margin-bottom: 250px; display: inline-block; } Do not argue with a spouse who is packing your parachute.

But the left margin is wrong for the text above the sidebar -- not counting the first paragraph. That first paragraph appears before the sidebar in the html code. Not only that, but it bumps the sidebar down -- it's no longer at 250px. I'm pretty sure I can use javascript to fudge around this -- after the page is loaded -- but I'm NOT recommending that approach.
