What is the correct order of these hierarchical priors?

I'm quite new to Bayesian data analysis, so this is most likely am easy question. I have the following model: a function f has two exponential rate parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ and for some input $x$ it returns a set of $p_i$which are success rates for binomially distributed data at different level $x$. So f works similar to an inverse link function in glms. Parameter estimation works fine. Now I would like to set up some alternative models to test, e.g. one in which both $\lambda$'s are equal. They should however reflect independent processes, so I cannot set a common prior from which both are drawn. Instead I would like to add another hierarchical layer. I want the $\lambda's$ to have gamma pirors, so I thought I need an hyper prior that allows for each gamma having independent shape parameters which however have the same mean (drawn from a mormal) (a). But I wonder whether it shouldn't be the other way around, with gamma at the top and drawing from the normals on the second layer gives some independence to the $\lambda$'s (b). Which way would be right to express that the rates are the same but govern independent processes? Many thanks in advance Jan
