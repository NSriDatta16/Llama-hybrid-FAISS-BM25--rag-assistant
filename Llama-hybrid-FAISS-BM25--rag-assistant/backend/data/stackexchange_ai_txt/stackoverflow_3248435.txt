For something as dirt simple and non-critical as a high scores list, a database feels a little like overkill to me. I'd be inclined to use a CSV file myself. Of course, take that with a suitable grain of salt, as I don't develop on Android. If the overhead for SQLite is trivial (or if it's already on Android waiting for you to use it!), may as well use it for your data storage needs, if only to keep your code consistent.
