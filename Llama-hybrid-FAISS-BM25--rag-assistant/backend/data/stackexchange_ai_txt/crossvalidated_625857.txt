Multiple covariates as treatment in double ML

I have multiple economic indicators as covariates such as employment rate, gdp growth, average wage, etc. I want to estimate each of them's effect on travel demand. I was thinking of two steps: Make a DAG based on their relationships Make each of the economic indicators one at a time as treatment variable and the rest as covariates and get the treatment effect using the DAG and Double ML Does this makes sense or not?
