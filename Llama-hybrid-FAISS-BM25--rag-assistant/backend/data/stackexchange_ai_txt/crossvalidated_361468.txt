For the Mantel test see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel_test To be able to store two square matrices about the size 1e6 (number of rows and columns) you need storage in the terabyte range, so I doubt you have enough ram. But given that you have enough disk storage, you can compute this via online algorithms, probably indirectly via online algorithms for covariance and variance, see for instance Online algorithm for the mean square error and search this site for tag [online]. That would obliterate the need for putting together results from many random submatrices, although that would be a possibility too. But I leave details of such an approach to others.
