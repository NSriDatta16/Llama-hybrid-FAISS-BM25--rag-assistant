stochastic vs. deterministic trend in time series

I am relatively new to time series and studying this section - https://otexts.com/fpp3/stochastic-and-deterministic-trends.html . From the above section, didn't quite understand the difference why one is called stochastic and the other is called deterministic. Went through several posts in stack overflow. But I don't see a relation to the answer in below posts to the above textbook. Can some one please explain this. What is the difference between deterministic and stochastic model? Explain what is meant by a deterministic and stochastic trend in relation to the following time series process? I saw the youtube videos in the second link, and I understood the difference between deterministic and stochastic. But, I don't see any relation between the explanation in video vs. text books ( which talks about ARIMA process with D=1)
