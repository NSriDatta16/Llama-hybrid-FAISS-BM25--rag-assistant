Does adding new features that contain information derivable from current features help performance?

So say you have some data that consists of some values: 1.3, 0.9, 1.1 You introduce a new feature which is the average of these values: 3.3 In this example lets say that you know the average of these features is a good indicator to classify data with. My question is that, you're not actually adding anything to the model by creating this 4th feature, all the data is already in the features so does having this average help the model training identify the relationship more easily?
