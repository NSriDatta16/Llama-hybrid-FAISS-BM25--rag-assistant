Regarding question 1, time series do not deal mainly with random walks. Stationary time series have correlation structure that is modelled in for example ARMA models. Time series analysis also looks at periodic effects and trend (we call those time series nonstationary). Looking for patterns in data is not incompatible with statistics as long as there is recognition that there is a pattern + a random component and the random component must be considered in the analysis. Regarding question 2 I don't see why you call TAR a mix of machine learning and statistics. I see it as just a more complicated time series model that includes a threshold parameter an 2 AR models. I guess I also don't see a big distinction between machine learning and statistics. I view machine learning as part of statistical pattern recognition/classification which falls under the realm of multivariate analysis. It seems to me that TAR could easily be extended to putting a threshold on an ARMA model. I don't know if it has been tried or why it might not have been developed. Perhaps someone who works with these type of time series models can answer that question.
