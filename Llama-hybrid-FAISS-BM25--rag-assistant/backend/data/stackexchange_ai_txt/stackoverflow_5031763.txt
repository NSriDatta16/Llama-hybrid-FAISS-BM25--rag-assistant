Eclipse has Internal packages that are not intended for use by downstream plug-ins. However, these packages are visible to downstream plug-ins by default. A discouraged reference is a reference in your code to one of the Eclipse internal packages. You can find more information in the Plug-in Development Environment Guide -> Tools -> Editors -> Plug-in manifest editor -> Plug-in run time -> Access Rules.
