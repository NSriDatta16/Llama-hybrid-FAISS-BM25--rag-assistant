Personal experience: I found Buttons to the right in a column is the least controversial - that is: Once you have decided on that, there are no further discussions such as "align to the left, center or align to the right?", "when right-aligning, shouldn't "OK" get a fixed position, i.e. rightmost?". Windows User Experience Guidelines (as cited by Jay, with a painful root link) say "Commit buttons go to the bottom in a row, right-aligned, OK usually being leftmost". The style guidelines say nothing explicit about "command buttons" (i.e. buttons that don't commit the dialog). The examples hint at a bottom-right row for commit buttons, and a top-right column for command buttons, though I personally find this rather unelegant.
