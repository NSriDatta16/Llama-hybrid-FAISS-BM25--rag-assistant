Seeking C Union clarity

typedef union { float flts[4]; struct { GLfloat r; GLfloat theta; GLfloat phi; GLfloat w; }; struct { GLfloat x; GLfloat y; GLfloat z; GLfloat w; }; } FltVector; Ok, so i think i get how to use this, (or, this is how i have seen it used) ie. FltVector fltVec1 = {{1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}}; float aaa = fltVec1.x; etc. But i'm not really groking how much storage has been declared by the union (4 floats? 8 floats? 12 floats?), how? and why? Also why two sets of curly braces when using FltVector {{}}? Why use a union at all? Why not do.. struct FltVector { GLfloat x; GLfloat y; GLfloat z; GLfloat w; } ? Any pointers much appreciated (sorry for the pun)
