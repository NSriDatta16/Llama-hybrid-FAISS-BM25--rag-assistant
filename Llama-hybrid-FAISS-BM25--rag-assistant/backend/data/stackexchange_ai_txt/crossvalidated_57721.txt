The Ljung-Box statistic is not significant calculated over lags one to six lag six simply because you have no particularly large autocorrelations until lags seven & eight. Plot & examine the auto-correlation function of the residuals. There's some evidence for lack of fit, so perhaps you can come up with a better model: higher autocorrelations seem to repeat at intervals of seven without dropping off, suggesting seasonal differencing with a period of seven might be worth a try; possibly a seasonal moving average term. All the same, with about 150 observations your current model doesn't look awful.
