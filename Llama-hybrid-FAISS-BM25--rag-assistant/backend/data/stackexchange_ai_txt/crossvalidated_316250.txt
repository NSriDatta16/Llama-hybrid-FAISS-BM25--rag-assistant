Prediction interval for the predicted probability obtained using a logistic regression for new subject

I am trying to calculate the prediction interval for the predicted probability for a new subject using a logistic regression, and I wonder if we can use the same formulas that is used for linear regression and to calculate the predicted interval for the linear predictors and transform it to the probability scale. I tried to do it by hand and I got very wide interval and comparing it with the result obtained from predict function in rms package it was tonally different. Does any one knows how it should be calculated !
