Since you do not specify any probability distribution of the numbers (as others have correctly mentioned, there is no uniform distribution over all the positive integers), the No Free Lunch Theorem give the answer: any method (that does not repeat the same number twice) is as good as any other. Once you start making assumptions about the distribution (f.x. it is a human being or binary computer etc. that chooses the number) this of course changes, but as the problem is stated any algorithm is as good as any other when averaged over all possible distributions.
