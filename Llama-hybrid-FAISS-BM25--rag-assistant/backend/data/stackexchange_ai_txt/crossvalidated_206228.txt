I agree that clustering is not the right approach. It does sound like dimension reduction in terms of the sheer number of industries is a goal. Chances are that many of these industries are so sparse in your data that they could be eliminated based on judgement alone. For instance, based on a minimum threshold of mentions, the most infrequently named industries could be tossed, further reducing the burden of sparsity. You've indicated that 94% of your companies have five or fewer industries assigned to them. One obvious question is whether or not the industries mentioned for each company are ordinally arranged. By this, I mean that companies will have a distribution of involvement, from high to low, across the industries they are concentrated in. So, going across the industry field, is the first named industry the primary focus of a company's activity? If so, then you could ignore industries 6-48 and create five fields that capture the first five named industries, spanning ~94% of the possibilities. It looks like the industries do not correspond to any standard industry classification system such as SIC or NAICS but if they can be classified along those lines, that would be another approach to dimension reduction. The beauty of these systems is that, once a code is assigned, then the hierarchical nesting enables a roll up to as few as 15 or so very high level sectors, e.g., Consumer, Retail, Manufacturing, etc. Another approach would be to use a robust PCA algorithm as discussed in this paper by Xie and Xing ( http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pengtaox/papers/cpca.pdf ). They propose a range of techniques for modeling sparse matrices. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) aims to learn compact and informative representations for data and has wide applications in machine learning, text mining and computer vision. Classical PCA based on a Gaussian noise model is fragile to noise of large magnitude. Laplace noise assumption based PCA methods cannot deal with dense noise effectively. In this paper, we propose Cauchy Principal Component Analysis (Cauchy PCA), a very simple yet effective PCA method which is robust to various types of noise. We utilize Cauchy distribution to model noise and derive Cauchy PCA under the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework with low rank constraint. Our method can robustly estimate the low rank matrix regardless of whether noise is large or small, dense or sparse. We analyze the robustness of Cauchy PCA from a robust statistics view and present an efficient singular value projection optimization method. Experimental results on both simulated data and real applications demonstrate the robustness of Cauchy PCA to various noise patterns. They have Matlab code available but the core of the algorithm can be readily written up in any software which allows matrix manipulation.
