symfony 1.3 or 1.4 is the right choice for now. 1.3 if you've used symfony 1.0 before, 1.4 if not. I am personally not a fan of the from sub-framework in symfony 1.1+ for many reasons, but you may find it entirely agreeable. That's a personal choice, then. symfony 2.0 is not stable, and many of the features it is introducing are not those which would really interest a developer, I feel, at this stage at least. sf2.0 is however a impressive exercise in making the next generation of web frameworks; but, not in making the sites you make more feature-rich or easier to develop. It may make them faster and more elegant under the hood, but this is not necessarily the primary advantage of a framework to a developer. An example of this is dependency injection. It's a further abstraction of the already excellent symfony core code components, and its inclusion only increases my respect for the symfony core team and their advances - but for an end-user it probably leaves many scratching their heads over the advantage. The main advantage of symfony once you appreciate the basic framework is the community and its plugins, and this I think is the dealbreaker for sf2.0 right now. Yes, I know it is essentially built from 'plugins', but you will lack several crucial plugins I'm sure, and either have to write them yourself or adapt existing to suit. This is the reason you reject Zend Framework. Still, just my opinion. I've been a symfony 1.0 and 1.1 developer (mostly 1.0) for over 3 years, and it still hasn't let me down.
