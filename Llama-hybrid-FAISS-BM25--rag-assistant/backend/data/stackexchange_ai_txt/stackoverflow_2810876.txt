Expanding videoplayer like CNN-website, prerably jQuery-based

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a script/plugin, jquery-based or otherwise, which could be used to achive the effect that can be found on CNN.com. I'm talking about the videos that are representet by a small thumbnail, that when clicked expands in to the text and plays. I'm by no means a JS-guru, and me and flash isn't the bestest of friends, but I'm not completly cluess. Essentially, what im looking for is a way to click a thumbnail, expand a swf, and stop it if i contract it again. something like that. ANY ideas, tips or insights are welcome!
