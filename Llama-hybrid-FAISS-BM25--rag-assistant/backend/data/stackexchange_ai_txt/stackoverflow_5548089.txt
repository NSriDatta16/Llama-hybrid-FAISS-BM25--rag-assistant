iPhone twitter integration: NSXMLParserDelegate protocol not found error

Im very new to iPhone programming, and am facing this really weird issue with importing the Twitter+OAuth libraries for implementing some basic twitter integration into my program. My SDK is iPhone 3.1.3. After i drag-drop the twitter+oauth library, i add the header path and the library search path [$(SDKROOT)\usr...whatever as i found in this tutorial ] I then added the libxml2.dylib framework to the project. When i compile the project, i get six errors, all the same from different .h files that say "NSXMLParserDelegate protocol not found". Please help! :(
