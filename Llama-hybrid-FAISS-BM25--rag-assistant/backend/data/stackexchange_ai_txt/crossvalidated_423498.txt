How to interpret the result from local sensitivity analysis?

I am currently doing local sensitivity analysis on a model that has 40 input parameters. I varied the base case value by 10% within the range of [-1, 1]. While doing so the average change (here, I averaged the values for all observations and got the single output) with the base case value is 0 for some parameters. How do I interpret 0 in this case? Does this mean that the parameters I am using have no influence in my output? I could not find any literature that could verify my interpretation. Hence, any help/suggestion would be highly appreciated. The equations I used to calculate sensitivity index (SI) and elasticity (EI) is given below: Q being the output and P being the input to the model. Thank you!
