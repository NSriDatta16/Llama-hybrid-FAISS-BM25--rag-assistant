Tada!!! With Images: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; CGRect myImageRect = CGRectMake(touchPoint.x, touchPoint.y, 20.0f, 20.0f); UIImageView *myImage = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:myImageRect]; [myImage setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"YourImage.png"]]; myImage.opaque = YES; // explicitly opaque for performance [self.view addSubview:myImage]; [myImage release]; } This code will draw an image wherever you touch!! I couldn't test it on a device yet, but i believe it would lag just a tiny bit. (because of many images on screen) With Quartz: The second way is to use Quartz, try this link: http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=132024
