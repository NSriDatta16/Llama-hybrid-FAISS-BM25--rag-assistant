Basically, the clean way to abort a task is to ask it to nicely, and then let it shut itself down gracefully. That could be with a flag, a cancellation token (e.g. Parallel Extensions) or anything like that. This only works when you're in control of the task - or when it's already programmed to do this - but it's useful in a large number of situations. I don't agree with the "wait for the previous operation to complete before executing the next one" in general. It depends on the operation, of course - but if you can run two operations in parallel, can prevent the completion of the first one from messing things up, and don't mind the first one continuing to run until it notices the "stop please" flag you've just set as per the first paragraph of this answer, that's fine. It depends heavily on the situation though.
