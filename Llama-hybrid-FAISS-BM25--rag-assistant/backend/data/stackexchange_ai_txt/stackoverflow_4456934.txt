I can't think of anything that would require hacking the core to accomplish. Take a look at extensions like K2 or Zoo or template frameworks like Gantry or Warp5, they do amazing things without touching a single core file. Joomla was written specifically to extend. It has a very good API that is pretty well documented. It's even getting better with 1.6 on the horizon. Anyone who tells you that most Joomla extensions require hacking the core don't know what they are talking about.
