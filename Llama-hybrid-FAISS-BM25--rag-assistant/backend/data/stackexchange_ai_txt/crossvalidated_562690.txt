1. Don't confuse statistical significance and practical significance Your result is statistically significant if the probability of finding a difference as large as the one you have (or larger), under the null hypothesis that the advantage to white is the same under chess870 and chess90 , is less than some preset criterion, conventionally $p \lt .05$ . It is practically significant if the difference you did find, +0.191 versus +0.1790, is large enough for anyone to care about. That isn't a statistical question. 2. With all the data, you don't need to care about statistical significance You're in an unusual situation because you can evaluate the advantage for literally every possible starting position. If you're totally happy with your definition of advantage (that is, the number generated by this one evaluation engine), then your results are a statement of fact: chess90 starting positions on average yield a greater white advantage than chess870 positions. Things are more complicated if you want to generalise, for instance to other evaluation engines. If you can only obtain results from some evaluation engines, statistical significance once again comes into play, as you're trying to draw conclusions about evaluation engines in general based on information from a limited sample.
