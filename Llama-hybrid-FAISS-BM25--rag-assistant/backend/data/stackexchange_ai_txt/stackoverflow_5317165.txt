You can declare variables with global scope or group scope. Global scope variables are visible to the whole report (just like parameters). You can declare global scope variables by right clicking an empty area, click Report Properties, and then select Variables on the left side. Group scope variables are visible within the group. If you select a Tablix, you will see Row Groups and Column Groups towards the bottom of the designer. Click the arrow at the end of the group and click Group Properties. You can declare variables in there. Group scope variable is probably what you looking for.
