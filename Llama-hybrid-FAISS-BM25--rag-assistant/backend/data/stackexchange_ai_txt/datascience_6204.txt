Well, you just train it on unbalanced dataset, it is not a problem. I don't think you need to apply some special techniques. The only case where you may want to do something special is if your classes are skewed by their nature (if the skewness is the property of class itself, not of just your specific dataset). For example, if you build a classifier which will tell if someone has a malignant tumor in X-ray image or not. By nature of the task absolute majority of patients will not have a malignant tumor. In such case you may want to tune your classifier algorithm a bit, for example introduce a weighting into your SVM or smth like it. A special case is if you have EXTREMELY unbalanced classes. For example 100000 of positive examples and 20 negatives. In such case you will want to go away from classification task to the approach called 'anomaly detection'.
