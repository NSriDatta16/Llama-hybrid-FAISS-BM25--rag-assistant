Are you trying to install the latest RC1 release candidate? I just downloaded it myself, and it looks like their build process (accidentally?) left this information in. The local.xml file is where Magento keeps come configuration information, such as the username and password to use for a database. In previous version of the system, it shipped without a local.xml . This file was created during the installation process. My guess is, as mentioned, the file was included accidentally. I'd try renaming it to something else, or removing it from the folder, and starting your installation. If that doesn't work, then I'd just enter your mysql DB information in local.xml to work around the problem Worth reporting as a bug http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking
