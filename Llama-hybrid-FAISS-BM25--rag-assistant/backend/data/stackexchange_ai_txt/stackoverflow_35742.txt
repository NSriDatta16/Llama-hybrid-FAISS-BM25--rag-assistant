There are several key aspects to multi-agent computing, distribution and independence are among them. Multi-agents don't have to be on different machines, they could as @Kyle says, be multiple processes on a single chip or machine, but they act without explicit centralised direction. They might act in concert, so they have certain synchronisation rules - doing their jobs separately before coming together to compare results, for example. Generally though the reasoning behind the segmentation into separate agents is to allow for differing priorities to guide each agent's actions and reactions. Perhaps using an economic model to divide up common resources or because the different functions are physically separated so don't need to interact tightly with each other. Is it something to ignore? Well it's not really anything in particular so it's a little like "can I ignore the concept of quicksort?" If you don't understand what quicksort is then you're not going to fail to be a developer because most of your life will be totally unaffected. If you have more understanding of different architectures and models, you'll have more knowledge to deploy in new and unpredictable places. Ten years ago, 'multi-agent systems' (MAS) was one of those phrases that appeared everywhere in the academic literature. These days it is less prevalent, but some of the ideas it represents are really useful in some places. But totally unnecessary in others. So I hope that's clear ;)
