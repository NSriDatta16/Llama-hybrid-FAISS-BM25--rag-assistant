Q1 Most mobile devices have propriety browsers. How can the app be tested on those different browsers (testing on an actual device is not possible due to security restrictions)?

Android: devices and emulator are available Other mobile phones? check http://www.deviceanywhere.com Of course, you need to pay service fee. But i think its reasonable. Q2 How to optimize the site for different screen sizes? iphone4 WVGA854 WVGA800 VGA HVGA QVGA QCIF+ Making contents for all different size is difficult. So have to make a choice about screen size and supported models. Q3 How to make the app touch friendly? It is your design issue. Q4 How to detect orientation of devices (in devices that come with an accelerometer)? Android and iOS has special message about such event. You have to follow such message. Of course, you need both landscape and portlait layout. Q5 How to check that the device is not a desktop/laptop? You can use User-Agent header or IP address. But IP address is not good method.
