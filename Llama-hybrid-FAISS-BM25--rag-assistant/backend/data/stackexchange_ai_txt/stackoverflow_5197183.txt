If you start adding virtual functions, it will increase by 4 bytes on most systems/compilers (and an extra 4 bytes for every interface you include). Generally speaking, the struct should be the same size as the contents unless the compiler has added extra padding as Aviv said. Have a look at #pragma pack(n)for packing issues, at least in Visual Studio ( Microsoft page on pragma pack )
