How to plot the calibration curve for an ordinal logistic regression model applied to a test sample?

I'm doing a validation study of an ordinal logistic regression model that was made with the lrm function of the rms package in R. How can I plot the calibration curve for the model when applied to new data? I want to create the cal1 and cal2 plots below (without bootstrapping), but using a new sample: library(rms) library(heplots) data(Diabetes) d = Diabetes id = 1:145 d$id = id training = d[sample(1:nrow(d), 75, replace = F),] testing = d[-training$id,] dd = Chemical_Diabetic cal2 = plot(calibrate(mod, kint = 2)) # plot for group >= Overt_Diabetic I have previously used the val.prob function to calibrate a new sample with a binary response, but this function doesn't take an ordinal outcome. I tried changing my response to be binary for each level (y >= Chemical_Diabetic and y >= Overt_Diabetic), but it seems incorrect: pred.test = as.data.frame(predict(mod, testing, type = "fitted")) chemical.pred = pred.test[,1] # select predictions for >= Chemical_Diabetic overt.pred = pred.test[,2] # select predictions for >= Overt_Diabetic y = as.numeric(testing$group) y.chemical
