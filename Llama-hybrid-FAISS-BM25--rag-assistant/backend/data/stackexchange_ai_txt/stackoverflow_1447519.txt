First a scold, then some help, because that's how StackOverflow rolls. Unless you're really conversant with Magento conventions, chances are you didn't change enough of the right things. Read up on the controller distach process in Magento and try tracing its progress So, that read, you now know your frontname here is "vblog_admin". Are ANY pages with this front name loading? If not, check your section of your customized module Your controller name is "manage_vblog", which means in the customized module you should have a controller at the following location: ModuleName/controllers/Manage/Vblog.php . Once you've ensured that controller is in place, make sure it has a newAction method on it. If any of the above steps fail, magento will 404 on you. Finally, in app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Router/Standard.php Search for the text getControllerFileName . This is where your controller gets its name, as well as the general area of the system where Magento decides if it has a legitimate request or not. Update: Based on the file provided below (and private communication) it looks like it's your naming conventions that are causing the problem. Magento is extrodinarly strict about its camel case naming convention VBlog should be Vblog in all instances of class and filenames. While PHP itself doesn't care about case in classnames, msot linux servers DO case about case. Magento can't find your controller class file because of this and that's why you're getting a 404.
