If the goal is to compare A vs. B for one category only, conducting the hypothesis test is easy using a chi-square test of association, or a test of proportions. Note that the table for a chi-square test uses Damaged / Not-damaged , whereas the test of proportions, here, uses Damaged / Shipped . ### Books Damaged = c(65, 45) Shipped = c(4722, 3400) prop.test(Damaged, Shipped, correct=FALSE) ### 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction ### ### data: Damaged out of Shipped ### X-squared = 0.04157, df = 1, p-value = 0.8384 ### alternative hypothesis: two.sided ### 95 percent confidence interval: ### -0.004549325 0.005609444 ### sample estimates: ### prop 1 prop 2 ### 0.01376535 0.01323529 ### Books Books = matrix(c(65, 4657, 45, 3355), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE) chisq.test(Books, correct=FALSE) ### Pearson's Chi-squared test ### ### data: Books ### X-squared = 0.04157, df = 1, p-value = 0.8384 Likewise, this can be done on the totals as well. There are more sophisticated approaches, namely logistic regression, which could include all the data simultaneously, and then allow for investigating each category. Also, be sure to present the proportions, as you have done. With relatively large sample sizes, you might find significant differences that don't have practical importance because the difference in proportions is relatively small.
