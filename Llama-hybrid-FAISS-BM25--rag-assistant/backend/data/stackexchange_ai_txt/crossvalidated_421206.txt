Usually, I'd interpret it as roughly "We have suggestive but inconclusive evidence for X. All else being equal, we think it's more likely than Not-X". I'll note that this confusion around communication of weak results seems to be less of an issue when the analysis is done in a Bayesian framework. The prior is defined and so there's less need to argue over what the default belief should be when the data does not point strongly in one direction.
