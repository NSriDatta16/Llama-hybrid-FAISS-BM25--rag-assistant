Launch Runnable Jar from Web Start

This is my first time trying to use Web Start, and I am trying to launch my runnable jar. I get the following error from my webpage as I click the link to launch the jar. Can anyone help me out? The Notepad example from the tutorial works fine from another link on the test page (JNLP and jar in same folder as I have too). The jar and jnlp are definitely in the same folder, yet the jar cannot be found. Thanks in advance.
