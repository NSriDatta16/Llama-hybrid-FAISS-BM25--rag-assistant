What's the most elegant way to concatenate a list of values with delimiter in Java?

I have never found a neat(er) way of doing the following. Say I have a list/array of strings. abc def ghi jkl And I want to concatenate them into a single string delimited by a comma as follows: abc,def,ghi,jkl In Java, if I write something like this (pardon the syntax), String[] list = new String[] {"abc","def","ghi","jkl"}; String str = null; for (String s : list) { str = str + s + "," ; } System.out.println(str); I'll get abc,def,ghi,jkl, //Notice the comma in the end So I have to rewrite the above for loop as follows ... for (int i = 0; i Can this be done in a more elegant way in Java? I would certainly use a StringBuilder/Buffer for efficiency, but I wanted to illustrate the case in point without being too verbose. By elegant, I mean a solution that avoids the ugly(?) if check inside the loop.
