Average causal effect of one year increase in schooling vs a four-year increase in schooling

I'm not sure why in Mostly Harmless Econometrics , last paragraph of p. 55 , the expectations of $f_{i}(s-4)$ is taken and the expectation of $f_{i}(s-1)$ is not. The text reads: Conditional on $X_{i}$, the average causal effect of one-year increase in schooling is $E[f_{i}(s)-f_{i}(s-1) \vert X_{i}]$, while the average causal effect of a four-year increase in schooling is $E[f_{i}(s)-E[f_{i}(s-4)] \vert X_{i}]$ In the second equation there is an expectation inside the expectation.
