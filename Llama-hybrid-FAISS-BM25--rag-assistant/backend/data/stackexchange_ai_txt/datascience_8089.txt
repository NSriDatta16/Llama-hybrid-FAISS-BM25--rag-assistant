Two recent papers use a Deep learning architecture called CharWNN to address this problem. CharWNN was first used to get state of the art results (without handcrafted features) on Part of Speech (POS) tagging on an English corpus. The second paper by the same author uses the same (or similar) architecture for predicting whether a word belongs to 10 Named Entity classes, with apparent state of the art results.
