Don't how they track it since I don't work there. I am pretty sure that they have enough storage to record every little thing about their user if they wanted. If I were them, I would use AwStats if I just wanted to know basic stuff about my users. It is more likely that they have developed their own scripts for tracking their users. Stuff they would log -ip_address -referrer -time -browser -OS and so on. Then a script to see different data about the user varying by day, weeks, or months. As brulak said, something along the line of Analytics, but since they have access to actual database, they can learn much more about their users.
