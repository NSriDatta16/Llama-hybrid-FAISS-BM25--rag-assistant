How to simulate a HTTP Post request from a django view without a template

I am writing views, not so keen to write templates right away. But I need to test my program by submitting post requests. How do i simulate HTTP Post from within a django view I am aware that urllib2 and httplib modules of python allow a lot of options, but I am looking for something that elegantly integrates into the django views. Would U create a method that performs post, where would you call it from? Update: Some of the answers deal with testing by sending a POST to my application. What if I want to POST to an external service and deal with POST response. How can I do it without writing templates.
