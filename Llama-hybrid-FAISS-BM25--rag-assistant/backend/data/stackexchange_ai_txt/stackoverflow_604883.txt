Where to put view-specific javascript files in an ASP.NET MVC application?

What is the best place (which folder, etc) to put view-specific javascript files in an ASP.NET MVC application? To keep my project organized, I'd really love to be able to put them side-by-side with the view's .aspx files, but I haven't found a good way to reference them when doing that without exposing the ~/Views/Action/ folder structure. Is it really a bad thing to let details of that folder structure leak? The alternative is to put them in the ~/Scripts or ~/Content folders, but is a minor irritation because now I have to worry about filename clashes. It's an irritation I can get over, though, if it is "the right thing."
