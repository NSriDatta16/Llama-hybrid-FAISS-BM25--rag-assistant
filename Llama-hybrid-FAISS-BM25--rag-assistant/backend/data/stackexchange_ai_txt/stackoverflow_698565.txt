I second Paolo Bergantino. If you can use an array that would be better. If you don't how to do that, here you go: Instead of making variables like: $var1='foo'; $var2='bar'; $var3='awesome'; ... etc... you can make a singe variable called an array like this: $my_array = array('foo','bar','awesome'); Just so you know, in an array, the first element is the 0th element (not the 1st). So, in order to echo out 'foo' and 'bar' you could do: echo $my_array[0]; // echoes 'foo' echo $my_array[1]; // echoes 'bar' But, the real benefits of putting value in an array instead of a bunch of variables is that you can loop over the array like this: foreach($my_array as $item) { echo $item; } And that's it. So, no matter how many items you have in your array it will only take those three lines to print them out. Good luck you with learning PHP!
