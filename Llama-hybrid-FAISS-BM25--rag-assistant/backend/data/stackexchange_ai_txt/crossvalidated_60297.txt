Showing that $s^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$

$s^2 = \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} $ which apparently equals $ \frac{\sum(x_i^2) +n\bar{x}^2 - 2n\bar{x}^2}{n-1}$. Does this just come from expanding the numerator and using the fact that $\bar{x}$ (the average) is not dependent on $i$? How might one continue this to show for certain $E(s^2) = \sigma^2$?
