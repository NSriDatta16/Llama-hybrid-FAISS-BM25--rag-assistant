Why doesn't every OOP runtime allow manual deletion (garbage collection) of object instances?

You can create new objects, but when you've finished using them there's no real way to destroy them immediately as well? Why didn't every OOP runtime implement such behaviour? I'm sure we as developers could (often) organize for object instances to be destroyed when we've finished using them. function work(){ var p1:Point = new Point(x, y); var p2:Point = new Point(x2, y2); .... destroy p1; destroy p2; }
