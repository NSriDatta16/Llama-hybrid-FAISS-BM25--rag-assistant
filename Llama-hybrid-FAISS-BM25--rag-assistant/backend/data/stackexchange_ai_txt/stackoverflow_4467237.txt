wmode=transparent and wmode=opaque are evil. And here's why: • It works sporatically between different browsers when it comes to how it renders it with content. As you've observed, sometimes the stage will allow clicks to bleed through, sometimes not... sometimes you'll get a flicker in the flash when trying to layer html content over the flash... etc.. • It kills flash performance, and drags the users machine down with it (causing CPU usage to spike).. this is mostly due to the Flash player being forced to send its rendering directions through the browser instead of directly to the GPU... aaand it's not able to intelligently throttle down its FPS when hidden from view. • Random, god-knows-where-they-came-from bugs that appear in Flash once you flip wmode over to one of those awful options... I've seen firsthand text rendering bugs, shape-drawing bugs, and externalInterface bugs that magically disappear once you remove the wmode parameter, or switch it over to one of the other friendlier values. Have you considered creating a hybrid? A type of solution where you have several swf movies - their x/y in the browser window controlled by HTML? I guess you'd still have to use wmode=transparent to layer it over the rest of the page, but then at least you'd consistently get your ability to click through to content below...
