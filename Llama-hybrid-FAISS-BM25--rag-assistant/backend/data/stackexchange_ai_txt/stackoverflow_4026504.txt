ensuring a windows service will run before logon

I built an application that is running as a windows service and is installed through my code. All is fine except at logon. When at the first windows xp/2003 server logon screen, I am not sure if the service is running at all. If it is, then it does work as it's not functional (the service IS USING WINPCAP so that could be an issue). The service settings are set to "interact with desktop" and run as SYSTEM. How can I ensure the service will start before windows logon? Also how can I make sure it is running even after I log off?
