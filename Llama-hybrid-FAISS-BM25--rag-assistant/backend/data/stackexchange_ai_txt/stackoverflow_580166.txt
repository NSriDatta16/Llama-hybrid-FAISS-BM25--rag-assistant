Those two give me this (as an example): com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily (Bundle identifier) Internal.icns (Resource File) I tried to extract the icon using this method: NSBundle *bundleWithIcon = [NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:bId]; NSString *iconPath = [bundleWithIcon pathForResource:rFile ofType:nil]; But bundleWithIcon is nil . bundleWithIdentifier: requires you to have already created an NSBundle instance for a bundle with that identifier; it only looks up a previously-created instance. Therefore, you'll need to find the bundle in the file-system and instantiate it by pathname. Fortunately, you seem to already have the link to the question about that.
