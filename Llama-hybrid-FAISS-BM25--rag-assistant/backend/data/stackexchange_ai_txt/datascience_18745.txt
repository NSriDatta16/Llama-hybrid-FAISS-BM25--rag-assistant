You could do sentiment analysis for this task. Since the output is binary (yes/no) and there are obviously key words that will let you know whether a stock is available or not. You could get very good results using an LSTM for the sentences that feeds into a final logistic regression layer to answer whether the answer is yes "1" or no "0". So you'd end up with an output probability of the question being answered "yes" or "no". This guy did the exact same model (with a different dataset basically) using theano, I highly recommend looking at this tutorial (code is provided as well): http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html All you need to do is build a dataset and get your hands a little dirty with python & theano. If you want to go deeper, look into word embeddings. Alternatively if that is too deep, you could just use a naive bayes algorithm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering It has good results on spam detection & probably might be able to help with your task as well!
