Because this is a one-time job from the sound of things, not an ongoing job, it doesn't have to be that elegant a piece of code, or frankly even pick up all the data. It won't have to be maintained so you can pretty much write anything that'll work, and there's no point in spending longer processing the odd rarities than it would take to update them individually, such as: UPDATE Table SET NewValue=86400 WHEN OldValue='86400 Sec'; UPDATE Table SET NewValue=86400 WHEN OldValue='24 hrs / valid=13:44'; This way you at least update all identical cases in one go, but it's far less work than trying to parse the real oddities. Write what you can to handle the bulk of the cases (which it looks like you have) and just go through the rest manually as above. If you spot any patterns you can script in that then by all means script them but sometimes a manual job is the right answer.
