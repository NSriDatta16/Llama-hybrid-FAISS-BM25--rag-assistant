Yes, this is supported. In the SDK, there is a project template for "Text Relative Adornment", which shows the general idea. That template places an adornment underneath text, like a highlight, but you can place text-relative adornments anywhere on the view ("text-relative" just means that the adornment scrolls with the text). For examples, you can start with this AgentBadgeVisualManager.cs file, which is for displaying a user "badge" off to the right of a piece of text. I recently wrote a blog article about text relative adornments , though it's more of "best practices" and less of "here is the code you need to put an arrow on the editor".
