This isn't the most elegant solution, but I tested it and it does work. Check to see if the current bounds contains the bounds of the full map. Google doesn't actually include the north and south pole, so I had to tweak it to go almost all the way north and south. bounds = gmap.getBounds(); var fullEarth = new GLatLngBounds(new GLatLng(-85, 180), new GLatLng(85, -180))) var isFull = bounds.containsBounds(fullEarth); min_lat = isFull ? -90 : bounds.getSouthWest().lat() max_lat = isFull ? 90 : bounds.getNorthEast().lat() min_lng = isFull ? 180 : bounds.getSouthWest().lng() max_lng = isFull ? -180 : bounds.getNorthEast().lng()
