Voice commands are included in iOS, but there is no public API for developers to hook into. Instead, you'll need to work with a third party framework to implement this feature - I would recommend looking at Nuance (the makers of Dragon Dictation). It looks like they have an API and framework that you can use, but I'm assuming there is a licensing cost. http://www.dragonmobileapps.com/developers.html
