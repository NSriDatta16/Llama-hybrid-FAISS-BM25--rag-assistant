Finally solved the issue. First thing to know is what's the maximum texture size allowed for the device: GLint texSize; glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, &texSize); When I ran this the texture size max for the Motorola Milestone was 2048x2048, which was fine in my case. After messing with the texture mapping to no end I finally decided to try opening and resaving the image..and voil√† it suddenly began working. I don't know what was wrong with the format the original image was stored in but as advice to anyone else experiencing a similar problem: might be worth looking at your image itself.
