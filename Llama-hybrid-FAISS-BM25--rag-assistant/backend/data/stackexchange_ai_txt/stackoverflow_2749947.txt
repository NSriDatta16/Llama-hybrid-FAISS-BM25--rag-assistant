what about using different and so on!? or something like wrapper or content as usual instead of using body! so you have: body { padding:0; margin: 0; text-align:center; } /*applied to all*/ h2 { font: normal normal 14px sans-serif } /*applied to all*/ #home_page h2 { color: #333 } /* home page only */ #download_page h2 { color: #666 } /* download page only */ just an example but you got the idea! UPDATE if you are using CMS, i don't know if is a common cms or one created by you, and also i don't know if you are free to edit it as you want in a custom way, or need to be a plug and play for client! Assuming you are rendering all the pages content with php, then you can 1 - check for what page the user is viewing and switch style! not very elegant although! 2 - your cms may have OR if of your creation should have some option for theme creation like: define( DEFAULT_STYLE , true ); //or false this would make my very fisrt responce real! 3 - render the CSS from backend header("Content-type: text/css"); based on what is the user request!
