I was about to answer "each layer, you can't have too much test code", but that's not necessarily true. I would have to say that it depends on how tightly coupled the layers are. If you can get full coverage using only the top layer, which is ideal anyway, you would not have to create separate tests for the lower layers. If not, for instance if the data access layer is a generic library that's only partially used for the moment, you would at least add tests in that layer to get the coverage up and be a bit more confident that you don't have problems there that will show up later.
