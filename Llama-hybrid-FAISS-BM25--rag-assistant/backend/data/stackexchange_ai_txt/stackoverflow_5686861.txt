This isn't working because $username isn't available within the scope of your validateUsername function. (Neither is the $error variable.) See the variable scope section of the PHP manual for more information. You could fix this by adding global $username, $error; within your function, although this isn't a particularly elegant approach, as global variables are shunned for reasons too detailed to go into here. As such, it would be better to accept $username as an argument to your function as follows: 10) { return false; } return true; } if (validateUsername('danielcarvalho')) { echo 'Success.'; } else { echo 'Failure.'; } ?>
