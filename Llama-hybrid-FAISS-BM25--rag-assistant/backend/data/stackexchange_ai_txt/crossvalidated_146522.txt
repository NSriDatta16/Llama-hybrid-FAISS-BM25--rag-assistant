Mixed way ANOVA

I have two variables (group, achievement level). I want to check the effect of an intervention on different achievement levels. For example, I want to check whether there is an increase in achievement scores in low achievers, average and high achievers. Please suggest me which statistical tool should I use? Shall I use individual t-test as I have found in many articles? Or I should use mixed ANOVA?
