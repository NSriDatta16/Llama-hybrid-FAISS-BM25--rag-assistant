Bayesian Students learning it might not have trouble telling you whether something "looks" Bayesian, but ask them to solve a problem with a frequentist and a Bayesian approach and they'll probably fail. In my experience students end up being taught that it's just a philosophical difference, with no concrete example that shows the same problem being attacked with both approaches. Now ask them why someone might take a frequentist approach in their example; chances are their best explanation would be something like "well, back in the old days, computers didn't exist..."
