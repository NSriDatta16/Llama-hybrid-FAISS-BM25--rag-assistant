Potential Outcome Framework Notation for ATE's

I am trying to understand/maintain standard notation for Average Treatment Effects (ATE) in the potential outcome framework. Am I representing ATE correctly? Are these even the correct formulas? What would similar formulas for estimating ATE/ATT/LATE for other popular quasi-experimental techniques like regression discontinuity, IV, etc. look like? I'm looking for a list of formulas for estimating the treatment effects for these techniques all using the exact same notation (and ensuring what I already have is correct). I understand I might be missing the i's in the Diff-in-diff notation. Where $Y_i (t=1)$ is the outcome if treated and $ Y_i (t=0) $ if not treated, and $X$ is the treatment and $Y$ is the outcome: Average Treatment Effect of X on Y: $ ATE = E(Y_i (1)|X_i = 1) – E(Y_i (0)|X_i =0) $ Difference-in-difference ATT: $ATT = (E(Y(1)|X = 1) – E(Y(0)|X = 1)) - (E(Y(1)|X = 0) – E(Y(0) |X=0)) $ Regression discontinuity: ATE = ? Instrumental Variable: ATE = ?
