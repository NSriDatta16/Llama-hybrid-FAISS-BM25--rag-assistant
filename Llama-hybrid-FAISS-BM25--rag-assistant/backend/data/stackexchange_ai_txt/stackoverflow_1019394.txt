The reason behind any design documentation is clear communication to all involved. So from that point of view, whatever tools you as an architect select, the finished product needs to be read both now by all involved, and later by maintainers. It therefore makes sense to select at least some fairly standard tools, that will still be around in a few years. That said, design documents are generally used to get the project or system up and going. Thereafter well documented code, and some basic documentation should be sufficient. I would probably pay more attention to the organisation of your documentation, so that people can easily find what they are looking for in the future. It can help to enforce some kind of standard repository structure/system for storing documentation, but don't necessarily insist on all sorts of templates for documentation. Focus on the content and not the tools.
