You don't need to use Sinatra if you want to redirect some URLs. You can use the new redirect method. See the Rails Dispatch article . match "/stories/:year/:month/:day/:name" => redirect("/%{name}") constraints :user_agent => /iPhone/, :subdomain => /^(?!i\.)/ do match "*path" => redirect {|params, req| "http://i.myapp.com/#{req.fullpath}" } end In your specific case, the problem is that the HomeApp class is not loaded. Either add the /lib folder to your load path changing application.rb config.autoload_paths += %W( #{config.root}/lib ) or require the file.
