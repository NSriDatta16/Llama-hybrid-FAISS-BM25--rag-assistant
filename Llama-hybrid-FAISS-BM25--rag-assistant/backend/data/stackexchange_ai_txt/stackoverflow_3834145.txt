Is a join necessary in this sql query?

Suppose I have a table Orders in sql with 4 columns (OrderId int, ProductID int, Price money, Size int) with OrderID and ProductID as a joint primary key. If I want a query to return the most recent order (along with price and size) for every product (i.e., maximal OrderId) is there a way to do this without a join? I was thinking of the following: select o.OrderId, o.ProductId, o.Price, o.Size from Orders o inner join (select Max(OrderId) OrderId, ProductId from Orders group by ProductId) recent on o.OrderId = recent.OrderId and o.ProductId = recent.ProductId but this doesn't seem like the most elegant solution possible. Also, assume that an order with multiple products generates multiple rows. They are both necessarily part of the primary key.
