Major update, major new answer. Let me try to clearly address this point, because it's where the problem lies: "If you argue that "after seeing the interval, the notion of probability no longer makes sense", then fine, let's work in an interpretation of probability in which it does make sense." The rules of probability don't change but your model for the universe does. Are you willing to quantify your prior beliefs about a parameter using a probability distribution? Is updating that probability distribution after seeing the data a reasonable thing to do? If you think so then you can make statements like $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$. My prior distribution can represent my uncertainty about the true state of nature , not just randomness as it is commonly understood - that is, if I assign a prior distribution to the number of red balls in an urn that doesn't mean I think the number of red balls is random. It's fixed, but I'm uncertain about it. Several people including I have said this, but if you aren't willing to call $\theta$ a random variable then the statement $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$ isn't meaningful. If I'm a frequentist, I'm treating $\theta$ as a fixed quantity AND I can't ascribe a probability distribution to it. Why? Because it's fixed, and my interpretation of probability is in terms of long-run frequencies. The number of red balls in the urn doesn't ever change. $\theta$ is what $\theta$ is. If I pull out a few balls then I have a random sample. I can ask what would happen if I took a bunch of random samples - that is to say, I can talk about $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)])$ because the interval depends on the sample, which is (wait for it!) random. But you don't want that. You want $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$ - what's the probability that this interval I constructed with my observed (and now fixed) sample contains the parameter. However, once you've conditioned on $X=x$ then to me, a frequentist, there is nothing random left and the statement $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$ doesn't make sense in any meaningful way. The only principled way (IMO) to make a statement about $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$ is to quantify our uncertainty about a parameter with a (prior) probability distribution and update that distribution with new information via Bayes Theorem. Every other approach I have seen is a lackluster approximation to Bayes. You certainly can't do it from a frequentist perspective. That isn't to say that you can't evaluate traditional frequentist procedures from a Bayesian perspective (often confidence intervals are just credible intervals under uniform priors, for example) or that evaluating Bayesian estimators/credible intervals from a frequentist perspective isn't valuable (I think it can be). It isn't to say that classical/frequentist statistics is useless, because it isn't. It is what it is, and we shouldn't try to make it more. Do you think it's reasonable to give a parameter a prior distribution to represent your beliefs about the universe? It sounds like it from your comments that you do; in my experience most people would agree (that's the little half-joke I made in my comment to @G. Jay Kerns's answer). If so, the Bayesian paradigm provides a logical, coherent way to make statements about $P(\theta\in [L(X), U(X)]| X=x)$. The frequentist approach simply doesn't.
