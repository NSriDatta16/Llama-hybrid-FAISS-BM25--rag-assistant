First of all, if you're interested in assesing when should you promote the extras, the definition of "time" considering the booking of main product as the beginning of survival time may be misleading. I'll show you with an example: A customer books his flight two months before his departure, and another one does it two weeks ahead of his flight. Both of them buy the extra three days before the flight date, but the subjects will have different survival times according to your scenario, because of their booking dates. Another disadvantage of applying survival analysis is the violation of censorships assumptions, as Michael M stated. I suggest using classification techniques, using the binary outcome 1 = buys extra, 0 = does not buy. Random Forest, Gradient Boost or simple classification trees for binary outcomes will probably help you identify the best combination of customers profiles and time that maximizes the chance of the event. Regarding time, I'd use "days before the flight" to make the model output easier to understand. The best part of using machine learning techniques is that you don't worry about assumptions, censorships or model distributions, and with classification trees the output is very easy to understand.
