using a function changing my average from Fahrenheit to Celsius

Hey guys. I got my average number of 32. I know that is freezing and it is 0 degrees in Celsius. What I have to do is use a function write a program to display it in Celsius. I know the Formula is C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9) def fahrenToCel(32): return (this is the part where I am stumped.. I don't know if i'm missing something obvious, or I approached it wrong)
