Logging daily check results with changing requirements

I apologize for the title, but I couldn't think of a better way to ask this question. Basically, I need to create a database model for logging daily checks and parameters on various pieces of equipment. Every day the user will open up a form, it will list a number of tasks to check as well ask for operating parameters to be recorded (for example, temperature). The user then enters the parameters and flags any item that has an issue. The issue I have with modeling this is the fact that the items to check can change as operational requirements change. We may need to add or remove things to check to keep things relevant. I don't really have much example data to show as I am stumped about which way to go. One thing I can think of is keeping some sort of version number but I'm not sure how that would look in a database. The only other thing I could think to do is generate a hard copy PDF of the results and save that, rather than saving the results in the database. That way I don't have to worry about adding/removing items because previous daily checks will not be stored in the database and therefore won't be impacted. This would probably work fine for our needs as we don't have to go back and change anything after it's done, but I can't help to think there is a better way. Let me know if you need any clarification and thanks for any help you can provide. Edit (More Information) Right now we have a blank excel sheet for each device, it's got a list of checks... one is say "General cleanup of hydraulic fluid", or "Check for abnormal noise/vibration" then there are a couple that wily say "Hydraulic Pressure (psi)" and you have to enter the pressure you recorded... there's probably about 20 tasks on average. You then put your name on the sheet, date it, print it and sign it.. it gets filled probably to never be seen again....
