Expanding on @Glen_b 's comment: KS works quite well here. In R , first create distributions like those mentioned set.seed(123) library(moments) library(lattice) UniDist -1 & NormDist -.5] TruncHighDist 0 & HighDist Then test with ks.test : ks.test(TruncNormDist, UniDist) ks.test(InvDist, UniDist) However, the D values are not intuitive (at least, not to me); ordinarily, I would suggest also using quantile plots: qqplot(TruncNormDist, UniDist) But that does not work well here (there is almost no divergence). Nor is a basic scatterplot much help: xyplot(TruncNormDist~UniDist) But Tukey mean difference plots are another matter tmd(xyplot(TruncNormDist~UniDist)) Shows that the difference between the two distributions is near 0 at -1 and 1, but larger in the middle. Comparing the inverse distribution to the truncated normal is much easier; both qqplot and xyplot show huge differences, and tmdplot is fascinating.
