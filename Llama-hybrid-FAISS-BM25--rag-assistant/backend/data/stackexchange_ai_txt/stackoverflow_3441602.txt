Find centre of a group of coordinates in PostgreSQL

I've got a postgres 8.3 database of hotels, each with an associated longitude and latitude stored as a point, and a resort stored as a resort id. I'd like to find the central or average point of the resort. I can do this using a simple query: select avg(lat_long[0]) as latitude, avg(lat_long[1]) as longitude, resort_id from accomm group by resort_id However, there is some bad data in the database, for example there might be an American hotel that is recorded in a European resort. Obviously doing a simple average this data will mean the results are inaccurate. How can I calculate an interquartile mean, or similar method to filter out this bad data? I've currently got about 30,000 rows in my table.
