Limited sockets to midp?

It seems to me that there is some kind of limitation in socket creation in MIDP. I need to make lots of connections to a server (none concourrent) and in the forth or fith try my app crashes. It crashes in the simulator and in my real device as well. To isolate any possibility of it being influenced by my code, I isolated the following code: try { StreamConnection c; StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); c = (StreamConnection) Connector.open( "http://www.cnn.com.br/", Connector.READ_WRITE); InputStreamReader r = new InputStreamReader(c.openInputStream(), "UTF-8"); System.out.println(r.read()); c.close(); } catch (IOException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } This code crashes in the 13th try. I've tryed to add a sleep of 10 seconds inside a while loop and, it crashes at the 13th try too. The crash message is: java.io.IOException: Resource limit exceeded for TCP client sockets - com.sun.midp.io.j2me.socket.Protocol.open0(), bci=0 - com.sun.midp.io.j2me.socket.Protocol.connect(), bci=124 - com.sun.midp.io.j2me.socket.Protocol.open(), bci=125
