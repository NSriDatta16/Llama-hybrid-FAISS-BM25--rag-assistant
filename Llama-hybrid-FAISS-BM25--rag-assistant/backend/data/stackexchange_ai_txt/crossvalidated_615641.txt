Multilabel Classification Task using SVM

I want to classify diabetic retinopathy grades (normal, mild, moderate, severe, PDR) using SVM. But the problem is i don't know which type of svm should i use, because i extract three lession features (MA, HM, and EX), and sometimes one image can contain all of these lession but just belong to one class (ex:severe). Can someone enlighten me should i use multiclass/multilabel SVM in my case. Thank you!
