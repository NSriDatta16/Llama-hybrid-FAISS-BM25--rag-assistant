Maybe its the wording you are using, but this is not in fact regression task, but job for time series. Your data (and time series in general) are correlated with itself, hence invalidating assumption of regression (independency). Therefore I'd suggest to step back and rethink the approach. Try to fit simple ARMA model and see. Time series will elegantly deal with your questions since you will be able to take the trends into account and actually model them. You could use regression, but then the data must be stationary (thus fit regression on differences). However, I would advice to use the reqular time-series approach.
