Intercept UITableView scroll touches

Is it possible to control when the UITableView scrolls in my own code. I am trying to get behaviour where a vertical swipe scrolls and a horizontal swipe gets passed through to my code (of which there are many example) BUT I want a DIAGONAL swipe to do nothing, i.e the UITableView should not even begin scrolling. I tried catching it in here - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView but the scrollView.contentOffset.x is always 0 so I cannot detect a horizontal movement. I also tried subclassing UITableView and implementing - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event etc.. but the UITableView (and I guess it's parent UIScrollView) start to scroll before the touches are notified? To re-iterate, I want the UITableView scrolling to be locked if a diagonal swipe is made, but to scroll vertically normally. (This behaviour can be seen in Tweetie(Twitter) for the iPhone) Thanks for any help!
