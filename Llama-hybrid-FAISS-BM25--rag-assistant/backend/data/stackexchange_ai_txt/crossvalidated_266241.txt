How to fit a generalized logistic function?

I'm trying to fit models that predict probabilities: $h(X,B) \rightarrow (0,1)$ It struck me that for for a great many cases logistic regression seems like a bad link function, I expect an S-curve, but I also expect bounds on the predicted probability to be much larger than 0, and much less than 1. For example, let's say I want to predict the likelihood of a first bankruptcy within 10 years, and I have some feature $x$ (e.g. number of years a loan in is default). Here I might expect, that for all x , $p>>0$ because many people go bankrupt for reasons unrelated to loan defaults, and that $p Fitting such a probability function with logistic regression leads to a very poor fit: The target function above is a (special case) of "generalized logistic function". In this case: $$ {prob} = p_{min} + (p_{max}-p_{min})*logistic(X,B) $$ with logistic inputs $X$ and coefficients $B$. Are there good ways to optimize $p_{min}$, $p_{max}$ and $B$ for this type of function such that a measure of regression error is minimized (log error, squared error, ...), or a similar 'S'-shaped model that's likely to provide a better fit than a logistic curve?
