The data set should only be fetched 1 time. Do you have three data sets for the report, each one representing a different sub-set of fields? If so that would explain the three separate fetches. Can you create a single large data set that satisfies all the cross-tabs and then use run-time filters to produce the individual sub-sets you need? Another option would be to consume your XML via a POJO and leverage it in the BIRT report as a scripted data set. This would certainly give you the control you are looking for. If you are interested in looking at building a scripted data set, have a lok here for a bit of backaground. accessing parameters when writing a scripted BIRT data source in java Good Luck!
