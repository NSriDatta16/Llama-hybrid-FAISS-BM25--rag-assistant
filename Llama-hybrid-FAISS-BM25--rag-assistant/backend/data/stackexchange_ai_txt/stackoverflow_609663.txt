The Controller Key pop-up menu is a way to help you discover what keys the controller (typically a NSArrayController, NSObjectController or a NSTreeController) presents. The best example is the selection key of NSArrayControllers, which contains the set of selected objects. What is confusing is the NSObjectController presents a 'selection' key too, although the controller can control only a single object (therefore the selection = the object). I agree that it is not clear at all. I personnally began to understand it when I bound my objects programmatically (i.e. using the bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options: method).
