I take it you're referring to the out of the box web services. In order to do what you require you will need to leverage the 'webs' webservice available at /_vti_bin/Webs.asmx to return details of a web and its subwebs.When you return the details of the website you are querying against, you will have a list of the Document Libraries available. Then you could call the lists service for each list on this to return your data. I suppose my main point is that you will have to traverse through all the webs and subwebs recursively. private void RecurseThroughWebsForDocuments(SPWeb web){ //do whatever with documents on the web here foreach(SPWeb subWeb in web.Webs){ RecurseThroughWebsForDocuments(subWeb); } } You may be better off writing your own custom web service and deploy it on the SharePoint server. You could build a recursive method to run through sites/subsites and then list the document libraries etc. If you are dealing with a large volume of data, you could split this into multiple threads and recombine the results before you return them to speed this up. Hope this makes sense, Shane
