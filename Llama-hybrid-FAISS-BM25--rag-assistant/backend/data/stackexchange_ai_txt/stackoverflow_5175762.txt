Why does it need to be a class? Why not just a collection of methods? That's what a helper is: a collection of helpful methods. Business logic does not belong in helpers. You can place your code in a module within the helper file if you want to give some more structure and organization, though. You can put classes in app/models without it having to be an ActiveRecord class, but you should seriously consider what the purpose of your class is before you place it there. If it concerns only rendering the view, and not accessing data directly, it belongs in the view or a view helper.
