Best datastructure for a heightmap

I have a heightmap (a 2D array of floating point values) and I wish to find the highest point on the map, once I have found this point, I want to change its value, and the values of all nearby points. What's the best datastructure to use for efficient retrieval of the highest point? Requirements: Find the highest point efficiently Change the value of an arbitrary set of points, this set will always contain the highest current point, and a load of points nearby, the delta will be different for each point. My current thinking is a priority queue, I can find the highest point in O(1) and I can change a load of values and heapify in O(n log n). Nb. I've marked this as language-agnostic and Lua, because it is a largely language agnostic question, but I will be implementing the final solution in Lua.
