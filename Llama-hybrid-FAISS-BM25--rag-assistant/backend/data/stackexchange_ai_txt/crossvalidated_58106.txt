Finding a correspondence between time-series elements

My problem deals in particular with time-series data about server performance, but the solution is sure to be applicable to many types of data sets. Pardon me if the answer is well-known; I don't know the right vocabulary to effectively search for these things. Suppose I have two sets of time-series observations (let's call them A and B) containing thousands to millions of observations each. For example, A: [ (1367678860, 30), (1367678870, 40), (1367678880, 33), ... ] B: [ (1367678863, 0.18), (1367678873, 0.11), (1367678884, 0.12), ... ] The data in A and B are, in general, collected by different processes with different sampling rates. Furthermore, any number of data points could be straight-up missing from either series. I want to parameterize this data by time with a one-to-one correspondence. That is, I need an algorithm that will find a sequence of ordered pairs (a_i, b_i) whose corresponding times are close to each other. For example, the data above would be converted to: [ (30, 0.18), (40, 0.11), (33, 0.12), ... ] As I said, it needs to work on data sets that don't necessarily share a sampling rate, and for which arbitrary points may be missing. Points that don't match up nicely (whatever that means) with the other time series should be discarded. I've been banging my head against this for a while, trying to adapt the least-squares linear regression method to the problem, but so far I haven't come up with anything good. Stats nerds: what do you suggest?
