Profiling SQL Server and/or ASP.NET

How would one go about profiling a few queries that are being run from an ASP.NET application? There is some software where I work that runs extremely slow because of the database (I think). The tables have indexes but it still drags because it's working with so much data. How can I profile to see where I can make a few minor improvements that will hopefully lead to larger speed improvements? Edit: I'd like to add that the webserver likes to timeout during these long queries.
