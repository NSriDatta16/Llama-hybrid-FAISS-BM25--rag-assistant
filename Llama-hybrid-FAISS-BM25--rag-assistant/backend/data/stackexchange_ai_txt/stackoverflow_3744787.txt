iPhone - Problem with Distribution Certificate

I'm trying to publish my app to the app store. I followed the Apple instructions to create the Distribution Certificates and Provisioning profiles and added them to my XCode Organizer. When I select Project > Edit Project Settings and check the 'Code Signing Identity - Any iOS Device, my DistributionCertificate/Profile appears correctly. HOWEVER when I select Target > Edit Active Target, and check the 'Code Signing Identity - Any iOS Device, my DistributionCertificate/Profile is disabled (the same one mentioned above). I can see the message: "Profile doesn't match application identifer bundleID What am I doing wrong? And How can I go about enabling the code signing in my Target Settings?
