Since you know the total cost of each purchase and the number of items of each type for each purchase, you can model the purchases $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{bread}*X_{bread} + \beta_{eggs}*X_{eggs} + \beta_{milk}*X_{milk} + \epsilon$ where $X_{item}$ is the number of that item in the purchase, and use regression to estimate the parameters. In this model, $\beta_{item}$ represents the average cost of that item across the population.
