The question asks both about standardizing to the 50th percentile and about estimating means, and I think those questions deserve opposite answers. Means I would not be comfortable estimating mean rents from data at 40th and 50th percentiles. There are too many possible changes at the extremes of the distribution which can affect the mean and standard deviation without showing up in the middle percentiles. For example, imagine two datasets of rents, one with and one without summer vacation rentals. These datasets might have similar 40th and 50th percentiles, but the one with summer vacation rentals would have a higher mean, and the 40th and 50th percentile data can't tell you which dataset you have. Medians I'd be more comfortable standardizing to the 50th percentile, using difference-in-differences. For example, consider a model where each state at each time has a lognormal distribution of rents $LN(\mu_{s,t},\sigma_t)$ , with auto-correlation across time and positive correlation between states. In this model the dispersion of rents varies by time but is constant across states. Let $L$ be the states with 40th-percentile data in 2005, and $M$ be the states with 50th-percentile data in 2005. Let $\mu_{L,t}$ , $\mu_{M,t}$ be the average $\mu$ 's for those groups of states at some time. Then we can estimate \begin{align} A&:=\mu_{L,2004}-0.25\sigma_{2004}\simeq\text{mean-log of 2004 data for L's}\\ B&:=\mu_{M,2004}-0.25\sigma_{2004}\simeq\text{mean-log of 2004 data for Mâ€™s}\\ C&:=\mu_{L,2005}-0.25\sigma_{2005}\simeq\text{mean-log of 2005 data for L's}\\ D&:=\mu_{M,2005}\phantom{-0.25\sigma_{2005}}\simeq\text{mean-log of 2005 data for M's} \end{align} The difference in differences is $$(A-B)-(C-D)=\mu_{L,2004}-\mu_{M,2004}-\mu_{L,2005}+\mu_{M,2005}-0.25\sigma_{2005}$$ If the states in the two groups changed similarly between 2004 and 2005, then $$(A-B)-(C-D)\simeq -0.25\sigma_{2005}$$ which gives the factor for standardizing 2005 figures from 50th to 40th percentiles or vice versa, relying only on the model being accurate in the middle percentiles.
