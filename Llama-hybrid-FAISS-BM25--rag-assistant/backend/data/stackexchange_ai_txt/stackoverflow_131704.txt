Is it possible to make an eclipse p2 provisioning mechanism running *locally*?

Eclipse 3.4[.x] - also known as Ganymede - comes with this new mechanism of provisioning called p2 . "Provisioning" is the process allowing to discover and update on demand some parts of an application, as explained in general in this article on the Sun Web site . Eclipse has an extended wiki section in which p2 details are presented. Specifically, it says in this wiki page that p2 will look for new components However after reading it. I suppose (but you may confirm that point by your own experience), that p2 can function file "file://" protocol, which would allow it to provision with local file (either on your computer or on an UNC path '\server\path'), as illustrated here , but also by the files: [eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32]\eclipse\configuration\.settings\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.artifact.repository.prefs [eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32]\eclipse\configuration\.settings\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.metadata.repository.prefs p2 mechanism is used to update eclipse itself, through an eclipse 3.4 update site , and reference in those '.prefs' files with line like: repositories/file:_C:_jv_eclipse_eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32_eclipse/url=file:/C:/jv/eclipse/eclipse-SDK-3.4-win32/eclipse/ Now, how could I replicate the eclipse components present in that update site into a local directory and reference those components through the mentioned '.prefs' files, in order to have an upgrade process entirely run locally , without having to access the web? I suppose that some p2 metadata files present in the distant 'update site' need to be replicated and changed as well. Do you have any thoughts/advice/tips on that ? (i.e. on how to discover and retrieve and update the complete structure needed for a full eclipse installation, in order to run that installation locally)
