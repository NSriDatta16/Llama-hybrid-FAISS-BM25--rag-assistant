Presenting 5-point Likert scale data as a percentage, rather than an average

I'm working on a project that uses mostly descriptive statistics to show how satisfied people who visit police services are with the services at any particular station. The consumers aren't very savvy with statistics, so it's a challenge to present this data (think the police chief of a developing country). Here I'm limited to descriptive statistics. Now, and in this case usually, I'd just take this 'very satisfied' to 'very dissatisfied' data and show a breakdown bar and the final score of all the data and average it on a 5-point scale (e.g. 4.25/5). However, the company I'm working for has been basically taking that data and putting it on a 100% scale because that's the only scale they've found that the audience can understand. 4.25/5 doesn't make sense to them, but apparently 85% out of 100% does. My concern is... how they are interpreting this data (are they secretly interpreting it as a school grade because it's a scale they're familiar with?) and part of me wonders if it's valid methodologically to put 1/5 as 0% score and 5/5 as 100%. Any thoughts on these questions?
