There are two parts to this: Why are you transforming at all? Regression models don't require that any marginal distribution (outcome or predictors) be normal (Gaussian). This point is made repeatedly in threads on transformation in this forum, so I advise search of previous posts. I advise against trying any transformations of temperature, assuming that you have either Fahrenheit or Celsius measurements, which are both standard examples of interval scale variables with arbitrary zeros. You run a great risk of producing something highly arbitrary, if not meaningless. You don't say so, but I guess here that 15 states means 15 states of the United States. If so, then I guess that you are using Fahrenheit and none of your annual temperatures are zero or negative, but in principle they could be and it is a bad idea to use any transformation that would be undefined for possible values of your data. (Zero or negative temperatures would not mix with reciprocal, logarithmic and square root transformations.) Further, whatever you would do to Fahrenheit should mesh with whatever you would do to Celsius measurements, and vice versa. That rule alone renders most transformations moot as contingent on an arbitrary choice of measurement units. Your bimodal distribution sounds like an artefact of which states you have chosen (or for which you have available data), one fairly cold group with low averages and some with rather higher averages. Even if you had 50 states annual temperature would not necessarily be normally distributed. But this bimodality is as likely to be useful as harmful, and I advise leaving the distribution as it is. (A side-issue is that this is a thoroughly international forum, so spelling out which areas you are working with does no harm. There is no presumption that it's one particular country.)
