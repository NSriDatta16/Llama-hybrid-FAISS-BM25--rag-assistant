With modern hardware you should not be doing ad-hoc geometry fiddling for (C)LoD as is done in ROAM. Instead you should chunk the terrain up in blocks (organized in a quadtree or similar setup) and push it to the device in nice hardware-friendly batches. See Thatcher Ulrich's excellent writings on the subject .
