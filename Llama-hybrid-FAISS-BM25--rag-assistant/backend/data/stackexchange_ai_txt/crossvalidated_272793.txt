SVM performance drops in validation

I'm checking my ability to predict a binary outcome using SVM. While the model fits very well, when resampling the model performance drops (but not so much when using logistic regression) which makes me think that SVM overfits this model, but as I understand this should not happen unless cost is set to very low. I'm using bootstrap for validation due to the size of my sample size (and not split sample) In my specific problem I'm using R and caret, I hope this is informative without data. library(caret) bootControl
