This looks like a bug in 1.4 to meâ€”I get the same results using your sample code; switching back to 1.3.2 allows the embedded scripts to execute again. The documentation certainly doesn't mention anything about any changes in 1.4 which prevent the execution of scripts in retrieved HTML. I'd post a question at the jQuery forum and see if anyone else is having the problem; you might get the attention of one of the jQuery devs too.
