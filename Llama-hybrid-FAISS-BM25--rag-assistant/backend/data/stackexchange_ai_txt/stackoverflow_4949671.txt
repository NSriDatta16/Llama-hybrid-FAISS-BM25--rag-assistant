I found a workaround, I did the following: changed the target of the visualization to a child div that has a position of absolute added a second child div that has height and width = 100% and is also absolute This way the second child will "cover" the first (but it's essentially invisible because it is empty) and allow the drag and drop to work(as it will inherit the drag and drop from the parent). Anyone have any thoughts or better ideas? It isn't perfect because it prevents any mouse functions of the Google Visualization, but it still looks good.
