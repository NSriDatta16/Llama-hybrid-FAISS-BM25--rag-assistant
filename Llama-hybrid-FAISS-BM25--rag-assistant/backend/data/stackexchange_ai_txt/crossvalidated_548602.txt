Bayesian and frequentist analyses are not equivalent under non-informative priors in any general sense. For one thing, Bayesian probabilities are exact and frequentist p-values and confidence intervals are approximate except under a very select choice of models. For another thing, the "equivalence" breaks down if there is more than one look at the data, i.e., sequential analysis is being done. I can't think of a situation where there is no information about a parameter. Think about comparing two treatments for treating blood pressure. If you use a flat prior for the treatment effect, such a prior allows the treatment effect to be 100,000mmHg. We know at the very least that the treatment will not shift mean blood pressure by more than 50mmHg. We know more than that in many situations, e.g., that the probability of more than a 10mmHg shift in mean blood pressure is less than 0.025 likely. Some resources about Bayes may be found here .
