Data normalisation and recommendation based on skillset

Given the job title return the skillset required for the job If a user is lacking some skills required for the job, we have to suggest the courses the user has to take to bridge the gap. Problem with 1) is: 1) The provider is returning the skillset only if the keyword(tile of the job) is exact. For instance: For "Accountant" it gives the skillset whereas for "Accounting" it didn't give any result. One another example is: It gives result for "Developer" not for "Software Engineer" or "Software Developer" Does NLP or machine learning solves this issue? If yes, can you give some recommendation on how this problem could be approached. For 2): What is the way to handle recommendations?
