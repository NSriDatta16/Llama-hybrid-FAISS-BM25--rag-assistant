What is the correct way to "gang" together and keep in sync a pair os UIScrollViews?

I would like to have a pair of scrollviews - call them scrollA and scrollB - on the screen that work in parallel. When the user scroll/zooms scrollA scrollB mimics that behavior, zooming and panning identically. And vice versa. Is this possible? Thanks in advance. Cheers, Doug
