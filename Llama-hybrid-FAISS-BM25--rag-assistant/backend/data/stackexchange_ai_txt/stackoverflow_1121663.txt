I'd emphasize the compartmentalization of developing modules here. It allows separate smaller teams to develop portions of an application and then put it together at the end. I'd also like to say that MVVM is definitely the way to go here, but the CAG also encourages you to use dependency injection for your ViewModels, making them more testable than they would be otherwise. Of course you can use dependency injection without the CAG, but it's nice to have this formal encouragement.
