Help me understand iPhone touchesBegan implementation and dragging a UIView

I know this has been sort of answered before ( iPhone "touchesBegan" and "touchesMoved" message ... do not move to centre of touch ), but I'm very new to iPhone development so don't understand the answer. Essentially, what I want to do is have a UIImageView which responds to touches, to move it around the screen. The sample from Apple has the view that when it has touchesBegan, moves its centre to the touch, then moves the view. What I'd like is for the image to pan like when you use the UIImagePicker. The selected image does not snap to the touch, but instead will move from the touch. Any help would be most appreciated.
