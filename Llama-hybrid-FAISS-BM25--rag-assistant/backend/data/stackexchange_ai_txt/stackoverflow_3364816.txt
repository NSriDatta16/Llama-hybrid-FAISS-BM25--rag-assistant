Django Model retrieval gives wrong type error

I have a template that has a button that posts just the button's name to a view which has the following code: if request.POST: a = request.POST name = mymodel.objects.get(id = a )[0] return HttpResponse(name) request.POST has the name of the button that submitted the post. THE error is: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'QueryDict' However, when I do: a = request.POST['name] , django raises a no 'name' in post error. How do I fix this?
