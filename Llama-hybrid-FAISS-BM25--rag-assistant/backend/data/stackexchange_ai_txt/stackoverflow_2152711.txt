Where can I get a touch event with phase UITouchPhaseStationary?

In these methods, I get corresponding phases: touchesBegan:withEvent: UITouchPhaseBegan, touchesMoved:withEvent: UITouchPhaseMoved, touchesEnded:withEvent: UITouchPhaseEnded, touchesCancelled:withEvent: UITouchPhaseCancelled. Where can I get a touch event with this phase: UITouchPhaseStationary ?
