Create a script that runs the query 1000 times, or whatever number of iterations causes the results to stabilize. Then follow your process as described above, but just make sure you aren't relying on a single execution, but rather an average of multiple executions, because you're right, the results will not be stable as row counts change, and your machine is doing other things. Also, try to use a wide array of inputs to the query, if that makes sense for your use case.
