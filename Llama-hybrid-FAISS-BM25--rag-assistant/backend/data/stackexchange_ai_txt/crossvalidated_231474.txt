Are there any methodologies for combining the class probabilities from a classifier run on partitioned data?

We have n datasets, all in the same format, managed by separate organizations. For legal/privacy reasons, the raw data cannot be retrieved from their servers. We run classifier models against the individual datasets. Are there any legitimate approaches to combining the predicted class probabilities to make inferences about the larger population? Since this is a broad question, pointers to relevant literature would be greatly appreciated.
