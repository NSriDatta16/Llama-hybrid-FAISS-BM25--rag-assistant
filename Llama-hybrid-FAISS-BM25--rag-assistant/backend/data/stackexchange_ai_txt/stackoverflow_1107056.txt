This is of course IMHO... ORM in general treats databases as merely a storage medium for data and is geared towards maintaining the constraints/business logic in the "O" side and not the "R" side. I haven't seen any ORM products that make use of some of the more "hardcore" relational database concepts like alternate keys, composite unique indexes, and exclusive subtypes. In a sense, ORM makes the database a second class citizen. Call me old fashioned, but ORM seems to be good for reading data but for writing data back to a non-trivial relational design, I've always found it falls short. I prefer to do all my updates through SQL and/or stored procedures.
