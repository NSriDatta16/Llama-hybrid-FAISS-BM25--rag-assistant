VB6 Runtime Type Retrieval

How can you obtain the Type (the name as a string is sufficient) of an Object in VB6 at runtime? i.e. something like: If Typeof(foobar) = "CommandButton" Then ... /EDIT: to clarify, I need to check on Dynamically Typed objects. An example: Dim y As Object Set y = CreateObject("SomeType") Debug.Print( y) Where the output would be "CommandButton"
