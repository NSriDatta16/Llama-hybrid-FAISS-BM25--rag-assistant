Random Forest and Decision Tree Algorithm

A random forest is a collection of decision trees following the bagging concept. When we move from one decision tree to the next decision tree then how does the information learned by last decision tree move forward to the next? Because, as per my understanding, there is nothing like a trained model which gets created for every decision tree and then loaded before the next decision tree starts learning from the misclassified error. So how does it work?
