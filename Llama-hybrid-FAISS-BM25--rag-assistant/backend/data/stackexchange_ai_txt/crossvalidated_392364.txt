How to put list of unordered elements as features into a random forest model

Assume that I have 3000 unique rows of data to train with. For each data point, I have a special attribute called $SomeFeatureList. This is a list of independent features (categorical features) that are not of the same length (from 6 - 10), and it is not ordered. I can expand the feature into 10 independent columns, but I thought about it and decided against it because this would imply artificial relationship that doesn't exist. If I put certain features into column 5 and others into column 4, this doesn't imply that features in column 5 are a distinct group from column 4. In fact each feature in that list are equal to another. What do I do in this case that would: Make sure each feature within the list is considered by the model - I can't just aggregate them into one feature because that would be creating a lot of arbitrary categories. Generate no arbitrary correlations by putting them into distinct columns. Thanks! Regards.
