Forecasting an ADL model

I am fairly new to Stata, currently taking an undergrad time series econometric class. The economic significance of the regression I am running and attempting to forecast is all but zero; this is simply my learning how to use Stata somewhat efficiently. I have run an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL) regression of Industrial Production ( ip ) using two lags of ip and one lag of the Federal Funds Rate ( ffr ). My goal: forecast this model 30 periods into the future. I was hoping I could run an AR(2) model of the ffr and forecast it 30 periods (this is straightforward and I have done so) and then use these values to forecast my ADL model 30 periods. Does this make sense and could someone inform me on how I could do this or suggest another method?
