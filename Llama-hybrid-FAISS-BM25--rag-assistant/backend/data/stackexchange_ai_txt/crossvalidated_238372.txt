Your interpretation should be slightly different: The second one (-0.55195) is the difference between the mean biomass of the year 2 and year 1 For observations with intercept values on other categories, namely organ1 and year1 . The third one (0.65445) is the difference between the mean biomass of the year 3 and year 1 For observations with intercept values on other categories, namely organ1 and year1 etc. The interaction effect is the difference in main effect with other categories on other variables. So the eight one (YEAR2*ORGAN2) is the difference between observations with year1 and organ1 versus year2 and organ2 (in addition to the main effect). About your second question: you can't really answer that based on this table, since all first categories are the reference group. I think you should run a pairwise comparison of groups to answer that question.
