In Xcode, groups are just for organization, and all of the data files that you add to the project will be placed in the root of your application bundle, regardless of their group (assuming that the group isn't a folder, etc.). If you use a folder instead of a group, then the directory structure is preserved. I think UIImage imageNamed: always looks in the root.
