I like the book Linear Models in Statistics (2nd ed.) by Alvin C. Rencher, G. Bruce Schaalje. It would probably be a more advanced undergraduate text and requires knowledge of Matrix Algebra. I'd encourage you to check it out and to see if it is at your level as undergraduate abilities vary considerably from institution to institution and person to person.
