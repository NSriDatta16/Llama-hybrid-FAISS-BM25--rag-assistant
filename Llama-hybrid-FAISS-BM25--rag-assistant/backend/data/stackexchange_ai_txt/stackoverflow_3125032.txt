The Chrome Developer Tools took over the features of Firebug, so all the main features and familiarity are there (such as the $0 , and console object). There are some small differences, such as the DevTools do not have a CSS panel (although CSS stylesheets can be manipulated in the Elements panel). The Chrome tools additionally have the Timeline , Profiles and Storage panels. The Timeline panel logs loading, CSS rendering, and JavaScript parsing. The Profile panel profiles resource usage and the Storage panel shows and allows changes in the site's database, local storage, session storage, and cookies. Finally, both tools have their own minor variances, which make various actions a tiny bit easier or harder. My advice is to use Firebug for Firefox, and DevTools for Webkit browsers, since only Firebug Lite works on Chrome, and it lacks many features the normal Firebug has (and the DevTools are built into Chrome).
