Dani Gamerman & Hedibert F. Lopes. Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic Simulation for Bayesian Inference (2nd ed.). Boca Raton, FL: Champan & Hall/CRC, 2006. 344 pp. ISBN 0-412-81820-5 . -- a more recently updated book than Gilks, Richardson & Spiegelhalter. I haven't read it myself, but it was well reviewed in Technometrics in 2008 , and the first edition also got a good review in The Statistician back in 1998.
