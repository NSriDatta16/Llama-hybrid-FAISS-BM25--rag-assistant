Create appendix in Lyx

I am trying to create appendix in Lyx. I use 'Document->Start Appendix Here' just before the beginning of the appendix text, and I can see that the text before the Bibliography is wrapped in an appendix box. However, when I print the document, the text appears the same way as the main body text, i.e. no indication whatsoever that these are part of appendix. Any suggestion what I may have missed? I have also tried inserting '\appendix' before the appendix text, but it doesn't work either. In addition, how does the section numbering work in appendix? Can I simply organise the sections using the dropdown list
