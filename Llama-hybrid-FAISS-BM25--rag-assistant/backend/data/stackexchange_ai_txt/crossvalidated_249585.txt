Can a neural network tell if it has seen an image before?

I am not trying to classify the image, I just want to know (with a given confidence) if the net has seen the image before. I am using neural network instead of just linearly searching a database not only because I expect the neural network to be faster, but also it will be much more robust to image alterations (if any). How would one train such a network? Normally, we provide the training images and the class but in this case, the classes are seen and not seen, which is paradoxical. EDIT: Facebook research have done something similar. Checkout the paper .
