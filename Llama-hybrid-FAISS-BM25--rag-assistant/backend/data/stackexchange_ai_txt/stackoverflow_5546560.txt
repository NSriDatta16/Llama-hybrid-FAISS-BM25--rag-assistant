There are a couple of solutions. Using cookies . (don't...) Using AJAX . (can get mildly difficult depending on how you handle this) Using Web Storage that's being added with HTML 5. (might be easiest to implement) Take note. If you want persistent changes to the database, you need to use AJAX, basically make a request via JavaScript with some data to a PHP page that updates your database. Cookies and Web Storage can be deleted by the browser the end-user is... using. But still. A table structure for your project seems difficult to implement for your level. That's why I highly recommend Web Storage. Later Edit Take note, all of your AJAX needs can be handled by jQuery.ajax() , which can be a highly useful library in all of your endeavours.
