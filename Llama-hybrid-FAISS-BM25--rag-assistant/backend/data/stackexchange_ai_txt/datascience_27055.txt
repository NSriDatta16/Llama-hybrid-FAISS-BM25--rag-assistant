What algorithm can predict structured outputs of arbitrary size?

I have a collection of graph objects of variable size (input) which are each paired to another graph of variable size (output). The task is, given an input graph, produce the most likely output graph. I have been looking at 'structured output' techniques such as SSVM but as far as I can tell, they all act on outputs of fixed size (or at least a size that matches the input size, i.e. sequence tagging). Are there any tools that can map an input to a structured object of arbitrary size?
