HTML5 and CSS3 are modular projects. They're supposed to be adopted part by part. You should talk about specific features or modules within the scope of these projects and ask if you can use them today. There are things in HTML5 that are compatible with all older browsers, like the new doctype. Then there are things that can be "faked" from javascript, like native json decoding, or local storage (with flash fallback). It will take many years before you will be able to use the entire specs, but you don't have to wait for that.
