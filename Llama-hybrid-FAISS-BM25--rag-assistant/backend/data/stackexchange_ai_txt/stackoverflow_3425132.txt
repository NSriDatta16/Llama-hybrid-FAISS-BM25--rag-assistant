RegEx - Not match inside a text?

I am working with iCal entries: BEGIN:VEVENT UID:944f660b-01f8-4e09-95a9-f04a352537d2 ORGANIZER;CN=****** DTSTART;TZID="America/Chicago":20100802T080000 DTEND;TZID="America/Chicago":20100822T170000 STATUS:CONFIRMED CLASS:PRIVATE X-MICROSOFT-CDO-INTENDEDSTATUS:BUSY TRANSP:OPAQUE X-MICROSOFT-DISALLOW-COUNTER:TRUE DTSTAMP:20100802T212130Z SEQUENCE:0 END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT UID:aa132e2b-8a8d-4ffc-9e54-b75249e78c72 RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=12;INTERVAL=1 SUMMARY:*********** X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html: LOCATION:Map Room ORGANIZER;CN=********* DTSTART;TZID="America/Chicago":20100730T080000 DTEND;TZID="America/Chicago":20100730T170000 STATUS:CONFIRMED CLASS:PUBLIC X-MICROSOFT-CDO-INTENDEDSTATUS:BUSY TRANSP:OPAQUE X-MICROSOFT-DISALLOW-COUNTER:TRUE DTSTAMP:20100727T025231Z SEQUENCE:0 EXDATE;TZID="America/Chicago":20100810T080000 EXDATE;TZID="America/Chicago":20100807T080000 BEGIN:VALARM ACTION:DISPLAY TRIGGER;RELATED=START:-PT5M DESCRIPTION:********* END:VALARM END:VEVENT I need to parse out starting and ending times. I have a comparison function that determines if the passed in event is between the two times. Due to the increased complexity in calculating the times I plan on not supporting the recurrance series. I would like to play the safe side and make sure my code only reads the first event as a match and not the second. So I have the following RegEx with the single-line option : BEGIN:VEVENT.+? DTSTART;.+?([0-9]{8})T([0-9]{6}) DTEND;.+?([0-9]{8})T([0-9]{6}).+? END:VEVENT This gets me the start and end times of both entries. My thought was to only match ones that don't have FREQ= between the BEGIN:VEVENT and DTSTART. I don't understand how to do this, however. I was wondering if someone could help me out here? I realize at a certain point a full blown parser is a better option, but I am unskilled with parsers and I am under a slight time constraint. I have tried using the !? operator without success.
