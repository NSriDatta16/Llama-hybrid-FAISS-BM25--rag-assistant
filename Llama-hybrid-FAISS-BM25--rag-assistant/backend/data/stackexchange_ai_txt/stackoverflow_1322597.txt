ncover merge reports

we are using NCover from http://www.ncover.com/ For our application we have 6 different solution and we create report for each solution. In NCover explore there is MergeData option which I can use to merge all Coverage.xml. But I want some functionality from command line which I can use in NANT script, has anybody got any idea how to do that thanks
