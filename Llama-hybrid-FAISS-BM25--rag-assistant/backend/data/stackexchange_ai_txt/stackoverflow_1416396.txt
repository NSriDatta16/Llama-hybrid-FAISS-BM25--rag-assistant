Attributes may have as only parameters primitives, typeof expressions and array-creation expression. Nullable is a struct. Therefore it is not allowed there. I suspect the assembly file format itself doesn't allow storage of complex types like structs in the place where attribute values are stored. I don't know of any plans to change that. But I cannot explain why this restriction exist.
