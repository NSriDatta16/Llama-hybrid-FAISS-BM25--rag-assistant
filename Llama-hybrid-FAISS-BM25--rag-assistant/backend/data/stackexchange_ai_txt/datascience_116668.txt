To add a bit more to @ru.mp 's very good answer. It is important to understand the terms "document" and "corpus", because these originally referred to Information Retrieval problems (Finding which documents in a corpus contain some terms, like a search engine). In TF-IDF's use for NLP/Data Mining etc., each of those two terms might have different meanings depending on how your data are structured. It may be that "document" is a line from a file and "corpus" is the entire file. Or a sentence and a paragraph respectively Or an actual document of an actual corpus of course In your example, the corpus is a single text and each "line" is a document. No matter which of the above is true, generally in order for the TF-IDF/sklearn combination to make sense, you can imagine your data being in a table, where each row is a document and all the rows together form the corpus. Thus, as @ru.mp said, you can have different values for the same term in different document (as the nominator for a term is different, while the denominator is the same for all term occurences).
