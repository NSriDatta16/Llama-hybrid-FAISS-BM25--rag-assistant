Drupal theme won't read CSS file

I'm currently working on a drupal theme but keep having problems with getting the theme to read the damn css file. I started off theming with the Framework theme, I tried organising the files on there for example creating a subdirectory to store the CSS file, change the setting in the .info file so it knows it's in the css folder, but it won't read the damn file. Fast forward a few days and I've got 60% of my theme styled and layout-ed, so decided to port everything into a new theme folder rather than the Framework theme folder. Organised the folders and files, but again it won't read the CSS file whether I put it in a subdirectory or in the same directory as the .info file. It somehow worked once, but then went and hasn't worked again. I've tried clearing the cache etc, but to no avail. I'm working on a local wamp server. Drupal is latest version 7. Any ideas how to fix this problem? Thank you
