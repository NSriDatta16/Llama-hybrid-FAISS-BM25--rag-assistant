Why do you not want to use an external gem? They can make your life a lot easier, take a a look at this Mechanize example where you can quickly output every link on the page: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' a = Mechanize.new { |agent| agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari' } a.get('http://google.com/') do |page| p page.links end I've been scraping a lot lately and you can not get very far without parsing the page, I use Nokogiri with plain net/http but will switch to Mechanize in the future. Mechanize uses Nokogiri internally as well.
