Compiler Error C2106 when trying to simulate a vector

I'm trying to write a fake vector for my class assignment, and I currently get an error in the member function pushBack. The compiler doesn't seem to like incrementing the SIZE variable which holds the number of elements in the "vector". Is there something I might need to fix? Your assistance would be highly appreciated for helping me with this, and any other problems you might happen to find. /* Write a simple program that simulates the behavior of vectors -You should be able to add and remove elements to the vector -You should be able to access an element directly. -The vector should be able to hold any data type. */ #include template class Vector { #pragma region constructors&destructors private: T vec[SIZE]; public: Vector() {} ~Vector() {} #pragma endregion template void defineVec(T var) { for(int i=0; i void pushBack(T var) { SIZE ++; //C1205 vec[SIZE - 1] = var; } template void popBack() { vec[SIZE - 1] = NULL; SIZE--; } //template void showElements() { for(int i=0; i myints; myints.pushBack(6); myints.showElements(); return 0; }
