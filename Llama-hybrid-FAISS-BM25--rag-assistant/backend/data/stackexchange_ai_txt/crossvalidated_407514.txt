You are using logistic regression, which is based on a binomial model. Also, you are not predicting rare events, but their probabilities. But for events: Predicting if the event $E$ should occur is the same as predicting that the reverse event, $E^c$ , should not occur, so one cannot be more precise than the other, it is really the same. And for a random variable $X \sim \mathcal{Binom}(n, p)$ , the variance of $X$ is $np(1-p)$ , which is the same as the variance of $n-X \sim \mathcal{Binom}(n, 1-p)$ . So there is no difference. Also, note the comment above by @Stephan Kolassa, and read Classification probability threshold (and the other links there.)
