nCover With many class libraries

So I have my project and it is set up like this: MyProject MyProject.Module1 MyProject.Module1.Tests MyProject.Module2 MyProject.Module2.Tests What I want is the code coverage number for the entire project. I am using nCover... what is the best way to do this? For example would I have to rearrange the project and have everything put into MyProject.Tests?
