It is called a time series observation. This is a bit of an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms because it is never truly observed although it is called an observation. It is a collection of transactions .. your customer data (which can be observed) but it itself is never truly observed. We observe transactions and then bucket transactions into time or space intervals and then analyse the collective to make predictions and even more importantly detect innovation.
