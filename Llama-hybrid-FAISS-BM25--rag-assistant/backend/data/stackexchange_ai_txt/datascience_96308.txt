Can we use machine learning models to parametrize a family of functions

Suppose a parametrized family of functions is defined as $f(Z) = g$ where $g$ is mapping such that $g: X \rightarrow Y$ . Now the problem can be stated as follows: Given inputs [ $X_1, X_2,$ ... $X_n$ ] and responses [ $Y_1, Y_2,$ ... $Y_n$ ] generated from $g_1, g_2,$ ... $g_n$ ; want to obtain the parameters such that $f(Z_1) = g_1, f(Z_2) = g_2,$ ... $f(Z_n) = g_n$ using supervised learning. I wonder if there are related works or if this is not doable currently. Appreciate any insight!
