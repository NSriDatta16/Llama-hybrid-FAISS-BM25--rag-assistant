Just as some more data to consider, I ran my agent against every possible scenario you could have in the game (1-21 sticks left times 5 possible last moves). Some of these states are impossible (e.g. 20 with the last move being 2). I removed most of these from the table but more probably remain. If there is a value for that combination, it means that playing that move at that point will definitely result in a win (assuming continued perfect play). Those marked with an x mean that being in that state will definitely result in a loss regardless of move (assuming the opponent's perfect play). 0 1 2 3 4 5 21 1 20 x 19 3 18 5 5 5 17 4 4 5 16 3 3 x 3 3 15 2 1 1 1 1 14 x 1 1 1 1 13 x x x x x 12 5 5 5 5 x 11 4 4 4 x 4 10 3 3 5 3 3 9 2 3 2 2 2 8 4 1 1 1 1 7 x x x x x 6 3 3 x 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 x 4 4 4 4 x 4 3 3 3 x 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 x 1 1 1 1 So if you're stuck doing analysis, you can lookup in this table what the (or a, if there are multiple best moves) best move is at that particular state. One thing to note jives perfectly with your analysis thus far: if it's your move, and there are 7 sticks left, you're screwed! But note 13 as well.
