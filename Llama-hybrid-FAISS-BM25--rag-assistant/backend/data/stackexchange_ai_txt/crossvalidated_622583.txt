[ Still under editing] There is no definitive rule that tells us what numeric integration method is best for all functions $f$ , it really depends on the function. As far as I understand, you want to do it by Monte Carlo integration, which is fine. You can do definitely better than sampling independent points over the domain, as long the dimension is low. Simple stratified sampling As a start, have a look stratified sampling , a simple yet very effective way to randomly sample points, and still improve the precision of your Monte Carlo integral. To this end, partition the integration domain into $N$ equally sized intervals / squares/ cubes, and sample one point uniformly in each interval. This way, clusters and holes in the point pattern of sampling points are avoided, which yields much more precise results than uniform sampling. In practice, if you want to integrate over an interval $[a, b]$ , say, you would generate $N$ uniform random numbers (between 0 and 1) $U_1,\dots,U_N$ calculate the grid points for integration as $$ X_i = a + (i - 1 + U_i)/N \cdot(b-a),\quad i=1,\dots, N $$ and as usual get the Monte Carlo estimate for your integral by multiplying the average of $f(X_i)$ with the width $(b-a)$ of the intergration interval. The method readily extends to higher dimensions. It is worth while pursuing for dimensions up to three, maybe four, but for higher dimensions the gain in precision compared to independent sampling decays rapidly. .
