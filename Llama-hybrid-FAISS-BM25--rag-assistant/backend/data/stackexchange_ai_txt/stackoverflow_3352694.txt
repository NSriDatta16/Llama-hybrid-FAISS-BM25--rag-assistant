Custom types in CoreData can be declared transformable , meaning that they'll be transformed to and from instances of NSData . The default value transformer works in many cases, but your classes may require a custom NSValueTransformer . Edit: Since utilizing CoreData changes how you retrieve your data, it'd be wise to review your model. Read the CoreData documentation and then consider how your objects are accessed and how you can avoid faulting objects and properties that will go unused.
