jQuery UI: moving items from one list to another

While this should be relatively straightforward, I can't figure out how to move (rather than copy) LI elements between UL s. All I want is to drag any item from list foo to list bar (or vice versa) without duplicating the element. While connectToSortable does almost exactly what I want (though I'd prefer to avoid sortable ), it clones the element - and manually removing the original element by reacting to the stop event turns out to be not so easy (e.g. ensuring that a valid drop actually happened). A simple "hello world" example would help me greatly.
