If you are using jmx4perl with the Jolokia agents, you are able to set parameters with string lists/array values (same for arguments of JMX operations). The are given as a comma separated list of string values. It is still somewhat limited now (no escaping), but there is worked underway to fully support any JSON structure as value for writing attributes. The corresponding clients are jmx4perl as a command line tool and j4psh a readline based JMX shell with context sensitive command line completion.
