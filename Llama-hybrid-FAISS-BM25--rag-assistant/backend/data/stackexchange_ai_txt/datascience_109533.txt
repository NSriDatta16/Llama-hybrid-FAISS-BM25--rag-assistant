HyperOpt: Finding the best modeling based on precision or f1 score

I have been using the hyperopt for 2 days now and I am trying to create logistic regression models using the hyperopt and choosing the best combination of parameters by their f1 scores. However, eveywhere, they mention about choosing the best model by the loss score. How can I use the precision or f1 scores instead? Thank you!
