How to test two methods for their capability of quantifiy target?

I have two quantitative methods A and B, and I ran a series of measurements against a known quantity of target. The difference from the expectation was 56 and 13. To check which method is truly better at quantifying, I ran a t-test using R providing the expected value as average of the distribution. I got: > t.test(A$val, mu=405) One Sample t-test data: A$val t = -5.0987, df = 119, p-value = 1.305e-06 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 405 95 percent confidence interval: 331.7295 372.7205 sample estimates: mean of x 352.225 > t.test(B$val, mu=405) One Sample t-test data: B$val t = -0.87175, df = 119, p-value = 0.3851 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 405 95 percent confidence interval: 371.7133 417.9367 sample estimates: mean of x 394.825 Can I say that method A was significantly different from the expected value but not B hence method B is a better quantitative method than A? Is the format of the test correct for this context? Should it be two-way? Thank you
