Statistical technique to assess nutrition

My goal is to find risk factors for a disease. I think that a malnutrition is a risk factor for this disease. I have 5 variables that indicate the frequencies of eaten meals (lets say per a fixed period, e.g. every month). I put the variables in a logistic regression model, but none of them was significant. My question is: What kind of statistical technique I can use to assign a score for every individual that assess his nutrition? factor analysis? correspondence analysis? discriminant analysis? Can this aproach help finding a "hidden" relationship between the dependent variable and the nutrition score abtained (via logistic regression for example) Thank you in advance for your help
