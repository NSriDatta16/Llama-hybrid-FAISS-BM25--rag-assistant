You can use either Flash or Flex to create your AIR app. Which is easier depends on the nature of your app. If your app is fairly complete as it is and won't change much going forward and you are just concerned with turning it into an AIR app, you can use either. I do like the availability of a command-line compiler (i.e. mxmlc from Flex) as I can use automate the build process more easily. With Flash, you will need the IDE to compile the app. Also, once you get into making it an AIR app, it's highly likely that you might run into things that can be done much faster in Flex than in Flash due to the framework code that you can leverage. So Flex is a better way to go overall.
