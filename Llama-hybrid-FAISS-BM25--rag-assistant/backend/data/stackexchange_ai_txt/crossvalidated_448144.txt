If you can generate an exponential rv. with rate 1 (call this X), then you can generate an exponential random variable with rate lambda by multiplying X with 1/lambda. So, if you want to use an exponential function as a posterior, you can use the re-parametrization trick in variational autoencoders by only generating exponential rv. with rate 1.
