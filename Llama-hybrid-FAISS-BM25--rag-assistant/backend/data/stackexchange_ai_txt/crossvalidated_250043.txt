You can visualize the CDF of $Y$, $F_Y$, in terms of (a) a graph of the transformation $\phi:X\to Y$ and (b) a graph of the CDF of $X$, $F_X$. In this figure the top plot shows the graph of $\phi$ while the second plot shows the CDF. To see the value of $F_Y$ at some trial value $y$, draw a horizontal line at height $y$ in the upper plot (shown at $y=3/8$). Identify all the $x$ for which the graph of $\phi$ lies on or below that line: these are the values of $X$ corresponding to the event $Y\le y$, written $\phi^{-1}(Y \le y)$. They are shown beneath the red parts of the graph. In the lower plot, the values of $F_X$ at this event cover a portion of the vertical axis between $0$ and $1$ (as marked in black). The total amount of coverage is the probability of $\phi^{-1}(Y \le y)$. It is equal to $F_Y(y)$. Consider what happens when, as in this example, $y$ is increased slightly so that it suddenly includes a flat portion of the graph of $y$. Instantaneously, all the probability of $X$ corresponding to that flat portion of the graph of $\phi$ is included within $\phi^{-1}(Y \le y)$. This visual understanding should give you confidence in your calculations, as well as provide intuition for how distributions behave generally when random variables are transformed--even when the transformations are discontinuous (their graphs have jumps), not one-to-one (they don't always increase or always decrease), or have flat spots.
