I have brief answers to the two points in your question, and encourage you to see the reference below for details. Most surface estimation algorithms estimate a point cloud P' to approximate the input set P. The point to point distance between the estimated point and corresponding input point may suffice for your error metric. You are seeking a metric for how smooth the surface estimate is. The literature has several popular metrics with popular choices being curvature and surface variation. Here is an excellent reference relevant to the two points in your question : Pauly, et. al.
