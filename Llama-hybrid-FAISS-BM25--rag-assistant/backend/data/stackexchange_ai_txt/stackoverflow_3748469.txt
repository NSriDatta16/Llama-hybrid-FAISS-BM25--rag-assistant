I see two problems: the primary one is that you have OnDemand , which tells launchd that the agent needs to me kept alive (and that appears to be overriding KeepAlive , which means exactly the opposite). The secondary problem is that you have a space before the key name in LaunchOnlyOnce . Simple solution: remove both the OnDemand and LaunchOnlyOnce keys, and it should work fine.
