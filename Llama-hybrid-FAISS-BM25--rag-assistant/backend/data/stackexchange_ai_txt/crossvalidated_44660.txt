Well, if you knew the variances in the unpaired and in the paired (which would generally be a good deal smaller), the optimal weights for the two estimates of difference in groups means would be to have weights inversely proportional to the variance of the individual estimates of the difference in means. [Edit: turns out that when the variances are estimated, this is called the Graybill-Deal estimator. There's been quite a few papers on it. Here is one] The need to estimate variance causes some difficulty (the resulting ratio of variance estimates is F, and I think the resulting weights have a beta distribution, and a resulting statistic is kind of complicated), but since you're considering bootstrapping, this may be less of a concern. An alternative possibility which might be nicer in some sense (or at least a little more robust to non-normality, since we're playing with variance ratios) with very little loss in efficiency at the normal is to base a combined estimate of shift off paired and unpaired rank tests - in each case a kind of Hodges-Lehmann estimate, in the unpaired case based on medians of pairwise cross-sample differences and in the paired case off medians of pairwise-averages-of-pair-differences. Again, the minimum variance weighted linear combination of the two would be with weights proportional to inverses of variances. In that case I'd probably lean toward a permutation (/randomization) rather than a bootstrap - but depending on how you implement your bootstrap they can end up in the same place. In either case you might want to robustify your variances/shrink your variance ratio. Getting in the right ballpark for the weight is good, but you'll lose very little efficiency at the normal by making it slightly robust. --- Some additional thoughts I didn't have clearly enough sorted out in my head before: This problem has distinct similarities to the Behrens-Fisher problem, but is even harder. If we fixed the weights, we could just whack in a Welch-Satterthwaite type approximation; the structure of the problem is the same. Our issue is that we want to optimize the weights, which effectively means weighting is not fixed - and indeed, tends to maximize the statistic (at least approximately and more nearly in large samples, since any set of weights is a random quantity estimating the same numerator, and we're trying to minimize the denominator; the two aren't independent). This would, I expect, make the chi-square approximation worse, and would almost surely affect the d.f. of an approximation still further. [If this problem is doable, there also just might turn out be a good rule of thumb that would say 'you can do almost as well if you use only the paired data under these sets of circumstances, only the unpaired under these other sets of conditions and in the rest, this fixed weight-scheme is usually very close to optimal' -- but I won't hold my breath waiting on that chance. Such a decision rule would doubtless have some impact on true significance in each case, but if that effect wasn't so big, such a rule of thumb would give an easy way for people to use existing legacy software, so it could be desirable to try to identify a rule like that for users in such a situation.] --- Edit: Note to self - Need to come back and fill in details of work on 'overlapping samples' tests, especially overlapping samples t-tests --- It occurs to me that a randomization test should work okay - where the data are paired you randomly permute the group labels within pairs where data are unpaired but assumed to have common distribution (under the null), you permute the group assignments you can now base weights to the two shift estimates off the relative variance estimates ( $w_1 = 1/(1+\frac{v_1}{v_2})$ ), compute each randomized sample's weighted estimate of shift and see where the sample fits into the randomization distribution.
