Predict future payments using Machine Learning

Considering a data set looking like the following, where the values correspond to the amount of money paid. Name Age 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 A 83 0 0 1000 900 550 0 B 24 550 550 0 0 0 0 C 35 0 0 0 0 700 500 D 63 0 0 0 400 0 0 E 17 0 0 0 0 0 1600 The goal is to predict how much still needs to be paid in the future for the listed people. We can assume that latest 3 years after the first payment there won't be anymore payments. (So I want to predict the payments for 2007 and 2008) I was wondering what kind of machine learning algorithms/techniques would be suitable for this kind of problem?
