when do i use skew normal or skew t Regression via MCMC? If in that question you're just interested in the circumstances in which you'd use a skew-normal or a skew-t model, why specify the method of estimation (MCMC)? In respect of when to use it, why would it matter whether I used MLE or MCMC or methods of moments? Do I use them when the data are heavily skewed, for example income data? It depends on which skew-normal and which skew-t you mean. If you mean this skew normal distribution , the skew normal isn't nearly skewed enough for typical income data. In some circumstances, you might use it for the log of income data. This skew-t seems to be used for somewhat more skewed situations (it's not 100% clear that it's the same object you intend though - you should always give enough details for people to be certain of exactly the distribution you mean). Azzalini's skew-t seems to be the above skew-normal divided by the square root of (an independent chi-square on its df). I don't think its the same distribution as the skew-t as in that paper I link above, though it, too, seems as if it is able to be more skew than the skew-normal. Azzalini$^{[1]}$ seems to have used the log-skew-t for income, suggesting that in general that this skew-t may itself not be skewed enough for incomes. Or do I fit a normal Regression model first and inspect the residuals of the normal Regression and if the residuals are skewed, then I apply a skew normal Regression? A normal distribution almost certainly won't be suitable as a model for incomes. [1]: A. Azzalini, T. Dal_Cappello and S. Kotz (2003).
