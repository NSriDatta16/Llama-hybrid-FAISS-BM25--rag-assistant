i tend to follow a pattern like this: 1. Table names are singular nouns 2. Link tables are nouns connected by underscore 3. a synonym can be created for the reverse order of the nouns e.g. ADDRESS ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION_ADDRESS synonym: ADDRESS_ORGANIZATION this tends to simplify all query creation no matter which direction you are approaching the join from. also important is that you use full words, avoid abbreviations - this makes it simpler for everyone.
