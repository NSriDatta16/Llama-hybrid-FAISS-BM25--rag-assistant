EDIT:Here's a link to Pete's project page which has a hex grid sample. http://blois.us/Projects.html There is a pathfinding sample that shows a project called pathfinding which has a Hex Grid, and probably uses the same basic code that minesweeper does. I haven't looked at it yet. It is Silverlight 3 so may need to be upgraded. Minesweeper was pretty elegant. Ralph ORIGINAL: There was a sample for silverlight 2 by peter blois of a hexagonal version of minesweeper. It included source code. He had a very elegant method of doing it by overriding the measureoverride and arrangeoverride on the grid. Mouseovers, etc. worked fine. There was remarkably little code. I can't find the project on the web any more, although google has a stale link to it by searching for hexagon minesweeper silverlight source code blois Peter Blois has a current blog at the below address, so you might try contacting him here... http://blois.us/Projects.html Good luck and tell me how it goes, I'm going to be dong something similar.
