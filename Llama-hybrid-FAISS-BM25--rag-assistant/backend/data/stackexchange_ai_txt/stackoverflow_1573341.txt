An addition to the other answers: in IE, having elements such as in your mark-up will cause all kinds of problems with DOM traversal methods in JavaScript . Have a look at the following XHTML document: Test function show() { var span = document.getElementById("span"); alert(span.innerHTML); } Paragraph containing some text followed by an empty span Second paragraph just containing text The idea is that when the page loads, the JavaScript will get a reference to the empty span and display its HTML contents. That will be an empty string, right? Not in IE it won't. In IE, you get all the content after the span in the whole document: Second paragraph just containing text Also, the second shows up in the span's childNodes collection. That same is also in the body's childNodes collection, meaning a node can effectively have multiple parents . This isn't terribly good news for scripts that rely on traversing the DOM. I have also blogged about this .
