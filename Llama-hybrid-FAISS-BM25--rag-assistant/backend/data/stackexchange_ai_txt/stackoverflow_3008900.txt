How to organize xml data using equivalent to #region / #endregion (outlining) from C# .NET

I'd like to organize my XML data to be collapsable and expandable using a preprocessor command like the #region/#endregion command in C#/.NET. I'm editing this file Visual Studio 2008. Does any such ability exist? I've googled to no avail. The closest I can come to so far is to expand and collapse the tags themselves, so I can collapse between (this is collapsed)
