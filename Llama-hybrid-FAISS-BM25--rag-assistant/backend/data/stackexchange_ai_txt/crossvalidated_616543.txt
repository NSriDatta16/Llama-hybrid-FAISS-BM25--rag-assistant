It's not obvious the usual argument won't go through with two points and no error in $Y$ , and the result would be interesting either way. So, let's actually calculate. Two points, say (-1,-1) and (1,1). Each can be moved left or right by 1/2, with equal probability of each direction. There are four possible slopes, given as y difference/x difference LL: (2/2) LR: (2/3) RL: (2/1) RR: (2/2) That's interesting: the average slope over those four possibilities is 1.16667, which is greater than the true slope of 1. The denominator (the x-difference) averages to 2, but the non-linearity from taking the reciprocal makes the slope averages to more than 2/2 (by Jensen's inequality) -- not less, and not equal to. Is it something special about having just two points? We can try with lots of pairs of points (note: this is lots of pairs, it isn't a sample with equal probability on $\pm 1$ ) > LOTS x z y lm(y~x) #check Call: lm(formula = y ~ x) Coefficients: (Intercept) x 2.329e-31 1.000e+00 > lm(y~z) Call: lm(formula = y ~ z) Coefficients: (Intercept) z -0.001197 0.797857 Ok, so with lots of pairs of points we get the expected dilution, so it is something about the number of points. The next step is to try different numbers of pairs: each point on the graph is an average of 1000 replicates. There is dilution as soon as you have more than one pair, and it settles down pretty fast to the usual value. I think this has something to do with the fixed x values; if $x$ were randomly drawn with 50% probability on $\pm 1$ things would be different. You could then have two $x$ values that were the same and became different only with error, so you'd have a possible horizontal line. However, it's pretty clear that you won't understand the general problem by working with two points this way, because the results are indeed different. This has also been an example of calculations beating handwaving.
