Personally, for small, easily modifiable XML, I find TinyXML to be an excellent library. You can make each class understand it's own format, so your object hierarchy is represented directly in the XML. However, if you don't think you need XML, you might want to go with a lighter storage like yaml . I find it is much easier to understand the underlying data, modify it and extend functionality. (Also, boost::serialization has an XML archive, but it isn't what I'd call easily modifiable)
