Java multiple Images Uploader

I have this new requirement to develop a software which is a large scale image up loader in a web application. I was able to do the same using swing contains several feature like drag and drop, progress bar, remove file / files , modify, limit file size, verify file information, timer, verify at run time ..and its a very powerful tool which uploads images. I would like to do the same in web based app, like user selects 200 images process it and click upload and it should start uploading, like to know any feasible frameworks or any API's which help me do this faster and achieve the same kind of functionality. Please point me in correct direction. -PD
