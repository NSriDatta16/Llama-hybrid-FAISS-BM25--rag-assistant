set an id on jQuery datatables to be used by TableDnD plugin

I have a table which I am loading data into from a server side PHP script which returns the table as JSON for jQuery dataTables to render. I am then using the jQuery tableDnD plugin to allow drag and drop re-ordering of tables, this requires that the rows of the table contain the id matching the table row in the database ie I am wondering how I can achieve this using dataTables as it doesn't allow me to specify this. My current thinking is to use a callback on the data maybe, that or rewrite tableDnD to read the id value from an index column, does anyone have any ideas regarding this?
