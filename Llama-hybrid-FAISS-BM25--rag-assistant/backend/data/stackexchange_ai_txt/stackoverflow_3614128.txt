Should you remove old versions? Up to you. You'll certainly have a "clean" installation. Do whatever you think is best for you. (You might want to reboot your system after uninstalling.) Paul Peelen linked the command line step to do the removal, but I'm going to quote ad verbatim from Apple's "About Xcode.pdf" since the link could disappear: Uninstalling Xcode Developer Tools To uninstall Xcode developer tools on the boot volume along with the directory, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools -mode=all To remove the underlying developer content on the boot volume, but leave the directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=systemsupport To just remove the UNIX development support on the boot volume, but leave the directory and supporting files untouched, from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=unixdev Finally, to just uninstall the directory you can simply drag it to the trash, or from a Terminal window type: $ sudo /Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=xcodedir NOTE: The uninstaller that ships with previous versions of the Xcode developer tools will not clean everything off of your system properly. You should use the one installed with these Xcode developer tools. (Those are current at least as of "Xcode 3.2.3 for Mac OS X 10.6 and iPhone OS 4.0")
