name for histogram of nominal p-values under the null

To evaluate a statistical test or means of generating frequentist confidence intervals, it makes sense to repeatedly simulate data for which the null is true and then compute the nominal p-value, and generate a histogram of these p-values. For a valid test, this distribution is basically flat (uniform). There is good discussion of this point here . Within either the frequentist or Bayesian literature, is there a name for this type of histogram/ method for assessing nominal p-values? A citation for when this approach was first proposed/ implemented?
