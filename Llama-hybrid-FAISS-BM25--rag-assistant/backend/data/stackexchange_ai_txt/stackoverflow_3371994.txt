Representing arbitrary hierarchies in WADL

I am modeling a REST API and part of the API will represent resources that are organized into an arbitrary hierarchy of nodes with values and sub-nodes (kind of like a file system or the windows registry). I would love to create a WADL file so that i can generate the JAX-RS boilerplate for the API but i'm not sure how to represent such a situation in WADL. i could just use a string as a template parameter but i'm not sure how i would detect that that string parameter is allowed to have slashes in its value and generate the JAX-RS @Path annotation properly. Is it legit to create a template parameter that is repeatable and expect that sort of functionality? e.g. HTTP GET http://my.service.com/registry/path/to/my/node where the repeated template params are "path", "to", "my", "node" ?
