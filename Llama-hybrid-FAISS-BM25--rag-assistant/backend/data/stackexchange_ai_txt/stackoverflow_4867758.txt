MSDeploy runCommand using relative path

I am trying to run a command as a part of my packaging/deployment process via MSDeploy. In particular, I am trying to create a custom event log by running installutil against one of my DLLs, but I am having trouble with specifying a relative path to the DLL from the deployment directory. To get started, I added the below config to my csproj in order to generate the runCommand provider inside of my Manifest file. Please note the absolute path to the DLL. TRUE $(AfterAddIisSettingAndFileContentsToSourceManifest); CreateEventLog; installutil C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyTestApp\bin\BusinessLayer.dll After calling msbuild, this generated my manifest correctly inside of my package.zip. When I ran MyTestApp.deploy.cmd /Y it correctly called msdeploy and deployed my files to inetpub\wwwroot\MyTestApp and ran my command from the manifest below: The problem I am having is I do not want to hardcode this DLL path to c:\inetpub\etc. How can I make the above call using the relative path from my deployment directory under Default Web Site? Ideally, I would like MSDeploy to take this path and pass it as a variable to the runCommand statement in order to find the DLL. Then I could write something like: installutil $DeploymentDir\NewTestApp\bin\BusinessLayer.dll without having to worry about hard-coding an absolute path in. Is there any way to do this without using the absolute path to my DLL every time?
