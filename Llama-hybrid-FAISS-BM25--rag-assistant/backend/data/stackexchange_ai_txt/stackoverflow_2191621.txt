How to use a Qt 4 plugin or self developed plugin in qt application?

I'm trying to make a simple application for calendar and it doesn't seem to link properly. Platform: WinXP, Qt: 4.5.3 with MinGW The application is trying to use a predeveloped qt plugin "worldtimeclockplugin" from C:\Qt\4.5.3\plugins\designer. I dragged and dropped this widget in Qt designer on a dialog and then tried to build the app. I tried all possible ways mentioned in Qmake documention and forums, but the linker doesn't find the library and fails to link the application. Can someone provide me the right clues?
