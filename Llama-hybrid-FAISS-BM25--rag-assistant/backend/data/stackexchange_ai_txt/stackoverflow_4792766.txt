Should I use utf8_decode when returning db results stored as utf8_general_ci and/or utf8_unicode_ci?

Should I use utf8_decode when returning db results stored as utf8_general_ci and/or utf8_unicode_ci , or is it simply a case of making sure the file encoding, HTML content-type and db storage all match up?
