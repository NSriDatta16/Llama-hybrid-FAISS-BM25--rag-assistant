Squeeze a time series to fit in a range while maintaining shape

I have the following time series with intermediate highs and lows marked by the vertical lines: I want to transform/squeeze the series so that the resulting series would fit in a range, let's say [0,1] where the intermediate high and low points touch (or approximately touch) the edge of the range. Here's an extremely ugly approximation of this for the above graph where the highs (marked by red lines) equate to the black line low hitting the top of the range and vice versa for the lows (green lines). Is there a way to do this (like finding a polynomial function, which is then multiplied by the series) while still largely maintaining the shape and minor fluctuations?
