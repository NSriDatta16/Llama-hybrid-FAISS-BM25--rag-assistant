How to better predictions with Random Forest in R?

I am using Random Forest to predict the MRR (Material removal rate). But the predictions have been quite off the mark. Even Linear Regression gave a much better result. I don't know where I'm going wrong. Below is my code in R: data I have even tried a larger dataset (with 100 training and 25 testing samples) but the accuracy where quite off the mark even there too. Both the decision tree and random forest results have been very bad. Where I am going wrong? How to improve the results? Any help would mean a lot.
