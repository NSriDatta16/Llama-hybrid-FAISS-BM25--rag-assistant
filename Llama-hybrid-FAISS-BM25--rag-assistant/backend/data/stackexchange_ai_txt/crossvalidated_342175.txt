Self Learning Neural network

Is it possible for a neural network to learn based on its own predictions? So what I really want to do is to have my neural network model to learn from its own predictions but I'm not sure what the implications would be. On my own intuition, I think that it might lead the model into a state where it doesn't work well with new input since what it knows too much only about itself. I would want any advice for the matter. Also I thought of having the model learn from its own predictions that pass a certain uncertainty. But I also have a hard time determining uncertainty for a neural network model and Im using keras.
