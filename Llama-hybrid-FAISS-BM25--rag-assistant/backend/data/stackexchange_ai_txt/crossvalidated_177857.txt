Bayesian Prior in Conditional Probabilities

I have $A$, $B$, and $C$, all are inter-dependent. The question is whether $$\Pr(A | B \cap C) \propto \Pr(A|B)\times \Pr(C|A) $$ Specifically, I want to infer the most likely outcome of $A$ given $B$ and $C$, and I know $\Pr(A)$ $\Pr(C)$ $\Pr(A | B)$ $\Pr(A | C)$ $\Pr(C | A)$ $\Pr(A \cap C)$ I don't have $\Pr(B)$ $\Pr(B | A)$ $\Pr(C | B)$ $\Pr(B | C)$ My math fails me. Is the proportional equality above correct for dependent events? If not, what's the correct way to estimate $\Pr(A | B \cap C)$ with what I have?
