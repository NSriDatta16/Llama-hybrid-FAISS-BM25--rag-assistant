First step, embed the text values of id1,id2 into a vector of real-numbers. Assuming that you use Keras for the overall implementation, this can be done with the Embedding Layer. Then, zero-pad short words or truncate long ones so that in the end you have words of the same length. These words should be vectors of real numbers and their length should be fixed. Lastly, train your LSTM with those real-valued vectors and their labels and then test to see how well it can identify the label itself. A very good tutorial of text binary classification with LSTMs can be found here . Let me know what you think :)
