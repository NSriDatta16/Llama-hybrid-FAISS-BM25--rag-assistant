Solving difference equation for stationary distribution of Markov Chain

Say I have the following matrix where the state space is {0,1,2,3,4} \begin{bmatrix} 1-p & p & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 1-p & 0 & p & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1-p & 0 & p & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1-p & 0 & p\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1-p & p \end{bmatrix} where $ 0 I have derived a general solution for calculating the stationary distribution when $p\neq\frac{1}{2}$: $$ \pi_{i}=A\left ( \frac{p}{1-p} \right )^i + B $$ I would like to determine the values of the constants A and B should be simple enough, but I'm not sure of the boundary conditions. I know the stationary distribution should sum to 1, i.e. $$ \pi_{0}+\pi_{1}+\pi_{2}+\pi_{3}+\pi_{4}=1 $$ For ease, I would like to determine the boundary condition at $\pi_{0}$ as this gives $\pi_{0}=A+B$ It seems like it should be $\pi_{0}=A+B=(1-p)$ but it doesn't look right when I try to solve it.
