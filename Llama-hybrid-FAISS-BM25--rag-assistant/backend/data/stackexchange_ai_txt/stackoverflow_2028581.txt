In general, a queue is used to 'smooth' out publish rate versus consume rate, by buffering incoming requests that can't be handled immediately. A queue is usually backed by some sort of non-volatile storage (such as a database table). So the distinction is not so clear cut. Use a database when you want to perform many searches against your 'queue', or provide rich reporting.
