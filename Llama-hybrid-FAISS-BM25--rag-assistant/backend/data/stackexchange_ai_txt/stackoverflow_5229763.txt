@Alan's answer is entirely correct with regard to Magento's PHP code in app/code and lib/Varien , however the theme files in app/design , js/mage and skin are released under Apache Free License , which (as I understand it) allows you to distribute that code under whichever license you wish (including closed or proprietary licenses), requiring only attribution. The official Magento statement is here , and Roy Rubin from Magento posted re this topic on the Magento boards. As per @Joseph's disclaimer, I am not a lawyer and would recommend that you consult a lawyer. Do have a read of the wikipedia article on AFL if you wish. For reference, the OSL wikipedia article as well. I recognize that this question specifically asked about Magento's classes, I'm merely adding the AFL status for completeness and future visitors' information.
