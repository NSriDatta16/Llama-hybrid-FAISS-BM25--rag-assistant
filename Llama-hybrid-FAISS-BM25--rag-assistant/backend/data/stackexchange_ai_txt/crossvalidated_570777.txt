Is my sample sufficient for PCA?

I’m working on a project for my stats class and I’m wondering if my sample size is sufficient for PCA; I keep seeing mixed recommendations so I figured I’d ask. My sample size is 50 (unit of analysis is states). I have 7 variables after turning my one categorical variable into a binary one through one-hot encoding; prior to that I have 5. I ran a correlation matrix and found that a sufficient amount were at or above 0.3; I also ran a Bartlett test and the p-value was less than .01. The only thing I’m stuck on is whether or not the sample size is causing this.
