Feature selection/reduction technique for combination of features in image processing

I have a combination of features extracted from 3 descriptors. Namely, GLCM based features (correlation, homogeneity, energy, and contrast ), Local binary patterns (256), and discrete wavelet transform coefficients, and a dataset of 40 cases. I am using SVM with RBF kernel. Would there be a need for the feature selection? If so, what do you recommend?
