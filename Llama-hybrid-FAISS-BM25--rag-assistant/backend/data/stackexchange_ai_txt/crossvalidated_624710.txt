How calculate importance ratio for continuous states?

I am trying to understand importance sampling estimators, in particular for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. I am working with the definition: The IS estimator provides an unbiased estimate of π_1’s value by averaging the following function of each trajectory (s_1, a_1, r_1, ..., s_H+1) in the data: define the per-step importance ratio as p_t := π_1(a_t|s_t) = π_0(a_t|s_t) In words, I understand this as: "how likely π_1 takes action a_t in s_t compared to π_0". But if s is continuous and unbounded, how do I get the probability of a given s ? Do I have to fit a model on the (s,a) pairs for each policy? (I thought IS was model-free)
