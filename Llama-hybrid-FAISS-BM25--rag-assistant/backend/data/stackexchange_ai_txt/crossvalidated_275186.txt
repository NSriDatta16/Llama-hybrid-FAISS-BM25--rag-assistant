If estimating your model with ordinary least squares, your second regression is rather problematic. And you may want to think about how the variance of your error term varies with city size. Regression (2) is equivalent to your regression (1) where observations are weighted by the square of the city's population: For each city $i$, let $y_i$ be drunk driving incidents per capita, let $x_i$ be liquor stores per capita, and let $n_i$ be the city's population. Regression (1) is: $$y_i = a + b x_i + \epsilon_i $$ If you run regression (2) without a constant, you've essentially scaled each observation of regression (1) by the population, that is, you're running: $$ n_i y_i = a n_i + b n_i x_i + u_i $$ This is weighted least squares , and the weights you're applying are the square of the city's population. That's a lot of weight you're giving the largest cities?! Note that if you had an observation for each individual in a city and assigned each individual the average value for the city, that would be equivalent to running a regression where you are weighting each city by population (not population squared).
