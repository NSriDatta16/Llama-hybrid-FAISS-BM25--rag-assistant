It depends on how old of a system you need compatibility with. For old systems, there's SHGetSpecialFolderPath . For somewhat newer systems, there's SHGetFolderPath . Starting with Vista, there's SHGetKnownFolderPath . Here's some demo code that works, at least on my machine: #include #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "shell32.lib") int main() { CHAR my_documents[MAX_PATH]; HRESULT result = SHGetFolderPath(NULL, CSIDL_PERSONAL, NULL, SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT, my_documents); if (result != S_OK) std::cout
