iPhone SDK: building app for AppStore

I have dev cert and distibution cert. I am able to build an app to run on my own device and also followed Apple's instuctions to build for AppStore by using Distribution Cert. I also followed Apple's guidance to verify that app was correctly signed by reviewing a build log. However I still have a question. Consider the following screen shot: http://www.braginski.com/temp.jpg There are TWO entires: one which correctly say "Don't code sign" and the second which points to my distribution certificate. All Apple docs show the first box as EMPTY and second box with the acctual cetificate. The problem is that I can't figure out how to make first box empty. So the question is: what should the first box be? Does it even matter? Build log shows that app is signed even when first box says "Don't sign" thanks
