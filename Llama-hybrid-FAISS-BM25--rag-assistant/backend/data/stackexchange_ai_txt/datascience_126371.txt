Recommendation system NLP ideas

The problem : If we have a clustering problem with lets say x groups. And each group has a document describing it, lets say 3 pages. Then we have n observations each with a smaller piece of text describing it, 1 or 2 sentences. And we want to allocate these observations to one of the groups. Ideas : What would be a good technique to use for this problem. Would creating text embeddings for the larger and smaller pieces of text, and then computing their similarities be reasonable? And if so are there any text embedding techniques you recommend?
