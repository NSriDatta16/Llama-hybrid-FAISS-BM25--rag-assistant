1) For the core functionality as you describe it SharePoint isn't going to add anything, BUT if you build it on SharePoints premisses it allows your client to add a lot of functionality outside the core for "free" like: They can add Content Editor WebParts to pages where they can add descriptions, and messages They can add lists where the customers can enter requests/comments/... and automatically have new entries mailed to anyone in the organisation subscribing to changes The functionality you develop can be reused on their intranet Any future small "web apps" can be included in the same site ... So all in all unless you have a better framework to use then use SharePoint 2) WSS is all you need for now 3) Your main deliverable for now would be: a feature with some Site Pages and a few Web Parts a feature with a custom masterpage and corresponding css
