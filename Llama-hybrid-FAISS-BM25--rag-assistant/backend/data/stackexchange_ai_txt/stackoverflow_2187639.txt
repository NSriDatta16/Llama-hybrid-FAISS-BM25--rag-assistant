JQuery UI Nested Tabs - Load AJAX content into a single DIV

All, I am using JQuery UI Nested tabs. Consider the structure like this: There are 2 Main tabs: Animals, Birds. Under Animals, there are two tabs "Cats", "Dogs". Both the tabs "Cats" and "Dogs" should be loaded via AJAX when clicked.. So, the code for them is something like this: Cats Dogs $(document).ready(function() { $("#tabs-loading-message").show(); $('#fragment-1').tabs({cache:false, spinner:''}); }); When I switch tabs to "Dogs", I noticed that the HTML that was generated for "Cats" tab still exists on the page (in a hidden state, but still accessible) and Vice Versa. So if both tabs have common elements, that would be a problem.. How can I fix it such that there is only one empty Div and it gets loaded and repainted with whatever tab is currently loaded or switched?
