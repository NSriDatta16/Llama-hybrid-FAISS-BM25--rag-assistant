It seems that the average student, will take on average a 1.5 Scholarships (somewhere between 0-2.5) if finish on average the Ph.D. in 5.5 terms (somewhere between 0-10), i.e. if we could average the points in the left bottom corner. Also, for sure we can identify that students that need a big amount of terms to finish their Ph.D. for sure they have the least amount of scholarships, whereas the most scholarships are taken by students that are relatively quick in finishing their Ph.D. 0-10 terms.
