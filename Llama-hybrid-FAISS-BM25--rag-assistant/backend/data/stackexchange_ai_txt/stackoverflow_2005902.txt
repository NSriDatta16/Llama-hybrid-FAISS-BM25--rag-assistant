It's tricky because function names are expression not types - you need something like gcc's typeof . Boost's TypeOf is a portable solution that gets very close. However, if the code can be organised so that the work is done inside a function template to which Foo or Bar can be passed, there's a straight-forward answer: template void test(R (*)()) { R var1; } int main() { test(&Foo); }
