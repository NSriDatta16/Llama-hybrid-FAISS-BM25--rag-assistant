Timeseries of odds in race - how to pick a model

Being new to AI/ML I'd like some pointers to where to begin. I got data from horse races. Specifically, I got the odds for each runner during the race - ca 5 times per second. t1 r1 r2 r3 ... 1 5.25 2.04 3.25 2 5.10 2.50 2.75 ... I also know if the runner won/placed/lost My goal is to be able to say that runnerx X will win/place after ca 50-75% of the expected racetime with say 80% accuracy. My problem is that I don't know how to model this situation. I've seem tournament strategies - ie who out of two runner will win - but here's more data - both in time and in participants What model should I pay attention to? /Bj√∂rn
