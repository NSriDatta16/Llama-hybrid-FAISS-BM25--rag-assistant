For a simple test of the difference between populations I would consider using the mean for each individual, and a Mann-Whitney U or t-test to test for a difference between the 15 individuals in each population (since you are only comparing a single variable). You could also do glm where you include 'individual' as a random effect, and test for the fixed effect of 'population'. However, when looking at your plot, it looks like you are mostly interested in the difference in variance between populations. Have the measurements been standardized within individuals or do all hover around zero as raw data? To test for a difference in variance between populations (using means of individuals) you can use the Levene's test . However, all this depends on whether the multiple measurements (the time series) are only used to account for measurment error or if they have a specific purpose (e.g. track a change over time during an experiment). For instance, if you want to model how the difference between populations changes over time you need to take the autocorrelation between time points into account. So the question is; why have you taken multiple measurements for each individual? Basic code for the Levene's test (on means of individuals) would be: library(car) leveneTest(indmean ~ population, data= datafile,center="median") For a preliminary/simple test of difference in individual variance between groups you could use the same test, but with individual variance as response. However, if the main aim is to model within-individual variance and how this differs between groups, a hierarchical random effects model is probably more suitable (nested as observations within individuals within groups).
