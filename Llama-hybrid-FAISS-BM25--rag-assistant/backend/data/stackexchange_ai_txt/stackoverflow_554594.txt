Depiction vs. Depicts

I'm working with FOAF and RDFa, and struggling to figure out whether I should be using foaf:depiction or foaf:depicts and the correct way to use them. Here's what I've already established: Employee Name: Fred Flintstone I understand that depicts and depiction are inversely related. I've searched across the vast reaches of the Internet but can't find any concrete examples. From what I've read, Image depicts Person, so I'm feeling inclined to use foaf:depiction because my subject is Person, but I'm not sure how to do so correctly. Rel or rev? On the image itself or on the enclosing paragraph?
