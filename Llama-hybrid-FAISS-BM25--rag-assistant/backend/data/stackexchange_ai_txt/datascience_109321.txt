The packages you are using are designed to work in a very specific way and the data might not be what is expected at each stage. A NumPy array has to have a consistent dtype/datatype through out. For machine learning that has to be a numerical value, typically float. If try to pass in object type into scikit-learn, it will not work. Scikit-learn expects NumPy arrays as input, not Python lists. If data stays NumPy arrays, the code is more likely to work. You are currently manually looping through the data to transform it. If refactor your code to primarily use scikit-learn Pipelines, it will be more automated and might have more informative error messages. Since you have heterogeneous data, Feature Union is the best practice to process that kind of data for scikit-learn.
