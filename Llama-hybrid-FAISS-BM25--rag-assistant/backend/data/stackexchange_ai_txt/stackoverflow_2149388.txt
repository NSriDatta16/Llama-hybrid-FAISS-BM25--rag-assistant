Score system based on time in Javascript

I have used a jQuery script in order to have a countdown script on a php page that I am doing, but I would also like to have a score system in it based on the time the user takes to answer some questions. I am using some drag and drops and click in a certain link into an image map -which is the only correct link in the webpage- and in the three pages I am using this countdown, but I would like to, once the user has completed the drags&drops or clicked the links, get the number on the countdown just when the user clicked on a "submit" button...but I am not even sure if I can do this. Alternatively, could I use any countdown script that would let me get the actual number that is being showed just when the user click on the submit button? Thanks a lot everybody in advance!
