Agree, but you do need to start somewhere. You can look at trend, autocorrelation, variation around the trend, whether or not each sequence is stationary, compare the distributions of values, estimate and compare a Markov chain model for each sequence, compare extreme values, etc. Sounds like a great open-ended project for some undergrads.
