This is something that I go through in SQL Server and MySQL as well. You should definitely use parameterised SQL queries See this page for examples in many languages. I strongly discourage the use of literal strings in the update statement. Use parameterized queries. There's no reason to compromise security You can write a function which replaces each instance of character ' with '' http://www.kamath.com/codelibrary/cl003_apostrophe.asp
