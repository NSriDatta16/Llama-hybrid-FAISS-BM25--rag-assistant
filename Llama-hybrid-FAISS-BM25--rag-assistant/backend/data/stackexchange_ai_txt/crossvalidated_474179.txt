Can autocorrelation confound causal inference?

I'm working with a weekly aggregated time series that has autocorrelation and I'm trying to find out why the trend has been decreasing by regressing other features onto - I noticed that when I use an ARIMA to account for autocorrelation, it masks some features that wouldn't have been masked from OLS. In the case of this time series, there's certainly yearly seasonality, but when it comes to short term lags there's really no reason to believe that they have a causal influence on eachother, its more likely just caused by the fact that they occur within the same seasonality. Is it better to use something like OLS in this case and ignore the fact that there's autocorrelation in the errors? Or is there justification for still accounting for the autocorrelation? If so, what is it?
