Can Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation find the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) instead of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)?

Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) has a number of advantages for counterfactual modeling, however in my field we often want to estimate the ATT, rather than the ATE, for health care programs or interventions. Part of the procedure for finding a TMLE estimate of the ATE is calculating a "clever covariate" for each record in the data: $$H(A,X)=\frac{I(A=1)}{\hat p(x)}-\frac{I(A=0)}{1-\hat p(x)}$$ The structure of the above formula suggests it's possible to estimate the ATT by simply substituting the inverse weights for ATT: $$H(A,X)=\frac{I(A=1)\times1}{1}-\frac{I(A=0)\times \hat p(x)}{1-\hat p(x)}$$ Is this a correct assumption or is there another method for estimating the ATT?
