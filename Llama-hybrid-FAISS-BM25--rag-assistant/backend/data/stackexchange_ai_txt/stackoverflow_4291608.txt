Syntactically, a div inside a p is invalid in all standards of HTML. Moreover, when using a conforming HTML parser, it is impossible to place a element inside a in the DOM because the opening tag will automatically close the element. Semantically, the correct choice depends on the content that you are marking up. You will need to show at least a sample full paragraph and possibly the content surrounding it to be sure of providing sufficient information for the correct semantic mark-up to be determined. However, given that both and are semantics free, and that CSS in no way can ever change that, if you are certain that the contents of the tag truly form a paragraph, and that gets you the presentational effect that you are seeking, then that is valid HTML and would be a wholly appropriate solution.
