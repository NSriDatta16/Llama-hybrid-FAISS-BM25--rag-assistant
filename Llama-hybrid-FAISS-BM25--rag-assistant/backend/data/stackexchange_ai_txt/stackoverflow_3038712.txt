That doesn't work properly in Safari. http://whatsthepointy.blogspot.com/2010/05/safari-focus-and-popup-alerts.html The problem is caused by that "alert()" in your handler. Safari doesn't realize that its main window regains focus after the alert box is cleared, and when Safari doesn't think it's the focused application it pays no attention to .focus() calls on anything .
