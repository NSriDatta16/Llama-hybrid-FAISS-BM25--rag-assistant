In a non- deterministic system , we cannot know with absolute certainty the future state of any individual. Increasing the number of individuals, measuring more of their characteristics, precisely measuring outcomes, or using different methods to discern the association between characteristics and outcomes do not have the emergent property of allowing us to clearly known the exact future state of individuals. These approaches only allow us to asymptotically approach individual prediction by creating more accurate cohorts; we never have access to an individual's future outcome. Semantics are inescapable here, and I fully accept that based on your definition of "individual prediction" I may have answered an unrelated question. A prediction is a testable claim about an exact future state (eg, "you will have a heart attack"), while risk describes the likelihood of an outcome (eg, there is a 24% chance you will have a heart attack). Testable predictions and risk estimates should be bounded by time. For example, we would never say to a patient "If you undergo this treatment, you will be cancer-free on July 12,2022." We prefer to say "In patients similar to you who undergo this treatment, 50% were cancer-free within 6 months." We simply do not have the information to provide the certainty required for the individual-level prediction, while we have more confidence in the accuracy of the cohort-derived risk estimate. When considering your survival curves, these curves are estimates of risk that, by definition, are derived from and pertain to groups of patients. We may be able to draw more accurate curves from larger samples and better models, but individuals cannot have a risk curve; they either had or did not have an event by a given time. In short: Can we make predictions about the future state of an individual? Yes, but this is an approach fraught with problems of certainty. Can we estimate risk more precisely for an individual? Yes, and this leaves appropriate space for uncertainty. Your question is not new. In 1814, Simon Laplace wrote: We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. However, the advent of quantum mechanics years later supports the notion that the universe is largely probabilistic and not deterministic. Machine learning is unlikely to be the "intellect" that Laplace describes. Your question, as I've interpreted it, may be more philosophic than methodologic, and accordingly, definitive sources are scarce. Thus, there are two books that may help you with the distinction between experiments with one trial or observation in time (eg, an individual) and those with multiple trials or observations over time (eg, aggregates of individuals): Tetlock, P. E., & Gardner, D. (2015). Superforecasting: The art and science of prediction. Lewis, M. (2003). Moneyball: The art of winning an unfair game.
