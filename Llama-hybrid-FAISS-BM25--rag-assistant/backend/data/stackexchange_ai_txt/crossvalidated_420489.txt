This is more of an extended comment. The question is interesting and should have a proper answer. You might look as your nominal values as analogous to words in a text, and look at methods for word embedding . Then the embeddings give numerical values which can be used as inputs in a model. There are many posts about that at this site, see this list . Some other similar posts is Where to find a guide to encoding categorical features? , How to use more features in text based machine learning models beyond the text itself?
