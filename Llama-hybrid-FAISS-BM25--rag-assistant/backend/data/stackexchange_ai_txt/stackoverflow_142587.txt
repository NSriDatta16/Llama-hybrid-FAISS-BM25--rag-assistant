CSharpAtl is correct, use a Master-Detail control. An example of using one in a WinForm app is at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y8c0cxey.aspx . WinForm DataGrids support add, edit, and delete of both Master and Detail records. As for your question about what happens if you change a Detail record so it matches a new Master; that is not possible. By design a Detail row only contains records that match the Master, you cannot (for example) change an order to belong to a new customer because the Detail row does not contain any customer information. If you want to move a Detail row to another Master, you have to create a new Detail row for the new Master, copy the data from the old Detail row, and delete the old Detail row. If you're ambitious you could support Cut and Paste or Drag and Drop of Detail rows, but internally you have to Create/Copy/Delete.
