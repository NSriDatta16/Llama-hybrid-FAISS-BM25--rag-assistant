I include the file name, a brief description of the file's purpose, and a $Id$ tag for CVS or Subversion purposes. File creator and date of creation can be found by checking the repository, so it's not needed. File name is included because depending on what you're using to edit the file, that might not be entirely apparent when you're editing it. The description can be used to determine if a bit of code belongs in the file, or if it should be moved to another. And of course, $Id$ gives you last change time, and last editor. Embedding check-in messages is only useful when the message is useful, and only if the file is updated once and a while. Including every message will simply bloat the file to the point where there's more comments describing changes than there is actual code. Best to leave that to the repository as well; often it's only a short command line to get the file's check-in log. If you're stuck with a revision control system that can't keep history for moves and copies, in that case just reference the original file and its version number. Of course, if you're using a system that was created sometime in this century and not the last, that shouldn't be an issue.
