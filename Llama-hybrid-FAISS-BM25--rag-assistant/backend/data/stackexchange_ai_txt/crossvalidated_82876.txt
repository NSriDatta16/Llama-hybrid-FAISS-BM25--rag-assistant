Difference between pooled t-stat and normal t-stat

Suppose I have data like this - Val Bin -1 Y 5 N -2 N 4 Y so forth - where Bin is a binary value. I want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the average difference between the values that have a Y associated with them and the values that have a N associated with them. Note - I have more values associated with Y than with N(which is why I'm not clear about using a normal T-stat). I'm unclear as to whether I should use a pooled t-stat or a normal t-stat. What should I be using?
