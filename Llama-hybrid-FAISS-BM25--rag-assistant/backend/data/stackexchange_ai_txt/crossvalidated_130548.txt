You are right - Deep architectures should be able to learn those features that they 'handcrafted'. Honestly - there is way too much hype around deep learning. To an extend where people are just using them for no reason. In fact, I've seen several papers where people handcrafted features then used deep architectures. This indeed, is sort-of against the entire philosophy of deep learning. However - the deep architecture would be able to still learn abstractions between the handcrafted features. Whether this is useful or not, is up to the application at hand.
