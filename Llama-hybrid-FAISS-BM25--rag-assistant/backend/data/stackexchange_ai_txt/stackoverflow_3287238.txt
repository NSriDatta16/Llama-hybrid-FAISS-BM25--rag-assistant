You can get a list of all the tables in the database with this query: select tbl_name from sqlite_master; And then for each table returned, run this query to get column information pragma table_info(my_table); For the pragma, each row of the result set will contain: a column index, the column name, the column's type affinity, whether the column may be NULL, and the column's default value. (I'm assuming here that you know how to run SQL queries against your database in the SQLite C interface.)
