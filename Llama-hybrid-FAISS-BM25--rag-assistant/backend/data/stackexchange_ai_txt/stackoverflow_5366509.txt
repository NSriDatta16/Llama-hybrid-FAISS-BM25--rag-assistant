As for me, I will transfer touch event to another view by override following methods. – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: – touchesCancelled:withEvent: Like this way, - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // pass touch event by default implement. [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; // redirect the touch events. [anotherView touchesBegain:touches withEvent:event]; } hitTest:withEvent: is used to decide which view should response touch event on the view hierarchy tree. If the view doesn't want to response touch event, it will return nil in hitTest. As result the above touch event methods won't be called.
