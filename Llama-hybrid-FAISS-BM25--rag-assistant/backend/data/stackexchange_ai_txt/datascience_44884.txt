how to work with a large dataset in python?

for a training purposes, in order to start machine learning and data analysis with python I work on a pretty small dataset (20000 rows, 600MB) .But since couple days I decided to go further so I have download a large data set of 1Go. I wanted to do some analysis and apply machine learning on it so I tried to read the csv file with pyhton in jupiter nootebook and th file is still loading after more than 3 hours. So I will would like to know what are the best practices/process to follow when you have to work with large dataset ?
