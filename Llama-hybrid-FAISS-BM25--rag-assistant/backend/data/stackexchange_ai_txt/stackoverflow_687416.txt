You can use the HttpContext (the one exposed by the static Current property). It has an Items property which is meant to be used specifically to shuttle data between modules and handlers, as indicated by the documentation: Gets a key/value collection that can be used to organize and share data between an IHttpModule interface and an IHttpHandler interface during an HTTP request. Which can be located here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcontext.items.aspx
