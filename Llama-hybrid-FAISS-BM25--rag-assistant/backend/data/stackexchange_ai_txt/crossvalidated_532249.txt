It is somewhat of a false dichotomy that one has choose between using a time series framework OR a regression framework. The main reason for wanting to use a time-series framework would be autocorrelated errors. With this in mind, one can incorporate autocorrelated errors into regression by using Regression with ARMA errors ( The ARIMAX model muddle - Hyndman ) and in a sense get the 'best of both worlds'.
