Custom iPhone control using UIViewController subclass

I wanted a control like the UISlider, but with two thumbs instead of one so you could specify a range instead of just one value. I read up on other people looking for the same thing and suggestions about making new controls were over my head. So I decided to setup what I wanted in a nib and then created a view controller to handle its behavior. It actually works really well this way accept for 2 things. 1) To load my 'custom control' into another nib I need to do it through code like this... MaxMinSliderViewController *feeMaxMinSlider = [[MaxMinSliderViewController alloc] init]; [self.view addSubview:feeMaxMinSlider.view]; feeMaxMinSlider.view.frame = CGRectMake(20, 20, 280, 54); ...instead of dragging and dropping into other nibs like normal IB controls. Is there an easy way to be able to do this? 2) In all my reading about doing this, its seems as though I was supposed to (to do it the right way) subclass UIView instead of UIViewController. I couldn't setup the UIView correctly and get it working though. Thoughts?
