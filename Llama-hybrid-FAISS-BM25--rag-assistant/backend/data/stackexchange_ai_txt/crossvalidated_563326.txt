With only about 0.02 of the kids having > 1 measurement it is not worth the effort to model this longitudinally. But to have any confidence in the result it is important to (1) know the reasons the intervention was given more than once in a child, (2) what determined the timing of the first intervention, and (3) what is the distribution in days of the time gap between enrollment (and collection of baseline variables) and intervention. If this distribution has any width it is advisable to include days until intervention/wheezing assessment as a covariate if the intervention is more or less pre-planned and is not a time-dependent covariate itself. Were you to ever model data like these longitudinally I'd suggest a first-order Markov process using logistic regression as discussed here . There is nothing about the problem that suggests a mixed effects model with its oversimplified within-patient correlation assumption. I would remove mixed-model and lme4-nlme as tags.
