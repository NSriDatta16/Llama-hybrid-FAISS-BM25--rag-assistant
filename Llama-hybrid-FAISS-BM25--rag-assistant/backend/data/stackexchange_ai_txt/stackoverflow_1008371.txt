It is called Rest Arguments and it can be done at least in C++ and Java. Google "Rest Arguments" and you will find a lot of data on the subject with some examples like functions that will pass numbers and return an average of the numbers input, maybe the minimum or maximum of all numbers passed. As you can see, there are a lot of uses for such features, I used it in code for inputing data in MYSQL so when I want to add a row, I just add the Table name as the first string and the rest are all column names and then their data without having to sit there and manually do it over and over again. Good Luck!
