I created a new ASP.NET website in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 with .NET 3.5 as the target framework. I was able to use the value from a readonly textbox to update the value of a label. Here is the example: Designer: Code behind: public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page { protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { Textbox1.Text = "GANESH"; Label1.Text = Textbox1.Text; } } Any inputs from you will help us help you.
