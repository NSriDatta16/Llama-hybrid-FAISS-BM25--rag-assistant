Is it possible to use Transformer model for binary classification of unbalanced panel data?

So I have unbalanced panel data, i.e. multivariate time series with different lengths for each individual and a binary label at each time point. I was thinking to use some deep learning approach and NLP techniques can deal with sequences, is it possible to use Transformer model or binary classification somehow ? Did anyone try something like that before? EDIT: I am asking for transformer, bcs I need some interpretability. LSTM can not do that...
