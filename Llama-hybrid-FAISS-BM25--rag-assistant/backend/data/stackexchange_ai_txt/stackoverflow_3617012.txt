There are a few reasons why you might want to use EF with stored procedures. First, your company's DBA might require all stored proces (granted, this is a different debate but unfortunately sometimes you're not given a choice) - in this case using EF with stored procedures still allows you to use the rich mapping framework and save yourself from writing a ton of code wiring up columns to properties. Also, ORM's like EF are great at modeling your typical CRUD operations. However, you might have a very complex query where it's easier to model it with straight SQL than an EF query. In this case a sproc would be desirable as well (and still you're leveraging the EF mapping capabilities).
