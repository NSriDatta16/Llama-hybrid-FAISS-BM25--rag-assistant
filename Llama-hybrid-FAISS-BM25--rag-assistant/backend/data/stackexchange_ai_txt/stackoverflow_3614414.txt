Either way you construct it, the application will have to cope with variant types. In such a situation I recommend that you use a single representation in the DBM because the alternative is to require a multiplicity of queries. So it becomes a question of where you stick the complexity and even in a huge organization, it's really hard to generate enough events to worry about DBMS optimization. Application code is more flexible than hardwired schemata. This is a matter of preference.
