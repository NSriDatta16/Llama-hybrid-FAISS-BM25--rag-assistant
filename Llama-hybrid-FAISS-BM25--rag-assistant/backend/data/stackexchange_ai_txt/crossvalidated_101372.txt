How can I use the results of GARCH in order to improve a forecast?

I am kind of confused with what I should actually do with predicted volatility values that I obtained via a ARCH/GARCH model other than feeling happy that I know when volatility rises/falls. Is there a way that I can incorporate the predicted volatility values via a GARCH/ARCH model into a prediction model for my actual time series or is what I am saying erroneous? I use R as my primary tool.
