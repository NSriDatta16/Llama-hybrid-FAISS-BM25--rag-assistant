If you can, go with the newest stable version. There are a lot of reason to use JSF2. You can have drag&drop with ICEfaces2 too, at least in Eclipse (see the wiki ). IDE integration is available for NetBeans, the release note mentions a palette (I'm not familiar with NetBeans, but it may be what you're looking for).
