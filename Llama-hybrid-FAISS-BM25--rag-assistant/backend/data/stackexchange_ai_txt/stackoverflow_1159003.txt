There has to be something in the markup to differentiate the paragraphs from each other. One group might all be a member of a given class , or might all be descendants of an element with a particular id , or some other condition . You have to look at your markup, see if there are any rules that can describe the group of paragraphs that is different, and change the markup so such a rule can be written if there aren't. Selectutorial will help you learn about the types of rules you can use. Since you say you are importing HTML from other websites (I hope you are being careful, it sounds like you risk letting them insert harmful code into your pages), you should be able to wrap the imported code in an element (a div would probably be best) that you can give a class or an id and use a descendent selector with.
