I know...the idea is pretty bubbly. Even I had this experience (for a while :p). But Its really when you dig into it, that you realize how big a word you just said. I am in no cost gonna say that you can't make an OS. Cause I believe in keeping unachievable dreams. Cause doing this might help you learn faster. Anyways, PYTHON? na. Go for C. Read (principles) : System processes & services. Write (code) : Practice & get used to code. Use language as a tool, not a skill. Learn (from mistakes) : This is the best thing. You will have an OS if you learn frm dem. I would however suggest not to waste your 3 months, googling how to create an OS in 3 months & rather Also doing things things like which say the job you are trying is a piece of cake. eg : http://linuxologist.com/1-general/create-your-own-linux-distro/ Even that heading is misleading and discouraging. All that said. Best of Luck :)
