How much variance is explained by a given subset of variables?

I have a big dataset (e.g. number of variables), I developed a method that selects small subsets (of variables) of it. I would like to estimate how much variance of the original data a given subset can capture or "explain". Is there a way to measure that? Note: the subsets are not selected using statistical procedures like PCA etc., but rather using a heuristic methods based on the business meaning of these data.
