What is the variance of the forecast error for a horizon $\ h$?

Consider the following time series model $\ Z_t = \mu + a_t$ where $\mu$ is the level and $\ a_t$ is the random component. For this model, the level is a moving average process of order 6, $\ MA(6)$; hence the forecasting equation for$\ h$ steps ahead can be written as: $\hat{Z}_t(h) = \hat{l} $, where $\hat{l}$ is the estimator of $\mu$. I read that the variance of the forecasting equation is $\ var[\hat{Z}_t(h)] = \sigma_a^2/n^2$ where $\ n $ is the order of my $\ MA$ process. That means it doesn't matter if my forecasting horizon is 1 or a 1000, the variance will always be the same for every forecasted value. It's also clear taht the higher the value of $\ n$, the lower is the variance of forecasted value. Question: what is then the variance of the forecasting error for h steps ahead in terms of $\ n$? If the forecast error calculated at origin $\ T$ for a horizon $\ h$ is defined as: $\ e_T(h) = (Z_{T+1} - \hat{Z}_T(h)) $, the variance of the error is $\sigma_{e_T}^2 = var(Z_{T+1}) - var(\hat{Z}_T(h))) $. How do I get the equation for $\sigma_{e_T}^2 $in terms of $\ n$?
