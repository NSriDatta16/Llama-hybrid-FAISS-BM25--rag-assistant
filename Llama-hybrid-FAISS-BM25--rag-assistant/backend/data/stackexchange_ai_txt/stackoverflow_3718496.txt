Here's how I see it paying off for small apps: Your tests are a form of documentation on how your app is supposed to work. Makes life easier on you when you leave the app alone for a while or the next guy. Your tests are good coverage when you just need to make that small change that you know won't break anything. Your tests will let you know quickly. Many times in small apps the unit tests save you time in testing the UI of the app. AKA - How many times do you have to fire off the app to test that the input screen takes the correct information and spits out the correct information. This doesn't replace UI testing but it does save time in testing in general even on small apps. How often do small apps grow. In my experience often enough. If you don't start unit tests early you are more likely to not do it later and/or take more time to cover the code that wasn't originally done. Now if you could just remember how that code was supposed to work in all cases.....hmmmm... It's great practice for when you do absolutely see the value in doing it say on a larger project and hopefully be the better for it. :-) The tests are a great way of helping you see if you have a design flaw and/or a better way to code something. The tests can/are a form of design and can really help one see if somethings a little clumsy / awkward. Check out James Shore's youtube play by play of doing TDD on a very small application. Just watching him go through it and seeing and listening to him really helps show how TDD and unit testing can really be beneficial even in small apps.
