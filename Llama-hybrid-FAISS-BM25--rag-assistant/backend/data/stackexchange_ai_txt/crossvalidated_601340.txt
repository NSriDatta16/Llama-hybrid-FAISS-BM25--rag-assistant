Sum of medians or median of sums

I am estimating the total consumption of a community of species. I have a dataset of total consumption for a given species based on population density and average energetic needs. This is related to body mass. I run a mixed effect MCMC model of logConsumption ~ logBodyMass, that includes phylogeny of the species as random effect. From this I have a posterior distribution of 1000 samples of consumption per species. Which I exponentiate to get the actual values and not the logged transformed values. Therefore the 1000 estimates for each species will be a right-skewed distribution. From this dataset I want to calculate the total consumption for any given community of species. I have chosen to use the median instead of the mean since that is less affected by the skewed distributions. For any given community I get different results if I: Method 1: Estimate the median consumption per sample for the species list and then then sum them, or: Method 2: Calculate the median consumption per species first, and then take the sum of medians for the particular species community. Is method 1 wrong? Is one method better than the other? What measure is the best to show uncertainty for the community. Standard deviation is not good when I use medians I assume? Should I have used means instead? Since then the order doesn't matter? Code example below. Method 2 is always larger. # A simple simulation of 1 cell, 10 species, and 100 samples of consumption # Code in R set.seed(42) # Number of species species
