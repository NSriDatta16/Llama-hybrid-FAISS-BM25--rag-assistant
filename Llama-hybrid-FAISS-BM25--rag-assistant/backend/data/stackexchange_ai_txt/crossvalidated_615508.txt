With great respect, what you are proposing is a really awful way to model the relationship of income to life expectancy. Before you even get to the choice of models/distributions, you are missing one of the most important statistical phenomena at work in this type of problem: cumulative income is likely to be strongly positively related to total lifetime primarily because it is accumulated steadily over that lifetime --- a person who has twice as much lifetime as an adult will have roughly twice as long to earn money, so they will tend to have a higher cumulative income over their lifetime. This is likely to give a strong statistical effect which will dwarf the effect of the positive statistical relationship between income and health. If you want to model the relationship between health and income, you should be looking at various standard forms of survival models and you should be aiming to get longitudinal data on the income of people at each year (or other relevant interval) over their lifetime. You can then build a survival model where the conditional probability of survival in each interval is based on a regression of various income variables up to that point (e.g., present income, average or cumulative past income, etc.). If you can collect longitudinal data on health for the same people (or other relevant covariates) then you can also incorporate these variables into your survival regression. In order to get a feel for this field of analysis, I recommend you read some introductory material on survival analysis. I have never seen a truncated normal distribution used within this field and it has some glaring problems that would make it a poor choice for almost any purpose (e.g., imposing a hard cut-off on the maximum possible age, having a strange shape with some continuity and symmetry but then hard cut-offs, etc.). There are applications for truncated normal distributions in other fields, but this is not an area where they would be fruitful. Proper survival models deal with the death of elderly people by having hazard rates that increase rapidly in old age, making it highly unlikely (but not impossible) for an elderly person to live to a much older age. If you would like a primer on how to do survival modelling that incorporates regression effects based on longitudinal variables, you can have a look at Allison (2014) .
