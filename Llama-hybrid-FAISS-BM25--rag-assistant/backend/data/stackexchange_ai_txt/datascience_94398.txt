How can I predict the last element of the fixed length=8 sequence after I get each element?

There are fixed length lists [X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8] like this. I have many lists like them from the past. In the future, I will get new element of current list on weekly bases. one new element for each week. what machine learning model can I use to predict the last element as soon as I get new element ?
