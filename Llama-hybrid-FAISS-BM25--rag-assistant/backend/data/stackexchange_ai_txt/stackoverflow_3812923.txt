LaunchDaemon Plist not running

I have created a plist file to launch my app (10.5 & 10.6)on the login screen, die when logging in and the respawn when the Desktop is loaded. If i place my plist file within /Library/LaunchAgents it runs correctly. If i try running it from /Library/LaunchDaemons it does not run. As this is my first app for the Mac i am unsure of where i should be putting my plist file and what mistake i have made. I have set the ownership of my Plist file to root:wheel with the permissions -rw-r--r-- Am i right trying to run my app from LaunchDaemons or is it in fact ok to be run from LaunchAgents? I have attached my plist below KeepAlive Label com.kezsoft.client LimitLoadToSessionType LoginWindow Aqua OnDemand ProgramArguments /Applications/kezsoft/kezsoftClient/Client.app/Contents/MacOS/Client
