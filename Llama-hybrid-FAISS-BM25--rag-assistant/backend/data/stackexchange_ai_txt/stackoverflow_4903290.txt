multi php.ini files in my system

I have Linux Ubuntu 10.10 and when i run the below in a terminal: php -i | grep php.ini I got the loaded Configuration File => /etc/php5/cli/php.ini While if I use phpinfo() in the browser it will be: Loaded Configuration File /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini Which means that there are different ini files according to php_sapi_name!! now the question is how can i set the same php.ini for all user agents (browser, cli, etc) without copying the same file to different locations!?
