CMS framework suitable for educational website

I am building a educational site for carpentry. It will contain lost of articles and tutorials sorted in different categories. I am looking for suitable CMS and/or theme. The focus is on content and ease of organizing lots of links ion categories. So I don't care about beautiful visual design, but rather a neat way to organize a lot of information on a topic. Thank you!
