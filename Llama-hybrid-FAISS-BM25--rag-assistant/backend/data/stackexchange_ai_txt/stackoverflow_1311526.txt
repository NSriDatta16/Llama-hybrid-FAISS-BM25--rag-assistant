Two main requirements here: Client-side cookie needs to be valid for all applications Check the cookie set by CakePHP on the client side ( FireCookie is good for this). The domain part of the cookie needs to read .example.com (not www.example.com ) in order for it to apply to sub-domains. This might work in bootstrap.php : ini_set('session.cookie_domain', '.example.com'); Server-side session storage needs to be accessible by all applications In core.php for each application, set a common session storage. Options are: php : This will use the PHP defined session storage directory, which should be the same for all applications. database : If all applications use the same database, this could be an option. cake : For this to work, you would need to define a common /tmp directory for each application.
