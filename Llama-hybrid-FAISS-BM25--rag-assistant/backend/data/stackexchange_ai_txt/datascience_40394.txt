Linear Regression in python with multiple outputs

I have a time series dataset which represented as following: x=[ [12.19047619, 18.28571429, 6.0952381 ] , [ 80.98765432, 14.17283951, 11.13580247 ] , [ 50.82644628, 16.26446281, 9.14876033 ] , .... ] and to predicted --> Y = [13.9, 18, 14.987] How I can use LASSO and SVR linear regression models in python to predict Y (which represented as a vector as shown in the above example)
