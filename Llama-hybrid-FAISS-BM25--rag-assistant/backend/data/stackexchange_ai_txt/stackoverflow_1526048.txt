If you create your mapping correctly, that should not pose a problem. There are 3 different ways of mapping a class-hierarchy to the DB using NHibernate. Check out this and this article. You can map both Dragon and FierceDragon to the same table, but, in that case, your table should have some nullable columns to be able to store the additional properties of FierceDragon. Since you're talking about one table, I suppose you want to use the 'Table per class hierarchy' mapping strategy ?
