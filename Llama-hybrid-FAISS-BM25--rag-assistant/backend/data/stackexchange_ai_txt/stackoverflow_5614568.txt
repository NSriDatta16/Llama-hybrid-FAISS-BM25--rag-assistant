LISP - Breadth First Search

I have an implementation of BFS I got elsewhere and modified slightly, but I am having problems with its input. It takes a graph, and will take it as '((a b c) (b c) (c d)) But my input I am giving it is a weighted graph... I know it's not useful for the BFS, but I use the weights farther down the line later. This input looks like '( (a (b 3) (c 1)) (b (a 3) (d 1)) (c (a 1) (d2) (e 2)) ) And so on. My code: (defun shortest-path (start end net) (BFS end (list (list start)) net)) (defun BFS (end queue net) (if (null queue) nil (expand-queue end (car queue) (cdr queue) net))) (defun expand-queue (end path queue net) (let ((node (car path))) (if (eql node end) (reverse path) (BFS end (append queue (new-paths path node net)) net)))) (defun new-paths (path node net) (mapcar #'(lambda (n) (cons n path)) (cdr (assoc node net)))) I'm just not sure where I need to most likely modify it to accept the new style list, or make a help function to format it correctly?
