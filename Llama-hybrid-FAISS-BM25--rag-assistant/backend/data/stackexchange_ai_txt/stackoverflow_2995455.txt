a basic issue in implementing validations through properties ? Please guide me

thanks for your attention and time. I want to implement validations in settter of properties. Here is an issue where your expert help is required please. I have idea of how I will do validations before setting value. but not getting what to do if passed value is not correct. Just not setting is not a acceptable solution as I want to return an appropriate message to user (in a label in web form). My example code is: private int id; public int Id { get { return id; } set { bool result = IsNumber(value); if (result==false) { // What to do if passed data is not valid ? how to give a appropriate message to user that what is wrong ? } id = value; } } A thought was to use return but it is not allowed. Throwing error looks not good as generally we avoid thorwing custom errors. Please guide and help me. thanks in anticipation haansi
