The Memory Management Programming Guide defines a set of naming conventions that determines whether a method should return an "owned" object or an autoreleased one. According to these conventions, a method named -somethingAnimation should definitely return an autoreleased object. So in your case, you should be returning [something autorelease] instead, and then not releasing it later.
