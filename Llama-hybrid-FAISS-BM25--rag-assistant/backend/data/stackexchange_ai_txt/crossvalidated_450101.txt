The point of using a surrogate model is that it lets you make an educated guess about what point to evaluate. Imagine that you are optimizing hyperparameters of a model that takes 24h to train, in such case, with large grid of hyperparameters, it could take years to train and evaluate the model for all the combinations of hyperparameters. So looking at the "actual scores" wouldn't really work in here. In Bayesian optimization, we are using the surrogate model to make guesstimate on what could be the score for a combination of parameters, and then we are verifying those guesses on the most interesting candidates, instead all of the possible candidates.
