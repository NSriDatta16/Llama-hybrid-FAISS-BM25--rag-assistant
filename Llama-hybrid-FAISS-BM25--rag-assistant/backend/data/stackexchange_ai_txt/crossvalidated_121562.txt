Yes, this is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, so it works and can be called a MCMC algorithm. Nothing forbids setting the proposal distribution $Q(x_{\mathrm{new}} \mid x_{\mathrm{old}})$ to be independent of $x_{\mathrm{old}}$ so the proof for detailed balance condition in Metropolis-Hastings directly holds for this proposal distribution. Note that to guarantee convergence to the correct stationary distribution, we must further assume that the proposal $Q$ has positive probability for all regions where $P$ has positive probability. Edit: as Tom Minka pointed out, this is known as independence chain or independence sampler and is discussed in this answer and this webpage .
