Does the above mean that in spite of setting up the CHECK constraints and the RULEs, I also have to create TRIGGERs on the master table so that the INSERTs go to the correct tables? Yes. Read point 5 (section 5.9.2) If that were the case, what would be the point of the db supporting partitioning? I could just set up the separate tables myself? Basically: the INSERTS in the child tables must be done explicitly (either creating TRIGGERS, or by specifying the correct child table in the query). But the partitioning is transparent for SELECTS, and (given the storage and indexing advantages of this schema) that's the point. (Besides, because the partitioned tables are inherited, the schema is inherited from the parent, hence consistency is enforced).
