Be careful when using union to actually get the columns you want for each unioned query. And this case, a subquery seems to make more sense: SELECT name, synonym, description FROM files_list WHERE name LIKE '%dragon%' OR synonym LIKE '%dragon%' OR description LIKE '%dragon%' OR name LIKE '%ball%' OR synonym LIKE '%ball%' OR description LIKE '%ball%' OR listid IN (SELECT listid FROM files_tags WHERE tag_name='dragon' OR tag_name='ball'); Some additional questions: When you say you want show the user "all tags", do you mean all tags that exist for a given listid? Or just those that matched? And if description like "%dragon%", is dragon one of the tags you want returned even if it isn't in file_tags?
