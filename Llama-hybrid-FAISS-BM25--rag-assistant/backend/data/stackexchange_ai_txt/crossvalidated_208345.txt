How to find the correct picture for this SVM classifier?

There are different SVMs with different shapes/patterns of decision boundaries. The training data is labeled as yi ∈ {−1, 1}, represented as the shape of circles and squares respectively. Support vectors are drawn in solid circles. Here is my question, how to find a hard-margin kernel SVM with $$k(u, v) = u · v + (u · v)^2 $$ I am thinking of 1 and 6, but interestingly, I can't see their difference except for the shape of the edge. They do have different support vector distributions, but does it really matter? Does any one have any idea on this?
