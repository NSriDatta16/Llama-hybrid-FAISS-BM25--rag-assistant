How can I leverage machine learning for log analysis?

I am new to data science and trying to find possibilities of using datascience in tasks. I have a set of logs which I want to convert to json. The logs are more or less of same format and I can write a script which parse them or aggregate them but instead of doing it manually I want to use help of machine learning. This thought is also inspired by the fact that at sometime some new log line may come. I guess pre-trained LLM models can identify the context and information from logs. But I am not sure how exactly can ML be used for for this purpose? The question may sound stupid but please pardon.
