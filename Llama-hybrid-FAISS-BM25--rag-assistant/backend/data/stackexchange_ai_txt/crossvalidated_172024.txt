Transformation of box constraints after PCA

I have a $n\times m$ data matrix where $n$ is the number of records and $m$ number of dimensions. Running principal component analysis (PCA) and selecting first $k Consider I had a box constraints on the original data, say $x_{\min},x_{\max}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$. How to construct new constraints for the first $k$ components? The motivation is the following: I want to optimize an unknown function $f:X\to\mathbb R$ where $X$ is the hyperbox given by $x_{\min},x_{\max}$. I need to construct the function $\hat f$ from data. For practical reasons, I need PCA on the data. How to transform the set $X$?
