In the current form definitions[i].label and definitions[i].def are what you're looking for. You can also try to play with the representation if you want to access definitions by their labels instead of a numerical index, what you're looking for is more like a hash than an array. In this case you may reorganize your array into an object, and the keys will be the labels. var definitions = { // objects are hashes abdomen: "stomach, stomach area, belly, tummy", ability: "skill", abolish: "end, do away with, get rid of", // key: value, // ... }; This of course changes the way you go through the items, which now becomes an enumeration . for (var label in definitions) { if (definitions.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // label is label // definition is definitions[label] alert(label + " => " + definitions[label]); } }
