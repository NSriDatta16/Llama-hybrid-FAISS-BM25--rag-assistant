Deep Learning Framework that is *not* translation invariant

CNN (convolutional neural networks) are well-known to have the nice property of "translation invariance". Is there any other type of neural network that does not have such a property? Or can we remove certain "layers" in CNN (such as max pooling, dropout, etc.) to "disable" translation invariance? Possible scenarios is to: classify by position (e.g. cat in the top left vs cat in the bottom right of image) classified by "skewness" of object (e.g. classify squares vs rectangles). Thanks a lot for any help.
