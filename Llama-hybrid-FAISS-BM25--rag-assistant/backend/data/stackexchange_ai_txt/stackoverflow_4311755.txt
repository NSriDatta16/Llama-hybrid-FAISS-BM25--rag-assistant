Some .obj files doesn't have normals at all. You should at first compute per-face normals: Given a face composed of 3 vertices v1, v2, v3 you can compute the normal : The normal is the normalized cross product between v1 - v2 and v1 - v3 N = Normalize( (v1 - v2) x (v1 - v3) ) Normalize(V) = V / length(V) length(V) = SQRT (V.x * V.x + V.y * V.y + V.z * V.z) The cross product : v × u = (v.y * u.z − v.z * u.y, v.z * u.x − v.x * u.z, v.x * u.y − v.y * u.x). After that you can compute the "smooth" normals by averaging all the normals of adjacent faces.
