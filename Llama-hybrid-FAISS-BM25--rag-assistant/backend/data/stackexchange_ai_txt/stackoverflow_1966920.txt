more info on Memory layout of an executable program (process)

I attended interview for samsung. They asked lot of questions on memory layout of the program. I barely know anything about this. I googled it "Memory layout of an executable program". "Memory layout of process". I'm surprised to see that there isn't much info on these topics. Most of the results are forum queries. I just wonder why? These are the few links I found: Run-Time Storage Organization Run-Time Memory Organization Memory layout of C process ^pdf^ I want to learn this from a proper book instead of some web links.(Randy Hyde's is also a book but some other book). In which book can I find clear & more information on this subject? I also wonder, why didn't the operating systems book cover this in their books? I read stallings 6th edition. It just discusses the Process Control Block. This entire creation of layout is task of linker right? Where can I read more about this process. I want COMPLETE info from a program on the disk to its execution on the processor. EDIT: Initially, I was not clear even after reading the answers given below. Recently, I came across these articles after reading them, I understood things clearly. Resources that helped me in understanding: www.tenouk.com/Bufferoverflowc/Bufferoverflow1b.html 5 part PE file format tutorial: http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html Excellent article : http://www.linuxforums.org/articles/understanding-elf-using-readelf-and-objdump_125.html PE Explorer: http://www.heaventools.com/ Yes, "layout of an executable program(PE/ELF)" != "Memory layout of process"). Findout for yourself in the 3rd link. :) After clearing my concepts, my questions are making me look so stupid. :)
