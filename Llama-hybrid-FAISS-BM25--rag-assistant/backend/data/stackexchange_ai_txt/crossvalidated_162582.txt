Can we settle this STD vs SEM debate once and for all?

OK, I AM getting tired of seeing the SEM used simply as a means of reducing the size of error bars. If the SEM is a measure of the precision of a mean from a sample, then in my mind one cannot generate an SEM from one mean. One needs many means to estimate the precision of the "population mean" SO, the only time I ever used the SEM was when I calculated many sample means (each with replicates of course to generate a mean) and then calculated the STD of the average of those means to use in the equation SEM = STD/sqrt of n which in my case was the number of individual sample means. To me one should show the STD of a representative experiment (itself a somewhat ambiguous and often inaccurate phrase) and dispense with the SEM. I just see zero utility in its use from a SINGLE sample mean.
