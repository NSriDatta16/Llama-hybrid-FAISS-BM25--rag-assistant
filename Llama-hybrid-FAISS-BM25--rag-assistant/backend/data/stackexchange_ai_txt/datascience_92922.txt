You can use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) that is a technique of dimensionality reduction. Basically you will change the basis of the data, you will not drop any columns, minimizing information loss. So, for sure you will lose some information, but it's up to you decide how much information lose, depending on the number of principal components you will compute.
