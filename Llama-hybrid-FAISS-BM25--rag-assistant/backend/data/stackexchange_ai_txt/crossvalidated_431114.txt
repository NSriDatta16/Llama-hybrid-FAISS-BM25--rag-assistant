Kmeans cannot use a distance matrix. In order to compte means, it needs to have vector data. If you pass a distance matrix, it will treat the rows as vectors and compute averages of these distances, and squared errors there. This adds hard to understand bias. The method is just very designed to squared Euclidean. If you want to use a distance matrix, use PAM (k-medoids) instead. If you want to minimize Euclidean distances, PAM can find better solutions than k-means (but does not necessarily so, because it is constrained to use data points as centers).
