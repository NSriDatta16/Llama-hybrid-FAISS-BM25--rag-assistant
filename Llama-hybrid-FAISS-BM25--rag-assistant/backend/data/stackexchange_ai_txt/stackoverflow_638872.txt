I've never implemented a system like you describe in a "real world" context, but I have played with them a considerable amount as hobby projects. My preferred approach is to use some kind of logic language like Prolog to make assertions and check them. You'd have assertions for where the park is, what it means to have something, what a dog is, and then you'd make a rule pretty much exactly like your example in parentheses at the bottom of your post. I'm sorry my Prolog is too rusty to give you a useful example... I've been playing with home-grown inference languages too long. There are Prolog interpreters available for embedding in most languages, though I'm not sure about PHP5. You could throw together something simple that does forward-chaining inference on rule data structures of your own creation in fairly short order, if you can't find a Prolog interpreter. You may be interested in these notes on automated inference.
