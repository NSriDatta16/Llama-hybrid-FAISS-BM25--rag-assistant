No. As Bjarne Stroustrup says in TC++PL, a reference can be thought of as just another name for an existing entity (object or function). While this is not always the most precise description of the underlying low-level mechanism that implements references, it is a very good description of the concept the references are intended to implement at the language level. Not surprisingly, the language provides no means to obtain the address of reference itself. At language level reference is not guaranteed to occupy a place in storage, and therefore in general case it has no address.
