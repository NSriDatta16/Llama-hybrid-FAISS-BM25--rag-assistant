Java - problems iterating through an ArrayList

Ok, so I have an ArrayList (arrBok) , which is full of book objects (the code is in Norwegian, so pay no attention to that please). I want to make a public method which iterates through all the objects in the `ArrayList'. When I execute the code, it just seems to run in an infinite loop, not producing any return values. Here is the relevant (I hope, because there are a couple of other classes involved) part of the code; public String listAll() { itr = arrBok.iterator(); while (itr.hasNext()) { i++; } return "lol"; } This code does nothing useful, but I just want to see if it can iterate through it successfully. What I have tried so far; Tested if the bokArr (ArrayList) is empty, which it's not. It has 4 objects inside of it. Return the toString() method of the itr , with the following result; java.util.AbstractList$Itr@173a10f // return itr.next().toString();
