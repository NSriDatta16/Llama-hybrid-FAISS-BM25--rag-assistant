Functions are ' first class citizens ' in javascript, meaning they are variables (or better still: objects, like everything in javascript is an object). So your constructor function could also be written as var server = function() { //[...] } Now, if you declare a new variable called server , this overwrites the constructor function, being a variable too. It's common practice to upcase the name of constructor functions. If you use function Server() { ... } , var server = new Server (no need for parenthesis by the way) you're fine.
