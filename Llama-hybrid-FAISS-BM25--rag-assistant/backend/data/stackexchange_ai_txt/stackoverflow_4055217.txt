Azure PHP web role, F# worker role: developing on different machines

A friend and I would like to create a website to manipulate Facebook data. The structure is: a PHP web role (contains the web page, user OAuth login, interacts with queues, and interacts with SQL Azure database) an F# worker role (does statistics and quite heavy data extractions) The process is (assuming a new user): user arrives on the web page and logs onto Facebook via OAuth, the PHP web role then posts a message in a worktodo queue with the login info and token. F# worker role reads the message off the worktodo queue and starts doing data crunching (using the Facebook API) and stats, then it writes the results to a SQL Azure database. Finally it posts a message to the workdone queue stating it has succeeded in doing the data processing for the user. Finally the PHP web role reads the workdone queue and notices the work is done, and displays the algorithm results. I have two questions: Is there a big flaw in this design? What is the best way to collaborate: one person will write the PHP and another the F#, is there a way to use development storage from two different machines? Thanks a lot! (Apologies if some find this stuff too basic, I am very much a beginner in all these matters).
