In general, the stratified model requires more power to estimate, is more flexible and general, but harder to draw inference from. You cannot directly calculate a $p$-value. You must either use a path-model, bootstrap or permutation test, or the $\delta$-method to obtain standard errors for the difference in regression parameters between two stratified models. A test which is inefficient but often performed is inspecting the coverage of 95% CIs. If either CI overlaps the point estimate of the other stratum coefficient, do not reject the null. This does not provide a powerful test. Inspecting the narrower CI only makes an anticonservative test. The interaction model by contrast is more efficient, requires homoscedasticity between the two strata, and the inference is just based on the product-term coefficient. The interaction model has the additional advantage that it can assess interaction between two continuous covariates. You couldn't, for instance, fit a stratified model for a continuous covariate without splitting one of the covariates into an arbitrary number of strata; this likely spends too much power. The homoscedasticity assumption (both between strata and overall) can be relaxed by using robust sandwich variance estimation. These models will consistently estimate the same thing only when the mean model is true . If, in fact, the mean model is not true, it is possible that, as the sample size grows to infinity, one model definitively says there's no interaction and the other says there is interaction. For that reason, with either model, you should perform some diagnostic comparisons to ensure there aren't egregious departures from the modeled mean. If there are further adjustment variables: the need for correct model specification in the interaction model and power drop in the stratified models is exacerbated. In a simple $X,W,Y$ analysis, the stratified models in total have 4 parameters and the interaction model has 4 parameters (intercept, X coefficient, W coefficient, and product-term: you must always adjust for the main effects). However, introduce adjustment variables $Z_1, \ldots, Z_p$, and the interaction model has 4+p parameters and the stratified model has 2+2*p parameters.
