"Beveled" Shapes with cocos2d

I would like to draw 2d shapes like this in an iPhone app: alt text http://www.shaggyfrog.com/junk/beveled-circle.jpg I asked a similar question here to see if I could do it easily with Quartz, but didn't get a solution. So I got to thinking that I might be able to leverage an exsiting 2d library out there, and then I thought of cocos2d. The goal is to draw these kinds of beveled shapes dynamically, i.e., using arbitrary colours, and possibly with the highlight/bevel drawn at an arbitrary position. Is this possible with cocos2d?
