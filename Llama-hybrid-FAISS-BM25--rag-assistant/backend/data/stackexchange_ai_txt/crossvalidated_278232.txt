How can I refute a monotonic correlation

I have a binary target T and a continuous variable I expect to correlate with it. I expect some monotonic correlation, as the explaining variable increases I expect P(T) to increase. I collect some (independent) samples and I see in some binning what appears like a dip in the measured P(T), how can I test if this is a sampling fluke or if my monotonic assumption is likely false. I'm considering using isotonic regression to convert my explaining variable to a probability estimate, but I'm wondering when I should not do this, maybe pre-select bins and average in them and not assume montonicity. Essentially I would like to assume monotonicity unless the data tells me this very unlikely.
