It should be OK to include a score from an external source as a predictor. This could be useful especially if the people making the external score has access to information not available to you. Remember that the linear predictor in logistic regression is on the scale of log odds, so if the external score is meant to be interpreted as a probability, like a default probability, you could consider first transforming it to log odds via $\log \left( \text{score}/(1-\text{score}) \right) $. Alternative, if the score varies over a large range, you could model it vith a spline term.
