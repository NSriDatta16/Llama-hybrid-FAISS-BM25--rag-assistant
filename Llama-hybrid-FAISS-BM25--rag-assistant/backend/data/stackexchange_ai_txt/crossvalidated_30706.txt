What are the assumptions of ordinal mixed effects logistic regression?

Specifically, what are the assumptions of ordinal mixed effect logistic regression performed with the "ordinal" package in R? I just got knobbled by a reviewer because these weren't clearly stated in a paper. The same reviewer asked me how I could "account for repeated measures". How would you explain the ordinal(ity) assumptions and the ME/ hierarchical model in a relatively parsimonious way?
