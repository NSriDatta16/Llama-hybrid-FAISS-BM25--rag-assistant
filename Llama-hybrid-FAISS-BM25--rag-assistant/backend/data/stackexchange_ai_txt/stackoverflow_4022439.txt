I'm not an expert on Threads with Python but quickly reading the docs leads to a few conclusions. 1) Calling os.system() spawns a new subshell and is not encouraged. Instead the subprocess module should be used. http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.6/library/os.html?highlight=os.system#os.system 2) The threading module doesn't seem to give a whole lot of control to the threads, maybe try using the thread module, at least there is a thread.exit() function. Also from the threading docs here it says that dummy threads may be created, which are always alive and daemonic, furthermore "â€¦ the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left." So, I would imagine that the least you need to do is signal the currently running threads that they need to exit, before exiting the main thread, or joining them on ctrl-c to allow them to finish (although this would obviously be contradictory to ctrl-c), or perhaps just using the subprocess module to spawn the svn up would do the trick.
