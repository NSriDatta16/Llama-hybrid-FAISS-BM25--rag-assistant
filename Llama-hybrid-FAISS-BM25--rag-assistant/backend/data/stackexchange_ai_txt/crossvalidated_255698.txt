This is more directly and more accurately handled through the use of a binary logistic regression model with an interaction term. The usually-best test is the likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ test from such a model. The regression context also allows one to test continuous variables, adjust for other variables, and a host of other extensions. General comment: I think we spend too much time teaching special cases and would do well to use general tools so that we have more time to deal with complications such as missing data, high dimensionality, etc.
