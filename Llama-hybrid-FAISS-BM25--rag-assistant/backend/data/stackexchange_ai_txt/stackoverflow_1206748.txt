An Ajax call performs a HTTP request, so no, it isn't "different" from a HTTP request, though the Ajax HTTP request is used differently from a page retrieval for rendering. If a page is populated via Ajax, yes, it will be much slower than a page that's pre-populated on the server side, because the Ajax-populated page runs a separate HTTP request for each populated element, and moreover those generally cannot all run at once. The start-to-end is, at some high level of abstraction: Set up an Ajax object Initiate the Ajax HTTP request Wait for the Ajax HTTP request to complete Unpack and use the results of the Ajax HTTP request
