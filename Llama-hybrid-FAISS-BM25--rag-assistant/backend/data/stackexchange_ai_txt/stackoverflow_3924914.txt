.NET uses a string intern pool to store string. The common language runtime conserves string storage by maintaining a table, called the intern pool, that contains a single reference to each unique literal string declared or created programmatically in your program. Consequently, an instance of a literal string with a particular value only exists once in the system. Example below shows that the intern pool is used for literal string only. ( s2 doesn't reference the same string as s1 even if the content is the same) string s1 = "MyTest"; string s2 = new StringBuilder().Append("My").Append("Test").ToString(); string s3 = String.Intern(s2); Console.WriteLine((Object)s2==(Object)s1); // Different references. Console.WriteLine((Object)s3==(Object)s1); // The same reference. Java does the same thing : All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are interned.
