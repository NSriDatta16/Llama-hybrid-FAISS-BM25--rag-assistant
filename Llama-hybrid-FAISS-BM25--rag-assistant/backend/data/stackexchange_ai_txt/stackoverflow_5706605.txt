Solr/Lucene highlighted keywords - paddings

I would like a specific padding (EG '...') --> only on start/end of fragments that are truncated , I would also like to concatenate 2 fragments, even if they are not close, like: ... fragment1 ... fragment2 ... Are there any fragmenters / highlight settings that can be used?
