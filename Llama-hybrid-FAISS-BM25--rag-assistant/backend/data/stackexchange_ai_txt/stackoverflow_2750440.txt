I think you'll need to subclass NSSliderCell and override startTrackingAt:inView: , continueTracking:at:inView: and stopTracking:at:inView:mouseIsUp: . The documentation of continueTracking:at:inView: says: This method is invoked in trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp:. The default implementation returns YES if the cell is set to continuously send action messages to its target when the mouse button is down or the mouse is being dragged. Subclasses can override this method to provide more sophisticated tracking behavior.
