Because a NN doesn't see a box. The only job it does is to minimize the loss using Feedforward and Backpropagation. Let's say the image has 1 object - => 4 o/p values => 4 o/p neurons => 4 y_train values => 4 losses into the NN =>To have the loss minimum it will adjust itself to have all the 4 o/p neurons as close to the truth as posible. Let's say the image has 2 object - => 8 o/p values => 8 o/p neurons => 8 y_train values => 8 losses into the NN =>To have the loss minimum it will adjust itself to have all the 8 o/p neurons as close to the truth as posible. The difference - Obviously, later will be a bigger network and need more epochs to get the golden values of weights If you have just started Deep Learning - Michael Nielsen
