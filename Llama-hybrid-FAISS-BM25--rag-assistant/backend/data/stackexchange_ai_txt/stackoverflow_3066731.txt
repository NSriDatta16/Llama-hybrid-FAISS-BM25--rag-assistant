What is the best way to organize object oriented code?

I haven't coded in java for a long time, and after coding in C, I'm having issued organizing my code for OOP. More specifically I'm not sure when to create a new method, and when to create a new class, and when to just lump everything together. Are there some general rules or guidelines on how it should be done?
