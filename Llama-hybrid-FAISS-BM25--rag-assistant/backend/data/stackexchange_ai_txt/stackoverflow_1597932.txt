Forcing lightbox/dhtml over flash

I have read a lot of posts about how you can force lightbox (or other dhtml things) above flash by modifying the embed-tag with wmode="opaque". Just modifying the z-index of lightbox (or whatever else you want above the flash) simply is not enough. But what if you cannot control the embed-tag? I am working with a client that has a banner-system, where I do not have control of the embed tag... Is there really nothing I can do to force the html over the flash-item, that does not require manipulating the embedding of the flash?
