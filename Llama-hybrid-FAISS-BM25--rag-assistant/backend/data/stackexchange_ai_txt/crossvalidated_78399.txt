The concept is the same in the sense that you need a loss function that is minimized. Yes, MSE reacts to outliers. But you can use any other loss function that suits your needs better: e.g. mean average error puts less weight on grossly wrong predictions. But there are many other possibilities, see e.g. The Elements of Statistical Learning. As a side note: neither is classifier optimization as straightforward as you state: average prediction error is not a /proper scoring rule/, so minimizing it doesn't guarantee you that you end up with the optimal model.
