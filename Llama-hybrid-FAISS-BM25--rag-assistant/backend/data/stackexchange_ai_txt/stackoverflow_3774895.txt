It doesn't help solve your problem, but I feel compelled to point out that the PHP is a XSS attack waiting to happen: $id = $_GET['block']; echo " The player will show in this paragraph "; Try using htmlspecialchars with ENT_QUOTES on the $id before echoing it straight out into the HTML. Even if this isn't production code, I don't like leaving such things posted on the interwebs for others to copy & paste ;) PS: Would have commented on your question instead of providing an "answer" but I don't have enough rep yet.
