As stated already, the issue occurs because both frameworks define the same function ( __() ). In order to solve these problems, you need to remove one of the declarations (or make it conditional as listed). IF they happen to be identical functions in both frameworks this is fine, but if either one of them implements the function differently you will need to move one of the declarations to another function (i.e. __2() ) and refactor the existing code to point to it. This is a bad idea. This is actually a good example of why Wordpress and Magento are not easily closely tied together. My first suggestion for getting around this would be to keep the two codebases at arm's length and use mod-rewrite to take care of integrating them if at all possible. Failing that, and depending on requirements, use Wordpress installed elsewhere to manage posts and grab the database information with a wrapper. When the codebases change (e.g. you upgrade), having integrated the two codebases will likely cause you much existential angst. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
