First, you could skip the whole cross-tabulating business and just fit a logistic regression of C on F1 to Fn where C is TRUE or 1 when it's present and FALSE or 0 when it's not. Now, I don't really understand what your data look like from the description, but assuming you have a data frame dat with columns named C, F1, F2 and F3 representing your subjects (or whatever), a reasonable starting model might be mod A full set of interactions would be fitted if you replaced each + with a * . That's not clearly a good idea (how to interpret it?) Also, it won't work if some combinations of values of F1, F2 and F3 contain no subjects. When that happens, you'll get an NA estimate, as you do. This is actually the right answer because glm uses ML to estimate the model and there is simply no information about the relationship between C and subjects with some particular combination of Fs. This applies also to any regression you might run too fitted this way. If you want to shrink the values of F together then you'll need to apply some random effects assumptions. For that, lme4 is probably your package.
