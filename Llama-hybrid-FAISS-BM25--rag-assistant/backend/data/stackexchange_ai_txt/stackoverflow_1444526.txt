According to the Jquery documentation on Selectors . All draggables that match the selector will be accepted. If a function is specified, the function will be called for each draggable on the page (passed as the first argument to the function), to provide a custom filter. The function should return true if the draggable should be accepted. Thus, $('.selector').droppable({ accept: '.special' }); in their example will only act as if something has been dropped on it if it has the class 'special'. It looks like it can accept any Jquery selector .
