How to make an argument for why system build tools shouldn't automatically do SVN checkin

I'm trying to make a case against automated checkins to version control. My group at work has written some system build tools around CFEngine, and now they think these tools should automatically do checkins of things like SSH host keys. Now , as a programmer, my initial gut reaction is that nothing should be calling "svn up" and "svn ci" aside from a human. In a recent case, the .rNNNN merged versions of a bunch of files broke the tools, which is what started this discussion. Now , the guy designing the tools has basically admitted he's using SVN in order to sync files around, and that he could basically replace all this with an NFS mount. He even said he would wrap "svn diff" into "make diff" because it seemed better than all of us knowing how SVN works. So... I'm asking how I can make a good argument for NOT having Makefiles, shell scripts, etc, wrap Subversion commands, when Subversion is basically being used to synchronize files on different machines. Here's my list, so far: We aren't really versioning this data, so it shouldn't go in svn. We've said it could be replaced by an NFS mount, so why don't we do that. Homegrown tools are now wrapping SVN, and software is always going to have bugs, therefore our SVN revisions are now going to have messes made of a revision when we encounter bugs. How can I make this case?
