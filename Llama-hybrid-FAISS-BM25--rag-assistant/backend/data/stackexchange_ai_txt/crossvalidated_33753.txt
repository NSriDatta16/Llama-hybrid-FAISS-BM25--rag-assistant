Limits of correction for over dispersion with Poisson / binomial data

Reading many help pages, I see that a common way to correct for overdispersion is to fit models using quasibinomial or betabinomial distributions. However, I can't find help concerning how far correction is achieved nor how to be confident that a reliable model has been fitted. I am interested in mutation data from many genes that fall into 10 ordered classes. Each observation comprises a number of bases surveyed ( N ) and the number of substitutions observed ( S ). Overdispersion is great (~22!) because the genes vary considerably in how fast they are evolving. There is also the issue that N also varies a lot from 30,000. I want to test the hypothesis that average substitution rate ( S/N ) increases with class number. I have tried the following options: (awful!) Ignore the fact the data are binomial, set a minimum N>=1000, and fit a Gaussian model with S/N as the response. Fit is poor, though arguably not dreadful. Use cbind(S, N-S) and fit a model with a quasibinomial error structure. Seems to give a similar answer that avoids the crazily low P-values I get when using family=binomial, but how do I know if the degree of correction is valid? This seems a relatively simple problem, but I want to make sure the model is fitted properly and is, if anything, conservative.
