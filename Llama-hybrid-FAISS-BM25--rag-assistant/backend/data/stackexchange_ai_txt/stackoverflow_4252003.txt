Database schema for interlinked texts

I have the task of designing a bible database, non-affiliated to any group ;) The problem is like this I have 1 bible verse, 18 different commentaries on the bible verse, 5 commentaries on the commentary. The plan is to make a WPF application that will be available so that users will have the text marked with the different commentator’s comments on the side of the screen. What I would like done is the following, When a person looks at the verse, the commentary will be highlighted on a button on the side of the screen , when he looks at the commentary the verse will be highlighted, also I would like to make other verse quotes highlighted and searchable. I will need to precompile everything into sql and then export it into SQLite. I have broken the data into the following form. BOOK CHAPTER PARAGRAPH VERSE CommentatorName CommentatorComment VerseINComment location So I have the following problems 1: Data is entered in a stagnated form (A verse will be entered multiple times, but only have one comment from the same author) We will have a block of data in the database. I will need to process the data looking in the comments for Verse quotes. How should this be done? Should all the DATA be entered into the database then a program run to search the database, or can I somehow use tsql to search the commentators comments for verses and then mark them? 2: What is the best way to store the location of VerseINComment location? Meaning I was thinking some form of mapping, like they use in real maps , 1,1,1,1 would indicate GENISIS,CHAPTER 1 Paragraph 1 VERSE 1 (ACTUAL = In the beginning the ……). Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. ETT (ehost Think Tank)
