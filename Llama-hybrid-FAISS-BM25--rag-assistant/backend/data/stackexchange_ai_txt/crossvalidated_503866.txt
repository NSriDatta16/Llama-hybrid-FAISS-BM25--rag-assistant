Dimensionality Reduction

I have a very basic doubt, are the number of rows/ observations in the data reduced during feature selection techniques like filter/ wrapper methods or during dimensionality reduction using PCA/ LDA/ SVD. Or is it just reduction in number of columns/ variables? Please explain in detail. Thank you.
