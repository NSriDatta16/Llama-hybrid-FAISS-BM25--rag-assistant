Is there a class / method to handle dragging views?

I found a useful tutorial to get started in understanding how to Cocoa handles touch events. I've used this as a base to create a custom script, I'm trying to make a UIView draggable, very similar to the native Maps application. I've written a custom script, using the touchesBegan method it will capture where the input began and compare it to the centre point of the UIView using some conditional statements. The touchesMoved method will do some further conditional statements to determine whether the touch start point and the center of the view will move positively or negative. I've also captured the views boundaries so it doesn't go too far out. it's lacking the polished finished found in other applications such as Maps, or scrolling a UITable, such as the ease effect after the user has released their fingers, and the snapping effect when it reaches the boundaries is horrible. Is there a method that takes a view and makes it draggable like this? If not I'll continue to refine my script. Many thanks!
