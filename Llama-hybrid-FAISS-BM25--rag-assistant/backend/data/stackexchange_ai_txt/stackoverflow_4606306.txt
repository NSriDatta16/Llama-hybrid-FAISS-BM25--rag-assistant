Performance testing utilities for C++

I was curious whether anyone has any suggestions for performance testing libraries and frontends that will produce nice graphical charts for C++ (like how gcov produces coverage data and there are frontends out there for viewing the code coverage data). Being able to produce charts like: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.7M4-201012081300/performance/performance.php?fp_type=0 would be pretty slick. We use cppunit right now for unit testing, so maybe there is something that integrates with that. Some more info: We're compiling on Linux (we use Ubuntu Lucid/Maverick) on Intel x86-64 machines.
