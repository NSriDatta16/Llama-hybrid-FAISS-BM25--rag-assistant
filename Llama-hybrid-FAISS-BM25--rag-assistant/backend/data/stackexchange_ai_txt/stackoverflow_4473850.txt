Add some logging code to the base template block #File: app/code/core/Mage/Core/Block/Template.php public function fetchView($fileName) { ... Mage::Log($this->_viewDir.DS.$fileName); var_dump($this->_viewDir.DS.$fileName); include $this->_viewDir.DS.$fileName; ... } Ultimately, rendering a template block is a call to include with a system path. Once you get the path Magento is constructing to your template, create a one line PHP file And attempt to load the template. This should allow you to isolate the reason any particular call to include is failing. My immediate guess is a PHP safe mode setting, but it's been a long time since I had to fight shared hosting restrictions. Good luck!
