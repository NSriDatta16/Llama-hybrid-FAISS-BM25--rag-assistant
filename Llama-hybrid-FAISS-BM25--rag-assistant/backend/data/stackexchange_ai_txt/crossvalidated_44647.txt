Which Dickey-Fuller test for a time series modelled with an intercept/drift and a linear trend?

Short version: I have a time series of climate data that I'm testing for stationarity. Based on previous research, I expect the model underlying (or "generating", so to speak) the data to have an intercept term and a positive linear time trend. To test these data for stationarity, should I use the Dickey-Fuller test that includes an intercept and time trend, i.e. equation #3 ? $\nabla y_t = \alpha_0+\alpha_1t+\delta y_{t-1}+u_t$ Or, should I use the DF test that only includes an intercept because the first difference of the equation I believe underlies the model has only an intercept? Long version: As stated above, I have a time series of climate data that I'm testing for stationarity. Based on previous research, I expect the model underlying the data to have an intercept term, a positive linear time trend, and some normally distributed error term. In other words, I expect the underlying model to look something like this: $y_t = a_0 + a_1t + \beta y_{t-1} + u_t $ where $u_t$ is normally distributed. Since I'm assuming the underlying model has both an intercept and a linear time trend, I tested for a unit root with equation #3 of the simple Dickey-Fuller test, as shown: $\nabla y_t = \alpha_0+\alpha_1t+\delta y_{t-1}+u_t$ This test returns a critical value that would lead me to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the underlying model is non-stationary. However, I question if I'm applying this correctly, since even though the underlying model is assumed to have an intercept and a time trend, this does not imply that the first difference $\nabla y_t$ will as well. Quite the opposite, in fact, if my math is correct. Calculating the first difference based on the equation of the assumed underlying model gives: $\nabla y_t = y_t - y_{t-1} = [a_0 + a_1t + \beta y_{t-1} + u_t] - [a_0 + a_1(t-1) + \beta y_{t-2} + u_{t-1}]$ $\nabla y_t = [a_0 - a_0] + [a_1t - a_t(t-1)] + \beta[y_{t-1} - y_{t-2}] + [u_t - u_{t-1}]$ $\nabla y_t = a_1 + \beta \cdot \nabla y_{t-1} + u_t - u_{t-1}$ Therefore, the first difference $\nabla y_t$ appears to only have an intercept, not a time trend. I think my question is similar to this one , except I'm not sure how to apply that answer to my question.
