The best advice I could give you is to NOT use the proposed formula. The main reason is that its coverage will be erratic, and very often below your desired 95%. Please read the wikipedia link provided by @Henry. You should also consult the following paper: Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion Author(s): Lawrence D. Brown, T. Tony Cai and Anirban DasGupta Source: Statistical Science , May, 2001, Vol. 16, No. 2 (May, 2001), pp. 101-117 It demonstrates how your formula (Wald interval) can mis-behave, and then shows how some alternate derivations behave better. Unfortunately that paper does not compare Wald to the "exact" binomial CI's (otherwise known as Fisher, Clopper-Pearson, etc.), which is what I would be using in your situation (you ran a binomial test, it follows -exactly- a binomial distribution, so you should use a binomial test, and not one based on normal approximations, more or less massaged...). Binomial CI's are more "conservative" than normal approximations for small n's. That is true, but I do not see that as a problem (after all, more "conservative" means larger CI's which fail to include the true proportion less often than your stated significance, which I would not call a "problem" or failure of the test. It is a problem of the sample size, or its lack of power, which is a well known property of binomial tests (they require higher sample sizes than, say normal tests, for the same power; all you know is that a sample passed, but you do not know by how much: barely of with flying colors. That loss of information requires larger samples to compensate...). This is related to the discrete nature of binomial tests, but as n gets above 50 or 100, this effect disappears.
