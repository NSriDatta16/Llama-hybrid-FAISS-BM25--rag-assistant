Before diving into the code it is useful to first get a architectural overview to know where to dive in. For bazaar the following might help: http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.2.3/en/user-guide/core_concepts.html http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.2.3/developers/overview.html I found the bazaar code base well organised, clean and readable, probably because it is python and each code change gets reviewed so code documentation is normally amended as per review which in general makes things a lot clearer. If you get stuck you can always ask on IRC or the mailinglist, but I have not needed to do that much at all.
