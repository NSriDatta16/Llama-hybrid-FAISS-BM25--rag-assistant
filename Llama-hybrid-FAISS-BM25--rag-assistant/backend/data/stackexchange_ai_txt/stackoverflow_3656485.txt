How to upcast an Object to a java.util.Map?

I have an object in my code of the type Object: Object o The class of the instance is Object: o.getClass() gives Object. Now, it should be a Map! How can I upcast this to a Map? I tried: Map map = (HashMap )o But this returns: java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to java.util.HashMap The instance 'o' comes from a XMLRPC request. This request does not qualify variables correctly supposedly Please have a look at this!? EDIT: Now I have the following issue: o.getClass().getName() gives java.util.ArrayList , o.get(0) gives [Ljava.lang.Object;@739e8329 , and o.get(0).getClass().getName() gives java.lang.String . I cannot findout what to do.. EDIT2: Finally I found out what happened. The software that created this object flattened a datastructure into a String (valueOf()). So, when I printed the variable it returned a [Ljava.util.Object, which was in fact a String containing this information. Thanks guys!
