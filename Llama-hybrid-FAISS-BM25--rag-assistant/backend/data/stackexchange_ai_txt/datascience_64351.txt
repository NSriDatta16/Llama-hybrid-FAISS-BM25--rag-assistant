image classification with training set with 4 classes and test set with 3 classes

I have to do image classificaion with a CNN, and for doing this I have been given a training set with 4 classes and a test set with 3 classes. I am really confused because I don't know if this is going to influence my prediction. It never happened to me. How can I deal with this? Thanks in advance.
