Assuming your implementation is correct and your colleagues not being able to reproduce the problem, it might be that your MFT is running out of space. By default, Windows XP reserves 12.5 percent of each NTFS volume (an area called the MFT zone) for exclusive use of the MFT. So if you plan to store tons of small files (under 8K, say) on your volume, your MFT may run out of space before your volume's free space does, and the result will be MFT fragmentation. From Technet First, the MFT doesn't shrink even when you delete files and directories from the volume; instead, the MFT marks the FRSs to reflect the deletion. Second, NTFS stores very small files within the MFT FRSs that refer to the files. Although this setup provides a performance benefit for these files, it can cause the MFT to grow excessively when the volume contains many such files.
