This really gave me an idea and I tried using FsLex/FsYacc to process your Excel cells. It's maybe not exactly what you imagined, but it may be useful and it's also not very big. Basically, the code I wrote runs like this: let teststrings = [ "1002"; "=SUM(B2:B12)"; "=A1+AVERAGE(B2:B4)"; "=B3+G7"; "=MIN(MEAN(A3:A20))"; "=A1+B4*C6" ]; teststrings |> List.iter (fun s -> (convert s |> printfn "%A" s)) and the output looks like "1002" "(SUM,(RANGE,B2,B12))" "(+,A1,(AVERAGE,(RANGE,B2,B4)))" "(+,B3,G7)" "(MIN,(MEAN,(RANGE,A3,A20)))" "(+,A1,(*,B4,C6))" The whole thing is too big to put in this box, but have a look here .
