You can store a temporary Point from touchesBegan . Add a iVar in "YourImageView" interface. @interface YourImageView : UIImageView { CGPoint previousPt; //Other iVars. } @end @implementation YourImageView - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { previousPt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { const CGPoint p = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; if (previousPt.x > p.x) { //Dragged right to left } else if (previousPt.x I would extract a method out of it. But I hope you got the idea.
