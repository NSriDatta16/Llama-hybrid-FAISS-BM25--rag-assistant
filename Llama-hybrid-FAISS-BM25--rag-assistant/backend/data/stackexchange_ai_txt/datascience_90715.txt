It's hard to say for sure without having the article in hand. At risk of putting words in the author's mouth, I would guess that the two terms do mean the same thing if they are being used interchangeably. Featurization is a common-ish term for feature engineering or feature extraction. In that context, you typically start with some low-level, noisy representation of the data, then pass it through some algorithm to transform it into a "feature vector" (a high-level representation of the data). So I guess it might be tempting to call that process "vectorization" as well. Once again, hard to say for sure without taking a look at the article. Outside of a given article, I would not want to use them interchangeably. Usually "vectorization" refers to modifying an operation so that it works with vectors rather than scalars. (this is what numpy.ndarray is all about).
