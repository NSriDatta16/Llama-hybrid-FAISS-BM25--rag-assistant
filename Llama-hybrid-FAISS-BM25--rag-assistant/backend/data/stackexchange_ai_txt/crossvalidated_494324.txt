No, summing correlation between different variables does not make much sense. In fact, given that correlation has to be on an interval $[-1,1]$ (as correlation of $1$ or $-1$ implies perfect positive or negative relationships respectively) the value of $2.9$ is meaningless. Furthermore, also as pointed in the comments correlation is calculated for two variables, as it measures strength of relationship between them. The Pearson correlation coefficient (which I assume was used here) is given by $r_{xy} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{s_X s_Y}$ so in essence it is a standardized covariance between two variables. Adding different standardized covariances together is again meaningless. However, if you would like to aggregate the result then instead of summing the correlations you could, for example, calculate an average of all correlations and report that. This will tell you how on average are those different stocks correlated with Facebook.
