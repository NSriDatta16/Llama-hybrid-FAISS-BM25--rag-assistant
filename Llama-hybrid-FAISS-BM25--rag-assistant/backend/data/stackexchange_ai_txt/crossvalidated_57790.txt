spss: working with two binary/dummy variables

Am trying to set a few binary/dummy variables against each other, i.e. propensity_to_dance and gender . I assume that it' ok to be using a binary logistic regression in SPSS (or otherwise) to investigate the interaction on these two variables; I've previously been using that kind of regression to investigate the relationship between binary and linear variables. Is it correct to use this methodology for two binary variables as in the above?
