Time series estimation, estimated values cannot be observed

Assume we have an infinite time series $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_i,\dots,v_j,\dots,v_y,\dots,v_z,\dots$ and use Gaussian process for prediction. At time $i-1$, we want to use the previous observed data to predict the values for $\bar{v_i}$ to $\bar{v_j}$. If these values are predicted, they cannot not be observed. We can continue to observe the data from $v_{j+1}$ to $v_{y-1}$ and use the historical observed data to predict $\bar{v_y}$ to $\bar{v_z}$. My question is, since the data $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ are predicted instead of being observed, can we use these predicted data to adjust the model for better result?
