Apparently someone was working on something similar for Rotor . I don't have access to IEEE so I can't read the abstract. Dynamic recompilation and profile-guided optimisations for a .NET JIT compiler Quote from Summary... An evaluation of the framework using a set of test programs shows that performance can improve by a maximum of 42.3% and by 9% on average. Our results also show that the overheads of collecting accurate profile information through instrumentation to an extent outweigh the benefits of profile-guided optimisations in our implementation , suggesting the need for implementing techniques that can reduce such overheads.
