If your domain is geographic or political, then it might be an entity, but in the average case, a country is just a value associated with things like addresses. In that case, in the context of your object model, it's just a value. As for storage, the domain model doesn't really care. You can use the database if it's convenient, XML if you prefer, and a class if you have behavior associated with countries.
