Yes, the characters get compared. They are usually compared based on their Unicode code points, though, which are quite different between hiragana and kanji -- making the sort potentially useless in Japanese. (Kanji borrowed from Chinese, but the order they'd appear in Chinese doesn't correspond to the order of the hiragana that'd represent the same meaning). There are collations that could render some of the characters "equal" for comparison purposes, but i don't know if there's one that'll consider a kanji to be equivalent to the hiragana that'd comprise its pronunciation -- especially since a character can have a number of different pronunciations. In Chinese or Korean, or other languages that don't have 3 different alphabets (one of which is quite irregular), it'd probably be less of an issue.
