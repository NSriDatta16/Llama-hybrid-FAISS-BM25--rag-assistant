Adversarial noise in PCA

PCA is known to be quite sensitive to outlier noise (and this is why several Robust PCA techniques exists.) However, I am looking for a concrete example of sensitivity of PCA to adversarial noise that is a synthetic setting in which we can show that an adversary can severely affect the quality of eigenvectors obtained. Can anyone provide a simple example for this or, better still, provide a reference? I am particularly looking at PCA of graph Laplacians where a malicious adversary can add a small fraction of nodes and/or edges. Any insights will be most appreciated. Thanks!
