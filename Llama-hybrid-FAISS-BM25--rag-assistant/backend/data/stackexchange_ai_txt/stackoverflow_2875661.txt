Perforce, Visual Studio and branching

We are in the process of trying to implement perforce in our small IT department. We're primarily developing in .net using visual studio 2008. I've organized my projects as follows: Customer Product main_line version_1 version_2 Libraries Library_Name main_line version_1 A main_line/version folders contain the solution file as well as the code files for the main project in the solution. The solution typically includes one or more projects contained in the "Libraries" hierarchy, and those library projects are usually included in multiple solutions. In perforce this seems to work fine as long as I apply source control to individual projects as opposed to entire solutions. In fact, either the perforce plug-in, or visual studio itself, gives me a warning if I try to source control solutions that share common projects/libraries. The problems start happening when I try to branch solutions. Since I'm not source controlling the entire solution, the .sln file is not copied to the branch directory, which I suspect is would be useless anyway due to incorrect file mappings. My question is, am I doing something wrong or is branching of visual studio solutions always this painful? Is there a better way? Perforce seems work well only for simple solutions. Is there a source control product that works better with visual studio?
