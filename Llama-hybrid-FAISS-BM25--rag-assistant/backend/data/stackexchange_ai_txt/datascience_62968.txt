Covariates in machine learning classificatoin

I would like to classify a number of people as sick and healthy. I have all the body measures as features. I have to control for age and sex because body features are affected by that. How do I adjust for age and sex? Should I just add all the variables including age and sex as variables and try to classify? Or, should I do something else?
