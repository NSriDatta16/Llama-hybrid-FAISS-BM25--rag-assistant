If you have more then two categories it's not logistic regression, but multinomial logistic regression (also known as multinomial regression) . While logistic regression model is defined in terms of conditional odds of one category as compared to another, in multinomial model you compare $K-1$ categories to the $K$th category that serves as a "default" category. If your categories are ordered, you will use ordinal regression , that is a similar model but for ordered categories. See the Interpreting exp(B) in multinomial logistic regression thread for extended discussion of multinomial model.
