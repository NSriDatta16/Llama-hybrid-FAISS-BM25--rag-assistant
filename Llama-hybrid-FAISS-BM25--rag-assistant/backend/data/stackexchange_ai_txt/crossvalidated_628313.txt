Here is a simple approach: You can pair the observations $(X_i,Y_i)$ . Then, you can create Bernoulli random variables from your data: $1\{X_i , i.e. this random variable is $1$ if $X_i and 0 else. Then, you can estimate $\mathbb{P}[X using the empirical mean (which I will denote by $\hat{\theta}_n$ ): $$ \hat{\theta}_n:=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n1\{X_i So, you are just calculating how many times $X_i$ is smaller than $Y_i$ on average in your dataset. This estimator is unbiased, since: $$ \mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}_n]=\mathbb{P}[X You also have consistency: by the (strong) law of large numbers $\hat{\theta}_n\rightarrow \mathbb{P}[X almost surely. Moreover, by the central limit theorem you have asymptotic normality: $$ \sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}_n-\mathbb{P}[X
