"Certainly, any continuous column (with enough resolution) has the power to uniquely identify the example." - that's not true for a predictor that is treated as continuous. For instance, if you generate Y and X at random using uniform distribution, then all of the values of X will most likely be distinct. However, when you regress Y on X using simple linear regression, the fit (in terms of $R^2$) will not be perfect. That's because there is a restriction on relationship between Y and X in the form $Y = x'\beta + \epsilon$. There are only two parameters in the model. If you treat X as a categorical predictor with N levels where N is the sample size, then there is no such restriction: for each level of X, you are allowed estimate a distinct parameter that describes the average response at that level of X. That is, you end up with N observations and N parameters. For each such parameter, its estimate will be equal to the observed value of Y, so you will end up with a perfect fit. One implication is that if your subject ID is formatted as a number and the ML package will see it as a quantitative predictor, then you won't have a problem with it, apart from including a meaningless predictor in your model.
