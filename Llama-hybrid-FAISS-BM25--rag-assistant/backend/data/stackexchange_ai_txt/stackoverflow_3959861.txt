What column or columns would the PK index be built on? If just a surrogate identity column, you'll have no performance hit when inserting rows, as they'd be inserted "in order". If it is not a surrogate key, then you have the admittedly minor but still useful assurance that you don't have duplicate entries. Is the primary key used to control the order in which report rows are to be printed? If not, then how do you ensure proper ordering of the information? (Or is this just a data table that gets summed one way and another whenever a report is generated?) If you use a clustered primary key, you wouldn't use as much storage space as you would with a non-clustered index. By and large, I find that while not every table requires a primary key, it does not hurt to have one present, and since proper relational database design requires primary keys on all tables, it's good practice to always include them.
