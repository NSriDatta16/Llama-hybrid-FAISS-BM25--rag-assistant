Interpreting Average Marginal Effect in raw numbers

I fitted a logistic regression model with a binary exposure variable X , trying to understand the effect it has on a given outcome Y , which measures infection (yes/no). I calculated the odds ratio of the variable of interest as well as the Average Marginal Effect, both highly significant. Particularly, in my case the AME associated with X =1 is -0.0245 [-0.0201;-0.0283]. This means that the probability that Y =1 (infection occurs) are reduced by 2.45% when X =1. Now, how do I move from this to a simpler explanation regarding the raw count difference between the two groups (i.e., treated and control)? Something like: "given that in my dataset I have 2,000 observations, with 1100 treated and 900 untreated, the AME is telling us that the probability that Y occurs is 2.45% lower for treated, translating to a reduction of Z infected patients" What do I have to use? The baseline unconditional probability of infection? I am a little bit confused about the process. Thanks for any help!
