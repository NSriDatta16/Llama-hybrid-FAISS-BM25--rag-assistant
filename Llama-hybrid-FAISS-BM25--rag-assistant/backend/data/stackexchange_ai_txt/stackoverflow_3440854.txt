CSS doesn't load after migration of magento website

I migrated my magento website to a different server, following the steps described here . Everything went smoothly, except for the fact that when I load the page, the CSS won't load, and I just get the page in plain text. I used firebug and noticed that the path the system is using to get to the CSS file doesn't exist in the FTP server. It starts with the 'minify' folder, which makes me think that something might be cached from the previous server. An example: my_site_url/minify/1281335374/skin/frontend/default/hellouno/css/styles.css This path doesn't exist, not even in the previous server, so I'm thinking maybe these files are supposed to be generated on the fly? I'm really confused, any help will be very appreciated!
