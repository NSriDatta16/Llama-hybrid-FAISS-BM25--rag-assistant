Your forecast is quite obviously badly wrong, and we can tell even without looking at the holdout data. An ARIMA(6,2,1) model is very complex. The I(2) term can be thought of as modeling quadratic trends in time. (Why? An ARIMA(p,1,q) series has ARMA(p,q) increments , and an ARIMA(p,2,q) series has ARMA(p,q) increments of increments , so overall, something "quadratic" happens. Think in terms of second derivatives!) Here is a little illustration of what kinds of time series happen with I(2) - note the vertical axes: R code: set.seed(1) # for reproducibility opar First, we don't see these kinds of trends in your data, and second, this can extrapolate very badly indeed. I would be very careful about integration orders higher than 1. Use a simpler model. I suspect you are calculating AIC values on all your models, and comparing them. You can't compare AICs between models of different integration orders (because the differencing implies that the data are on different scales). You can only compare AICs between models with the same $d$ . I recommend you either use auto.arima() from the forecast package for R, or at least take a look at how it decides on the order of integration. I suspect that auto.arima() will decide on a very different model than one with $d=2$ . In Python, you could try pmdarima , which aims at replicating auto.arima() . I don't have any experience with it, though.
