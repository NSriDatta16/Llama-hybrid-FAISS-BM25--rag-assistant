There is probably an issue with your model. Two issues that could lead to such trace plots are: (as mentioned in the comments) An improper posterior distribution. Did you impose proper priors? An issue with identifiability. For point 2: you have 3 parameters, say $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. If the identifiable parameters are actually $(\frac{\alpha}{\gamma}, \frac{\beta}{\gamma})$, then you might observe such a plot, where the 3 parameters diverge but the ratios (or some other transformation) remain more or less constant. One way to check this would be to start with a simpler model, including only 1 or 2 of your parameters (and keeping the 3rd constant), and checking whether your MCMC behaves better in that situation.
