GNU Compiler Debug 'Level'

While browsing the various option switches for my compiler (GNU C++ 3.2.3 is supported by my organization for my given hardware configuration), I ran across this: -glevel : Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use -g3. I compiled a test program with a few macros (such as a loop, a if-then-else on an argument), then tried the commercial debugger TotalView, and GDB on the code compiled -g3. I didn't see any difference (macros were not expanded to their original code, I couldn't 'step into' the macros, etc.). Anyone here had the experience of getting extra debugging 'features' using -g3 on GNU compilers?
