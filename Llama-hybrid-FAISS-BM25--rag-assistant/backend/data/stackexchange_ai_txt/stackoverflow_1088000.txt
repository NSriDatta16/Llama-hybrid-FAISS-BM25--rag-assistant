Is it possible to hash a password and authenticate a user client-side?

I often make small websites and use the built in ASP.NET membership functionality in a SQL Server database, using the default "hashing" password storage method. I'm wondering if there's a way to authenticate a user by hashing his password on the client and not sending it in clear text over the wire without using SSL. I realize that this would only be applicable for users with Javascript enabled. Or... possibly, this would be a great built-in capability for Silverlight (is this in the Silverlight roadmap?) EDIT: I'm also looking for "degrees of security." Meaning, if there is a method that has some advantages over simply sending plaintext password, I'd like to know what they are and why. I know there are lots of people who do small sites with logins (such as a family website or volunteering to make a site for a local cooking club) and don't see the need for purchasing SSL certificates.
