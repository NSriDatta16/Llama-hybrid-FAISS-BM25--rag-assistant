It seems this question has been answered in the affirmative in this recent article by Dmitry Yarotsky: Universal approximations of invariant maps by neural networks . The article shows that any translation equivariant function can be approximated arbitrarily well by a convolutional neural network given that it is sufficiently wide, in direct analogy to the classical universal approximation theorem.
