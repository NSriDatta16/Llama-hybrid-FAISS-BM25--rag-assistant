I am comparing the sex ratio of pheasants across Study Areas, (10), Release sites (26), and Years (13)

I am using Binary Logistic Regression and comparing Models using AIC. The Model is: sex ratio= study area + release site + years When I count the number of Parameters (K) in the Model -do I count Study Area, Release Site, and Years-each as 1 parameter. All 3 are categorical variables with multiple levels. OR is it 10 for the Study Area, 26 for the Release Site, and 13 for the Years????? 10 different study areas-26 different release sites of pheasants (within those 10 study areas and data collected on sex ratio from 2006-2018. Should I use YEAR as a covariate and continuous variable rather than a fixed factor and categorical variable? How many Parameters (K) for this Model and if YEAR is a covariate? Please help me. Thanks Scott
