Yes, in machine learning this would be called "active learning", where samples are iteratively added to the dataset in order to minimise the uncertainty of the model (in some sense). ISTR that one of David MacKay's early papers (arising from his PhD) on Bayesian neural networks had some coverage of this (866 Google scholar citations suggests it is a good place to start): David J. C. MacKay, "Information-Based Objective Functions for Active Data Selection", Neural Computation, Vol. 4, No. 4, Pages 590-604, July 1992. (doi:10.1162/neco.1992.4.4.590)
