Essentially Memcache does exactally what you want it to. It does its job very well, getting and setting values... I think the answer your looking for is outside of the default functionality of memcache. I suppose you can put more control on your codebase to check a timestamp that you store with your blob and use that to set expire times for future updates? I don't know what your using for your non-memcache consistent storage, but I would store an expiry date in that-- then use that value to update your memcache.
