Binary regressor - what happens if people move from one category to the other?

Suppose I have the following regression model: Monthly alcohol consumed A as independent variable, regressed on a binary regressor S (S = 1 if smoker, S = 1 if non-smoker), and through OLS I get an estimate for the coefficient of S, say 2 pints. So 2 pints is the difference in average monthly alcohol consumed between smokers and non smokers. Imagine now the government introduces anti-smoking campaign, and proportion of smokers fall by 10% points. Does that affect the monthly alcohol consumed? My initial thought was no: a smoker will on average still drink 2 pints more than a non-smoker, it doesn't matter whether there are more non-smokers around or not. But then I thought that surely the OLS estimate will be different, if I run a new regression? Since the smokers who turned into non-smokers will arguably (at least in the short term) carry over their increased propensity to drink, and thereby reducing the difference in average alcohol consumption between the two groups. I think I have now answered my own question: No, a reduction in proportion of smokers does not affect monthly alcohol consumption. It has nothing to do with the value of the binary regressor. Can someone please confirm/improve this reasoning? Apologies for any confusions.
