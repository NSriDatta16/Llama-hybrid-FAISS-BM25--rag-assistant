In the cited example the parameters are alpha = 81 and beta = 219 from the prior year [81 hits in 300 at bats or (81 and 300 - 81 = 219)] I don't know what they call the prior assumption of 81 hits and 219 outs but in English, that's the a priori assumption. Notice how as the season progresses the curve shifts left or right and the modal probability shifts left or right but there is still a curve. I wonder if the Laa of Large Numbers eventually takes hold and drives the batting average back to .270. To guesstimate the alpha and beta in general one would take the complete number of prior occurrences (at bats), the batting average as known, obtain the total hits (the alpha), the beta or the grand total minus the failures) and voila â€“ you have your formula. Then, work the additional data in as shown.
