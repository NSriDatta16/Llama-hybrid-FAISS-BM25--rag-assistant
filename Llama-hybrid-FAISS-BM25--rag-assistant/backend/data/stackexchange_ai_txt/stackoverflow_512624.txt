try-catch block in Java - execution statements in catch code

I have a question about the order of the execution of statements in a catch block in Java. when I run the following class Test1 (see below), I expect to have as output first Hi!, then the result of the e.printStackTrace(); statement, and then Bye!. However, I never get this order. Please, look at the outputs, which I have pasted below. public class Test1 { public static void calculate() { try { int h = 5/0; } catch (ArithmeticException e) { System.out.println("Hi!"); e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println("Bye!"); } public static void main(String[] args) { calculate(); } } Output1: Hi! Bye! java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero at Test1.calculate(Test1.java:6) at Test1.main(Test1.java:15) Output2: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero at Test1.calculate(Test1.java:6) at Test1.main(Test1.java:15) Hi! Bye! I have two questions: 1.) The more important question: Why I always have Hi! and Bye! printed always one after the other, even though mye.printStackTrace() in the code is between them? 2.) Why sometimes I have the output of the statement e.printStackTrace() before Hi!, and sometimes after Bye! ? I have run the program many times and I cannot understand under what circumstances I get one or the other print. Thank you. I am using Java 6, and Eclipse (Ganymed).
