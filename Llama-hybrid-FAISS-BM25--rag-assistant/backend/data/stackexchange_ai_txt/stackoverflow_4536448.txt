If I understand the problem, you have text and you want to determine keywords that are most relevant to the text. Three approaches: 1) Have user enter keywords 2) Statistical analysis of text, for example determine the words that are far more common in the text than they are in the language overall. Any good text on Information Retrieval will have some algorithms. 3) If you have a set of documents that are already classified (perhaps previously classified by humans) then you can use a machine learning algorithm (perhaps a Bayesian classifier) to train the system to classify the new documents. If you let the users override/correct the suggested keywords, the system can learn over time. Personally, I'd do #3, since it is more adaptive.
