How do you do bootstrapping with time series data?

I recently learned about using bootstrapping techniques to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals for estimators. What I learned was that if the data is IID, you can treat the sample data as the population, and do sampling with replacement and this will allow you to get multiple simulations of a test statistic. In the case of time series, you clearly can't do this because autocorrelation is likely to exist. I have a time series and would like to calculate the mean of the data before and after a fixed date. Is there a correct way to do so using a modified version of bootstrapping?
