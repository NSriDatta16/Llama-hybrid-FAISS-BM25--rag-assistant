Adding additional data to a model

I'm currently running a logistic regression for classification on 100 patients dataset. However for 10 of those patients I have additional data that would help the accuracy for for those 10 patients. I was thinking of producing two models, one for all 100 and then one for 10,then using the 10 patients model whenever there is data for it. Though this seems not optimal, I was wondering if there are other ways to do this, I'm sure this problem arises quite often.
