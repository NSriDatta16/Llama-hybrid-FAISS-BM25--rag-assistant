MySQL's ibdata file is getting big and the size doesn't reflect how much data I have

The size of MySQL ibdata is 4GB, but I don't think the data I have should take that much disk space. I am using MySQL InnoDB storage engine. Am I doing something wrong with configuration? How do I reclaim the disk space because deleting rows didn't help at all? Thanks
