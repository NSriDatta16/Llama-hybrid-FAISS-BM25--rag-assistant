Azure platform: scaling instances up and down

Note: if you are familiar with the Azure pricing model, just jump to the "question" section. Microsoft will begin to charge for the use of the Azure platform starting February 1, 2010 . The monthly bill will be a function of bandwidth, storage, and others. Among the factors used to calculate the bill is compute time . This latter factor, however, has a misleading name: it should be named instance hosting time instead. Quoting the windows azure pricing page: When developing and testing your application, developers will want to remove the compute instances that are not being used to minimize compute hour billing Thus making you think it's not compute hours , but uptime hours what you will be charged for. The doubt fades out completely after reading the official response to this question in MSDN forums: I can confirm that each instance (of any role) counts, and all the hours you have the instance active count (regardless of how much "activity" they have). In the case of an application that has two web role instances and two worker role instances, you'll be billed for four instances At $0.12/hour per instance, an app using N instances will be billed an average of 24*30*0.12*N/month = ~ $86/month per instance. The matter worsens for small websites when you take into account the fact that you can't have less than 2 instances if you want the 99.9% uptime service level agreement to apply. So, a small, compute-power-inexpensive web site is probably not the target market for Azure. But for batch processes, the burden would probably go away. Question Speaking only in terms of compute-power and "compute hours" billing, Azure would be a good hosting option for a batch process that runs only a few hours a month, if and only if you can scale up (and down!) the number of instances easily. So: Is it possible to programatically scale up and down the number of instances in Azure? Are any other options besides manually changing the configuration file? Are there any non-obvious issues of scaling down the number of instances? How much time does Azure takes to "acknowledge" the scaling down of your application? Regarding the latter question: Take an extreme case where you have a very large number of instances (say, 1000) running for 45 minutes. If Azure isn't capable of taking notice of the scaling down within 15 minutes after after the process has ended, you will be charged for another 1000 compute-time hours.
