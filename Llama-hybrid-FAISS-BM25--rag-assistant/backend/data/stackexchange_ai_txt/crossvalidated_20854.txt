Calculation confidence interval for estimated logit in logistic regression in R

I have read from here and understand how to calculate the estimated logit from a fitted logistic regression model, but how to work on the confidence interval? As it involved a variance-covariance matrix and I think it is better to have a program to do the calculation, rather then doing it by myself. Thanks. Edit 01 I have added a script here: chdage.dummy predict function can give me an estimate, but I can't use confint outside predict , so what can I do?
