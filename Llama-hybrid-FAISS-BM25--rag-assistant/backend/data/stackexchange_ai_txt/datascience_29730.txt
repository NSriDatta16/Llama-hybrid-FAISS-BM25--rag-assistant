If you are looking for a nice solid tutorial for Deep Learning in the domain of NLP (Natural Language Processing), then Robert Gutherie's notebook would be a great start. It teaches you how to use vectors and how does multi-dimensional vectors look like and how to deal with them. He uses the deep-learning library of Facebook, Pytorch to explain the concepts. This library is more pythonic and less verbose than tf, so it is easier to follow. (personal opinion though). After that, you can take up any library like gensim, spacy or Fasttext and put your vectors to work there. A nice follow-up, also would be to go through Pytorch's Deep Learning tutorials. They are very nicely written and often very intuitive and the code is very easy to read (thanks to Python and pythocicity of Pytorch :D).
