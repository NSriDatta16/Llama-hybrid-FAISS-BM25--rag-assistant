When I use vim, and I jump to a tag, by doing for instance: :tag getfirst I get presented with something that looks like: # pri kind tag file 1 F m getfirst /home/sthorne/work/.../FormData.py class:FakeFieldStorage def getfirst(self, k, default): .... 8 F m getfirst /home/sthorne/work/.../CGIForm.py class:CGIForm def getfirst(self, name): Choice number ( cancels): I type '5' to go to the 5th occurrence. If you can't get your vim to have that behaviour (it seems to be on by default for my vim), you can use g] instead of ctrl-] , which is analagous to :tselect instead of :tag
