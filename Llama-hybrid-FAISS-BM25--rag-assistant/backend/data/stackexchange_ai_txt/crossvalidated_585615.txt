Average Margin of Error

Sampling 100 random respondents for a binary true/false response from a total population of 220,000,000 yields a margin of error of 9.8%. If a new random sample of 100 respondents from the same population is surveyed each day for 90 days (each day's results having a 9.8% margin of error) and the 90 daily results are then averaged, how to calculate the margin of error associated with the 90 day average? To be clear: tn = % true day n 90 day average = (t1+t2+...+t90) / 90 Thank you
