You might try PRAGMA page_size = 512; prior to creating the db, or prior to creating the first table, or prior to executing a VACUUM statement. (The manual is a bit contradictory and it also depends on the sqlite3 version.) I think it's also kind of rare to create tables dynamically at a high rate. It's good that you are normalizing your schema, but it's OK for columns to depend on a primary key and, while repeating groups are a sign of lower normalization level, it's normal for foreign keys to repeat in a reasonable schema. That is, I think there is a good possibility that you need only one table of key/value pairs, with a column that identifies client instance. Keep in mind that flat files have allocation unit overhead as well. Watch what happens when I create a one byte file: $ cat > /tmp/one $ ls -l /tmp/one -rw-r--r-- 1 ross ross 1 2009-10-11 13:18 /tmp/one $ du -h /tmp/one 4.0K /tmp/one $ According to ls(1) it's one byte, according to du(1) it's 4K.
