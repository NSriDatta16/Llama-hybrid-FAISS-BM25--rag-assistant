Raise an event from MySQL and handle it from VB.NET (or something similar)?

I'm working with MySQL 5.1.39 and Visual Studio 2008 and connecting both with MySQL Connector Net 6.1.2. What I'd like to do is once a MySqlConnection object is created, be able to handle the "event raised" when a field in a specific row in a given table is updated. I mean, when that value in that table has been manually changed or modified from any other application, I'd like to receive a signal in my opened VB.NET application. Until now, I do it from opened VB.NET application checking that table every X seconds, but I wonder if it could be done in a better way. Many thanks for your attention and time.
