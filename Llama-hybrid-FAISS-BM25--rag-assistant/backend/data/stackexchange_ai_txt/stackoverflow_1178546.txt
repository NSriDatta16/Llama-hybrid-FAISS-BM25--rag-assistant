The best way to debug server code is to use remote debugging. First you need to add the following to the JVM params in the server start script: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 This will cause the JVM to listen on the specified port, then from your IDE you can start a remote debug session against that port and debug as if the code was running in the same process. Working this way prevent you restarting the server so frequently and hence side-steps your problem with Websphere's start-up time. You can get some odd results if the binaries on the server and the source in the IDE get out of sync but on the whole that's not a problem.
