How do I construct a request for a WCF http post call?

I have a really simple service that I'm messing about with defined by: [OperationContract] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "Review/{val}", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Xml, Method = "POST", BodyStyle=WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare)] void SubmitReview(string val, UserReview review); UserReview is, at the moment, a class with no properties. All very basic. When I try and test this in Fiddler I get a bad request status (400) message. I'm trying to call the service using the details: POST http://127.0.0.1:85/Service.svc/Review/hello Headers User-Agent: Fiddler Content-Type: application/xml Host: 127.0.0.1:85 Content-Length: 25 Body I would think i'm missing something fairly obvious. Any pointers?
