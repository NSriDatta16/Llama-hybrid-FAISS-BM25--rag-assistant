No, there isn't. Besides, every browser displays its dropdowns in its own way, some use system widgets, some have their own. In Safari, for example, no matter what styling you remove, it still has a box (well, sort of) around the whole of it. If you don't want to change your HTML code, perhaps a bit of javascript might do it - get the selected value and exchange the dropdown for a paragraph.
