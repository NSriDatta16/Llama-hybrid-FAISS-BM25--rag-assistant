How to organize model repository while using Entity Framework?

I have dilemma about how to organize connection (repository class) to data layer in my application that uses the Entity Framework. How would you write it? And why? public class ResearchRepository { public Research GetResearch (int id) { using (MnijenjeEntities mnijenjeContext = new MnijenjeEntities()) { ObjectQuery researchs = mnijenjeContext.Research; var research = (from r in researchs.Include("SurveyPaper") where r.ResearchID == id select r).First(); return research; } } //.... OR public class ResearchRepository { private MnijenjeEntities mnijenjeContext; public Research GetResearch(int id) { mnijenjeContext = new MnijenjeEntities(); ObjectQuery researchs = mnijenjeContext.Research; var research = (from r in researchs.Include("SurveyPaper") where r.ResearchID == id select r).First(); return research; } //.... The difference is in the dataContext object usage.
