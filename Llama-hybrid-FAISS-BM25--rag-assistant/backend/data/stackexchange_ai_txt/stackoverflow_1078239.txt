Switching connection strings

I've created a class library that contains three entity models for three databases that other classes have to connect to. This class library is then used by three different web services and a website. These are all installed on their own server so there's no easy way to let them share the same connection data. In my web.config files I have this line: This will load the connection strings from a separate XML file. It works fine but it also means that I now have 5 different copies of this Dependencies.ConnectionStrings.Config file. I would prefer to use a single file during development. However, my solution also contains four setup projects and in these setups, the config files must be next to each other. So how do I tell VS to share a single config file between multiple projects yet without modifying web.config? To make it slightly more complicated, the class library uses an app.config to store the connection strings. And I can't tell app.config to link the connection strings to a separate config file, apparently... One additional complication is that the connection strings need to be modified by the system administration after installation. That's because it will have to look to a different database than the development databases. (Actually, during development, I use 3 databases to split up the entity logic. The Test and Production environments will just use a single database.) My current solution is simple. I've added the Dependencies.ConnectionStrings.Config file to a separate folder in my solution and regularly drag&drop this into the other projects to update them. Although this works, it's error-prone...
