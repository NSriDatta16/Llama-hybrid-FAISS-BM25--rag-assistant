I think you are missing the point of Memcached. It's not for reliable data storage. It's for VERY fast access to cached data. If you want redundancy, try a NOSQL database like MongoDB... Besides, creating several connections is going to be bad for performance and redundancy (the more connections it needs to make, the greater chance something will go wrong, and the more it needs to do for each request). Simplify, don't complicate...
