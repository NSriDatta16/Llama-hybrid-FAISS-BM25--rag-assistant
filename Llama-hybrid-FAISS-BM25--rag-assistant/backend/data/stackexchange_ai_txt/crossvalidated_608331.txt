The way I think about it is this: $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$ The key is to understand what each term means and what division by $P(B)$ means in this case (it's a little more confusing because we are dividing by a number which is $\le 1$ Also, Do not think about this using a Venn diagram. As far as I know, this formula has no clear meaning that can be visualized with a Venn Diagram, and as another answer mentioned, Venn diagrams are mostly used to describe sets and intersections, not probabilities. Let's start with the numerator. $$P(A\cap B)$$ At first I was also confused as to why this is not the entire formula for conditional probability because both $P(A|B)$ and $P(A \cap B)$ describe probabilities in which both $A$ and $B$ occur. But things become clear when you consider more events(i.e. C, D, E etc). Now when you say $P(A \cap B)$ , you consider the entire sample space when what you need is $A$ with some relation to only $B$ , disregarding other events! What we need from conditional probability is to help us establish a "What is the likeliness of $A$ considering $B$ has occured." relation between two events. This leads us to the role of the denominator. To me, $P(B)$ was the confusing part about the formula , so let's consider the $P(B)$ in the formula as a seperate term $\frac{1}{P(B)}$ . If we consider $P(B)$ to be the chance obtaining 1 from a six-sided die, then $$P(B)=\frac{1}{6}\implies \frac{1}{P(B)}=6$$ This is the same as the average number of die rolls that we need to roll a one . In other words, to "probabilistically guarantee" an event $B$ , we repeat the experiment $\frac{1}{P(B)}$ times ( $P(B)\cdot \frac{1}{P(B)}=1$ ). Therefore, $$P(A \cap B)\cdot \frac{1}{P(B)}$$ Is the same as saying give me the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occuring assuming $B$ is guaranteed. NOTE: I am an undergrad student currently taking an Introduction to Probability course. If I commit a Math or Statistics crime, please forgive me. Also disregard the fact that I am answering this question 5 years later.
