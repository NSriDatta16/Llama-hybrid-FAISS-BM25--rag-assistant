Complex model can have better prediction accuracy but they lost definitive a lot in terms of interpretability. There are some techniques that can help you to understand what is happening even if this can be non trivial. I would suggest you to look at how random forest computes the importance of the predictors. You can use a similar system to understand what are the relevant variables in your system. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/25 Otherwise you can try with something like partial dependency plot or stuff like that. If you can transform your model in a 'linear in the coefficient model' maybe introducing variables that express non linearity or interaction like $x_1^2$ or $x_1x_2$ then you can use something like Lasso to reduce the complexity and understand which variables are important.
