How can I implement logistic regression in live decision system?

I got the equation for logistic reg, and I am comfortable with the result. Let's say logit(p), ln(p/q), or the model is something like $$\text{logit}(p) = b+a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + a_3X_3$$ For example --> $b = 10 , a_1 = 0.5 , a_2 = 0.6 , a_3 =0.7$ So my equation is $\text{logit(p)} = 10 + 0.5X_1 + 0.6X_2 + 0.7X_3 Let's say if I want my probability to be 40% ( $p = 0.4$ ) to be my cut off rate in the system. How can I use this in the live system? I'm thinking of giving the developer this logit equation but use in the live system this equation and block account that have fall below success rate threshold?
