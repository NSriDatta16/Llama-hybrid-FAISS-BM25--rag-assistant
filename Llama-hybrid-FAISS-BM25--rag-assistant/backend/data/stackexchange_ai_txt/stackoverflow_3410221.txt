If you're just concerned about what happens in the activity within that particular tab, the normal rules of activites apply, i.e. as if this activity were the only one in your application: You can either use Activity.finish() to go back to the previous activity on the stack, or use a ViewFlipper or something to randomly switch between various activities. Another (discouraged) way would be to remove all views and then call setContentView() to inflate a new layout, but the above ways would be preferred.
