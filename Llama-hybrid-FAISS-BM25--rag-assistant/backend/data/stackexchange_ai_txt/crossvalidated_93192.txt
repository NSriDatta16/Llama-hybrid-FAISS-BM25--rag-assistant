Variance Inflation Factor to Address Spatial Grouping with Binary Dependent Variable

I want to obtain reliable standard errors of the estimated coefficients from a regression of y on x. The observation for each individual consisted of a value of the y variable, which is binary, and a location. The latter was assigned to one of 8 geographical areas, the x values being estimated averages (from secondary data) over each of the areas. Thus the data is grouped, with x constant within each of the groups. The size of the groups varies considerably. Because of the grouping I expect that I need to apply a variance inflation factor to the OLS standard errors. Angrist & Pischke in Mostly Harmless Econometrics p 311 give this formula: $$\frac{V(\hat\beta_1)}{V_c(\hat\beta_1)} = 1+[\frac{V(n_g)}{\overline{n}} +\overline{n}-1]\rho_x\rho_e$$ Here $V(\hat\beta_1)$ is the true variance, $V_c(\hat\beta_1)$ the conventional OLS variance, $n_g$ the size of the $g$'th group, $\overline{n}$ the mean group size, $\rho_x$ the intraclass correlation of x (1 in my case) and $\rho_e$ the intraclass correlation of the error term. However, I haven't been able to find out whether this formula is valid with a binary dependent variable. Is there a formula for a variance inflation factor to address grouping in a regression with a small number of groups and a binary dependent variable?
