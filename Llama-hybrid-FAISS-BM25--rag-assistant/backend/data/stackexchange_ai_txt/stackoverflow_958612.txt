Neither is "best", the decision comes down to your personal preference. I know that's not the answer that you wanted but neither is "better" than the other, they both have their pros and cons. Rails is easier to get started with, but you already know PHP so that might be the way you want to go. It's up to you. If you decide to go with PHP, I'd recommend a framework such as CodeIgnighter for almost-Rails-like productivity. Again, that's up to you, but the "complex map creations" that you mention will run and look much better with Flex than with JavaScript. Also, Flash is really the only decent platform for video, so you're going to have to use Flash/Flex at least for some things. However, I personally have found that Flex isn't the easiest thing to learn, so if you don't want to (or can't) take the time to learn it, I wouldn't bother. (I assume you already know JavaScript. If not, then it may be worth your time to learn Flex instead.) Basically, with Flex, your application will be much more interactive, but there are many cons to using Flex instead of JavaScript as well. I don't really have too much experience in this area, but I'd highly recommend Amazon S3 for file storage (images, etc). It's fairly cheap and does most of the work for you (although you need to be sure your application does things like caching, etc, which can prove to be fairly difficult). As far as the other Amazon Web Services go (E2C, etc), I wouldn't bother with them until you need them. Use your own web/database servers, and if you feel the need to, for whatever reason, use AWS, then migrate.
