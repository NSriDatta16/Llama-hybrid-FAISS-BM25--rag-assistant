It depends on the expected size of neural network you are thinking about. If the DNN consists multiple layers with large default input and many fully connected layers then you need a GPU with large memory. Memory is the most important factor , without enough memory, you GPU is useless. To get an idea about the size of any DNN try to think about the number and size of fully connected layers. Of course the number of cores is important but again memory is more important
