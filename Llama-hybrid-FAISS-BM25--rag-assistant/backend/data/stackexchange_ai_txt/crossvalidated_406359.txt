Can SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel separate all kinds of data theoretically?

Gaussian is well known because its corresponding feature mapping is to infinite dimension. So with finite number of training data, is that the case that we can achieve zero training error with some proper combination of parameters? If not, how we explain the reason behind it? Why data (no exact same here) can't be linear separable even if we map it into infinite dimension?
