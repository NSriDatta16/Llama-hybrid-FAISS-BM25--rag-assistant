Finding image type from NSData or UIImage

I am loading an image from a URL provided by a third-party. There is no file extension (or filename for that matter) on the URL (as it is an obscured URL). I can take the data from this (in the form of NSData) and load it into a UIImage and display it fine. I want to persist this data to a file. However, I don't know what format the data is in (PNG, JPG, BMP)? I assume it is JPG (since it's an image from the web) but is there a programmatic way of finding out for sure? I've looked around StackOverflow and at the documentation and haven't been able to find anything. TIA. Edit: Do I really need the file extension? I'm persisting it to an external storage (Amazon S3) but considering that it will always be used in the context of iOS or a browser (both of whom seem fine in interpreting the data without an extension) perhaps this is a non-issue.
