I don't think you need a logistic regression. The outcome is binary (Left/Right is Most Persuasive) if I have understood correctly. The hypothesis is about the order in which arguments are presented. We can organize the results into a 2x2 table Left First Left Second Left Most Persuasive a b Right Most Persuasive c d Here, $a$ people who observed left make arguments first thought left was the most persuasive. $c$ people in that same group thought right was most persuasive. To test if the order in which arguments are presented affects the proportion of people who think left is most persuasive, we can use any number of tests in this answer though I would be preferential to a test of proportions + a Wilson Confidence Interval.
