Can principal component analysis be applied to datasets containing a mix of continuous and categorical variables?

I have a dataset that has both continuous and categorical data. I am analyzing by using PCA and am wondering if it is fine to include the categorical variables as a part of the analysis. My understanding is that PCA can only be applied to continuous variables. Is that correct? If it cannot be used for categorical data, what alternatives exist for their analysis?
