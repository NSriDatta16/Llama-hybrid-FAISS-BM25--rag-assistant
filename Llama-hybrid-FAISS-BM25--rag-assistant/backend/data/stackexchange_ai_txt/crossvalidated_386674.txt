TL;DR The wording may be confusing, but he means that $f(X)$ is a linear function of $X$ . By linear model we mean approximating the relation between $Y$ and $X$ using a function of $X$ , i.e. $Y \approx f(X)$ , where the function $f$ is a linear function . Linear function is defined as $f(x) = a + bx$ , where $a,b$ are parameters. If the model takes form of a non-linear function, then we call it a non-linear model. Notice that he discusses any machine learning model, not only regression models, and such models can be non-parametric, so "linearity in parameters" does not apply to them at all. See also the GLMs must be 'linear in the parameters' and How to tell the difference between linear and non-linear regression models? threads.
