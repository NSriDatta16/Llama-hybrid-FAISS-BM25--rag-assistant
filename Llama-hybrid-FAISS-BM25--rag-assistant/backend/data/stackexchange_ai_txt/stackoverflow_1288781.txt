I have a url rewrite i implement in the global.asax file in the begin authenticated request as I have some security. This is where I take the raw url and then do the db look up. this then rewrites the path to the aspx page and all the parameters are passed through the query string. No encoding is necessary. However if you are using the url to actually change data then i can see that you will have huge problems as you are effectively using the http GET to change database. It is usually concidered a bad idead, and not something i do. I only use a post request to do any databse manipulation. This keeps the url clean as all the data is in the page form. The only issue i had was to set the correct url to the page.form.action which in most cases is the raw url. If its the category names that are causing the issue then perhaps you should restrict the names to alpha numeric characters only and swap spaces for "-". IIS will throw a wobbly with periods "." as it looks for file names. P.S. IIS does not understand the tilde "~", this is something that the compiler understands. so if you use it in an anchor tag it will not work as expected and you should use the application root instead of the tilde. Edit: OK, it looks like an issue with IIS having issues with certain characters such as . / and &. Even if you do urlencode these IIS will still try to implement its own meanings. As such consider removing them so: Beverage & bar becomes BeverageBar Pastry / decorating becomes PastryDecorating. This will keep you urls clean, but does mean an extra column in the database so you can cheack the url against this shortened category name.
