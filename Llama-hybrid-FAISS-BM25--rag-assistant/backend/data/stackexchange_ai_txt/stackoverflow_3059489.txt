Intercept jTable selection change events

I found this forum thread which suggests overriding ListSelectionModel to prevent rows from being selected. I would like to prevent selection changes when there are unsaved changes (external to the table) for the currently selected item UNTIL the user confirms the discard. Something like: public class confirmSelectionChange extends DefaultListSelectionModel { public void setSelectionInterval(int index0, int index1) { if (unsavedChanges()) { super.setSelectionInterval(int index0, int index1); } } private boolean unsavedChanges() { if (noUnsavedChangesExist) { return true; } // Present modal dialog: save, discard cancel if (dialogAnswer == SAVE) { // save changes return true; } else if (dialogAnswer == DISCARD) { return true; } else { return false; } } } Is it possible to insert blocking code in the middle of ListSelectionModel changes? Is there a better way to intercept selection change events? I'm already listening for them but the change has already happened by then.
