Machine Translation: with sufficient parallel data, can we improve even further the performance of the system with the use of monolingual data?

I am trying to find scientific literature that studies if, in a situation in which we already have enough parallel data, the addition of monolingual data can further improve performance. I have not been able to find anything yet, but it seems reasonable to me that adding a target-side Language Model, for instance, should improve translation. Or maybe improving even more the parallel dataset by performing back-translation with target monolingual data. So, does anyone know of literature regarding this?
