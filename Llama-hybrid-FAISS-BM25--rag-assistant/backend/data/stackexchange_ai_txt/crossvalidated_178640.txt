Logistic regression is a natural choice for the specific situation - it is able to cope with both continuous (time since last visit) and categorical data (gender). Alternatively, you can use some more discrete oriented models such as naive Bayesian classifier or Bayesisan networks. Eventually, some approaches based on local regression (both polynomial/linear and logistic). As you can see, there is a multitude of applicable approaches and the best can be found by use of testing sets. Whatever approach is used, in the end you obtain the expected reward of clicking for given inputs and type of ad. Formally, we can write $R(X,A)$ where $A$ is the type of ad and $X$ are all other variables. If your model $R(\cdot,\cdot)$ would be perfect, it would make sense to take $$ A^{*}(X) = \arg\max_{A}R(X,A) $$ If you have few or not reliable data, it is worth to experiment randomly and obtain more evidence, i.e. to choose the type with the probability $1/3$ regardless to $X$. This is a well known exploration-exploitation dilemma from the reinforcement learning. There is a flexible tool for that called softmax action selection.
