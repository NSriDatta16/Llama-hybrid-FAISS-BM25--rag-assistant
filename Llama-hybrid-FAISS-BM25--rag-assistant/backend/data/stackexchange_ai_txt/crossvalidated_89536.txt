How to extract "average polyline" from a set of polylines

EDIT: As pointed, there is already a similar question "buried" inside a larger-scope one. I'll reproduce the relevant part here: If I have multiple recordings of the same routes are there any valid techniques to combine them to get closer to the real route? The relevant part of the chosen answer, in the context of my question, is this: With multiple recordings, you can create a 2D kernel smooth of each, sum the smooths, and subject that to a topographic analysis to look for a "ridgeline." You won't get a single connected line, usually, but you can often patch the ridges together into a continuous path. People have used this method to average hurricane tracks, for example. I have a set of polylines in bidimensional space (X,Y) representing object trajectories. Every polyline in the set is a measured track along the same prescribed path, most of them (but not all) starting around the same point, and ending around the same other point. I would like to statistically calculate the idealized path ("average polyline") from the set of polylines, in the same way I would manually manually trace it in a drawing program, except I would like this to happen without manual intervention. A sample image of a part of the polyline set (cropped) is below. It seems to me that tere is an "obvious" place where I would draw the average line with the mouse, but I can't figure which algorithm I could use. Important notes: I know I could use the nodes for calculations, but some segments might be arbitrarily long, thus not having nearby nodes that would help in the calculations. That is, I would like to consider the line segments themselves for the calculation, not just the nodes. There might be parts of a polyline behaving like outliers (see image). I think that, given the majority of polylines is well behaved, this outlier part would easily be "absorbed" by the well-behaved ones nearby. Although the original data is time-stamped, I believe no temporal relation should be necessary to infer the spatial result I am after, isn't it? Yes, this is GPS data (although this is incidental to the problem formulation, which has been purposefully abstracted).
