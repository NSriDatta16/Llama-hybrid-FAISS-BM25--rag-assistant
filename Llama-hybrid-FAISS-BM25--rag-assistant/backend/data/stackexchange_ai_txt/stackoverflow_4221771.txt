Full rewrite here. Supports number keys, numpad, and multiple-character entry, with backspace to remove. Entering 2-0-backspace will give you 200,000 - 2,000,000 - 200,000. Works in IE and FF. Does not need input field, just focus the drop down and type. HTML, values adjusted for ease in Javascript: 0 - $100,000 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $300,000 $300,000 - $400,000 $400,000 - $500,000 $500,000 - $600,000 $600,000 - $700,000 $700,000 - $800,000 $800,000 - $900,000 $900,000 - $1,000,000 $1,000,000 - $2,000,000 $2,000,000 - $3,000,000 $3,000,000 - $4,000,000 $4,000,000 - $5,000,000 $5,000,000 - $10,000,000 $10,000,000 - + Javascript: //Keypress storage var val = []; //Keypress manager function function findRange(e) { !e ? e = window.event : null; $('out').innerHTML = e.keyCode // SORRY REMOVE THIS LINE (testing only) //Enable backspacing if(e.keyCode==8) { val.pop(); findIndex(); } //Enable keyboard numbers if(e.keyCode >=48 && e.keyCode =96 && e.keyCode EDIT Accepted solution actually refers to this , from the comments.
