Drag and drop with 2 drop target

I am looking for an example of drag and drop where the drag item has two distinct areas that have to match up with two droppable areas. Example: I would like the blue drag item to revert unless it is dropped in a position where each of its red children land on a green area. Ideally I would like to use jquery ui (as I have experience with it), but any javascript library would be fine, thanks in advance.
