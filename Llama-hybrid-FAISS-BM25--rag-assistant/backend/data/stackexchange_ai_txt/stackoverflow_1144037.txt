Is Silverlight isolated storage treated as permanent, or as a cache?

How persistent is isolated storage - does Silverlight treat it like a cache, deleting items when it needs more space, or only when the user or application request it? There also seems to be a wide variety of means to identify isolated storage - machine, application, domain, .... What I'm having trouble with is how these all relate to the user. Is it possible , and if so how, to create and later retrieve an isolated storage file with the following properties: The same file is used, regardless of which Windows user is logged in The same file is used, regardless of the assembly version (updates to the xap). Instead the url would remain constant. This would have to work even offline (out of browser). Basically I want the isolated storage to persist across application updates, and over different users logging in.
