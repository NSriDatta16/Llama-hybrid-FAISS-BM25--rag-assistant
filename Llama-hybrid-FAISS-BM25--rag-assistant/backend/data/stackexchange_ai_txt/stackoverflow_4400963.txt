The Objective C versus Java angle has been nicely covered with the other answers. The preferences here largely being subjective. On the market/profit side, it kind of depends on what you're trying to do. Android is heavily skewed towards free or advertising supported apps. One factor in this is down to the fact that you actually can't buy apps in many of the countries that Android handsets are available in. This means that if your business model requires people to purchase software, iOS is currently way ahead of anything else. For free software it's less clear. iOS users already download lots of apps. Android appears to be growing more quickly. Probably neither are bad choices. This, of course, only factors in Android and iOS. BlackBerry has higher average selling prices for apps than iOS but probably fewer willing customers. It's also, I believe, Java based. Windows Phone 7 could be interesting, especially for enterprise developers already familiar with C#.
