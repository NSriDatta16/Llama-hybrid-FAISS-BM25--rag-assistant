Both your markup and CSS seem over-complicated, although without knowing where this is to be positioned on a page it's hard to know if that's necessary or not. At it's simplest this will achieve it: .access-slogan { float: right; text-transform: uppercase; } .access-slogan .access-slogan-number { font-size: 1.8em; } Give us a call at ###.###.### Note that you can't apply float and display:inline to an element since float applies display:block along with it's own document flow rules. You'll also note I've uppercased the text in CSS rather than in the source HTML, since this is a display artefact.
