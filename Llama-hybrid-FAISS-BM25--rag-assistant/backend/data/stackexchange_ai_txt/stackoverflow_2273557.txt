To list all the anomalies: SELECT name, count(*) FROM TableA GROUP BY name HAVING count(*) > 1; There are a few ways to tackle deleting the dups and your path will depend heavily on the number of dups you have. See this SO question for ways of removing those from your table. Here is the solution I provided there: -- Setup for example create table people (fname varchar(10), lname varchar(10)); insert into people values ('Bob', 'Newhart'); insert into people values ('Bob', 'Newhart'); insert into people values ('Bill', 'Cosby'); insert into people values ('Jim', 'Gaffigan'); insert into people values ('Jim', 'Gaffigan'); insert into people values ('Adam', 'Sandler'); -- Show table with duplicates select * from people; -- Create table with one version of each duplicate record create table dups as select distinct fname, lname, count(*) from people group by fname, lname having count(*) > 1; -- Delete all matching duplicate records delete people from people inner join dups on people.fname = dups.fname AND people.lname = dups.lname; -- Insert single record of each dup back into table insert into people select fname, lname from dups; -- Show Fixed table select * from people;
