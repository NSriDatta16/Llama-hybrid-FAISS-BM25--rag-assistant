My answer (below) said that it is not possible. I was wrong, as pointed out by @NicoleMorganErickson. Please see her answer (and upvote it!) for how to do it. In short, you use :before pseudo-class to create an element that draws a border across the middle of the cell, above the content: table { border-collapse:collapse } /* Ensure no space between cells */ tr.strikeout td { position:relative } /* Setup a new coordinate system */ tr.strikeout td:before { /* Create a new element that */ content: " "; /* …has no text content */ position: absolute; /* …is absolutely positioned */ left: 0; top: 50%; width: 100%; /* …with the top across the middle */ border-bottom: 1px solid #000; /* …and with a border on the top */ } (original answer) No, it is not possible using only CSS and your semantic table markup. As @JMCCreative suggests, it is possible visually using any number of ways to position a line over your row. I would instead suggest using a combination of color , background-color , font-style:italic and/or text-decoration:line-through to make the entire row obviously different. (I'd personally strongly 'fade out' the text to a color much closer to the background than normal text and make it italic.)
