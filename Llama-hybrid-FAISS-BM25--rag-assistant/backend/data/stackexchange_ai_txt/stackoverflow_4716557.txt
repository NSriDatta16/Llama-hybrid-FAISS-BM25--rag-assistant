Embedding an ejs template inside of an erb template

I'm building a javascript-heavy rails 3 app. It uses underscore.js, which has a very elegant templating mechanism built on top of ejs ( http://embeddedjs.com/ ). The problem: embeddedjs borrows heavily from the erb syntax, so including ejs templates in an erb template causes rendering problems with the view. Is there a way to include "non-erb" sections in an erb file? This would let me define ejs templates inside erb files. Right now I'm using a hack where I have a helper that reads the raw contents of a file containing ejs templates, and outputting that as a raw string in the erb template.
