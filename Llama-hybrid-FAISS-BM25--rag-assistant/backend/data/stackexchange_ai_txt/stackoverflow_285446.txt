Changing a ListBox selection changes other ListBox's selection. What's going on?

I've got a Windows Forms application with two ListBox controls on the same form. They both have their SelectionMode set to 'MultiExtended'. When I change the selection of one the selection of the other changes. Now I thought I'd done something stupid with my SelectedIndexChanged handlers so I removed them and re-wrote them from scratch, and got the problem. So I created a brand new WinForms app and dragged two ListBoxes onto the forms surface. In the constructor I populated them both with the following. List data = new List (); for ( int i = 0; i data2 = new List (); for ( int i = 0; i And then I built and ran the app. Started selecting some values to see if the symptoms were present. And they were! This is literally all the code I added to the form,I had not added any event handlers, I have tried it with the SelectionMode set to 'One' and 'MultiExtended'. Can anyone give me a clue as to why this is happening. Cheers
