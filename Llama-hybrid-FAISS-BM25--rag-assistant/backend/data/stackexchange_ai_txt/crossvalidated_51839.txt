Data cleaning is data cleaning. It doesn't matter whether you are doing regression (any type) or something else, bad data will mess things up. So... Are any of your DV incorrect and or impossible? Are your dates correctly coded? etc. But, if you have many time points, shouldn't you be looking at some sort of time-series model? Regression (any type) with time series data is fraught.
