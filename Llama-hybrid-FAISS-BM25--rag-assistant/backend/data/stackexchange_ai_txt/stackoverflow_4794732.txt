This could be caused by a number of different things. There are a few steps that you can add which, when performed correctly, may cause the flying men to return with goods and knowledge. First, you should scale to the printed page (code from a2zdotnet ): System.Printing.PrintCapabilities capabilities = printDlg.PrintQueue.GetPrintCapabilities(printDlg.PrintTicket); //get scale of the print wrt to screen of WPF visual double scale = Math.Min(capabilities.PageImageableArea.ExtentWidth / this.ActualWidth, capabilities.PageImageableArea.ExtentHeight / this.ActualHeight); //Transform the Visual to scale this.LayoutTransform = new ScaleTransform(scale, scale); //get the size of the printer page Size sz = new Size(capabilities.PageImageableArea.ExtentWidth, capabilities.PageImageableArea.ExtentHeight); //update the layout of the visual to the printer page size. this.Measure(sz); this.Arrange(new Rect(new Point(capabilities.PageImageableArea.OriginWidth, capabilities.PageImageableArea.OriginHeight), sz)); //now print the visual to printer to fit on the one page. printDlg.PrintVisual(this, "Code ganked from http://www.a2zdotnet.com/View.aspx?id=66"); The cargo-cult code is in the Measure and Arrange steps. Often, if you call Measure and pass in a new Size(Double.MaxValue, Double.MaxValue) that's all you need to do. The second ritual involves bumping the Dispatcher. visual.DataContext = foo; Dispatcher.Invoke((Action)()=>{;}); // bamp // print here Try these and see if it helps.
