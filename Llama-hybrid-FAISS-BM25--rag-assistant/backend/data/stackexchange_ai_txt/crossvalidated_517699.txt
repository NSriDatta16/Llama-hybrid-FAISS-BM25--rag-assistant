Computing Relative Information Loss [reopened]

I have a function that outputs a value of $y = 6$ at some datapoint. Now I decrease the dimension of that function and the updated function outputs say, $y = 5.7$ . How do I compute information loss as a result of this change in dimensionality reduction? Assuming that the first function has higher dimension and second function has lower, how do I quantify such "relative" information loss by using the outputs from the two functions?
