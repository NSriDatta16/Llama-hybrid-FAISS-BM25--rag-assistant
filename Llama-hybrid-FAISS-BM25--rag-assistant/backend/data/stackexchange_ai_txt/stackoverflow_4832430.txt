What you are trying to do is called serialization . You are strongly discouraged to do it by just reading/writing memory buffers in which your objects instances are stored. This way some unrelated internal data like memory pointers may get written to the file verbatim â€” and later, when read in, it won't be valid. Consider using some existing serialization library for operating instances of vector > , for example Boost.Serialization . You may look at this question for examples too.
