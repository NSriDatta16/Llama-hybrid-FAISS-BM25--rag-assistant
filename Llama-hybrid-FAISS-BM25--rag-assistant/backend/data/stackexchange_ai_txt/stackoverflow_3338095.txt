I would do this: 1) Break the XML into smaller files. For example, if the XML looks like this then I would create one file per article node with a name that matches the title attribute. If the title isn't unique, then I would just number the files. Since that is a lot of files, I would break them into sub directories with each having no more than 1,000 files. ... ... ... 2) Create an index table with the file names and the columns you want to search on. 3) As an option, you could store the XML fragments in the database instead of on the hard drive. SQL Server's varChar(MAX) type is good for this.
