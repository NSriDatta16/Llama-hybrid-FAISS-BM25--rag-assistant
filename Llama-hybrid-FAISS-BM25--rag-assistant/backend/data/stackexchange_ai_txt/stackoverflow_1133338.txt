While there are ways to "discourage" heap allocation of an object in code (several good ones discussed and linked to here), there is no way to fully prevent it. There are some types such as shared_ptr that I generally never want heap allocated (or perhaps a variant that I truly never want heap allocated). For these, the absolute best solution is understanding and documenting why you never want them heap allocated. With that in place, we never ran into problems because we were consistent about it.
