How are depth values resolved in OpenGL textures when multisampling?

I'm using an FBO to render my scene to a depth texture ( GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT ). When I enable multisampling in my application, those samples are resolved to a single texel, but how are they combined? Is the depth of the nearest sample stored to the texture, or the average of the samples? Is this behavior vendor-dependent?
