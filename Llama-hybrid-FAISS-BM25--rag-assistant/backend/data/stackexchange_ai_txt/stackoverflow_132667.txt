How can I disable #pragma warnings?

While developing a C++ application, I had to use a third-party library which produced a huge amount of warnings related with a harmless #pragma directive being used. ../File.hpp:1: warning: ignoring #pragma ident In file included from ../File2.hpp:47, from ../File3.hpp:57, from File4.h:49, Is it possible to disable this kind of warnings, when using the GNU C++ compiler?
