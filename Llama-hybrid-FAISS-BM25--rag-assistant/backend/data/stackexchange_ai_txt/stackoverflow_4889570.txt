WebSphere MQ connectivity architecture

What is the recommended architecture for accessing WebSphere MQ message queues across internet (i.e. 100+ ms latency) and over organizational boundaries? The two approaches that we are considering are to access the other organization's Queue Manager directly from our clients and the alternative is to have a Queue manager locally that would pump the messages from the remote queue and then local clients will access it. I think that both have merit but I am not sure of the trade-offs between the two architectures. The volume that we would have to handle is 600 per second with message size of about 50 bytes. The other org's queue manager is not changeable (and it is WebSphere MQ). The messages have to be processed in order. Perhaps they can be split between different queues and then each queue to be processed by separate client but in each queue the order is still very important. In general there would be one transaction processing client. There could be one additional business intelligence client that would process a copy of the message. Does anyone have any perf metrics of MQSeries to MQSeries queue manager throughput and a comparison of WebSphere MQ queue manager to client throughput?
