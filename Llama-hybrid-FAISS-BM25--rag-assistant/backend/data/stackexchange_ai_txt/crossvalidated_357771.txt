The shape of the eigenvalue plot is entirely determined by your underlying data generating process and will only follow a smooth trend if the underlying processes have a smooth distribution of contributing to the variation. This would be quite possible in a real world observation study, but would be unlikely in an experiment where some conditions are well controlled to provide variation greater than any background processes. If the control is more precise than the inherent variation then you would expect to see the first few pcs explain the controlled variation before a sharp drop for pcs explaining uncontrolled background processes. There is an upper bound to the number of non zero eigenvalues you can obtain, the rank of the matrix. If your matrix has fewer samples (n) than variables (v) you expect to see the remaining variance to be zero by the nth PC as you can describe the full variance of the data set by using n transformations of the original variables. If v is your rank then you can simply use the original variables to describe the full variance of the dataset, so the eigenvalue remaining is zero. Remember that PCA is just a series of simultaneous equations.
