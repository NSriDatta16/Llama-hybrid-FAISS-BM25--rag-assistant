There are any number of ways to do this, and what works for you will depend on your actual dataset and what outcomes you desire for specific articles. As a rough reworking though, I would suggest moving the times it has been read to the weighted numbers and dividing by age of the article, since the older an article is, the more likely it is to have higher numbers in each category. For example // x[i] = any given variable above // w[i] = weighting for that variable // age = days since published OR // days since editor recommendation OR // average of both OR // ... score = (x[1]w[1] + ... + x[n]w[n])/age Your problem of wanting to promote new articles more but not wanting to punish genuinely popular old articles requires consideration of how you can tell whether or not an article is genuinely popular. Then just use the "genuine-ness" algorithm to weight the votes or views rather than a static weighting. You can also change any of the other weightings to be functions rather than constants, and then have non-linear weightings for any variables you wish. // Fw = some non-linear function // (possibly multi-variable) that calculates // a sub-score for the given variable(s) score = (Fw1(x[1]) + ... + FwN(x[n]))/FwAge(age)
