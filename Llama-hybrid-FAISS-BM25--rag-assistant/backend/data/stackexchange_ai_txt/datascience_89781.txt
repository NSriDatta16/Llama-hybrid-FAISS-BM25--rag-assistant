How can I preprocess text to feed into a SVM?

I am using an IMDB dataset which contains reviews of the movies in the column text and the rating 0 or 1 in the column label . I am preprocessing the text using Tfidf using sklearn. The code for the above statement from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer vectorizer=TfidfVectorizer() X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_train['text']) Y = vectorizer.transform(df_test['text']) When I am trying to use the data for an SVM, using a linear kernel and then fitting it into the model using classifier_linear = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') classifier_linear.fit(X, df_test['label']) I am getting the error ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [40000, 5000] df_train is of the shape (40000,2) df_test is of the shape (5000,2) I am able to overcome this problem by using only 5000 values of df_train using df_train.loc[:4999,'text'] but this defeats the purpose of having a bigger training dataset. My question is how can I use the training dataset that will retain it's number of values?
