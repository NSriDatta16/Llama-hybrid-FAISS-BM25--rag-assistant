How to prevent UIWebView from scrolling past its boundaries?

I have a view with a UIWebView as a sub-view, along with some other (fixed) subviews. I want the UIWebView to be scrollable in every direction, but I don't want the user to be able to drag the contents past their natural boundaries, as illustrated here: In this image, I'm dragging the webview's contents down and to the right, and as you can see the contents go past their top and left boundaries. I want the contents to just stop right at the edges when this happens, so that no gray area is exposed underneath. Is this possible?
