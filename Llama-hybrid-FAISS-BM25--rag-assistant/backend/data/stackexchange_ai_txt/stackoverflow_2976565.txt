How request.login function check name and password? It isn't know user entity? The request.login allows to implement programmatic security and validates the provided username and password in the password validation realm used by the web container login mechanism configured for the ServletContext . In other words, it delegates the authentication check to the container and this check is done against the security realm of the webapp. This is a very nice alternative to FORM-based authentication. Authentication Without the Form has had a nice screencast showing this feature in action. If you don't want to use a file realm but a JDBC realm, check this blog post .
