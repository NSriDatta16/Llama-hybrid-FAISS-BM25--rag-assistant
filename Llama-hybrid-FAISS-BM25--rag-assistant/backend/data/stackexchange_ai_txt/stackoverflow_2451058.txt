Configure nHibernate for multiple-project solution

Im doing a project with C# winforms. This project is composed by: alt text http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/2540/esquemaw.png Client project: Windows Forms where user will call the CRUD operations; Server project; Common Project: This project will hold the models (in the image only have the model Item); ListSingleton Project: Remote Object that will do the operations on the models; Im trying to use a 3 layers style in which the CLIENT and the SERVER will be the views layer , the LISTSINGLETON will be the controller layer (where all objects are created), and COMMON project is the models layer ... I already have all the communication working, but now I need to work on the persistence of the data in a mysql database. I was trying to use nHibernate but I’m having some troubles. My main problem is how to organize my hibernate configuration. - In which project do I keep the mapping? Common project? In which project do I keep the hibernate configuration file (App.config)? ListSingleton project? In which project do I do this: Configuration cfg = new Configuration(); cfg.AddXmlFile("Item.hbm.xml"); ISessionFactory factory = cfg.BuildSessionFactory(); ISession session = factory.OpenSession(); ITransaction transaction = session.BeginTransaction(); Item newItem = new Item("BLAA"); // Tell NHibernate that this object should be saved session.Save(newItem); // commit all of the changes to the DB and close the ISession transaction.Commit(); session.Close(); In the ListSingleton project? Altho I had reference to the Common Project in the ListSingleton I keep getting error in the addXml line… And when I have 2 projects one with the models & mappings and another where ill use the hibernate (this project has a reference to the models project), how do i do "cfg.AddXmlFile("User.hbm.xml");" I keep geting "Could not configure datastore from file User.hbm.xml" When i use this 2 project structure. My mapping is correct because I tried with a one-project solution and it worked :X
