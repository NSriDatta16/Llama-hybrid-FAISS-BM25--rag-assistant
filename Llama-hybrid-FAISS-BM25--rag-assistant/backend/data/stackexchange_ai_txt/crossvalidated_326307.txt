Is it appropriate to use multilevel regression models for forecasting purposes?

I have time series data about 10 individuals. For each of them I have 120 repeated measures over time (a monthly measure for 10 years). I have a dependent variable (Y) and several predictors (X1, X2, ...). I made a two-level multilevel model, with repeated measures nested within individuals. So far I used multilevel models to see which predictors were significant in explaining Y (command -mixed- in Stata). Now I would like to use the final model for forecasting purposes. Is it appropriate to use multilevel models for forecasting purposes? Can you point me to a tutorial in Stata to learn how to do that? And to understand the connected diagnostics? Can you also point me to some literature that supports the use of multilevel regression models for forecasting purposes? Alternatively, which other approach would you recommend? ARIMAX? or others?
