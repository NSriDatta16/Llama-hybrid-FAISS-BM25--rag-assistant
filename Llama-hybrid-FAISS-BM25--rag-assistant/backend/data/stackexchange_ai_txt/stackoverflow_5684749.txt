border-radius; overflow: hidden, and text is not clipped

I'm doing some stylistic text inside of rounded divs, where the text bumps right up against the top of the container. I've been able to control almost all content, nested divs, images set as backgrounds, etc, and had them all clip successfully, but this one has been giving me serious grief. Using the old-school image borders or cover-ups is not a solution as we have dynamic graphical backgrounds. We need a solution to actually clip the text. This is mostly visible in Firefox 3.x and older versions of Chrome Here's the sample code to play with: http://jsfiddle.net/vfp3v/1/ div { -moz-border-radius: 45px; border-radius: 45px; background-color: #ccc; font-size: 100px; color: #777; line-height: 70%; overflow: hidden; width: 257px; } the jank: Notice it's been fixed in the new Chrome and FireFox 4 - the shui: Most of our site users are Firefox 3.6, so would love to be able to provide an elegant solution for them as well. Any help appreciated! Cheers
