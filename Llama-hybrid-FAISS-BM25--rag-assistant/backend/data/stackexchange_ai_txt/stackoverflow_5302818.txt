It looks like $Rows variable is an instance of type Result Tree Fragment. You can't perform any operation (like the one provided by [] filter expression) on RTF other than string operations: from https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/#section-Result-Tree-Fragments An operation is permitted on a result tree fragment only if that operation would be permitted on a string (the operation on the string may involve first converting the string to a number or boolean). In particular, it is not permitted to use the / , // , and [] operators on result tree fragments. Besides that, all the showed code could be simplified if $Rows is an instance of node set data type like this: There are XSLT processor (mostly every one) that provide implementations of node-set() extension function for RTF to node set conversion.
