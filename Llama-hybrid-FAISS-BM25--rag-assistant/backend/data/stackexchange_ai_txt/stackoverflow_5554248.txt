i have in the 1 controller (HomeController) and 1 file in the views (index), i dont no why when i get into localhost:3000/home/index this just loading and loading and in the terminal where i wrote rails s it doesn't saying nothing... maybe because the script in the controller? what i need to change to make the app works...? this is the HomeController file: class HomeController "f") search_form.field_with(:name => "q").value = @query.to_s search_results = agent.submit(search_form) site = (search_results/"a")[12].attributes['href'] site = agent.get(site.to_s) @movie = (site/"object") end end this is the index.html.erb file (in the views): function show() { var movie = document.getElementById("m"); movie.style.display = "block"; } "get") do %> thanks very much for helping me...
