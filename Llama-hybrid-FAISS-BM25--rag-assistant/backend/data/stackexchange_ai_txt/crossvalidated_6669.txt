From a theoretical perspective Questions 2 and 3 are based on the incorrect assumption that the definitions are wrong. So I am in agreement with @whuber's answer in that respect, and @whuber's answer to question 1 does not require any additional input from me. However, from a more practical perspective a confidence interval can be given its intuitive definition (Probability of containing the true value) when it is numerically identical with a Bayesian credible interval based on the same information (i.e. a non-informative prior). But this is somewhat disheartening for the die hard anti-bayesian, because in order to verify the conditions to give his CI the interpretation he/she want to give it, they must work out the Bayesian solution, for which the intuitive interpretation automatically holds! The easiest example is a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for the normal mean with a known variance $\overline{x}\pm \sigma Z_{\alpha/2} $, and a $1-\alpha$ posterior credible interval $\overline{x}\pm \sigma Z_{\alpha/2} $. I am not exactly sure of the conditions, but I know the following are important for the intuitive interpretation of CIs to hold: 1) a Pivot statistic exists, whose distribution is independent of the parameters (do exact pivots exist outside normal and chi-square distributions?) 2) there are no nuisance parameters, (except in the case of a Pivotal statistic, which is one of the few exact ways one has to handle nuisance parameters when making CIs) 3) a sufficient statistic exists for the parameter of interest, and the confidence interval uses the sufficient statistic 4) the sampling distribution of the sufficient statistic and the posterior distribution have some kind of symmetry between the sufficient statistic and the parameter. In the normal case the sampling distribution the symmetry is in $(\overline{x}|\mu,\sigma)\sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$ while $(\mu|\overline{x},\sigma)\sim N(\overline{x},\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$. These conditions are usually difficult to find, and usually it is quicker to work out the Bayesian interval, and compare it. An interesting exercise may also be to try and answer the question "for what prior is my CI also a Credible Interval?" You may discover some hidden assumptions about your CI procedure by looking at this prior.
