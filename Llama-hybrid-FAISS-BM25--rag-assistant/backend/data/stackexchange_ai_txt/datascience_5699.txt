You can easily take an existing Multilayer Perceptron implementation and modify the backpropagation algorithm to prevent weights from becoming negative. Of course, you would also need to make sure you initialize weights with only non-negative values. But you need to be aware that you are limiting the decision surfaces that the neural network can learn. So you should consider whether a neural network with only non-negative weights can provide an acceptable solution for your given data set.
