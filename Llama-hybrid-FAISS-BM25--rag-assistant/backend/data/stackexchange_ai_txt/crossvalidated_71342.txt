Normal distribution in Excel

How do I calculate with Excel's formula to answer the question: What is the probability for a student's point is less than 560 by using excel? I know how to answer the question - What is the probability for a student's point is higher than 620. The answer is "=1 - NORM.DIST(620;590;25;true)". Info: Student's average is 590 and the standard deviation is 25
