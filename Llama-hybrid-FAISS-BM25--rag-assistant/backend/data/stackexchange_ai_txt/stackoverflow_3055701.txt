Interpolation of time series data in R

I'm not sure what i'm missing here, but i'm basically trying to compute interpolated values for a time series; when I directly plot the series, constraining the interpolation points with "interpolation.date.vector", the plot is correct: plot(date.vector,fact.vector,ylab='Quantity') lines(spline(date.vector,fact.vector,xout=interpolation.date.vector)) When I compute the interpolation, store it in an intermediate variable, and then plot the results; I get a radically incorrect result: intepolated.values Doesn't the lines() function have to execute the spline() function to retrieve the interpolated points in the same way i'm doing it?
