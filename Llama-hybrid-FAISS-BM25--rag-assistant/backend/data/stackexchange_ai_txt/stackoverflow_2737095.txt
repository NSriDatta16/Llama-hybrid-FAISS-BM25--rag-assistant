how could I store data within a GUID

I have an application that I want to represent a users session (just small pieces of data here and there) within a GUID. Its a 16 HEX characters (so 16^16 possible values) string and I want to 'encode' some data within that GUID. How can I achieve this? I am really after any ideas and implementations here, Ive not yet decided on the best mechanism for it yet. I would also like encryption to be involved if possible... Thanks a lot Mark EDIT: Thanks so much for the help so far everyone, I think I must have left out WAY too much information on this. Ill try to clarify. I'm not using GUID's in the traditional sense, they are not GUID's in that they are globally unique, but they are a series of 16 characters, each is a HEX value, hence the 16^16 possible byte values. This restriction is enforced by my environment, and our desired achievement is to encrypt data of a users session (which COULD theoretically be duplicated by chance, which, trust me, is ok), such data could be bit-flags identifying products in a group of products, etc... I hope that makes sense, Ill start reading into Steganography too :) Thanks for the help guys!
