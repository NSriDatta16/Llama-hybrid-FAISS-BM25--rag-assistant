One indication of the difference between (a) $x=5$ successes in $n=10$ tosses and (b) $x = 50$ successes in $n = 100$ tosses lies in the different widths of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the two cases: Wald CIs. Even though the Wald Ci is not the most accurate kind of CI, it is perhaps the most familiar, so I will start by making 95% Wald CIs for cases (a) and (b): [Roughly speaking, the 95% Wald CI extends 1.96 standard errors (mentioned in @Dave's Comment) on either side of the point estimate.] #(a) x = 5; n = 10; q = qnorm(c(.025,.975)) p.est = x/n CI = p.est + q*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/n); CI [1] 0.1901025 0.8098975 #(b) x = 50; n = 100; q = qnorm(c(.025,.975)) p.est = x/n CI = p.est + q*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/n); CI [1] 0.4020018 0.5979982 So in (a) the 95% Wald CI is about $(0.19,0.81).$ of length about $0.62.$ By contrast, in (b) the CI is $(0.40, 0.60),$ of length about $0.20.$ Jeffreys CIs. A better style of frequentist CI is the Jeffreys interval , which is based on a Bayesian argument with a non-informative prior. This kind of interval tends to have nearer the 'promised' 95% coverage probability--especially for small $n.$ As shown by the computations in R below, the two 95% Jeffreys CIs are about $(0.22,0.77)$ for (a) and $(0.40,0.60)$ for (b). #a qbeta(c(.025,.975), 5.5, 5.5) [1] 0.2235287 0.7764713 #b qbeta(c(.025,.975), 50.5, 50.5) [1] 0.403174 0.596826 Note: With either style of confidence interval, the larger sample size leads to a more precise estimate of the true success probability.
