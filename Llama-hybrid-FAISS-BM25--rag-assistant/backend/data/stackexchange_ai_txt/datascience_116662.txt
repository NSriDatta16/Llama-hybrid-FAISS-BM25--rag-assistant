A non-deep-learning approach to this kind of problem is ordinal regression , which serves precisely the purpose you described. To apply the idea of ordinal regression to deep learning, there are at least 2 approaches: Rank consistent ordinal regression (CORAL) , a theoretically-sound formulation (see Rank consistent ordinal regression for neural networks with application to age estimation ). The empirical approach proposed by Mathias Gruber - How to Perform Ordinal Regression / Classification in PyTorch . The author of this approach claims that it gets better results than CORAL.
