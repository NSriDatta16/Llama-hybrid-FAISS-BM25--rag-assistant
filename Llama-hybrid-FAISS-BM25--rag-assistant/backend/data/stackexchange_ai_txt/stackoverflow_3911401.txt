One App, Multiple Branding

I have made an application for the iPhone but it is required to be released with multiple brandings. Eg Differernt: App Name Icons Default.png Text replaced for the app name in IB Colour schemes for all images such as backgrounds, icons etc I'm not sure of the best way to do this. I was thinking of a plist file for each branding that would have the name of the files to load eg "brand1_background.png" for brand1 but that would get very messy with the text replacement. It would also mean that all brands images would be in the package making it of larger size. Looking around a bit I could have an 'images' folder for each brand and drag it in to build that brand's app, however the text is still an issue. I'm wondering how everyone else would handle this situation as I want to do it as right as possible.
