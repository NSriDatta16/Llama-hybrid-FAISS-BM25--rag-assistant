PHP SimpleXML with xpath

I have a small XML file: Richard Barret's Articles on Leadership and High Performance Organisations I'm trying to use PHP SimpleXML and xpath to extract the value between the string element in the var name HEADLINE element. This code works: // Location of the XML file on the file system $file = 'http://10.10.200.37/skins/importscript/41802.xml'; $xml = simplexml_load_file($file); // CREATE THE ARRAYS FOR EACH XML ELEMENT NEEDED $title = $xml->xpath('//var[@name="HEADLINE"]'); echo " "; print_r($title); echo " "; The problem is that it returns not only the value but also all the array information. As in: Array ( [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [name] => HEADLINE ) [string] => Richard Barret's Articles on Leadership and High Performance Organisations ) ) How can I get it to return just the value and nothing else? If I replace print_r with echo $title; I get the word Array on the page instead of the value. If I try echo $title[0]; I get nothing at all. I've tried so many things now can't think of anything else! What am I doing wrong? Could anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!
