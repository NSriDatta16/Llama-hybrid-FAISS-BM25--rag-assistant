Making Eclipse's Java code formatter ignore block comments

Is there a way to make Eclipse's built-in Java code formatter ignore comments? Whenever I run it, it turns this: /* * PSEUDOCODE * Read in user's string/paragraph * * Three cases are possible * Case 1: foobar * do case 1 things * Case 2: fred hacker * do case 2 things * Case 3: cowboyneal * do case 3 things * * In all cases, do some other thing */ into this: /* * PSEUDOCODE Read in user's string/paragraph * * Three cases are possible Case 1: foobar do case 1 things Case 2: fred * hacker do case 2 things Case 3: cowboyneal do case 3 things * * In all cases, do some other thing */ I have already played around with the Windows > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter settings but can't find one for keeping comment formatting. I'm using Eclipse 3.4.0.
