Logistic Regression: Different Formulas between Courses?

New to statistical and machine learning and taking some online courses. I am trying to understand logistic regression in more details, and noticed a difference in the formula between the Andrew Ng course and the Stanford statistical learning course. Below I post a link image to both formulas. So the numerator is different. I must be missing smthg as I am a noob in this: $$p(X)=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}$$ and $$h_\theta(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^\top x}}.$$ http://prntscr.com/dmyvx7 http://prntscr.com/dmywgy
