There's plenty of drop-in workaround scripts to automate the bypass of the click-to-activate garbage. This was the first result in a quick googling: http://www.mix-fx.com/flash-prompt.htm Background: Microsoft got sued by a patent troll over embedded "active" content in a page. But the patent only covered stuff that activate automatically (e.g. on page load). So Microsoft add the click-to-activate workaround to bypass the patent's coverage. Standard fixes are to use Javascript to loop over all the object elements in a page and basically do: obj.outerHTML = obj.outerHTML on each one, which is enough to appease the workaround's requirements and limit the patent trolls to only a dozen Ferraris each.
