Assuming that the claim about the DOM write cycles is true, which I can't comment on, then this won't work very well. PostgreSQL assumes that it can write whatever it wants whenever it wants (even if no logical updates are happening), and you have no real chance of making it go along with the 3 triggers that you mention. What you could do is have the entire thing run on a RAM disk and have some operating system process back this up atomically to permanent storage. This needs careful file system and kernel support. This could work if your device is on most of the time, but probably not so well if it's the sort of thing that you switch on and off like a TV, because the recovery times could be annoying. Alternatives are using either a more embedded-like RDBMS such as SQLite, or using a storage system that can handle PostgreSQL, like the recent solid state drives, although some SSDs have bogus cache settings that might make them unsuitable for PostgreSQL.
