Depending on Operating System and/or architecture you may or may not write to executable pages. Check documentation about marking pages as executable or read-only in the Intel (IA-32e) manuals. The code may be located in a read only section, therefore, you may not write to it. You may mark the code not to reside in read only pages, but it's compiler specific (JIT compilers do this). Under MSVC, you can use the #pragma section to create a read-write section and use #pragma alloc_text to put functions in it.
