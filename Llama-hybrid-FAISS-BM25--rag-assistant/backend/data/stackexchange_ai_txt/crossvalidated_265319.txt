If the pooling operation is average pooling (see Scherer, Müller and Behnke, 2010 ), then it would be learnable because there is trainable bias term: takes the average over the inputs, multiplies it with a trainable scalar $\beta$, adds a trainable bias $b$, and passes the result through the non-linearity But many recent papers mentioned that it has fallen out of favor compared to max pooling, which has been found to work better in practice.
