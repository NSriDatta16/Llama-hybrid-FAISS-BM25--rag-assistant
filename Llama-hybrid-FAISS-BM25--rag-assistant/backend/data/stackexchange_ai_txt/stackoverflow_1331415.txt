Habits that help context switch between tasks easily

One of the challenges of being on a small team (sometimes even large organizations) is needing to switch contexts very often. I could be writing PHP code right now, followed by some completely unrelated C++ an hour from now, followed by HTML/JS immediately after that and repeat the process again all on the same day. Being able to context switch effectively is important, and takes discipline. What habits/practices do you follow to help you switch context effectively without wasting time?
