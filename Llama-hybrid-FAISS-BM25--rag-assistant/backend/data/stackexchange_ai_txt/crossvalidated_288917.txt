How to combine two uncertainties in estimation of (binary) classification metrics?

I have a data set with 22990 samples. I am training a binary classification model (logistic regression) and use 67%/33% splitting for train-validate/test sets. The model is 10-fold cross validated. To assess the stability of the metrics on the test set due to random splitting, I repeat the train-validate/test procedure 100 times. QUESTION How to properly report results? I have two sources for errors of metrics - one is the binomial error estimation and the second is the variability due to 100 repetition. If I want to estimate the binomial interval, how do I do it as I have 100 repetitions?
