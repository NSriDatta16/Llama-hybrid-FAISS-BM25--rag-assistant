CMS + Ecommerce - Which opensource program is best?

We have to develop an Ecommerce site with 20+ pages of static content which needs a CMS and a store or 30+ products. We use Magento or Cubecart for Ecommerce and Wordpress or Joomla for CMS sites. Which has the best of both worlds - a good CMS with Store management? I am not sure if a Wordpress CMS site with an Shopping cart plugin will be a scalable solution.. Any advice?
