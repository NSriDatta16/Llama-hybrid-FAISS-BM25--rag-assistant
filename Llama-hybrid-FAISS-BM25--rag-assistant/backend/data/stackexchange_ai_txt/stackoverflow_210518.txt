Regex multi word search

What do I use to search for multiple words in a string? I would like the logical operation to be AND so that all the words are in the string somewhere. I have a bunch of nonsense paragraphs and one plain English paragraph, and I'd like to narrow it down by specifying a couple common words like, "the" and "and", but would like it match all words I specify.
