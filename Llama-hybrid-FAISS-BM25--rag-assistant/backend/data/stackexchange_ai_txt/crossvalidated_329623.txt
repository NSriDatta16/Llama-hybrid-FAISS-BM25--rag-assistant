In an ideal world, sampling from $p_1(x_1)$ and then from $p_{1|2}(x_2|x_1)$ is a correct way to simulate from the joint. In case one of these distributions is unavailable, simulating a single step of Metropolis-Within-Gibbs targeting $p_{1|2}(\cdot|x_1^{(t-1)})$ and a single step of Metropolis-Within-Gibbs targeting $p_{2|1}(\cdot|x_2^{(t)})$ is correct. Note that since $p_1(\cdot)$ is available, the MCMC chain starts at stationarity. Note also that, if $p_1(\cdot)$ is available and $p_{2|1}(\cdot|x_1^{(t-1)})$ is available, then (a) $p_{1|2}(\cdot|x_2^{(t)})$ is available up to a constant and (b) $p_1(\cdot)$ can be used as a proposal in the Metropolis-Within-Gibbs step. In the event where $p_1(\cdot)$ is not available but generational [simulations can be produced from $p_1(\cdot)$] and $p_{1|2}(\cdot|x_1^{(t-1)})$ is available, then making Metropolis proposals $x_1'$ from $p_1(\cdot)$ and accepting these with Metropolis acceptance rate $$\dfrac{p_{1|2}(x_1'|x_2^{(t)})}{p_{1|2}(x_1^{(t-1)}|x_2^{(t)})} \dfrac{p_{1}(x_1^{(t-1)})}{p_{1}(x_1')}=\dfrac{p_{2|1}(x_2^{(t)}|x_1')}{p_{2|1}(x_2^{(t)}|x_1^{(t-1)})}$$ can be implemented.
