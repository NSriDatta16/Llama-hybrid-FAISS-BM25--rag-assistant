!important commands take over any other... so your height:500px; line will always be ignored (which is why the optimizer took the line out). If you want your div to have a height of 500px only then your CSS should just be: .divTest { height:500px; } If you want your div to have a varying height, no smaller than 500px then your CSS should be: .divTest { min-height: 500px; /* height:auto; - implied */ } You don't need the !important for this css-fragment, unless there's some other rule that's effecting the height and you need to override it. You don't need to specify height:auto because that's the default style for a div (unless of course you're inheriting something else ;)) If you're using IE6 there's a work around : .divTest {min-height:500px;} * html .divTest {height:500px;}
