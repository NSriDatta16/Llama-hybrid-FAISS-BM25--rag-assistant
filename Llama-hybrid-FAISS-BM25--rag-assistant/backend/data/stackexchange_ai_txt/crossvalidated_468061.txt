Do imbalanced categorical predictors do any harm when classifying?

Assume I want to do some, say, churn analysis on a dataset. Decision Trees, for instance, are relatively robust to skewed distributions in the (numerical) features, but are rather poor on imbalanced targets (as is standard). My question is: what about imbalanced categorical features e.g., the feature sex having 10% male and 90% females? Are classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM robust against imbalanced categorical features? If not, are there some ways to overcome this by e.g., under/oversample features or...? Clearly, if we have a small dataset it is a problem, but generally speaking, I am curious.
