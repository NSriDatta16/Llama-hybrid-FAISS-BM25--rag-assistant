Input size vs hidden state in RNNs

Im using PyTorch to implement RNNs on univariate time series data . This is the documentation for the RNN class: link I think I'm understanding the math behind an RNN cell. But I have an specific question: if $x_t$ is a scalar (and not a vector) since I'm working with univariate time series, how can I perform the operation $h_{t}=\tanh(x_{t}W_{ih}^{T}+b_{ih}+h_{t−1}W_{hh}^{T}+b_{hh})$ ? My problem is that in this scenario I assume that $W_{ih}^{T}$ is a scalar (not a matrix) since $x_t$ is a scalar, but $h_{t-1}$ can be a vector (not a scalar) which implies that $h_{t−1}W_{hh}^{T}$ will be a vector, and how can I add a vector and a scalar! Maybe the answer is simple: in this scenario a vector plus a scalar will be an entry-wise addition of the scalar. But I want to confirm with anyone that know more about the topic. Any help will be appreciated!
