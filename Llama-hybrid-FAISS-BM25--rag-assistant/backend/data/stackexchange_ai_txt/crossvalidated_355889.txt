It's not terrible but it's not great, either. Ideally, we'd prefer that the network be able to sort out what is/isn't important given the presence of the other variables. On the other hand, a large number of irrelevant features can make that a challenging fitting & regularization task, so it's hard to fault you for taking a different approach. A useful example of a prominent researcher using univariate tests in this way is described in Elements of Statistical Learning (2nd edition, Section 11.9), on Neal and Zhang's Bayesian neural nets. (Don't bother hunting down Neal and Zhang's write-up, published in an obscure text -- the discussion in ESL covers it very well.)
