Are "covariance function" and "kernel function" synonyms?

Are "covariance function" and "kernel function" synonyms? In the Gaussian process (GP) literature, authors typically discuss covariance functions, whereas in the support vector machine (SVM) literature, authors typically discuss kernel functions. It appears that both refer to the same underlying objects, as the resulting covariance matrix is a Mercer kernel: both are symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices. Is the difference in terminology purely due to the historical development of the respective tools, or is there a subtle shade of meaning that I'm missing?
