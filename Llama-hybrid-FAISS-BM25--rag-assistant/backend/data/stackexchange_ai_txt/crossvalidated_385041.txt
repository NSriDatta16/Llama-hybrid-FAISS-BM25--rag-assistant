How to compare my machine learning system results with another state of art systems

I'm writing a report of a machine learning system I built. The best F-score measures are similar or greater than another ML approaches in the state of art. However, my advisor outlines that I can't simply compare the F-score results of my system with the results of another systems in the state of art, because they don't use the same dataset I use. My question is how can I compare my results to another systems, provided that I don't have access to them, and so, I can just get values like accuracy, precision and recall from them? Thanking you very much,
