If we define $\mathbf{y} =[y_1\;y_2\;y_3\;y_4\;\cdots\;y_n]$ where $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of i.i.d (individually and identically distributed) random variables, $$\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{y'}\mathbf{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2$$ is a sample approximation for the average value of $y^2$, the so called second moment. Where $Y_i$ has mean 0, (i.e. $E[Y_i]=0$), then $\frac{1}{n-1}\mathbf{y'}\mathbf{y}$ is the sample variance of $Y$. Where $X_c$ is a univariate random variable of mean 0 and variance $d$, recall that $$\mathrm{var}\bigg(\frac{X_c}{d^{1/2}} \bigg) = \mathrm{var}(X_cd^{-1/2})=1$$ So the equation $\mathbf{X_cD^{-1/2}}$ is simply normalizing the sample variance all 3 variables to 1.
