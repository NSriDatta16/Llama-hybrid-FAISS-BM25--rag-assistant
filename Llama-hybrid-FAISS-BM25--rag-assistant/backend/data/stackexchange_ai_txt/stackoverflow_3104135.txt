How can I sense the user is holding down their finger on the screen without moving?

The best method I can think of is to start a timer in the touchesBegan event method. If the timer expires before the touchesEnded event arrives, then you know the user is holding down on the screen. If the touchesMoved event is called, then simply reset the timer so as to only detect holding down without movement. Is there any functionality built into the iOS SDK to handle exactly this? Or any better, simpler, faster methods anyone can think of? Thanks in advance for your help!
