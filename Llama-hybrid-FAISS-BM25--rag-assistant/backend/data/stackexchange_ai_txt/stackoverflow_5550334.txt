OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 shaders to compare images on Android

i'm developing a software that compare images and i need to do it in a fast way! Actually i compare them using plain c but it's too slow. I want to compare them using shaders and a couple of gl surfaces (textures), using c and not java, but this doesn't change the situation so much, and get back a list of changed parts, but i really don't know where to start. Basically i want to use something like SIMD neon instruction to compare pixel colors to check for changes (well, i need to check only the first pixel fragment color, ex. only red ... these are photos so is unrealistic that it doesn't change) but instead to use neon instructions i want to use pixel shaders to do the comparison and get the list of changed part back More, if it's possible, i want to use parallel comparison on the same image splitting it in blocks :) Someone can give an hit? note: i know that i can't output back a list of stuff, but, well, use a third texture as output is good anyway for me (if i put on the texture 2 ushorts that indicates x and y i'm ok and with an uint on the end of the texture that report the number of changed pixels)
