Unnecessary differencing or filtering can inject structure (see Slutsky Effect: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Slutzky-YuleEffect.html , https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-meaning-of-slutsky , https://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/the-ghost-pattern-a-haunting-cautionary-tale-about-moving-averages , http://www.sef.hku.hk/~wsuen/ls/immortal/y2c.html ) . Sometimes a series can have a shift in the mean causing "non-statioanarity" ... the correct remedy is to neither difference or de-trend but to "de-mean" or use a Level Shift variable/filter to render the residual series stationary. Sometimes there is more than 1 trend requiring a number of trend variables/filters ... none of which have to start at the beginning if the series. Analysis will tell you which of these three approaches differencing de-meaning de-trending are suitable for your data.
