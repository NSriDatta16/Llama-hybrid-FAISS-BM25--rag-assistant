The main downside I can think of is that AssemblyInfo.cs is the source for the various version numbers of the built assemblies. This doesn't mean that your AssemblyInfo.cs files should not be in source control (they absolutely should in my opinion) but that developers should be very careful about checking them in. Where I work we have an automated build process that manages the version numbers so only that process modifies the AssemblyInfo.cs files - developers modify a seperate VersionNumber file when they schedule a minor or major build that requires a signifigant version number change.
