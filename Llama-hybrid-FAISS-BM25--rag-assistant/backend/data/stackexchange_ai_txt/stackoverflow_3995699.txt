Although not very elegant, I might select all your distinct brands and then pick 5 at random. In this case, I expect your list of brands is not very large so the initial query shouldn't be too expensive. brands = @user.cars.select('DISTINCT brand_id') selection = 5.times.map{ Random.new.rand(0..brands.size) } # Random requires Ruby 1.9.2+ @range = [] selection.each { |rec| @range This is untested code so apologies if I've mislead.
