Test statistic for whether variance is the same every month

I have a panel of observations, where there are $T$ days and each day there are $N$ observations. So the panel is $X \in R^{T \times N}$ . The question I'm trying to answer is: is the cross-sectional variance in March higher than average? To answer this question, I have 31 observations of cross-sectional variance in March vs. 365 for the entire year. What would be an appropriate test statistic to see if the "average daily cross-sectional variance" is higher than average? I know that I can use the F-test to compare variances but I feel like my problem is slightly different. As I have a time-series of variances and I'm trying to test if the subgroup's mean is different to the population mean.
