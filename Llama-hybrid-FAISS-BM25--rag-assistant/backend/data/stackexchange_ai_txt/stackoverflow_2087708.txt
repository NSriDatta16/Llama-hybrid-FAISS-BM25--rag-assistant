Can it be the portlet cache? You could have servlet caching activated and declare a long portlet expiry time. Quoting from techjournal : Portlets can advertise their ability to be cached in the fragment cache by setting their expiry time in their portlet.xml descriptor ( see Portlet descriptor example ) 3600 To use the fragment caching functions, servlet caching needs to be activated in the Web Container section of WebSphere Application Server administrative console (see Portlet descriptor example). WebSphere Application Server also provides also a cache monitor enterprise application (CacheMonitor.ear), which is very useful for visualizing the contents of the fragment cache. Update Do you have portlets that set EXPIRATION_CACHE ? Quote: Modifying the local cache at runtime For standard portlets, the portlet window can modify the expiration time at runtime by setting the EXPIRATION_CACHE property in the RenderResponse, as follows: RenderResponse.setProperty( PortletResponse.EXPIRATION_CACHE, (new Integer(3000)).toString() ); Note that for me the value is a bit counter-intuitive, -1 means never expire, 0 means don't cache.
