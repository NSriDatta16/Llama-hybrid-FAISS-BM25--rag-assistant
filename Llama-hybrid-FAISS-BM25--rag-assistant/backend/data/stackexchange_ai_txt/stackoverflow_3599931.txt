Do you mean, that you include Debug.h after all other #include lines, and still get compilation errors in the boost headers? This may happen when compiler tries to instantiate template class, only at this point template code is really compiled. The only way to prevent this is to return to original new operator in the code fragment which causes this error. There is no chance to compile boost stuff with redefined new operator. Another way is to move code lines that are not compiled into separate .cpp file without new redefinition.
