I would encourage you to run this analysis in one model (in AMOS) and I do not think your data structure is problematic (see for example: Maas, CJM & Hox, JJ (2005) Sufficient sample sizes for multilevel modeling. Methodology, 1, 86-92.). When you run several models on the same dataset you increase the chance of making type I errors (at the minimum you will need to employ the Bonferroni Correction; which is considered to be a conservative technique).
