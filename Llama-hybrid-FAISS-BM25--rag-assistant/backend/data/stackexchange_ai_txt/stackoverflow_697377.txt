When highlighting html on a page, it colors the words blue, but doesn't give it blue background?

I have a simple page with some html. When I hold and drag the mouse to highlight a part of it, for example a paragraph, it changes the forecolor of the text to blue, it does not change the forecolor to white and change the backcolor to blue as it normally does. Does anyone know anything that would cause this, for example, a certain CSS setting or something else? Could this happen if the text, in this case the paragraph tags are on an image (the background is set to an image)? Is there a way to change what the highlight color of the text when you highlight it?
