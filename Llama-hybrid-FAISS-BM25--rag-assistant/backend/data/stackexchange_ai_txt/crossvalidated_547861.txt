Appropriate Time Series Model for Data with Shifting Mean?

I have a daily data of sales. However, as seen on the graph, there is a clear shift in the mean values starting 2010. What could be the best prediction model to use in this case? I tried using several classical time series models like SARIMA and TBATS via Python but prediction performance is not satisfactory. Thank you.
