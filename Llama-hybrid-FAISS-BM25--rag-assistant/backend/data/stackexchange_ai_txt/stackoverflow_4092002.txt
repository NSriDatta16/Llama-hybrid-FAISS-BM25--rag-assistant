"In addition, could anyone please give me some in-depth details about design database which related to time duration as problem above?" Well, there exists a 400-page book entitled "Temporal Data and the Relational Model" that addresses your problem. That book also addresses numerous problems that the other responders have not addressed in their responses, for lack of time or for lack of space or for lack of knowledge. The introduction of the book also explicitly states that "this book is not about technology that is (commercially) available to any user today.". All I can observe is that users wanting temporal features from SQL systems are, to put it plain and simple, left wanting. PS Even if those 400 pages could be "compressed a bit", I hope you don't expect me to give a summary of the entire meaningful content within a few paragraphs here on SO ...
