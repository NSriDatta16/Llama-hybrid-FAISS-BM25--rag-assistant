Not necessarily what you asked, but maybe using postgres inheritance might help? CREATE TABLE A ( ID int, column1 text, column2 text, column3 text ); CREATE TABLE B ( column4 text ) INHERITS (A); This avoids the need to update B. But be sure to read all the details . Otherwise, what you ask for is not considered a good practice - dynamic stuff such as views with SELECT * ... are discouraged (as such slight convenience might break more things than help things), and what you ask for would be equivalent for the UPDATE ... SET command.
