In fact, you can think of using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to solve such segmentation problem, e.g. FCN , pipeline of which is to classify each pixel of an image into target or background using a CNN classifier. Similarly, you can train such a CNN using images with foot region labeled as target and others as background. An interesting research deep mask may also shed some light on this problem.
