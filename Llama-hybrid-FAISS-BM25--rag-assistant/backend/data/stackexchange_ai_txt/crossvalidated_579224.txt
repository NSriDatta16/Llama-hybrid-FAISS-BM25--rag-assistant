Do I need to check variable correlation before applying, NN or random forest?

I'm applying RF, ANN & RNN to my time series data (I originally had 10 variables (date,price...etc) but I only picked date and price and transform it into time series. But then I remembered I skipped feature selection, Do I need to do that ?
