Redirect POST request and keep data. Possible?

My problem is simple. I need to upload a file directly to the correct server (which has currently low workload). Therefore I do: then i print my form like "... Now I would like to shift this step to when the upload starts, like so: this url should do a redirect to the "real" server. So that the upload page doesn't slow down loading and I have static html code that I can cache, embed etc... Problem is that this works perfetly fine with get requests but not with post requests. The request seems like to get transformed into a get request when redirecting using the location header. All post data is lost. Is this impossible or am I doing it wrong? And yes, I considered a remote dynamic javascript that prints the html code with the correct server in the first place. I would rather like not to do that... any ideas? Maby alternative uplod techniques? edit: this is the exact html code i use: File to upload: Notes about the file: to upload the file! this is the redirect code i use: if($_GET["action"] == "target") { header("Location: http://storage.ivana.2x.to/rest.php?action=test"); } this is the output code i use to see the results: if($_GET["action"] == "test") { echo " "; var_dump($_POST); var_dump($_GET); var_dump($_FILES); } the result when uploading a small file looks like: array(0) { } array(1) { ["action"]=> string(4) "test" } array(0) { }
