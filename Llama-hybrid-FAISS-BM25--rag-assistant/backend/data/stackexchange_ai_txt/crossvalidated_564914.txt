Imagine there would be no home or away. Then the probability to win would only depend on the particular combination where 4 vs 2 and 2 vs 4 are equal situations (just the players who have the segments are inversed). In that case you would not need to model win probabilities for all $n^2$ combinations of segment-combinations, but only for $(n+1)n/2$ combinations. How does it change when there is a difference between home and away? How you want to add the aspect of the home vs away situation is not up to the statistician to decide for you. You need to come up with the relevant relationships and models yourself. There are different options. In a logistic regression like yours, You might add a variable for whether the team is home or away and add it to the linear equation (like a bonus that increases the probability to win when playing home, or equivalently a penalty that decreases the probability to win when playing away). Or you could have a more refined model where there is an interaction between home/away and specific combinations of segments. Obviously duplicating the data by adding a copy while switching home and away is eliminating any information about home and away due to the symmetry in the data. One thing that you could do is remove the home/away columns and add it as a dummy variable. And the segment columns should be ordered such that symmetric combinations do not occur (such that there are only $(n-1)n/2$ cases instead of $n^2$ ) Segment Segment Home/Away Outcome player 1 player 2 4 2 0 0 3 1 1 1 7 1 1 0 4 2 1 1 3 1 0 0 ... n rows ... 6 3 1 1 7 1 1 0 So here the segment of player 1 is always larger than the segment of player 2, such that there are no $n^2$ combinations. Whether you want to do something in the model with the 'home/away' variable is up to you.
