Why is "balanced accuracy" an arithmetic mean instead of harmonic?

In the F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision (Positive Predictive Value) and sensitivity/recall (True Positive Rate), I understand that we use the harmonic mean in order to penalize extreme values of one or the other, and because the harmonic mean tends to be better than the arithmetic mean for averaging rates. See e.g. Why we don't use weighted arithmetic mean instead of harmonic mean? . However, the Balanced Accuracy score is simply an arithmetic mean of sensitivity/recall (True Positive Rate) and specificity (True Negative Rate). Why do we conventionally use the arithmetic mean for this quantity and not the harmonic mean?
