It's hard to give a precise answer of why this is happening without looking at the data myself, but a simple thing to try is to regrow the random forest without brand_penetration , and compare the out-of-bag error between the old and new forests. In my mind, it is correct to call brand_penetration an important predictor if and only if its presence substantially increases predictive accuracy, which you can estimate with out-of-bag error.
