(conditional) Multiple Event Handlers C#

A portion of my program requires a "flag" retrieval, that is I am fetching a value that is either True or False, and based on this return value two things could follow. 1) The flag is true, aka "go ahead", and I retrieve data from a database. 2) The flag is false, and I want to prevent the data from being retrieved. Now, this check has to be performed before any function that would call upon the database in question. I decided to implement this check in the form of an event handler attached to GUI objects that would trigger this data inquiry. This check event handler is called first upon necessary events, and my question is: How do I stop subsequent event handlers from firing if the FIRST event handler (my flag checker) comes up FALSE? Thanks
