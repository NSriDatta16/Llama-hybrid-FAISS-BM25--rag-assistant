How to make my app full screen on Galaxy Tab

I've been trying everything I can think of to get my app to display full screen on the Galaxy Tab. Basically, it works like the Lunar Lander example app that comes with the Android SDK. What would you do to make that Lunar Lander app display in full screen on Large screen devices like the Galaxy Tab? I'm not concerned about the quality of the graphics at this point, but just how an app created like this can fill the screen. It was basically designed to work on a 320x480 MDPI screen with images in the drawable folder and it uses a SurfaceHolder and view to draw the individual bitmaps. Any advice? CLARIFICATION: Sorry, I don't mean full screen as in removing the notification and title bar, I mean that everything has a giant black border around it and it the graphics don't take up the whole screen.
