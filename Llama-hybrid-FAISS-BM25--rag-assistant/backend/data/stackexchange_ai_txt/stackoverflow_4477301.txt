creating jobs and schedules programmatically with pgagent

Is there a way to create and manage jobs/schedules in pgagent programmatically, i.e. WITHOUT using pgAdmin ? I suspect there may be a way of doing this by writing a postgres client using libpq (in case pgagent does not support this behavior out of the box) - but I am not sure how to go about it - if I need to go down the rought of writing my OWN API for job/schedule CRUD functionality. So basically I am asking two questions: is there a way to create/administer jobs and schedules in pagent programmatically? If no, to the above question, which parts of the pagagent code do I need to hook into in order to provide my own job/schedule CRUD functionality?
