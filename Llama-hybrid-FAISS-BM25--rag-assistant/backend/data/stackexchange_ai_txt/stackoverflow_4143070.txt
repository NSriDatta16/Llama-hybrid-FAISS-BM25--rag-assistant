No one can answer this question without a lot more information... like what technology you're using to build the website, what happens on a page load, what backend storage is used (if any), etc. It could be that for each user who logs on, you compute a million digits of pi, or it could be that for each user you serve up static content from a cache. The best advice I have is to test your application (either in the cloud or equivalent hardware) and see how it performs.
