This is an important problem! I don't have a full answer but I can point you in some directions. Joe Ramsey has developed a test called Conditional Correlation Independence (CCI) for testing the independence between non-Gaussian variables with non-linear dependencies. It scales better than tests that use Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, so it may perform better than the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. Regarding mixtures of discrete and continuous variables: At one point I needed to test $X \perp Y | Z$, where $X$ and $Z$ were continuous and $Y$ was discrete. I simply did a logistic regression of $Y$ onto $X$ and $Z$, and tested the significance of the coefficient for $X$. I think this is consistent - that coefficient is zero iff $X$ and $Y$ are independent conditional on $Z$. You can use multinomial logistic regression for non-binary discrete variables. One thing to worry about is that your different families of tests will have different degrees of sensitivity. You may need to control the false discovery rate for each type of test separately.
