In general, the best approach is to manually pick out the ones that break and add them to it. Most agents that do not support gzip will simply not advertise gzip support (and therefore you probably shouldn't try to ignore them and send it anyway). For example, IE6 does support compression, however there can be quirky interactions with it. These are far from 100% of the cases, though (we use compression with IE6 clients in most cases, with only a few pages excluded due to bugs we found in testing). The bottom line is that the reason you haven't found a blacklist is likely because there really is no valid one-size-fits-all blacklist available.
