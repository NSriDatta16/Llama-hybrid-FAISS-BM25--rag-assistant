Natural Language date and time parser for java

I am working on a Natural Language parser which examines a sentence in english and extracts some information like name, date etc. for example: " Lets meet next tuesday at 5 PM at the beach. " So the output will be something like : " Lets meet 15/09/2009 at 1700 hr at the beach " So basically, what i want to know is that is there any framework or library available for JAVA to do these kind of operations like parsing dates from a sentence and give a output with some specified format. Regards, Pranav Thanks for the replies. I have looked on few NLPs like LingPipe , OpenPL, Stanford NLP . I wanted to ask do they hav anything for date parsing for java.
