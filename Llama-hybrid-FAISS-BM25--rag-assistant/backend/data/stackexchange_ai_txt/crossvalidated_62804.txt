At least from a theoretical point of view, identifiably is not important from a Bayesian perspective. If the data is not informative about some parameters under the model then the posterior of those parameters will just be highly influenced by the prior. From a practical point of view if the posterior is broad then approximate methods such as MCMC will take longer maybe much longer to run. Another practical problem is that if you have a large parameter space and little data as it sounds like you do then the results, if you can manage to compute them, are likely to be very sensitive to prior specification.
