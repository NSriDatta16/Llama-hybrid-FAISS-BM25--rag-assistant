I would most definitely have them write vanilla JavaScript. It will encourage all students to better understand the abstractions that frameworks/libraries provide in particular environments i.e. for the most part, in the browser working with the DOM. I highly recommend having a good text for the course. Object Oriented JavaScript by Stoyan Stefanov is in my mind a great text for learning the language, including some of the topics that many people have difficulty with (prototypes, objects, closures, inheritance, etc). I've read numerous JavaScript books and feel that this particular text best balances the core of the language and it's application in the modern client-side development realm. You may then want to look at dissecting certain pieces of the source of a particular JavaScript library to gain insight into patterns and practices used in a real-world scenario.
