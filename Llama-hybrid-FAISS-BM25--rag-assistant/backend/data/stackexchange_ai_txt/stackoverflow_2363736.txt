How do I store the value of a register into a memory location pointed to by a pointer?

I have the following code: void * storage = malloc( 4 ); __asm { //assume the integer 1 is stored in eax mov eax, storage //I've tried *storage as well but apparently it's illegal syntax } /* other code here */ free(storage); However, in the code, when I dereference the storage pointer ( as in *(int *)storage ), I do not get 1. So, what is the proper way of storing the value of a register into the memory pointed to by a C++ pointer?
