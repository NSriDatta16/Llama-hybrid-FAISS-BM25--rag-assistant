Why does Django admin try to encode strings into ASCII rather than Unicode? Or is this error something different than it looks like?

I've got the following error: TemplateSyntaxError at /admin/results_cop/copsegmentresult/ Caught an exception while rendering: ('ascii', 'ISU European Figure Skating Championships 2009: Senior Ladies Ladies: Short Program - 2. Susanna P\xc3\x96YKI\xc3\x96', 98, 99, 'ordinal not in range(128)') The fragment of the string that won't render is: PÖYKIÖ What I don't get is why Django is trying to render the string as ASCII, why not UTF-8? EDIT 1: I forgot to ask - I'd also quite like to know how to get rid of the error ;) EDIT 2: Bobince's answer is correct :) I had something along the lines of: def __unicode__(self): return "%s %s" (self.foo, self.bar)
