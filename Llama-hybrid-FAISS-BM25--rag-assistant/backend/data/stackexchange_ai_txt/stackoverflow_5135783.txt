Within your view, you need to create the "OnTouchListener" which should look something like this: myView.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListnener(){ @Override public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent e){ switch(e.getAction()){ case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: //and code will go here for putting the finger on the screen I would have a look at MotionEvent and looking at the various levels. You'll want to pay attention to how it can pack several bits of movement information into one MotionEvent.
