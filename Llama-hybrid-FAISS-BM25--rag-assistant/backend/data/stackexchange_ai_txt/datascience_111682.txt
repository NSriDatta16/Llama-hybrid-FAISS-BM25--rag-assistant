This is a completely plausible model. You have five features (probably one-hot encoded) and then a categorical outcome. This is a reasonable place to use a (multinomial) logistic regression. Depending on how important those first five words are, though, you might not achieve high performance. More complicated models from deep learning are able to capture more information from the sentences, including words past the fifth word (which your approach misses) and the order of words (which your approach does get, at least to some extent). For instance, compare these two sentences that contain the exact same words The blue suit has black buttons. The black suit has blue buttons. Those have different meanings, yet your model would miss that fact.
