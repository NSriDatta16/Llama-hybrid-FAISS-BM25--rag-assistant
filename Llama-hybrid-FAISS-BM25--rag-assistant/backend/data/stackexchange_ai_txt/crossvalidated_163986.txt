Logistic regression is appropriate? Forecasting playerâ€™s serve point win % as a binary variable, w/ both numeric and categorical independent variables

I effectively want to model the probability of a player winning his service point (a point in which he is the server) based on the values of explanatory variables (namely court surface and opponent world ranking) Can this be done using a binary response logistic regression? Consider the fact that I can view my response variable as number of successes out of a total number of trials (for which I have the data). Will it work considering I have both categorical and numerical explanatory variables? Any feedback on why this will/won't work or how I can make it work would be hugely appreciated! I am doing the analysis in R, so pointers on functions or packages would also be welcome!
