You know your pages structure when you save page. So, you can generate URL for each page and save it in to the database record. Then you can use {*path} rule and find exact match in database. This rule should be last in your rules definition, so you can match other routes. For example, your Page1 has no parent page, it's url is Page1 . Your SubPage knows it's parent so it can ganarate url Page1/SubPage etc.
