I guessing why are you scaling the feature before the model. as far as a know feature scaling is applied only on those algo's where a distance is calculated (e.g. k-means). Maybe this could be a improving for you accuracy model. I totaly agree with @CrazyElf , switching to XGBOOST or other algo's could increase the accuracy. then last but not least, missing values are preatty important (if they are a lot maybe there's no need to drop them, but better consider them means to catch some insight)
