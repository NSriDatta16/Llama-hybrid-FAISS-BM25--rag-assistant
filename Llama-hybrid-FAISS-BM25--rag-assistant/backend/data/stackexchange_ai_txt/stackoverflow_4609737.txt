it seems to me that there is no encoding, normalization or representation where one character would be one code point in every case in Unicode. Is this correct? Depends on the meaning of the meaning of the word “character.” Unicode has the concepts of abstract character (definition 7 in chapter 3 of the standard: “A unit of information used for the organization, control, or representation of textual data”) and encoded character (definition 11: “An association (or mapping) between an abstract character and a code point”). So a character never is a code point, but for many code points, there exists an abstract character that maps to the code point, this mapping being called “encoded character.” But (definition 11, paragraph 4): “A single abstract character may also be represented by a sequence of code points” Is this true for Basic Multilingual Plane also? There is no conceptual difference related to abstract or encoded characters between the BMP and the other planes. The statement above holds for all subsets of the codespace. Depending on your application, you have to distinguish between the terms glyph , grapheme cluster , grapheme , abstract character , encoded character , code point , scalar value , code unit and byte . All of these concepts are different, and there is no simple mapping between them. In particular, there is almost never a one-to-one mapping between these entities.
