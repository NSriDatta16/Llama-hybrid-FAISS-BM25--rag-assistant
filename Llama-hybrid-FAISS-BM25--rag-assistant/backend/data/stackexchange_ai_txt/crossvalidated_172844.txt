A/B testing where success is not binary

I am a blogger testing different ad networks. The problem statement is actually quite simple: Ad network 1: 100,000 pageviews. $460 ad revenue Ad network 2: 100,000 pageviews. $428 ad revenue Can I say with 95% certainty that ad network 1 is better than ad network 2? The sub-questions are as follows: Am I asking the right question here? Or should I be asking "can I say with 95% certainty that ad network 1 is 10% better than ad network 2?" In this scenario, is it appropriate to use a chi-squared test counting each dollar earned as a success? If we did that, it would look like this . So in dollars, there is no statistically significant difference. But if we change to each cent earned as a "success", then there is a significant difference. So this method doesn't seem to pass the smell test. The test that answers the question "Does the average value differ across two groups?" is the two-sample T-test. But I don't have individual data points here; just aggregates. Is there an alternative to the T-test that can be used for aggregate data?
