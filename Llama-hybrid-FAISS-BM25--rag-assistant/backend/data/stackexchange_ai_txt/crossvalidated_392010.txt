This raises a large number of worrisome issues. Foremost, a pre-post design is ill-suited for this type of question. It is too sensitive to time trends, Hawthorne effects, and regression to the mean. Second, an increase of 2 units has absolutely nothing to do with the way you analyze the data. It is used only at the final interpretation, or if you compute the Bayesian posterior probability of a difference of at least 2. Third, the classification into categories A, B, C is statistically invalid and clinically nonsensical. Redesign the study as a parallel-group randomized trial. If you are unable to do that, then just ask the most general question you can. For a patient who begins at level X=x (y=5-15) what is the probability that she will end up at level Y=y. To do that I'd suggest a proportional odds model to estimate the P(Y >= y at follow-up given a baseline value of x) and model x as a quadratic expression in 5-15. You are likely to see a nonlinear effect (which also demonstrates that computing the change from baseline is a mistake). You can also use the prop. odds model to plot the mean of Y as a function of x. Doing anything that loses information in the 5-15 levels is a crime against data. And using a pre-post design will not land the research in the best medical journals.
