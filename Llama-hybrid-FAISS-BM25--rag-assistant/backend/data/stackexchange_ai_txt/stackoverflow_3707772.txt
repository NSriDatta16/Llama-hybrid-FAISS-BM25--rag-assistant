I'm using MongoDB as session storage currently. It is possible to avoid race conditions mentioned by pilif. I found a class that implements a session handler for MongoDB ( http://www.jqueryin.com/projects/mongo-session/ ) and forked it on github to suit my needs ( http://github.com/halfdan/MongoSession ).
