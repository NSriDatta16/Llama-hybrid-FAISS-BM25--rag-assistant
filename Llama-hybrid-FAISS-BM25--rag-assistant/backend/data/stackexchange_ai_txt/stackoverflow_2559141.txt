custom flex component, visual controls in design view

Do you know how if you drag an or component into your Flex project, when you go to design mode you get this panel on the right to set its properties like text etc. I have a custom component that I can call with actionscript, or with mxml like this: The component takes this input and uses it for its internal operation private var field1:String; private var field2:String; private function initializeit() { // component takes the input and lays it out as needed } When I go to design mode, I can see the component under custom components, I can drag it to the stage and see it, but can't set its values field1 and field visually on the right like a normal or would have. Any idea how I can add that? Do I need to make it inherit something or anything else
