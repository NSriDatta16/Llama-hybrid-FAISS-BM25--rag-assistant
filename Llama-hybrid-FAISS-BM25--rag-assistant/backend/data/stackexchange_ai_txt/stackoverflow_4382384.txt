Reducing redundancy in data for storage in MySQL

I have a feeling this has already been answered, but I don't know the correct terminology involved and couldn't find anything in my search. I'm working on a product recommendation system. And I've got a database of items, and I'm running through and determining which items are similar. For example ItemID 1 is similar to 5, 7, and 8. The issue is the data being redundant. As I loop through the whole item set i'll wind up with something like this: 1 5,7,8 5 7,8,1 7 8,5,1 8 5,1,7 What is the best way to store this in MySQL, so I can query it and find the items related to either 1, 5, 7, or 8. In real life, there will be an uneven number of items in each set. I'm concerned with speed more than storage space, but it seems like there should probably be a happy medium, or if I'm lucky one that is fast, and saves space.
