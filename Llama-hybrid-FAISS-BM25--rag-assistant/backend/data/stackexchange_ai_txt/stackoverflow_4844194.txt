You are multiply declaring a Car type. In your main.cpp you include car.h and carshop.h while carshop.h already includes car.h . Without inclusion guards this leads to linker errors. You have two possibilities: remove #include "Car.h" from your main.cpp use include guards like this: anyfile.h : #pragma once /* ... the rest of your code ... */ In the off-chance your compiler doesn't support #pragma once directive you can always use the standard, though a little cumbersome, macro guards in your headers: myheader.h : #ifndef MYHEADER_H #define MYHEADER_H /* ... your code here ... */ #endif
