Nonlinear relationship in logistic regression

I have a binary dependent variable (infection + or -) and both continuous and categorical independent variables. One continuous independent variable (BMI) seems to be nonlinear in that the lowest and highest BMI are more likely to be + and the BMI values in the middle are less likely to be +. So when I plot BMI against the proportion that are +, I get U shaped line. How do I incorporate that into the logistic regression?
