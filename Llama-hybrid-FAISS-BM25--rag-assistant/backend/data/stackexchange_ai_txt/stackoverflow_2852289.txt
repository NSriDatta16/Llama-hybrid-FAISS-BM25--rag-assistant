jqueryUI dialog box header size

I am creating hotel booking system which requires lots of modal dialogs. For this purpose I am using jqueryUI dialog widget. yesterday I embedded it on one of the features of application but this time when dialog opens upon click then its Header is very large about 300-400px in height where as normal header is about 40px in height. Everywhere in the application it is still working fine but at only place it is giving such error. Css is also identical at all places. If anybody knows how to fix this issue then please post here. Error can view at this link of an image it javascript code is listed below which is fired when a button is clicked. $("#dialogaddSeasons").dialog({ resizable: false, modal:true, width: 460, maxWidth:500, height:400, draggable: false , title:"Add New Season", buttons: { 'Add Season': function() { $("#dialogaddSeasons #addSeasonForm").submit(); }, Cancel: function() { $(this).dialog('close'); } } }); Its html is placed just at start of body tag with other dialog widgets and is listed below.
