There is a difference between 1 sided tests and 2 sided tests. If you are testing a difference between two groups without having a hypothesis about the direction (which one is higher) then you will take the two-sided p value (significance value). In your case, actually you expect that out home living has a lower comprehending score. Therefore you should compute the one-sided p-value (not given by some programs including spss) by dividing the two-sided p-value by two. This would give you 0.072 / 2 = 0.036 which is inferior to 0.05 (the usual significance level). Therefore you have shown that people living "out home" are on average less comprehending then those living "at home". Concerning the second test, you have not been able to show that people living "out home" are more distancing then those living "at home". It may still be true (or false) but in any case with the sample that you have collected the hypothesis cannot be proved.
