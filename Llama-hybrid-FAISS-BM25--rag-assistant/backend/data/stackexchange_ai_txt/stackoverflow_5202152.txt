As Robert posted, Print2Flash will take any printable content (presumably you have some printable content displayed in the iFrame) and convert it to a flash (swf) file. From the Print2Flash website: Print2Flash lets you easily convert any printable document (e.g. Microsoft Word, or Excel, or PowerPoint document) to an Adobe 速 Flash 速 file ( file with SWF extension ). This file can be shared with users who don't have the software that created the original document (for example, Microsoft Word). You can view such files with Adobe 速 Flash 速 Player that is available across a number of operating systems. And these files can be easily published on the Web as well for fast and easy access to them from anywhere across the globe.
