I don't think you can ever call something like this an "application issue". You'll probably need to convince the DBA that this is a database issue so he can talk to Oracle support, or at least look it up on Metalink or something. You may have scared him off when you started talking about IIS, .NET, etc. See if you can reproduce the error only in SQL*Plus, that should get his attention. As for actually solving the problem, you'll probably either need to patch, upgrade, or find some way to avoid the issue. Try rewriting your query in some trivial way and it may work. I usually end up working around these issues instead of actually solving them.
