Python Library installation

I have two questions regarding python libraries: I would like to know if there is something like a "super" python library which lets me install ALL or at least all scientific useful python libraries, which I can install once and then I have all I need. There is a number of annoying problems when installing different libraries (pythonpath, cant import because it is not installed BUT it is installed). Is there any good documentation about common installation errors and how to avoid them. If there is no total solution I would be interested in numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PIL Thanks a lot for the attention and help Best Z
