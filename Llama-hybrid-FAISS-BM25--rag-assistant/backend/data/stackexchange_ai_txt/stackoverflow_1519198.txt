Django - Parse XML, output as HTML fragments for iFrame?

I've been asked to quickly put together a small system that takes a Yahoo XML feed, parses it, and creates a HTML fragment based on it. At the moment, I'm using Django to handle the URL routing, with some Python script, and outputting a bit of HTML in a (with hardcoded dimensions as inline CSS), that can hopefully be put into an iframe (this part was my half-baked idea). I've also been asked to throw in a few other bits, like something to parse Twitter XML feeds, Wordpress XML search results etc., that could be re-arranged on a page in iFrames as well. URLs would be somehting like http://foobar.com/yahoofeed/keyword/dimensions , or /twitter/keyword/dimensions,where keyword is the search keyword, and dimensions is one of some pre-determined sizings (I suppose if there more parameters, I should be passing these as query strings, as opposed to as virtual subiddirectories as part of the URL, right? Thoughts? Pros/Cons of either?). However, I'm wondering if this is the best way to do this? It does seem a bit hackish to me, but I'm not really sure. Are there any problems with the current approach? Cheers, Victor
