One thing you could try is to use a "normal" Logit, as it is computationally not very expensive. Using Lasso, Elastic Net, or Ridge can yield good results (often similar to boosting) shown here . Here is a recent code example for Logit/Lasso. If you would like to stick with boosting, you may check LightGBM as it tends to be faster. XGBoost tends to be "heavy" in terms of data handling. LightGBM (as the name indicates) aims at resolving this problem and I have had good experiences so far. Here is the link to the the LightGBM docs.
