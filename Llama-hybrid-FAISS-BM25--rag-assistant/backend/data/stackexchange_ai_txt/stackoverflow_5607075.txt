The best x86 instruction latency reference is probably that contained in Agner's optimization manuals , based on actual empirical measurements on various Intel/AMD/VIA chips and frequently updated for the latest CPUs on the market. Unfortunately, I don't see the CMPXCHG instruction listed in the instruction latency tables, but page 4 does state: Instructions with a LOCK prefix have a long latency that depends on cache organization and possibly RAM speed. If there are multiple processors or cores or direct memory access (DMA) devices then all locked instructions will lock a cache line for exclusive access, which may involve RAM access. A LOCK prefix typically costs more than a hundred clock cycles, even on single-processor systems. This also applies to the XCHG instruction with a memory operand.
