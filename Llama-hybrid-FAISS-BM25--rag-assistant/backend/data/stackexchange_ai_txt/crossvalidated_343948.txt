A related method which does not use a prior is history matching . Unlike ABC it is not an approximation to Bayesian inference. Instead it simply rules out parts of the parameter space whose simulations are never consistent with the observations. There's a recent publication in Statistical Science ( McKinley et al 2018 ) comparing ABC and history matching.
