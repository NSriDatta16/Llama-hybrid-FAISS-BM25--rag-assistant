Remote access to Django ORM

Maybe I should first give an idea of what I want to accomplish as there might be a much better solution. I have a web application using Django that manages media (Recorded TV, movies, etc). The web app allows you to add meta data to the media such as what you have watched on a per user basis and allows you to perform searches and synchronizes with web resources to get information on show times and so on. The actual media files lives on a file server, to which the Django system has access to scan and update its database. I also have several media playing systems that can play the media files from the fileserver, with the front-ends written in Python. This frontend needs the meta data to display a user interface. Currently I'm creating views with Django that present the data in XML format and then retrieve the pages on the front-ends using urllib2. What I would really like is a way to access the Django ORM that manages the media meta data from the media playback systems directly so I can have the power the full ORM there. So, finally back to my question. Is there a way to remotely access the ORM in a standalone fashion? I guess I could copy the model to the front-end systems and then give them all direct access to the database, but there must be a more elegant solution.
