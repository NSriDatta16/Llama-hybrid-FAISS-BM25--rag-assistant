Nothing practical that you could use from within flash. Different browsers behave differently when flash is not viewable (visibility:hidden or display:none). Using ExternalInterface to perform a simple query shouldn't be a real problem, unless you're planning on embedding this flash file in environments where you do not control the "allowScriptAccess" parameter.
