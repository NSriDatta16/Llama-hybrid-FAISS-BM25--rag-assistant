As @theGD already pointed out in the comment, scaling is often not needed for spectroscopic data as the features already have a common intensity axis. Here's my guess what's happening when you scale: You have spectra with very nice zero baselines. In other words, all those features outside your analyte signal are constant mean + some noise. If you scale such a feature, this noise will be inflated/amplified until it has unit variance. Just like the scaled feature(s) of your analyte signal. After scaling, you'll then have lots of noise features of similar variance (i.e. importance) to your analyte signal features. The only thing that can now make your analyte signal stick out of this "forest of noise" is if your analyte signal covers a sufficiently large number of features. But then, if you have many noise features and not that many samples, the chance to have accidentally correlated noise features increases. This will lead to noise-only PCs that nevertheless have substantial eigenvalues (if you have many noise only features and few analyte features, your analyte signal can actually end up in a higher PC!). Unfortunately, there is nothing that forces noise-only features to be accidentally correlated with noise-only features: we may have accidental correlation with analyte features. In that case the model becomes noisy (unstable). To be sure, this correlation is present also in the unscaled data, but there only a small amount of noise enters the PC/latent variable with the analyte whereas after scaling the noise is about as large as the signal from a single analyte feature. Fortunately, we do have the huge advantage in spectroscopy that we can check the loadings: if they look noisy (instead of look like nice difference or maybe derivative spectra), they usually did pick up noise. I.e. we can see when/where our models get unstable. Together, these the amplification of noise and the sheer number of noise-only features in relation to few analyte (signal) features may explain your observation. I'd expect PLS to be somewhat less disturbed by such scaling than PCA as PLS looks for variance that is correlated also with the analyte signal, but in general I'd not expect any improvement, neither, for the situation you describe. If you want to scale your spectra, make sure you first exclude uninformative spectral regions. (But maybe you should anyways do this as this dimensionality reduction will help the modeling with small sample sizes)
