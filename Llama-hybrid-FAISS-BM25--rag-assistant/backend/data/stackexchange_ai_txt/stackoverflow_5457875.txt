That is a bad pattern to use, if it is on your own server, you should just include it via a relative path (why invoke HTTP) and if it isn't, you are basically handing the keys to your site over to the other domain. To request another document with a different user agent, try the cURL library. Do not continue, for informative purposes only... If you must run the resulting PHP code (and I strongly advise you don't, and most importantly why? ) you can then eval() the response. Update You need allow_url_include on to include a URL, and it is off by default. If you enable it, you can then set the user agent with the user_agent option. If you are doing this to join a php and jsp site together, you should try and stick to only sending data between them, not code for the other to run over HTTP.
