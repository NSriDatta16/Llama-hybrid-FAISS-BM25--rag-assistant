A 'Pure' Time Series Model

Can anyone explain to me what is meant by a 'pure' time series model? I believe it might have something to do with the exclusion of external factors but I'm really not too sure. For example, the term is used here [1] (Sec 4.8), a pure time series based approach can be used to generate forecasts for the predictor variable And also in a post here on Cross Validated: consider a pure time series model with AR(1) DGP: $x_t=ϕx_{t−1}+c$ [1]: Hyndman, Rob J and George Athana­sopou­los, Forecasting: principles and practice https://www.otexts.org/fpp
