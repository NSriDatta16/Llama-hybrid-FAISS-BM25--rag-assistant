Logistic regression - Does a decision threshold of 0.5 ever make sense?

Say I fit a logistic classifier on a supervised dataset with binary labels. If I select a threshold of decision of 0.5, which assumption am I implicitly making? Is there any situation where 0.5 makes sense? This page suggests that we should always tune the decision threshold to optimize some target metric of interest. So intuitively, my guess is that 0.5 only makes sense if the metric of interest is the accuracy AND the class probabilities are equal AND the misclassification costs are equal. In any other case, a threshold of 0.5 should not be used. Is this correct?
