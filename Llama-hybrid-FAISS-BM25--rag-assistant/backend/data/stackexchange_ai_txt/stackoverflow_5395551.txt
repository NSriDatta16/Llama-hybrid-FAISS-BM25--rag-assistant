If you leave the paragraph Id untouched, you can easily show differences at paragraph level on each document. Say Document1 v1 have Parag 10,20,30, and v1.2 have Parag 30,40,50, then you can say "between v1 and v1.2, Parag 10 and 20 where deleted, and 40,50 added". This is the easy part. Now the tricky part: If the content of a paragraph is changed between versions of the document, then you must create a new paragraph for the new content (with a new id) and link them (ie, "Parag 60 is a change from Parag 30") so you can say "for v1.2, parag 30 changed to parag 60". To get the differences between the two, you need a text-diff algorithm
