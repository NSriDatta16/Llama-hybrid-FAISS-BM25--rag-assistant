As mentioned by @Ryan the LDA is a way to go but I am not sure it will provide robust results on documents that are fundamentally limited to 140 characters in length. I tried it in the past on summaries of news articles and got mixed results. One alternative idea might be to test the performance of a supervised model like SVM or KNN when hash-tags are used as the classes? As an aside if you are committed to the LDA check out the gensim and LDAviz packages in python.
