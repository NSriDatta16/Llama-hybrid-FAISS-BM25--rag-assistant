Your problem is that if the JSONP fails to load, the whole function won't be called at all. In theory, there is the onerror event for the element that you could use, but according to this question , it doesn't work reliably in IE. However, that question shows a workaround that might work for you, too: Embedding a script that sets a variable, and checking for that variable afterwards. That would be an option if you control the remote app that you are calling. If that is not a possibility, I think the only thing you can do is have the callback function set a flag like json_loaded = true; and use a setTimeout to check for that flag after a few seconds. If the flag is not set, the script failed to load and you need to act accordingly.
