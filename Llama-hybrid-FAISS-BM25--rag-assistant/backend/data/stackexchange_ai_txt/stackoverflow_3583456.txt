Simple PHP function and variable confusion

I have a couple of simple PHP functions I am using. One to detect wether the user is on an iPhone, and one to resize images if they are. The problem is, if I manually change the $var to 0 or 1 in the userAgent() function, the images do not resize, but if I change the $var to == 0 in the imageResize() function, they do. Why is the variable not carrying across from the first, to the second function, or am I doing something else wrong?
