The approach typically recommended by many experts in evidence based medicine is to convert pooled odds ratios (OR), relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios (HR) to number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). Otherwise you can rerun your meta-analysis using risk differences (RD), but they may be less mathematically suitable. You can give an estimate of the uncertainty of the pooled effect estimates by reporting the two extremes of the confidence/credible interval, referring to them as the extremes of reasonable certainty for the average effect estimate. It is always useful to try applying your findings to real-world scenarios, such as a patient at low risk of event or another at high risk. As a reference, the reporting recommendations of the Cochrane Library are always insightful: http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_11/11_9_writing_a_plain_language_summary.htm
