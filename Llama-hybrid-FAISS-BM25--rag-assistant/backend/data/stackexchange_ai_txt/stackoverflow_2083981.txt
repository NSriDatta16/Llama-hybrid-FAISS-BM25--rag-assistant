One option is to pass a delegate from your main thread to the child threads that they can use as a callback to signal that they have a message. The child threads can pass the message through the callback, which saves the message in a memory-based collection or to persistent storage, and the main thread checks this when appropriate. You could take this one step further and not have the child threads signal the main thread at all, but instead have the child threads write the messages to a database, and have the main thread check the database when it's convenient. You can even use the database (through transactions) to handle concurrency. And this gives the advantage of not losing messages if the system crashes. Even lets you spread child threads (or main threads) across servers.
