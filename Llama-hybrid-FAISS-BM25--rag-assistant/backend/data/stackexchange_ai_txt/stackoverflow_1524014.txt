Javascript Ajax Graceful-degradation, with Different Pages?

I'm starting to give a little more attention to making my javascript and ajax degrade gracefully. Which is more recommended: working on incorporating the graceful degradation into your existing code (can be tricky) or developing a different sets of pages for the non-js users. I'm leaning towards the different sets of pages, because I feel it's easier and I get to deliver the best possible results for each user type (js-enabled or js-disabled). Do you agree with me, and if not, why do you disagree? I'm also worrying about hacking attempts. For example hacker gets to the js-enabled version, then disables his js. Any thoughts on this point? I don't know much about hacking, but can this be a security concern if I go with the separate versions? Thanks in advance
