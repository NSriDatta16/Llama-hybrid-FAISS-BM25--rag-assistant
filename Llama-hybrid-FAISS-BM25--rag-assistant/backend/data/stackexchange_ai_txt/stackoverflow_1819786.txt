Whilst I agree learning a new language is a good idea - make sure you are learning them and not just collecting them. For example - I come from a Java background and I keep catching myself writing in other languages in the way I'd write something in Java and not taking advantage of the new language's facilities. I'm sure you wont - but just be aware that it's a natural thing to do so keep an eye out for if you start doing the same! As for which I'd learn; I'd second learning Ruby (plus optionally Rails if you want to do web apps) - it's a very nice language and quite an easy transition from PHP. The "Pickaxe" book from pragmatic programmers is a good place to start. If you have access to a Mac - I very much recommend learning Objective-C and Cocoa. I certainly learnt a lot by studying these - I think more than any others I felt that understanding these made me a better all round developer. As for books - start with Kochan's "Programming in Objective-C" for the language side, then progress on to Hillegas' "Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX" for the GUI side. Good luck!
