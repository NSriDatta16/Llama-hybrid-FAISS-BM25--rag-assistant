Probability of winning a game: frequentist vs Bayesian approach

Alice and Bob play the game - the rules of the game are not important, and after 8 rounds Alice has 5 points and Bob has 3 points. Every round one of 2 players gets 1 point and the winner of the game is the one who gets 6 points first. What is expected probability of Alice winning the game considering: Frequenstist approach Bayes approach I calculated probability by summing up probabilities of Alice wins at least once in 3 rounds: W = 5/8 LW = 3/8*5/8 LLW = 3/8 * 3/8 * 5/8 The total sum is 94.7% Would it be correct considering this variant as frequentist approach? How to calculate probability using Bayes approach?
