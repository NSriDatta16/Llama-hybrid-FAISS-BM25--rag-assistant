C# organizing my code

does any tool (VS extension, or maybe Resharper supports this...) exist which can orginize code in my class in some specified way? Like this : public static fields/properties private static fields/properties public fields/properties private fields/properties constructors public static methods private static methods public methods private methods etc (and all are sorted alphabetically) It would be so nice... I like to have my code very organized, but sometimes I do not follow my own rules and than reorganizing everything by hands may be a little bit problematic )
