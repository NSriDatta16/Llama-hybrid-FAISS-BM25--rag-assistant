Unable to push a directory over smart-http

I've been going a this for two days in a row now, and I'm giving up on finding the solution all by myself. I am trying to set up Redmine on a server - that part went well. I am also trying to install a git repository, but although I've been able to clone and pull perfectly well via SSH, I'm having a rough time doing the same over HTTP. First of all, here is the verbose git push error: ================================================================ $ GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push http://192.168.0.13/gitweb/Project master * Couldn't find host 192.168.0.13 in the _netrc file; using defaults * About to connect() to 192.168.0.13 port 80 (#0) * Trying 192.168.0.13... * 0x20ab4f0 is at send pipe head! * Connected to 192.168.0.13 (192.168.0.13) port 80 (#0) GET /gitweb/Project/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: git/1.7.4.3282.g844cb Host: 192.168.0.13 Accept: / Pragma: no-cache The requested URL returned error: 403 Expire cleared Closing connection #0 Couldn't find host 192.168.0.13 in the _netrc file; using defaults About to connect() to 192.168.0.13 port 80 (#0) Trying 192.168.0.13... * 0x20ab4f0 is at send pipe head!

I reckon you'll also be interested in apache's configuration: ================================================================ ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost [...snip...] PerlLoadModule Apache::Redmine SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/cache/git/ SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/ DAV on AuthType Basic AuthName "Git Repository" Require valid-user PerlAccessHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::access_handler PerlAuthenHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::authen_handler RedmineDSN "DBI:mysql:database=redmine;host=localhost" RedmineDbUser "redmine" RedmineDbPass "XXXXXXX" RedmineGitSmartHttp yes Alias /gitweb/ "/var/cache/git/public/" Order deny,allow Deny from all Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Allow from 127.0.0.1 Allow from localhost ================================================================ So if someone would be so kind as to give me a hint about what to do, I'd really be grateful. Thanks in advance!
