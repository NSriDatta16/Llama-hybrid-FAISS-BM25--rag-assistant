You can create a process with a known name. Then when the application starts you could get a list with all the processes that are running. If the process is not there you can start it, if it's already there you can kill the process and exit. A more elegant solution would be as Max suggested to use a Mutex to communicate between the processes. For example to be sure that you don't kill another process with the same name.
