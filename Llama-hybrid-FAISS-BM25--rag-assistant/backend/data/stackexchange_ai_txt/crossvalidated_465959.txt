Can we derive the standard normal distribution function from specification of convolution?

In this article , the following is said: Why is the normal distribution so important? Because it is its own convolution with itself, is why. If you average many similar things, what you get has to be a fixed point of the "averaging" operation, which for a probability density function is the same thing as taking a convolution with itself. And that fixed point is the normal distribution (under some technical conditions), and it also maximizes the entropy for the same reason, and so on. This feature of the distribution can be formalized as, of course, a differential equation: â€²()+()=0. How do we use the fact that $f$ is the convolution-preserving map to get to the above differential equation?
