Linker error: Unresolved external '__Fastcall_Advgrid::TAdvstringGrid::AutosizeCol......referenced from ...name.OBJ

I was compiling a project, and this project has a unit called Gamespaceframe, the header file was as follow: : #include "Advdgrid.hpp" : and the .cpp was as follow: : #Pragma link "Advdgrid" : When I recompiled this project, I got this linker error: Linker error: Unresolved external '__Fastcall_Advgrid::TAdvstringGrid::AutosizeCol(const int, const int) referenced from C:\MHSS\Gamespaceframe.OBJ. Any help or comment is appreciated, Thanks in advance, Regards, David.
