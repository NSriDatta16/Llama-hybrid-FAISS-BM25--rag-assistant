raphael.js is a lightweight rendering tool for javascript (MIT licensed) which works in FF, Safari, Chrome and IE6+. It uses SVG for the first 3 and VML for IE but the API is identical across browsers and very sweet. http://raphaeljs.com/ e.g. // Creates canvas 320 Ã— 200 at 10, 50 var paper = Raphael(10, 50, 320, 200); // Creates circle at x = 50, y = 40, with radius 10 var circle = paper.circle(50, 40, 10); // Sets the fill attribute of the circle to red (#f00) circle.attr("fill", "#f00"); // Sets the stroke attribute of the circle to white circle.attr("stroke", "#fff"); I've used it to draw a line while dragging and can vouch for its ease of use
