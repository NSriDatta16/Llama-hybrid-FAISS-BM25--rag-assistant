Neural networks - input values

I have a question that may be trivial but it's not described anywhere i've looked. I'm studying neural networks and everywhere i look there's some theory and some trivial example with some 0s and 1s as an input. I'm wondering: do i have to put only one value as an input value for one neuron, or can it be a vector of, let's say, 3 values (RGB colour for example)?
