Sorry, I do not think that it's possible :) Why do we need measure theory, $\sigma$ -algebras, Borel sets? Because: simplest case: the sample space is finite, $\Omega=\{\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n\}$ , there is a finite number of events (subsets in $\Omega$ ), $2^n$ , every subset is "measurable", for example yon can just count its elements; hardest case: the sample space is uncountable, there are more subsets than real numbers, there are infinitely many nonmeasurable subsets. For example, if $\Omega=[0,1]$ and every $\omega$ (point) is equally likely, than $P(\omega)=0$ , $P([0,a])=a$ , where $a$ is the length of $[0,a]$ , but there are subsets "without length", e.g. Vitali sets . See here . This is why you need a $\sigma$ -algebra of Borel sets (much smaller than the collection of all subsets of an uncountable sample space), because Borel sets are just open intervals, therefore measurable. But uncountable sets are somewhat contrary to geometric intuition. For example, you can't draw a Venn diagram with as many points as there are in $[0,1]$ , there are as many points in $[0,1]$ (a segment) as in $\{(x,y):x\in[0,1],y\in[0,1]\}$ (a rectangle). My advice: try reading Shiryaev, Probability . In the first chapter he considers sample spaces whith a finite number of elementary events, algebras (not $\sigma$ -algebras) which are (finite) collections of all the subsets of a sample space, their generation by decomposition of a sample space, then random variables, randow walk, martingales, Markov chains in this simple context. In the following chapters he extends what you have learned to uncountable sample spaces and $\sigma$ -algebras. I think that this is a lot easier than learning random variables etc. starting with $\sigma$ -algebras and Borel sets.
