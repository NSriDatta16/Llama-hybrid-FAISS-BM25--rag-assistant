Using different timesteps for training data and target value

I would like to know whether it's wrong; when working with time series data; to use daily prices as features and the price after 3 days as target. Is this correct or should I use the next-day price as target and after training; predict 3 times; each time for one more day ahead(using the predicted value as a new feature) Will these 2 approaches give similar results?
