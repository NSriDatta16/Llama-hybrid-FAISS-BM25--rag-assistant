To add some more ways: You can write a custom Test listener and add it to the XML file . In that listener you can access the $testResult->time() . Some lines in your phpunit.xml and a 10 line PHP class. Not too much hassle. class SimpleTestListener implements PHPUnit_Framework_TestListener { public function endTest(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, $time) { printf("Test '%s' ended and took %s seconds.\n", $test->getName(), $test->time() ); } } If you generate a junit.xml anyways (for CI or while creating code coverage) all the numbers are there anyways and with a simple XSLT you can make those even more readable. Example junit.xml DemoTest::testFail Failed asserting that &lt;boolean:false&gt; is true. /home/edo/foo.php:9 and with an transformation like this: Tests : Failed ! you get lines showing you: testPass : 0.003801 (the HTML is just an example, it should be easily adaptable). Referencing my own blog post here: https://edorian.github.io/2011-01-19-creating-your-custom-phpunit-output.formats/ for the xslt stuff.
