How should I organize my mvc templates?

In the new version of MVC we have been given display and editor templates. I was wondering how to make the best possible use of these. I was at first thinking in the line of creating one for a collection and one for an item in the case I want to display either as a list or single but it does not really make sense to me. I'll show you what I mean and please comment if this is wrong. I have trouble figuring it out myself. >" %> item) %> So in my tiny reality that would for every item in the model search for a display template for DisplayPhoneModel. That display template could then simply look like. " %> x.PhoneType) %>&nbsp; x.PhoneNumber) %> So, question is if there is a better way to handle this? Am I at all on the right path?
