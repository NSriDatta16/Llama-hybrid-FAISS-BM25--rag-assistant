Visual Studio 2008, Multiple Monitors, "find" window placement problem

(another post here reminded me of this annoyance! this is not a dup!) I use VS2008 with multiple monitors. I have VS open on one and the app I'm debugging, reference pages, etc.. on the other. The problem is when I open a find window (Ctrl-F or click on the "Find in Files" icon) the window opens smack-dab in the middle of the two screens: half on one, half on the other. Every time. It's fairly useless in that position, so then I have to drag it somewhere else. How do I convince Visual Studio to put the window on one screen, or the other? I don't care which, just not split across both. followup Moving the window doesn't help. The position isn't remembered And yes, it happens every single time.
