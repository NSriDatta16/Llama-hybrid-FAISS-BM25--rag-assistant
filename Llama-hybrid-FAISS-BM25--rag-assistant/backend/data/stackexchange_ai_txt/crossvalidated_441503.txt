Dealing with outliers when Inter Quartile Range is 0

I am working with Classification Machine Learning problems and have come across a problem where I have 0 IQR for my data. No matter what technique I use, square root , cube root , log transform I still get the same IQR (obviously it is used to scale the data uniformly). How do I get rid of outliers in my data. Below is the Value Counts for the data. Amount Number of People 360.0 843 180.0 66 480.0 23 300.0 20 240.0 8 84.0 7 120.0 4 36.0 3 60.0 3 12.0 2 350.0 1 6.0 1 In this data, Q1 = Q3 = 360 making IQR =0
