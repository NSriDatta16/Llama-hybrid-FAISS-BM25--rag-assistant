This is absolutely impossible! The number of possible matrices is 2 140 , which is around 1.4e42. However, consider the following... If you were to generate two 14-by-10 matrices at random, the odds that they would be the same are 1 in 1.4e42. If you were to generate 1 billion unique 14-by-10 matrices, then the odds that the next one you generate would be the same as one of those would still be exceedingly slim: 1 in 1.4e33. The default random number stream in MATLAB uses a Mersenne twister algorithm that has a period of 2 19936 -1. Therefore, the random number generator shouldn't start repeating itself any time this eon. Your approach should be thus: Find a computer no one ever wants to use again. Give it as much storage space as possible to save your results. Install MATLAB on it and fire it up. Start computing matrices at random like so: while true newMatrix = randi([0 1],14,10); %# Process the matrix and output your results to disk end Walk away Since there are so many combinations, you don't have to compare newMatrix with any of the previous matrices since the length of time before a repeat is likely to occur is astronomically large. Your processing is more likely to stop due to other reasons first, such as (in order of likely occurrence): You run out of disk space to store your results. There's a power outage. Your computer suffers a fatal hardware failure. You pass away. The Earth passes away. The Universe dies a slow heat death . NOTE: Although I injected some humor into the above answer, I think I have illustrated one useful alternative. If you simply want to sample a small subset of the possible combinations (where even 1 billion could be considered "small" due to the sheer number of combinations) then you don't have to go through the extra time- and memory-consuming steps of saving all of the matrices you've already processed and comparing new ones to it to make sure you aren't repeating matrices. Since the odds of repeating a combination are so low, you could safely do this: for iLoop = 1:whateverBigNumberYouWant newMatrix = randi([0 1],14,10); %# Generate a new matrix %# Process the matrix and save your results end
