Your syntax is ok, but the problem of not-working-class-balance is fairly common in machine learning; in a way, the removal of some objects from the bigger class is an only method guaranteed to work, still it may be a source of error increase, and one must be careful to do it in an intelligent way (in SVM the potential support vectors should have the priority - of course now there is a question how to locate them). You may also try to boost the weights over simple length ratio, lets say ten-fold, and check if it helped even a little or luckily rather overshoot the imbalance to the other side.
