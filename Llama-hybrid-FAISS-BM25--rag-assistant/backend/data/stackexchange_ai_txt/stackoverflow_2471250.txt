How to extract a Date from an SQLDateTime object in Mathematica

I am trying to do a plot of a time series with DateListPlot . I want to feed it a time series I obtain from an SQL database. When I retrieve the time series the list is composed of SQLDateTime entries that DateListPlot doesn't understand. In[24]:= t=SQLExecute[conn, "select timestamp,value from timeseries order by timestamp asc"] Out[24]={{SQLDateTime[{2010,1,1}],12.3},{SQLDateTime[{2010,1,2}],12.51}} Doesn't work: In[25]:= DateListPlot[t] DateListPlot requires a Date tuple and doesn't understand SQLDateTime. What can I do?
