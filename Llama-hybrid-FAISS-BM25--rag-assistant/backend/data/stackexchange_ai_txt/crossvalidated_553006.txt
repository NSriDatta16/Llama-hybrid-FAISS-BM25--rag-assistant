Multiple comparisons correction methods

I come from a primarily Bayesian background; in my new role at a social networking company, we exclusively use Frequentist statistics and by in large it's in an A/B testing capacity. Often, we'll look at multiple treatments and groups simultaneously. It was discussed that if you set alpha to 0.05 and test 100 combinations of groups and treatments, you can expect 5 type I errors. So naturally I googled multiple comparisons and found that there are several approaches such as the Bonferroni correction (among others.) What I couldn't tell, from ignorance on my own part, is (A) which of these methods are principled versus heuristic in nature? And (B) what's the method that generalizes best across various contexts in an A/B test environment?
