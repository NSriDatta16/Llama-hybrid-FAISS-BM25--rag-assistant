How to download a Jupyter Notebook from GitHub?

This is a fairly basic question. I am working on a data science project inside of a Pandas tutorial. I can access my Jupyter notebooks through my Anaconda installation. The only problem is that the tutorial notebooks (exercise files) are on GitHub. My question: how do I download the exercise files from GitHub and then have them display in the Jupyter notebook section on my computer so that I can use them interactively? I am very new to Jupyter Notebooks. So far, I have been using PyCharm to execute all of my code.
