VS has the tendency to lose windows and sometime to reset menu mappings to have minimal amount of actually useful commands. Whenever that happens, you can dig them back via Tools|Customize -> Commands. Look in different categories, for example Autos is in Debug. From here you can drag the command onto menu or toolbar. In the Customize window there is also good-to-have-on checkbox "Show shortcuts".
