For data fields -- just don't use them. You can do some tricks like giving them crazy names to discourage their use, but that won't stop people. The only real way to do it is to make another private struct that is accessed by a void pointer by your library functions. For private functions -- use file static functions. Put all of your library functions in one C file and declare the ones that you want to be private as static and don't put them in any header files.
