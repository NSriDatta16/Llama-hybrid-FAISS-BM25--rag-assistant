Volatility of x and y variables in linear regression?

I have a simple regression with price returns: $r_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta r_t + \epsilon$ My question is: do I need to do anything if $r_{t+1}$ and $r_t$ are over different horizons? Suppose the x-variable is a one month return but the y-variable is a 1-day return: do I need to adjust the variables to account for the different volatilities? Edit: In response to the current set of questions: Imagine that we have two time series $r_{monthly}$ with rolling monthly returns (sampled daily) and $r_{daily}$ with daily returns. And then we have the simple regression: $r_{daily, t+1} = \alpha + \beta r_{monthly, t} + \epsilon$ So we are predicting the next day return with the preceding monthly return. These returns are of different volatilities (assuming returns are gaussian, by the square-root of time rule ). Should I do a transformation to normalize the volatilities before running the regression?
