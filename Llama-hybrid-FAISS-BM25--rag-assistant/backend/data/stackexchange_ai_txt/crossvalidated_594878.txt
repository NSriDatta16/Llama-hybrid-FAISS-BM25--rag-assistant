The sentence said by @Wayne summarizes it pretty well - "Any time that you can legitimately make stronger assumptions, you can obtain stronger results". Though, a bit more detail can be added to why CNNs are superior models for image data compared to the multi-layer perceptron. Fully connected layers are the fundamental components of a multiplayer perceptron, the simplest form of an artificial neural network. Often times, the final component in a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a fully connected layer because it performs the regression or classification task. The components at the start of a neural network typically serve the purpose of reducing the inputs to a more digestible form for classification, regression, etc. In the context of a CNN, one of the most important components is the convolution operation and its job is to reduce the image to a more suitable form. For the convolution operation, the input image is convolved with a filter to produce a new image, called a feature map, which reveals the parts of the input that are most similar to the filter. For example, say we want to automate the detection of hemocyanin particles in microscopy images via a CNN model. One thing a CNN might learn to do is to convolve the input image with a filter that looks like a hemocyanin particle. The pixels in the feature map will be brighter in the regions of the image that contain hemocyanin particles. It's pretty straight forward to see why the reduced image is more useful for detection than the original. This is the advantage of a CNN.
