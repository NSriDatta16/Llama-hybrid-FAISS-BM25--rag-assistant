Sunil, This can't be done at install time, but it can be done on the first run... This can be done by adding the following in your onCreate() method of your first Activity . if (!Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)){ Log.d("MyApp", "No SDCARD"); } else { File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+File.separator+"MyAppFolder"); directory.mkdirs(); } Good luck!
