It is different things. Lets look to each of it. ' EndpointAddress provides a unique network address that a client uses to communicate with a service endpoint'. The endpoint address belongs to the service endpoint, which also contains the binding, contract and behaviors for the endpoint. The endpoint address for a service can be specified either imperatively using code or declaratively through configuration. Defining endpoints in code is usually not practical because the bindings and addresses for a deployed service are typically different from those used while the service is being developed . It is more practical to define service endpoints using configuration. In cases when do you need multiple endpoints defined in your configuration - you can manually instantiate Client using endpoint Name attribute instead of endpoint address. ' WebGetAttribute indicates that a service operation is logically a retrieval operation and that it can be called by the REST programming model'. The WebGetAttribute attribute is applied to a service operation in addition to the OperationContractAttribute and associates the operation with a UriTemplate as well as the HTTP protocol Get verb. Here is great post about REST / SOAP endpoints for a WCF service where you can see how to configure endpoints for both technologies and how to use WebGetAttribute.
