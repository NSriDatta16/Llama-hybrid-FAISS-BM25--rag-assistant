From your question it seems like your only option is to use different tags (since you've excluded everything else). You could write an entire paragraph in h6 or something. Your response to Kobi seems rude to me and not helpful. You're only telling people what you don't want, but maybe if you told us what you do want, you'd get better answers. The only thing I'm seeing is you really want the solution to be IE6 compatible. I don't see how that excludes all the other options you've decided don't work for you.
