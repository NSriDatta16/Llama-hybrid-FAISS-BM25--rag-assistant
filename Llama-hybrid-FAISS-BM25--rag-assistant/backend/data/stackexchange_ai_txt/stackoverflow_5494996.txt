How to detect multi-touch in sequence?

I tried to trace multi-touch in sequence, here what I did: 1.Create a cocos2d app 2.Enable multi-touch 3.Add code in touchesBegin: - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; for (int i = 0; i I tried the "[touches allObjects]" at first, but that requires the multi-touch to take place at the same time. What I want here is to receive multi-touch on at a time. So I used [event allTouches]; 4.I tested the code by putting on my finger one at a time, but the output sequence seems raomdom (first finger with small xVal and second with big xVal, interval is bigger than 2s): result 1: 2011-03-31 10:54:35.847 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 58.0, 458.0 2011-03-31 10:54:38.045 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 56.0, 453.0 2011-03-31 10:54:38.046 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 2 930.0, 429.0 result 2: 2011-03-31 10:55:11.659 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 86.0, 415.0 2011-03-31 10:55:13.378 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 965.0, 409.0 2011-03-31 10:55:13.380 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 2 84.0, 413.0 result 3: 2011-03-31 10:55:32.991 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 76.0, 453.0 2011-03-31 10:55:34.630 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 877.0, 430.0 2011-03-31 10:55:34.631 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 2 76.0, 455.0 result 4: 2011-03-31 10:55:45.960 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 94.0, 440.0 2011-03-31 10:55:47.134 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 1 92.0, 438.0 2011-03-31 10:55:47.136 MultiTouchDemo[2788:207] allTouches 2 934.0, 358.0 So you can see the index of the 2nd finger in the [allTouches allObjects] seems to change all the time. If I want to make a game support multi-player on a single device, and I want to trace the move they perform, how could I do this with all this random pos? Hope someone can help me, thanks^_^
