Average value paradox - What is this called?

I have a dataset. Say $10$ observations and $3$ variables: obs A B C 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 3 1 0 1 4 1 1 0 5 1 0 1 6 1 0 0 7 1 1 0 8 0 0 1 9 0 1 1 10 0 1 1 Say that is $10$ customers who have bought ( 1 ) or not ( 0 ) in each category A, B, C . There are $16$ ones there so these $10$ customers buy into $1.6$ product categories on average. Note customers can buy into more than one of A, B and C. If I look at only those who buy A , there are $5$ customers who have bought into $9$ product categories, so that's $1.8$ on average. B is $9/5$ again, or $1.8$. C is $10/6 = 1.67.$ All of them above $1.6.$ which seems strange. I understand it but need to explain this to marketing next week and so need help! What is this thing called? I know it's not Simpson's paradox. To me it feels similar in logic to the Monty Hall problem and conditional probability.
