I have the same problem, and I'm thinking about solving this in another way. I think the pickle module is done exactly for something like this (serialization on python objects) Example (this one is for dumping to file... but I think it's easily changeble for db storage) Saving: # Save a dictionary into a pickle file. import pickle favorite_color = { "lion": "yellow", "kitty": "red" } pickle.dump( favorite_color, open( "save.p", "w" ) ) Loading: # Load the dictionary back from the pickle file. import pickle favorite_color = pickle.load( open( "save.p" ) ) IMHO I think this way is more elegant and safer(it works for any python object). That's my 2 cents UPDATE: After doing a bit of search on my idea , they show some gotchas on my solution ( I can't make sql searches on that field). But I still think that it's a decent solution (if you don't need to search that field.
