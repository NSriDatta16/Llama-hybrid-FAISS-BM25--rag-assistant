Display specific products on a CMS page

Could someone help me with some code to display specific products on a Magento CMS page? The idea being that I build a page that has multiple sections on it (sections meaning a heading, some intro text and a small handful of products) and the user can add a selection of the displayed products to their cart from this page. Ideally, the products should be displayed in the grid format, and I should be able to display between 1 and 6 products in each section. I am using Magento 1.4.0.1 currently. Cheers!
