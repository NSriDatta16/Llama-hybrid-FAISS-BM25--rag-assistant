Expanding a Region will expand children in Visual Studio

I am developing an ASP.NET Ajax form, and decided to make most of the site in one page, because it isn't a very involved site (it's more of a form). In the codebehind, I have been making my code more organized by adding regions to it (inside are the click events of the controls, etc). When I expand a region, all the subroutines and child regions are expanded. Is there an option in Visual Studio to prevent this from happening? I'd like to be able to expand a region, and then expand the region or subroutine I'd like to edit, rather than contracting all the subroutines and child regions to prevent me from getting distracted by my fat code. :)
