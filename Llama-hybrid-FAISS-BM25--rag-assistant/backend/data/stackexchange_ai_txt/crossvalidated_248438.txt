Label encoding for high-cardinality features in boosted decision trees - what to do with unseen labels?

I have a categorical feature with very high-cardinality (on the order of 1000s of unique IDs). RIght now, I am using label encoding along with XGBoost, because from what I understand, decision trees don't require dummy encoding of categorical variables. Let's say I train my model, and then when generating predictions, my high-cardinality feature contains an unseen label. If the model has been trained on a categorical feature with labels 1 through 100, what happens when I need to predict on something with a label of 101. Ideally I'd like XGBoost to default to the most likely value given the sample it was trained on. What is the best way to deal with this type of situation?
