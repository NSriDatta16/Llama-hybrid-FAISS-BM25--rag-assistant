How to tune the parameters of ANN in R?

I tried below code where I used method as 'mxnet': classifier = train(form = Survived ~ ., data = training_set_scaled, method = 'mxnet') From this code I got output: Neural Network 713 samples 8 predictor 2 classes: '0', '1' No pre-processing Resampling: Bootstrapped (25 reps) Summary of sample sizes: 713, 713, 713, 713, 713, 713, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: layer1 dropout Accuracy Kappa 1 0.00 0.6220221 0.234515267 1 0.35 0.6220221 0.234515267 1 0.70 0.6220221 0.234515267 3 0.00 0.3931104 -0.002267395 3 0.35 0.3931104 -0.002267395 3 0.70 0.3931104 -0.002267395 5 0.00 0.3798166 -0.119003962 5 0.35 0.3798166 -0.119003962 5 0.70 0.3798166 -0.119003962 Tuning parameter 'layer2' was held constant at a value of 0 Tuning Tuning parameter 'momentum' was held constant at a value of 0.9 Tuning parameter 'activation' was held constant at a value of relu Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. The final values used for the model were layer1 = 1, layer2 = 0, layer3 = 0, learning.rate = 2e-06, momentum = 0.9, dropout = 0 and activation = relu. But the problem with this code is, its not giving high accuracy. Is there any solution to this to find out the optimal hyperparameter of neural network in R ?
