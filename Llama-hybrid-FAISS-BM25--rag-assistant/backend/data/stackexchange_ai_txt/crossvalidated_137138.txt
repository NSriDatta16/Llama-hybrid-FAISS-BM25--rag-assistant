Slope estimate dependent on covariance?

I am trying to perform a linear regression with equal errors on x and y (ex =1 and ey=1) in a Bayesian framework (using WinBugs). Using Winbugs (solid line in the Figure), I managed to reproduce the estimate calculated with an Orthogonal Regression ( deming function in R, dotted line in the Figure) ` However, if I set ex=ey=100 the regression results in WinBugs change while with the deming function do not (as it should be). What am I not understanding? Is this a 'problem' intrinsic of the Bayesian approach? Here the code used to calculate the Orthogonal Regression with the deming function # -------------------------------------------- GENERATE ARTIFICIAL DATA ---------------------------------------- A a1 (Intercept) 0.0664332 > b1 x 0.0009596685 > a100 (Intercept) 0.0664332 > b100 x 0.0009596685
