You may be referring to OLE, which is heavily used in Office documents. From the wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a technology developed by Microsoft that allows embedding and linking to documents and other objects. For developers, it brought OLE Control eXtension (OCX), a way to develop and use custom user interface elements. On a technical level, an OLE object is any object that implements the IOleObject interface, possibly along with a wide range of other interfaces, depending on the object's needs. That website will initially look to be unrelated to your question, however, It's what is being used. If you want to skip the meat, scroll right down to the bottom where you'll find an 'external link' to: http://www.pldaniels.com/ripole/ ripOLE is a small program/library designed to pull out attachments from OLE2 data files (ie, MS Office documents). ripOLE is BSD licenced meaning that commercial projects can also use the code without worry of licence costs or legal liabilities.
