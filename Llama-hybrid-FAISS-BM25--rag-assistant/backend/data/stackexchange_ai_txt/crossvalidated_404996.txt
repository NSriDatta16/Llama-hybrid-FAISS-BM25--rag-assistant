Dummy/baseline models for time series forecasting

I am working on an evaluation of time series forecasting models in Python, more specifically with statsmodels, scikit-learn and tensorflow. I think it makes sense to first compare the model performance to a set of "trivial" models. What are examples of such baseline models typically used? Are there existing implementations? (E.g., is there something analogous to scikit-learn DummyClassifier for time series forecasts?)
