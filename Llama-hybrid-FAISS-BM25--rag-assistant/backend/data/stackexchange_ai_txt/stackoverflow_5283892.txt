I don't know any of these software you mentioned. But i can say in general if a software itsself recommends to use one single database for it you should do it. I had a similar problem with my wordpress blogs database and another organisational software i installed. The next day all my blogs content was gone forever. It could be, that for example the software just throws all existing tables away. So my answer (or better advice) is. Be careful and if you can avoid it, don't throw together two applications in one database. For the user-table thing you could probably just change one of the systems to use only the user-table of the other system. So nothing will be screwed up. Or if you have the opportunity make a third "General" Database where you just put your users data and use it in both systems.
