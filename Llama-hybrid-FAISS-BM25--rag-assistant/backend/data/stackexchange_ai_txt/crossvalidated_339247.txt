The t-test is testing two competing hypotheses: $$H_0: \text{There is no difference between the (true) averages of the two groups}$$ $$\text{versus}$$ $$H_a: \text{There is a difference between the (true) averages of the two groups}.$$ It is not clear what averages you are comparing for the two groups (e.g., average weights), so I stated the two hypotheses in a vague fashion â€“ you will need to fill in the missing information yourself. The p-value associated with the test is 0.1051 , so we cannot reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of no difference between the (true) averages of the two groups since the p-value is greater than the usual significance level alpha = 0.05 . Based on these data, we conclude that there is not enough evidence of a difference between the (true) averages of the two groups at the usual significance level of alpha = 0.05 . (You might want to consider a larger significance level of alpha = 0.10 with such small sample sizes, though.) The conclusion holds provided the assumptions underlying the test are verified by the data. See Wikipedia: Welch's t-test for details on the test assumptions. Here, the word "true" is used to refer to the averages you would get in each group if you had access to all the possible samples, not just the 7 samples per group you included in your study.
