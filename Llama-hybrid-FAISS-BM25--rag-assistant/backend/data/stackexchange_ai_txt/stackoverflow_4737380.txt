You could use a conditional which returns the proper location or even creates the link, probably best wrapped in a helper method. Something like that: def your_link_method(type="delete") case type when "delete" link_to … when "foobar" link_to … else link_to … end end end As a sidenote: This kind of construct smells IMO and I'd probably rethink my design first, before I implement a solution like this. Even if you can probably find a simpler and more elegant way to write it.
