Referencing an unmanaged C++ project within another unmanaged C++ project in Visual Studio 2008

I am working on a neural network project that requires me to work with C++. I am working with the Flood Neural Network library . I am trying to use a neural network library in an unmanaged C++ project that I am developing. My goal is to create an instance of a class object within the Flood library from within another project. There is plenty of documentation online regarding how to reference an unmanaged C++ project from within a C# project, but there is not enough information on how to reference one C++ project within another. Similar to how I would do it in C#, I added the Flood project as a reference in my other project, but I have tried all sorts of techniques to work with the object. I have attempted to use the #include directive to reference the header file, but that gives me errors stating that I need to implement the methods declared in the header file. How to add a reference in unmanaged C++ and work with the class objects?
