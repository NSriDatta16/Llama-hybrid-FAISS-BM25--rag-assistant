Am I missing a subtle transformation from the original Simpson/Yule examples of contingency tables into real values that justify the regression line visualization? Yes. A similar representation of categorical analyses is possible by visualizing the log-odds of response on the Y-axis. Simpson's paradox appears much the same way with a "crude" line running against the stratum-specific trends weighted in distance according to the stratum referent log-odds of the outcome. Here's an example with the Berkeley admissions data Here gender is a male/female code, on the X-axis is the crude admissions log-odds for male versus female, the heavy dashed black line shows gender preference: the positive slope suggests a bias toward male admissions. The colors represent admission to specific departments. In all but two cases, the slope of the department-specific gender-preference line is negative. If these results are averaged together in a logistic model not accounting for interaction, the overall effect is a reversal favoring female admissions. They applied to harder departments more frequently than did males. Surely Simpson's is a particular instance of confounding error. Has the term 'Simpson's Paradox' now become equated with confounding error, so that whatever the math, any change in direction via a hidden variable can be called Simpson's Paradox? Briefly, no. Simpson's paradox is merely the "what" whereas confounding is the "why". The dominant discussion has focused on where they agree. Confounding may have a minimal or negligible effect on estimates, and alternately Simpson's paradox, while dramatic, may be caused by non-confounders. As a note, the terms "hidden" or "lurking" variable are imprecise. From an epidemiologist perspective, careful control and design of study should enable measurement or control of possible contributors to confounding bias. They need not be "hidden" to be a problem. There are times in which point estimates may vary drastically, to the point of reversal, that does not result from confounding. Colliders and mediators are also change effects, possibly reversing them. Causal reasoning warns that for studying effects, the main effect should be studied in isolation rather than adjust for these as the stratified estimate is wrong. (It is akin to inferring, incorrectly, that seeing the doctor makes you sick, or that guns kill people hence people don't kill people).
