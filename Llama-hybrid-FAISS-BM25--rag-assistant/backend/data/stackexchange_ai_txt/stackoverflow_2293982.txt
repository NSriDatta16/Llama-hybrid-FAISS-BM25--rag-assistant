SHA should do just fine in any "normal" environment. Although this is what Ben Lynn - the author of "Git Magic" has to say: A.1. SHA1 Weaknesses As time passes, cryptographers discover more and more SHA1 weaknesses. Already, finding hash collisions is feasible for well-funded organizations. Within years, perhaps even a typical PC will have enough computing power to silently corrupt a Git repository. Hopefully Git will migrate to a better hash function before further research destroys SHA1. You can always check SHA256, or others which are even longer. Finding MD5 collision is easier than with SHA1.
