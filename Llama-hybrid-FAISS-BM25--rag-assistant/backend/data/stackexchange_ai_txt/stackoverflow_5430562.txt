How to compile a Qt application for a Symbian 9.1. device?

I tried to launch my Qt application on a device that uses Symbian 9.1 ( Nokia E65 ). But TRK (the debug agent) for S60 v3 FP1 can not install. I tried to download the TRK agent from other source and installed it on my device, but it doesn't work with the Qt Debugger. How can I make the Qt Debugger work with my Nokia E65 device? Or how do I get a compiled .sis application file for my Nokia e65?
