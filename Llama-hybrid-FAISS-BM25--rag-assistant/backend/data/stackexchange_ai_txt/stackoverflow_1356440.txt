Snow Leopard Services: targeting all files

Here's the available targets for Snow Leopard services in automator. Available service targets http://s3.amazonaws.com/augustl-stuff/automator-available-service-targets-84.png I want my service to operate on all files. It would sort of work to choose "files or folders" and ignore the action if the input is a folder, but that means the service will appear when right clicking folders too, which isn't very elegant.
