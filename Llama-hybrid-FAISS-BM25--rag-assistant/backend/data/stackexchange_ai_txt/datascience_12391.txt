impact of old reviews on new reviews

I am working on e-commerce, how to rank smartphones in the same category. I want to calculate a weighted average of sentiment score from reviews posted by buyers. Weights will be based on how many days before review was posted, as people might give more importance to recent reviews than old reviews. Now to find weight for previous day review, i want to understand impact of previous reviews on current review. i.e. impact of t-1, t-2, t-3 on t. I want to know for how many days should i aggregate review sentiment?
