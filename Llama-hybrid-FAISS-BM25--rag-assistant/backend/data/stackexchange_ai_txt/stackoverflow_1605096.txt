Regular expressions are singularly unsuitable to deal with "balanced parentheses" kinds of problems, even though people persist in trying to shoehorn them there (and some implementations -- I'm thinking of very recent perl releases, for example -- try to cooperate with this widespread misconception by extending and stretching "regular expressions" well beyond the CS definition thereof;-). If you don't have to deal with nesting, it's comfortably doable in a two-pass approach -- grab each paragraph with e.g. .*? (possibly with parentheses for grouping), then perform the substitution within each paragraph thus identified.
