Here's the answer, with example code, direct from the source (the creator of Tweetie): http://blog.atebits.com/2008/12/fast-scrolling-in-tweetie-with-uitableview/ From the blog post: "The technique is extensible to pretty much any style cell you need - I use the same thing in Tweetie and draw the chat bubble, text, and avatar all together into a single view." You can use - (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight to create a stretchable chat bubble to put behind each cell in your table view
