How to determine if change in time series is noise or significant?

I am looking at weekly sales data and see that sales last week dropped by x%. I see that weekly sales do fluctuate quite a bit so not sure if this is indeed a problem. What statistical methods can I use to determine if the observed change is something I should worry about. One option could be to plot the pct change for the last 52 weeks as a histogram (or distribution) and see where x% change falls in that distribution. If the likelihood of observed change is less than 5%, then I can conclude that the change is not due to noise but rather something that needs investigation. However, I am not sure if this approach would hold true given that these data points are not independent of each other as they are points in time series. Any other suggestions?
