Kruskal-Wallis versus Friedman - Paired data, but not repeated measures/blocks?

I'm trying to compare the difference in behaviour of an animal with no enrichment to the same animal with two (or more) types of enrichment. (Total active behaviours before/total active behaviours with enrichment A/Total active behaviours with enrichment B etc) As it is the same animal each time, the results of each trial are not completely independent so I can't use a Kruskal-Wallis (?) The 'flow charts' I can find all lead me to use a Friedman test in this case. However, I do not have any 'blocks' as it wasn't a repeated measures design. How can I find if there is an impact of enrichment on active behaviours. (10 x 1 hour observations recording total 'active behaviours' observed every 15 seconds, then averaged across the 10 sample observations. Repeated for each type of enrichment. Results do not show a normal distribution and so I can't use an ANOVA.)
