How to compare measurements and uncertainties made with different measuring instruments?

I have two different measuring instruments, A and B, both measure the same physical property $x$ of an object but with different "quality": B gives measurements with a known uncertainty while I do not know the uncertainty in the measurements given by A. I have $N$ distinct objects and I measure the property $x$ for all of them with A, so I get a list of measurements $L_A=\{x_{A1}, x_{A2},\ldots,x_{AN}\}$ where $x_{Ai}$ is the measurement of the property $x$ for the $i$-th object. The objects are not labeled so, given an object, I just know that its measurement belongs to $L_A$ but I am not able to extract the measurement from $L_A$. Furthermore, I cannot use A to measure an object that I have already measured in the past with A. Then I randomly choose $M \lt N$ objects from the $N$ objects. I measure all the $M$ objects of the sample with B and I get a list of measurements $L_B=\{x_{B1}, x_{B2},\ldots,x_{BM}\}$. Please note that the index in the subscript is not a label for the object so I cannot directly compare $x_{A1}$ with $x_{B1}$. Is it possible to estimate the uncertainty in the measurements given by A with the above data? I was thinking about comparing the empirical cumulative distribution function of $L_A$ with the one of $L_B$ but it is just an idea and I am not able to elaborate it further. Is there any established standards which cover my problem? For example I found references to "ISO 5725: Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results" but I have not access to it. Update: I found my question similar to How to test if reading from two devices are significantly different? where I read the answer by Michael Lew , he suggests the paper LUDBROOK, John. Statistical techniques for comparing measurers and methods of measurement: a critical review. Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology , 2002, 29.7: 527-536. but unfortunately it seems to me that the paper requires the pairing between the measurements. Update 2: I have written an R script to simulate my problem. set.seed(42) instrument_measurement Referring to the script, is is possible to estimate gain_A , offset_A and dispersion_A from L_A and L_B ? What would be the uncertainties in the estimates? I had an inelegant idea of defining a cost function and try to minimize it in the space of the parameters gain , offset and dispersion : function I made some test keeping gain=1 but with no luck... the cost function seems constant with respect to dispersion ... I am afraid I lack some theory/math about the problem :-)
