How to compute accuracy for CNN when outputs are one-hot encoded

I want to compute accuracy of my model on test data. I have three classes so actual output might look like this : [0 1 0] and the predicted output might look like this: [0.1 0.8 0.1] How do I compute accuracy with this? Shall I compute cross entropy and subtract 1 from that?
