No you can't do such a thing. The reason is that you can only catch click events on the page. The scrollbar is part of the browser not the page. Only the scroll event is triggered for you by the browser. The other point is not to limit yourself to desktop computers. Webpages should work fine on mobile browsers. Some of them don't have scrollbars at all. They can trigger scroll event, but click events on a scrollbar would be useless. The solution for you is to think differently. You may need to reconsider what you're really up to. “We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” Albert Einstein
