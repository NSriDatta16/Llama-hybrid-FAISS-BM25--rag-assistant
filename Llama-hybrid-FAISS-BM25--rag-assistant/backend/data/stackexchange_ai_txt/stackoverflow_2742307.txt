c# any cool graphing libraries to graph performance data?

Any one know of a tutorial or library or something that i could use to help me accomplish rendering a X-Y GRAPH for performance data or just data in general. My goal is to have a final result looking something similar to This Chart rendered by RRD. So just to clarify i just want to render these type of images i don't want rich server controls as they are over kill in my eyes. DevExpress,ComponentOne,Tel..,MSChart,FusionCharts,Jplot,dygraph,Ifragestics,DotNetcharting,AMcharts are no goods...
