The Bayesian approach is based on determining the probability of a hypothesis with a model using an "a priori" probability that is then updated based on data. On the contrary, the classical hypothesis testing does not admit assigning a probability to the null hypothesis, but just either accepting or refusing it. The error-I type is the probability of wrongly refusing the null hypothesis when it is true. Thus, it is something completely different from the Bayesian logic (since probability is referred to making a mistake, not to the hypothesis itself). EDIT : I stressed the fact the Bayesian approach is based on assigning a probability to a hypothesis, because this is a crucial difference wrt the classical approach, that mantains parameters are "assigned by Nature", thus not random variables, so you can't make probability statements directly on them. However, after you get your a posteriori probability, then of course you can take action, either by chosing the hypothesis with higher probability, or the one minimizing a given cost function. See, for example, here: https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter9/9_1_8_bayesian_hypothesis_testing.php To sum up, I'd say the difference is: " a posteriori probability vs p-value", not "making vs not making a decision".
