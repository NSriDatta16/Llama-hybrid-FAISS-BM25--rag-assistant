The advantage of stored procedures is that, because all the processing is done on the database, you do not incur network overhead shunting intermediate result sets back and forth. The disadvantage is that each RDBMS system out there has its own peculiar syntax for stored procedures. By implementing your business logic in stored procedures, you're pretty much restricting your app to a single database product, something you need to keep in mind if you intend your application to be database independent. Also, as gahooa pointed out, because stored procedures live in the database, your access to them as a developer may be restricted by local policy; some organisations will only let DBAs touch the database. @WolfmanDragon: I don't know if views inherently make things slower; your mileage may vary, I guess, depending on the complexity of the view and the RDBMS you're using. Plus, some RDBMS allow you to materialise commonly-used views so access to them is as fast as a base table.
