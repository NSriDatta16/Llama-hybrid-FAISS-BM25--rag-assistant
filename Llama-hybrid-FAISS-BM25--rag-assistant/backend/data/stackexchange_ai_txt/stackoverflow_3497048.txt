Double Click after a Drag and Drop

After I drag and drop a label(or other UIComponent) in a container, i want to double click the label to show me an alert. well it doesn't work. i've tried in the dragCompleteHandler to put event.dragIntiator.addEventListener or event.currentTargetaddEventListner but it doesn't work. Also i enabled the DoubleClickEnabler and still nothing? Any ideas because i tried to google it and nothing came out with this problem. thanks
