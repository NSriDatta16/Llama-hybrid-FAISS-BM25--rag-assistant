How to generically execute service operations in WCF?

I'm looking for a way to accomplish the behavior illustrated in source code below. I've create WCF service proxies with the "Always generate message contracts" option. All of my request and response message contracts implement a common interface and I'd like to execute them using the same function. It seems to me that there should be a generic way to send messages through the client proxy, but I can't find it anywhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated! // I can do this private IPagedResponse GetAllFoods() { NutrientDBClient client = new NutrientDBClient(); GetAllFoodsRequest request = new GetAllFoodsRequest(); GetAllFoodsResponse response = client.GetAllFoods(request); return response; } // I'd like to do this private IPagedResponse ExecutePagedRequest(IPagedRequest request) { NutrientDBClient client = new NutrientDBClient(); IPagedResponse response = (IPagedResponse)client.Execute(request); return response; } I've currently added an ExecutePagedRequest(IPagedRequest) method to NutrientDBClient and manually execute the correct service operation based on the concrete type of IPagedRequest. I'm looking for a more elegant way so that I can simply implement IPagedRequest on a message contract and it auto-magically works.
