The thing is, that T represents some type which by the way implements IAnimal. So, when you try to compile action(new Organatum()) you getting an error because you have declared that the action should take a parameter of type T which in its turn could be of type, let's say, Fish - you can't cast Organatum to a Fish , can you? If you want to trigger any action which takes parameter of a type which implements IAnimal interface, then simply forget about generics and use Action . HTH.
