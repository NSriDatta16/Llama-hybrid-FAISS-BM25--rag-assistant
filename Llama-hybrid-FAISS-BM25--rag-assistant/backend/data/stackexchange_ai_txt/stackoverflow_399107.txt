Ok, I think this is probably as good as I will get it. Thanks to Abgan for sparking the idea. This relies on the fact that None in a slice is treated as if it were a missing parameter. Anyone got anything better? def getReversedList(aList, end, start, step): return aList[end:start if start!=-1 else None:step] edit: check for start==-1 , not 0 This is still not ideal, because you're clobbering the usual behavior of -1. It seems the problem here is two overlapping definitions of what's supposed to happen. Whoever wins takes away otherwise valid invocations looking for the other intention.
