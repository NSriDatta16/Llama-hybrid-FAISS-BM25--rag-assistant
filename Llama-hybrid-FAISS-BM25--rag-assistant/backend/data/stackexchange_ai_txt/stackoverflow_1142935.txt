Sounds pretty complicated. The way I'd approach it is to periodically reevaulate the rankings and store the sort order to the database. From what you've described it sounds like a gigantic algebraic system. I don't know if that can be solved in the DB but even if it could, it might take O(n^holy crap) long to solve, so I feel that caching will be your friend here. As for the actual finding of the sort order, I'd build a list of equations, like: a = b + 400 c = a + 10 And once you have the whole list build, solve the whole thing and cache the rankings
