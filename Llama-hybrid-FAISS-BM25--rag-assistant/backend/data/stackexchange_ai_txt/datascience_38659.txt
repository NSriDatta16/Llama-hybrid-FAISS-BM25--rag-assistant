There's no way to know beforehand which algorithm is best, maybe your problem is so complicated even a 50 layer NN could not solve it, you just have to try, but visualizations usually help to understand your it. I would begin though with simple models as SVMs, Logistic Regression or Decision Trees/Random Forest. Don't forget to try with different kernels for the SVMs.
