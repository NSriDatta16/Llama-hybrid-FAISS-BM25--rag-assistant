With games using dice it's important to pay attention to how the game mechanics relate to what matters in the game play. For example (speaking outside specifics of Catan ) in a game where you're just trying to roll a total that was at least some fixed target, only the proportion of times you do that matters; any biases that don't affect the outcome -- like more 2's and fewer 3's than expected when the target is 8 -- would be irrelevant. On the other hand if the target varied you might consider displaying the whole cdf. Which is to say, you may well get a different answer about a suitable choice for different games. In Catan , each individual outcome is typically important. I concur with whuber's comment that the chi-squared test would be a suitable test for this case, but it's not a display. A warning -- at these sample sizes, the dice would have to be pretty far from fair to show up anything on a chi-squared test with at most 50 rolls. I will discuss a potential display I'd be inclined to look at. [I may come back and add another but I want to think about advice relating to some consequences of discreteness for that one.] You could plot the proportion of times each outcome was rolled, with the expected proportions for a fair die (so far, it is straightforward). Here's an example for a game with 36 rolls. Of course this doesn't show how unusual what we see is; we could add an interval around the expected proportions to indicate a range of observed probabilities consistent with a fair pair of dice. Alternatively to that interval you could put a confidence interval around each observed proportion. The coverage of such a set of individual intervals would need to consider the fact that you're looking at many such comparisons simultaneously -- the chance at least one would be outside such an interval is much higher than the individual ones. You might well want to look at a high individual coverage, or consider two different intervals. At the same time, you could not use the asymptotic distribution of the counts to get the interval here, because $n$ is quite small (e.g. a game of 25 turns may very easily see no 2's or 3's, and the probability you don't see a "2" say is quite high, around $50\%$ ), so choice of what interval to display is not trivial. See the discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval for example. Keep in mind that when choosing a higher coverage, the discreteness problem is worse. Even in the middle of the distribution, counts that are too low are only likely to "show up" at relatively low coverage probabilities (e.g. at n=25, even a 95% interval for each might not include " $0$ " for just the middle three values), which means high probability of at least some values being outside overall. Consequently, with so few rolls, this sort of thing would tend to only have much hope of finding individual errors "on the high side". It would tend to find the problem with my Catan dice easily; they roll "7" roughly 1/3 of the time, across many dozens of games (and games tend to be on the longer side as a result, helping show the bias more clearly). Even with that caveat in mind, a similar warning to the one for the chi-squared test - about not seeing anything with such a small sample - applies here. Your power to see anything not explainable as just random variation is quite low. If the number of rolls was higher -- across ten games, say -- it would be a more useful display, and you would begin to detect differences that matter.
