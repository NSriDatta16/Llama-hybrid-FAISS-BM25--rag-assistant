There is some disucussion of this topic here . Edit: Ok, then the next step is to identify which parts of your code are taking the longest. The simplest way to do this is to make a copy of your code and just start measuring various parts like this: Private Declare Function GetTickCount Lib "kernel32.dll" () As Long Private mlngStrt As Long Private mlngEnd As Long Private Const u As Long = 10000000 Public Sub Example() Dim i As Long mlngStrt = GetTickCount For i = 0 To u Next mlngEnd = GetTickCount Debug.Print "Section1", mlngEnd - mlngStrt mlngStrt = GetTickCount ExampleSubCall mlngEnd = GetTickCount Debug.Print "ExampleSubCall", mlngEnd - mlngStrt mlngStrt = GetTickCount For i = 0 To (u * 1.5) Next mlngEnd = GetTickCount Debug.Print "Section2", mlngEnd - mlngStrt Debug.Print "Example Complete" End Sub Private Sub ExampleSubCall() Dim i As Long For i = 0 To (u * 0.75) Next End Sub This approach is fairly straight-forward. The drawback here is that you need to insert all of the timing statements and then turn around and remove them. Which is why I would work on a copy. Once you know what parts are taking the longest you know where to focus your attention and what to ask for help with.
