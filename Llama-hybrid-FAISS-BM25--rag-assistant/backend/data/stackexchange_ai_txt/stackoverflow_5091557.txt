I feel trying to aim for 100% test coverage on an application is not always the best approach. Sure your app should be well tested but pushing everything aside to make sure you have 100% coverage stops you focusing on the quality of the tests and more about the coverage. Coverage is just a rough guide and does not tell you if your tests are actually testing what they should be only that "line x" got called. Having high TC is good but I'd say if there's 100% you're not testing properly. personally I wouldn't test this.
