When you get around to taking user data, always use dom methods to append user data to the page and assume all user data will contain horrible stuff like " ' > and and hrefs. "User data" here includes any text string that you didn't produce yourself. This includes browser user-agents, application library version strings, everything. ( Its really easy to get this one wrong, so my advice is to use DOM methods everywhere unless you KNOW you have a speed problem. Profile and don't prematurely optimise )
