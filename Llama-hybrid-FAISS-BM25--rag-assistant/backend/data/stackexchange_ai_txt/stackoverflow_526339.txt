I don't think you'll find a "lawyer" milestone in any software development process. It seems a waste of time to find one to cite for your customer's benefit. Even if you could, I doubt that it would provide enough cover for the objections you're worried about that will cost more than software development. There are lawyers that specialize in open source software, but the only "free as in beer" law that I know is "pro bono". The best argument I can think of to justify this is to figure out what a patent fight would cost if you don't bring in a lawyer. If you know the probability of being hit with such a suit you could multiply the average cost times the probability to come up with a dollar figure to compare to the lawyer's fees. That might be a more convincing argument than citing a software development methodology.
