Question about heap & stack memory usage

In windows operating system, the stack memory is a thread-specific storage, and the call stack is the logic flow of a series of methods. So each thread has it's own stack area. I want to know how heap memroy area is used? Is it thread-specific? Process-specific? Or in .NET, AppDomian-specific? Or shared between all the user applications and the operating system? Many thanks.
