Along with the WM_CLOSE and WM_QUIT, you can make it really elegant and simply launch a second instance of the app with STOP as the parameter. Like this: In the project main body... if ((ParamCount >= 1) and (UpperCase(paramstr(1)) = 'STOP')) then // send the WM_CLOSE, etc.. When the app launches and sees that it has a parameter of 'STOP', then hunt down the first instance and kill it. Then quit the second instance without creating your main form, etc.. This way, you don't have to have to write/deploy a second program just to kill the first one.
