Change mouse pointer from hand to I

I am using gird view which have read write access using password user can login and on its password he can read or write on the grid view on grid view i have asp:button i disable it by using grid view's command event protected void gvMemSpb_RowCreated(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e) { if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow) { int iRow = int.Parse(Convert.ToString(e.Row.RowIndex)); if (iRow > -1) { if (Session["Me_Status"].ToString() == "" || Session["Me_Status"].ToString() == "R") { e.Row.Cells[3].Enabled = false; e.Row.Cells[4].Enabled = false; e.Row.Cells[5].Enabled = false; lblRWAccess.Text = "This is (read only) Access page"; } } } This is how i disable the asp:button on grid view, they get disable, but the problem is that it is still showing hand icon on it when mouse over those buttons, i do not want to show hand pointer on mouse over event i lot search on google but could not find probable solution how to hide the hand pointer pragmatically { ?//what code i add hear to hide hand pointer ? ? e.Row.Cells[3].Enabled = false; e.Row.Cells[4].Enabled = false; e.Row.Cells[5].Enabled = false; lblRWAccess.Text = "This is (read only) Access page"; } Thanks in advance Vaibhav Deshpande(MCA)
