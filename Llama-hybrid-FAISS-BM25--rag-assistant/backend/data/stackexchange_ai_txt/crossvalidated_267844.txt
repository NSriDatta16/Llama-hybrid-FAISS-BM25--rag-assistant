Is $R^2$ useful to determine the accuracy of a VARX model?

I have a VARX model with 3 endogenous variables in 2nd differences. Each of 3 equations has very low $R^2$ (about 0,02), but the model gives good forecast (MAPEs are about 2%). Can I neglect low $R^2$ in this case? What is the usual practice of using $R^2$ in time series models? Does this metric really capture the accuracy of such models?
