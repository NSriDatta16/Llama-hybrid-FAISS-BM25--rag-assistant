This is not an easy algorithm to implement, since you are trying to index a data structure in two ways - lexicographically and by popularity. One way to do it might be to build a compressed trie of the songs, where at each node you store a pre-built list of the N most popular songs beginning with that prefix. This would take a lot of storage (O(NUM_SONGS * N)), but would allow fast lookup (O(PREFIX)).
