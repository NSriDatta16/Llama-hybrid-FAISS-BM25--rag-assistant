You can use bootstrap estimation of model performance for CART just as you would for logistic regression. There are two differences or issues to keep in mind: CART is a classification algorith and not likelihood based. It doesn't naturally estimate probabilities. As a result the model performance parameter estimate is often something like Kappa or Accuracy. You can create ROC curves or estimate c-statistic, but not sure it makes much sense. There is a tendency in machine learning to use K-folds cross-validation over bootstrapping. But bootstrapping is likely more efficient.
