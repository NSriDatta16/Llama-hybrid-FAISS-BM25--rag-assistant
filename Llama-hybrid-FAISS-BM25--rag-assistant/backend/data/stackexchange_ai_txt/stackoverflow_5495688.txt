You can ship the data with the installer app, then use Input/Output Streams to copy the data from the assets or raw dirs. Check this out: Ship an application with a database The answer has an implementation of in/outputstream. You don't need to use a db, just copy the file to ext storage. One important detail: if you put the file in assets, it will be shipped compressed, and the phone/tab will try to uncompress the file in its entirety in memory. One (hocky) way to avoid that is to name the file .mp3. Assets in .mp3 format are not compressed. (Hey! I said it was hocky!) The installer app can either uninstall itself by using ACTION_DELETE in an intent (see http://android.amberfog.com/?p=98 for details) or just show a msg to the user that it's safe to delete the data app. HTH, llappall
