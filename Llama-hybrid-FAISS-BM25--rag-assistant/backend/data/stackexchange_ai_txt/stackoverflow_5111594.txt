Summing particular items of a list of objects

I can't, for the life of me, figure out how to solve this using linq. Perhaps my syntax is off. Given the following object: Data ----------- string type string number string value I have an IEnumerable objects. I basically want to return 1 Data object with the values summed up (type and number in this case would be identical). Initially I thought this was a case for the Aggregate() function but I cannot seem to get the syntax correct. Here is what I had although I understand it is incorrect: var results = thisData.Aggregate(new Data(), (data, item) => { item.value?? }); Thanks! Update I think I may have not asked my question very well. At the end of this process I only want 1 record containing type, number and a summed (or aggregate) value. Is there a simple elegant way to achieve this?
