How can I set my Java system look and feel for JNLP apps?

I am running Gnome on OpenSuse. As a result, my system look and feel is GTK+, which has numerous ugly problems (see some of them here ). During development of my swing app, I can run the client from command line or IDE and specify VM parameter -Dswing.systemlaf=com.sun.javax.swing.plaf.metal.CrossPlatformLookAndFeel to make it look good. But I don't know how to force Java Webstart to use this VM parameter when I start the application through JNLP. edit: This has nothing to do with the programmatic ability to set the look & feel. The application does this properly. My question is how to tell Java Webstart to use a VM parameter "swing.systemlaf" when it runs the myapp.jnlp file.
