I am now Microsoft certified trainer in various subjects including ASP.NET and I've always heard questions like yours. I can tell you from my experience that ASP.NET MVC is very different from ASP.NET WebForms and one of those differences is the greater control that you have in MVC for HTML rendering. This can control virtually all the details of how to display the webpage, also takes much more work to detail to give a good appearance, a little different from what happens in WebForms. To be able to build a view much faster, actually AjaxControlToolkit is not the best idea and I'm starting to believe that either WebForms although there will always be people who think otherwise. With the AjaxControlToolkit, many use the UpdatePanel, which also is not a good idea, this allows you to use Ajax in a simple way without having to dirty your hands, but takes away the power you could ever have. You ask well, to build most performant views at first you would have to learn the following: ASP.NET MVC (You learn almost from scratch a new way to make applications, if you never did you use PHP for example) jQuery (A javascript library, this is the secret of speed and versatility of many sites). jQuery Plugins (There are many among them jqgrid, jstree, spinner, and more, you control them by hand, you have to forget the drag-and-drop) JSON (it's a way to pass and receive data between an application and javascript or query) REST (is an alternative to SOAP services) Hope this helps, if you have more questions you can contact me at my email
