Probability distribution of fragment lengths

I would like to compute the probability distribution for the length of the fragments which I would obtain by fragmenting a linear rod of length $L$ in the following way: I choose at random (uniformly) $n$ breakpoints I cut the rod at those breakpoints, creating $(n+1)$ fragments. Now, while it is easy to see that the probability that a stretch of length $x$ does not contain any breakpoint goes like a negative exponential, I don't know how to throw in the information about the length of the rod.
