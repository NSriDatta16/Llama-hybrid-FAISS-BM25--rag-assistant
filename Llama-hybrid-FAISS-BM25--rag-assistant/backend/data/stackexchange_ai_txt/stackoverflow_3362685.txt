Can I use the Dynamics CRM 4.0 SDK against a hosted IFD system?

I am running this code (with names and security details obscured). When I do, I get 401 unauthorised. The credentials are that of the user on the hosted server. Is this possible against an IFD system? var token = new CrmAuthenticationToken(); token.AuthenticationType = 0; token.OrganizationName = "myorganisation"; CrmService service = new CrmService(); service.Url = "https://myorganisation.dynamicsgateway.com/mscrmservices/2007/crmservice.asmx"; service.CrmAuthenticationTokenValue = token; service.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("bob.smith", "Password", "HOSTEDCRM"); var request = new RetrieveMultipleRequest(); request.Query = new QueryExpression { ColumnSet = new ColumnSet(new string[] { "name" }), EntityName = "account" }; var response = service.Execute(request);
