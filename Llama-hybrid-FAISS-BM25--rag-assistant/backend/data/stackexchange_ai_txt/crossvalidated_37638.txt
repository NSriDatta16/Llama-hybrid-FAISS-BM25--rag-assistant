Learning Algorithms/Neural networks books?

Possible Duplicate: Machine learning cookbook / reference card / cheatsheet? Machine learning self-learning book? What are some good theoretical and practical machine learning algorithms books? I am particularly looking for a book that explains the most important and prominent machine learning algorithms being used today. Also is there a good book for learning basic neural networks? I am looking for both theory and application so suggestions on either is good. I am only a beginner in the field, so the easier to understand the book is the better!
