Purpose of automation testing - Feasibility

what is the purpose of automation testing? According to me the main purpose is Fast Removes repetitive manual work My main query comes here. If after automation if it only reduces repetitive manual work but it is taking almost the same time as it was taking before then is automation feasible in this case. As to make the testing automated it takes some time by the tester to create. So if one resource is dedicating 15 working days to create the framework of the automation testing and later if he gets that the automation testing is just reducing his repetitive work but not reducing the time required then what is the profit of the organisation from this automation testframe provided the resource is dedicated to that part which he automate.
