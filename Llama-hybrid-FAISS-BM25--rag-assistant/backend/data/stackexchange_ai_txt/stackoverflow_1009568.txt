Thanks for your answers everyone. NextResult() works well provided you make quite a few changes going from the drag and drop control creation. Here they are. Remove the datasource from the aspx page Remove the DataSourceID property from the Repeater control Create a function in your codebehind that returns a datareader object. eg AstMgtDr() On your page load set the datasource and databind properties for the Repeater control Repeater1.DataSource = AstMgtDr(); Repeater1.DataBind(); At the top of your aspx page, add a page level directive to use the "System.Data.Common" namespace To display your data: this is the method with the best performance but it requires explicit typing ` ` this is another method using field names - more expensive than the previous method but faster than the default Eval. ` ` Hope this saves somebody else some time.
