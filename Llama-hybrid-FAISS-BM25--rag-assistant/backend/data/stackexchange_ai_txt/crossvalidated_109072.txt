10 fold cross validation model in weka

I'm trying to build a specific neural network architecture and testing it using 10 fold cross validation of a dataset. Now building the model is a tedious job and Weka expects me to make it 10 times for each of the 10 folds. Can't I just make the model for the first fold and ask weka to use that same model for the remaining 9? Also, since building neural networks in weka is so easy, can I import a neural network structure to matlab for further use?
