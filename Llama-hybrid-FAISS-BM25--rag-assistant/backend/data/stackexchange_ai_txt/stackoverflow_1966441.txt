How to select nth line of text (CSS/JS)

How to select and apply style on a specific line of text? Like the CSS pseudo-element :first-line , but I want to select any line, not limited to the first. It seems that it can't be done by using only CSS... Anyway I don't mind a JS solution. Update: Well, actually it's only for interest. I'm trying to achieve something like highlighting every even row of a paragraph (for readability, like what everyone does for table rows)... Pre-formating the text like: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. ...it is ok for me, but how to know where to split? Even if the width of paragraph is given, it is still hard to determine...
