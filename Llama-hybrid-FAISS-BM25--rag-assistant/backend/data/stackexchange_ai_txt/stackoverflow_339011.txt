You've mentioned that your primary key is a compound on (Stock, Date), and clustered. This means the table is organised by Stock and then by Date. Whenever you insert a new row, it has to insert it into the middle of the table, and this can cause the other rows to be pushed out to other pages (page splits). I would recommend trying to reverse the primary key to (Date, Stock), and adding a non-clustered index on Stock to facilitate quick lookups for a specific Stock. This will allow inserts to always happen at the end of the table (assuming you're inserting in order of date), and won't affect the rest of the table, and lesser chance of page splits.
