implement touchesBegan for UITextField

Can you catch TextField events when a Touch happens? So far I didn't see the Touch event get registered to TextField. For example, * (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [event allTouches] anyObject; if (touch view == TextFieldView) { do somthing..... } This a dummy code what I want to implement is I want a method that get fired when user touches the text field for some period. If yes than how??? Enlighten me on this. Thnx in advance.
