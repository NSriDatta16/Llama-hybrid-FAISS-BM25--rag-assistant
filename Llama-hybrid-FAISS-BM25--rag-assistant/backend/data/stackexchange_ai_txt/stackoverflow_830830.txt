check this . Its the jquery translate project. I've used it before with normal text, never tried markup but quoting their home page It also reduces the number of requests by concatenating elements and doesn't send unnecessary html markup still providing access to each element as they've got translated. If this doesn't work you can always hold on to the original document fragment and just walk it, translate content and replace. I am sure this will work as the API behaved perfectly with plain text.
