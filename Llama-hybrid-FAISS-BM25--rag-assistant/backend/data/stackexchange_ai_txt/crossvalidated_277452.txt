Sometimes when dealing with ratios it helps to log-transform your data. For example, defining the cell counts from the $i^{th}$ mouse as $y_i$, you could model the cell counts as follows: $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{mouse}_i \text{ is mutant}) + \beta_2 (\text{mouse}_i \text{ is in litter 1}) + \beta_3 (\text{mouse}_i \text{ is in litter 2}) + \dots + \beta_8 (\text{mouse}_i \text{ is in litter 7}) + e_i$$ The $\beta$ 's can be estimated using ANOVA with mutation state and litter membership as the sources of variation. Now consider two mice 'typical' mice from litter 1 where one of which is a mutant and the other is not. According to the model, ratio of their cell counts is $$\frac{\exp(y_m)}{\exp(y_c)} = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2)}{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_2)} = \exp({\beta_1})$$ Therefore, by exponentiating $\beta_1$, you can estimate the 'average' ratio between mutant cell counts and control cell counts. Also, you can show that this estimated ratio is statistically different from 1 by verifying that the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ does not contain 0. [As an aside: I don't think the paired-data tag is appropriate. I associate the term 'paired data' with paired measurements taken from the same measurement unit. For example, suppose you could somehow induce the mutation after the mice were born. You could count the number of cells before inducing the mutation and then again afterwards. Each 'before' measurement is paired with an 'after' measurement since they were taken from the same mouse. In your case, there is no pairing between measurements. Suppose Litter 1 has four mice: two controls (C11 and C12) and two mutants (M11 and M12). There's no justification for pairing the cell count from C11 with the count from M11 as opposed to the count from M12.]
