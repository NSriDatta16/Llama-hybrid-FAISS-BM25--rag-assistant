Tools for inspecting .lib files?

I'm evaluating some underdocumented software. When I build a sample project, I'm getting a linker error that looks like: error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol There aren't a whole lot of lib files with this app, so I can solve this problem with trial and error, but I know there's a more elegant way is to solve this problem. In the java world, I would grep FOO *.jar to find the jar and I'm looking for the C++ analog. I'm working with C++ code in Visual Studio 2005. I suspect the lib.exe utility with the /LIST option can get the information, but I've been unsuccessful so far. It just prints this: Microsoft (R) Library Manager Version 8.00.50727.762 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. granite50.dll granite50.dll granite50.dll granite50.dll ... Any suggestions?
