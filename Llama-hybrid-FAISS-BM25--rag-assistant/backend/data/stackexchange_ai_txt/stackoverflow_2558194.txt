Action by definition does not return value, you can use the generic version which allow multiple parameters. If you want it to return value, use Func or if you just want it to return bool and take one argument, you can use Predicate Or you can define a delegate anyway you like to return void or a value and take any number of argument. You can define a delegate like below and it is like a type that you can use. You can then pass it in as a callback parameter directly without using Action, Func or Predicate. Custom delegate is also use commonly use with writing custom multicast eventhandler. public delegate double PerformAverageEventHandler(int val1, int val2, int val3);
