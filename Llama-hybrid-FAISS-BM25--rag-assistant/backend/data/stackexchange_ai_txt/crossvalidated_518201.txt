Code help about creating custom loss function in tensor flow

I am trying to create my custom loss function for solving the regression problem using the RNN layers. For my specific dataset, I need the following conditions for updating my loss function: def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred): if y_true>b or y_true Basically, this loss function is penalizing more on predicting incorrect extreme values. I wonder if I am going to write using tf.cond() , how should I deal with the multiple conditions? Also my a, b are single values, so I need to convert those to an array in order to compare with y_true? Any answers or thoughts are appreciated.
