It is not possible, but its SQL "fault", not the fault of DataAdapter/Set, because result set does not carry the name of the table queried (nor is that discernibly possible if you use inner join) nor does the table adapter have a query from which to pick the name. One method you can use is to first return a list of tables as Query#0 in the procedure, e.g. select 'MyTable;MySecondTable;ThirdOrSo' as tables followed by all other queries, then read index 0 table and this field, split/forloop to rename other tables in dataset. The maintainer would still need to know the mechanism but at least it gives him some freedom to reorganize..
