Are those just log messages, or is an exception actually being raised? phpcassa calls error_log() every time that an exception like this is caught before retrying with a different connection. Basically, this means that you should keep an eye on the stack traces that get logged, but you don't need to worry too much about them. Those are client-side socket timeouts, which means that the call has taken longer than the default timeout of 5 seconds. Why exactly these are happening in the first place depends a lot on how Cassandra is behaving. Monitoring Cassandra is probably the best place to start.
