Average marginal effects for censored regression (Tobit) in R

I would like to calculate average marginal effects for a Tobit regression in R. margEff.censReg can calculate marginal effects at the mean, but not average marginal effects (the mean over marginal effects over all observations) The margins package can calculate average marginal effects e.g. for a linear model, but does not seem to work with the packages that are able to estimate a Tobit model. I tried: censReg ( Error in UseMethod("predict") : no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "c('censReg', 'maxLik', 'maxim', 'list') ) and vglm ( Error in get(dat, envir = env) : first argument has length > 1 ) Does anyone have another idea?
