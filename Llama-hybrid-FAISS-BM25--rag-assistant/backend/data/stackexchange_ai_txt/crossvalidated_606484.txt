Is there any way to compare the changes in the averages between two groups who are not entirely equal at the start?

RQ: analyzing the effect of completing a strenuous vs. more relaxing warm-up on reaction speed. Methodology: Randomly assigned the population to two conditions: complete a strenuous warm-up or a more relaxing one All participants took the reaction time test 3 times before being exposed to their condition to establish a benchmark. participants took the reaction time test 3 times again after being exposed to their condition My problem is that the group that completed the more strenuous warm-up has a faster reaction speed for the benchmark so my groups aren't equal at the beginning. Is there any test I can do to test the statistical significance of the change in the mean reaction speeds? Would ANOVA work?
