Averaging Bayesian posteriors

Does it make sense to use different uninformative priors and then take the mean of all the posteriors? For example, use (0,0), (0.5, 0.5), (1, 1) and calculate three posteriors and then take the mean. My thinking is that this will minimize the error from using the “wrong” prior (so to speak). This is of course being done, if we cannot have subjective priors. Has this been looked at?
