If you're using Closure, you can use the closure compiler. I'd recommend multiple js files that are compiled into a single resource by the compiler. You'd reference that single js file in your html, so you wouldn't have to link to all of them. Then, since you have multiple JS file, you can organize them in a logical way that will help you separate logic from UI from communications, etc. Also, if you're writing unit tests (JsUnit) it will be easier to write one test file per js file.
