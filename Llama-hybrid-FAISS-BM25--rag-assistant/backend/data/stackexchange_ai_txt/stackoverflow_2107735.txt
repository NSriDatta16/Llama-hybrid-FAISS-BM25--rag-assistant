The answer is evidently, yes...when the client is registering the channel, it keeps the server from registering another Tcp channel. I have removed the client instancing of a Tcp channel and the registration. Since I haven't gotten an answer on pinging, I'm going through with a try/catch block on the obj = Activator.GetObject(...). If obj is returned null, then I 'nudge' the server, it fires up...and then the client connects with the CommonDataObject (derived from MarshalByRefObject). So, in a sense, that is the polling technique I'm using. I'd like something more elegant - that is, an implementation that didn't work by causing a failure. To me, that's more of a hack work-around than a solution. I found the answer here . Thanks to Abhijeet for the inadvertent solution!!! Btw...don't forget to declare: using System.Linq;
