How does Wowhead.com do item popups across fansites?

If you run a site that links to world of warcraft items, you're probably using the wowhead.com javascript to bring their item popups to your site. See it in action here , mouse over the "King Dred's Helm" link. It will popup Wowhead.com's info. is this just a jsonp callback to their site? I want to implement something like this on my site. Perhaps it could be done using jQuery html fragment and a jsonp callback to my own site?
