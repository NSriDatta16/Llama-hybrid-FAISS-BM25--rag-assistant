Choices of priors for time-varying-parameter VAR in Primiceri (2005)

The main idea of the question is how to choose priors' parameters for the time-varying-parameter VAR model. I am really confused in the way Primiceri (2005) constructed priors in his paper under the title "Time varying structural vector autoregressions and monetary policy" . If I understood the idea of the prior correctly, it should reflect our believe for the parameters so we can calculate our posterior distribution. However, how the author identity the matrices' priors in Q, W, and S (in pg. 13) and, for example, choosing the value 40 (the training sample) as the variance for our prior? The same inquiry apply for the paper: Nakajima, J., M. Kasuya, and T. Watanabe (2011). "Bayesian analysis of time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model for the Japanese economy and monetary policy". However, in this paper, the justification of the prior choice is really vague and not straightforward.
