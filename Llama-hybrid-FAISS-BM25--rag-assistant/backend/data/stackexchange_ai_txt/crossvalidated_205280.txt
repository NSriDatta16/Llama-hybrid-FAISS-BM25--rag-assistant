The book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan is a really gentle introduction to using the common tools for Bayesian regressions. Also, his blog has solution codes for all of the exercises . You can do most common things just by modifying the example solutions. I highly recommend this as an introductory resource. I don't know of any "point-and-click" tools so I think no matter what you do, you have to get comfortable programming in at least one language.
