Well, first of all, why don't you just test if int rows = table.length; gives the desired result? It does indeed give you the number of elements in the first dimension. Multidimensional arrays are in fact nothing special, as they are just arrays of arrays of arrays of ... In your case - a 2D array - it is organized like this (in pseudo-code): double[][] foo = { double[] = {...}, double[] = {...}, ... } So when accessing foo, it refers to the "outer" array, which has of course the length property, which contains the number of arrays it contains on the second level. You can read the double[][] as "An array ([]) of double-arrrays (double[])".
