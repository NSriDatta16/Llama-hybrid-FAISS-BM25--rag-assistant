Not really answering your question about pasting but offering an alternative: you could subscribe for the submit handler of the form and perform the validation there. Even more elegant is to use the jquery validation plugin which will do the job of subscribing for you so that you only need to define the rules and error messages: $(function() { $('#myform').validate({ rules: { someFieldName: { required: true, number: true } }, messages: { someFieldName: { required: 'please enter a value', number: 'please enter a valid number' } } }); });
