Yo can use an WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver, or a content manager like Wordpress. Check these lists (verify that they are compatible with your SO): HTML Editors (Get all which have a WYSIWYG editor and a free/open-source license). I would recommend you Kompozer. Content Management Systems (Get just the free ones). I think it's the better option because the html editors aren't very useful when you have a minimum quantity of information. ANYWAY I would encourage you to learn HTML. It's very very easy and it will help you a lot.
