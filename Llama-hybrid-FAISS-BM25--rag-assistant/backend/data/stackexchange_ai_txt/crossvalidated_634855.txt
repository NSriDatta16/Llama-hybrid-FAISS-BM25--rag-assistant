R RandomForest model getting all predictions of one class wrong

I am doing the following, and the model is getting all of the "True" class predictions wrong. Any idea what I can try on this data? I tried to tune some things, and also tried XGBoost to no luck. Here is the mix of the true / false cases in the train and test. It is heavily one class, but the mix is not that bad > table(trainDf$dependent_variable) 1 2 406 37 > table(testDf$dependent_variable) 1 2 102 9 library(dplyr) library(randomForest) library(caret) x % predict(select(testDf, -dependent_variable)), testDf$dependent_variable ) 1 2 1 102 8 2 0 1 ```
