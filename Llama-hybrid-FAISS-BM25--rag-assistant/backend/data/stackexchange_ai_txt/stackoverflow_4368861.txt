R: converting xts or zoo object to a data frame

What is an easy way of coercing time series data to a data frame, in a format where the resulting data is a summary of the original? This could be some example data, stored in xts or zoo object: t, V1 "2010-12-03 12:00", 10.0 "2010-11-04 12:00", 10.0 "2010-10-05 12:00", 10.0 "2010-09-06 12:00", 10.0 ...and so on, monthly data for many years. and I would like to transform it to a data frame like: year, month, V1 2010, 12, a descriptive statistic calculated of that month's data 2010, 11, ... 2010, 10, ... 2010, 9, ... The reason I'm asking this, is because I want to plot monthly calculated summaries of data in the same plot. I can do this quite easily for data in the latter format, but haven't found a plotting method for the time series format. For example, I could have temperature data from several years measured in a daily interval and I would like to plot the curves for the monthly mean temperatures for each year in the same plot. I didn't figure out how to do this using the xts-formatted data, or if this even suits the purpose of the xts/zoo formatting of the data, which seems to always carry the year information along it.
