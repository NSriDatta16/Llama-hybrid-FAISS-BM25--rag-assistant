Java RMI and Thread Synchronization questions

I actually have two questions about Java RMI and thread synchronization: 1) If I implement my RMI remote methods as synchronized, are they guaranteed to be mutually exclusive? I need to make sure that no two of my RMI methods (methods offered to clients) execute at the same time. 2) I have a method that the server executes periodically. It is used to do cleanups. I have to make sure that this particular method does not execute when there is any RMI method being run/used by remote clients. Also, when that method is running, RMI calls shouldn't be possible. I.e. Clients must wait. Any idea how I can do that? I have read about Locks, but I do not know how to use them in this scenario. I have considered implementing RMI methods as static and including that cleanup method inside the RMI interface, but it does not seem to be an elegant way of solving the problem. I have also written the cleanup method inside the RMI interface as synchronized. When I ran it for testing, there did not seem to be collisions between methods, but I cannot be sure. Thank you for your time and answers.
