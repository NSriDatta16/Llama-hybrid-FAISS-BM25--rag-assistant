Your best bet is user agent sniffing. It's available by request.getHeader("user-agent") . There's even a 3rd party webservice to which you can submit this string and obtain detailed information: http://user-agent-string.info Another way is using a Java applet and gather the information by System.getProperty("os.name") . This is a bit more reliable since the user agent can be spoofed by the client.
