Excel: Multiple Vlookups to pull in 1 data element

I have 2 separate sheets in Excel. On sheet 1, I am using the following if statement in column C (hours) to pull in a number in column D (hours) from sheet 2. =IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!A:D,1,FALSE)),"N/A",VLOOKUP(B2,Sheet2!A:D,4,FALSE)) The first vlookup is validating the project number on the second sheet, then the second vlookup is validating the team name and pulling in the hours from the second sheet. The problem is that when I copy the formula down the column, the hours value repeats for the same team name. Does anyone have any suggestions? Sheet 1 columns Proj_Number Team Name Hours 123456 R&D 26 123456 Dev 50 123456 QA 10 777777 R&D 26 Sheet 2 Proj_Number Team Name Organization Hours 777777 R&D AUTO 26 123456 DEV AUTO 50 123456 QA AUTO 10 123456 R&D AUTO 20
