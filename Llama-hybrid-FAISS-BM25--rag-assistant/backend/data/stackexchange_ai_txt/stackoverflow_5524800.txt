How to delay a javascript function until after Jquery & Facebook are both loaded?

Jquery provides a very convenient way to delay executing code until the DOM is fully loaded: $(function() { dom_is_loaded(); }); The Facebook Javascript SDK, when loaded asynchronously, provides a similar mechanism: window.fbAsyncInit = function() { fb_is_loaded(); } What's the most elegant way to delay code from running until the DOM and Facebook's SDK have both fully initialized?
