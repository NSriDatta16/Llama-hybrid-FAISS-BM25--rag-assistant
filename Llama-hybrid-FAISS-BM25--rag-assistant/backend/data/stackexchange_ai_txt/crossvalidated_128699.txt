Do I need to take out any predictors from multiple regression if I put in some principal components as additional predictors?

I have an assignment which involves one area-level dataset made of $366$ scale variables. I have to perform PCA, compare it with rates of an additional response variable $X$, and comment on its face validity. I also have to do a regression analysis to predict rates of variable $X$. I would like to be clever and add the PCA scores to the regression to see if it improves the predictive power of the model. Question: I do not want to overestimate the predictive power of certain variables within the dataset. Do I have to exclude variables from the regression that are structurally related to the PCs that I put in? The PCA is very theory based and is done already, so I don't really want to mess with it.
