Converting Makefile to Visual Studio Terminology Questions (First time using VS)

I am an old Unix guy who is converting a makefile based project over to Microsoft Visual Studio, I got tasked with this because I understand the Makefile which chokes VS's automatic import tools. I am sure there is a better way than what I am doing but we are making things fit into the customer's environment and that is driving my choices. So gmake is not a valid answer, even if it is the right one ;-) I just have a couple of questions on terminology that I think will be easy for an experienced (or junior) user to answer. Presently, a make all will generate several executables and a shared library. How should I structure this? Is it one "solution" with multiple projects? There is a body of common code (say 50%) that is shared between the various executable targets that is not in a formal library, if that matters. I thought I could just set up the first executable and then add targets for the others, but that does not seem to work. I know I am working against the tool, so what is the right way? I am also using Visual C++ 2010 Express to try and do this so that may also be a problem if support for multiple targets is not supported without using Visual C++ 2010 (insert superlative). Thanks, this is really one of those questions that should be answerable by a quick chat with the resident Windows Developer at the water cooler. So, I am asking at the virtual water cooler, I'll also spring for a virtual frosty beverage after work.
