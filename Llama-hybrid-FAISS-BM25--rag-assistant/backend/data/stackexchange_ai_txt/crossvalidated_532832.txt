biplot of PCA data gives very unusual

Very much a new at data analytics, with some functional understanding of statistics. I was referred to this site from elsewhere. I am looking at ca. 1000 optical spectra, data available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for 1 data reduction], and [2] to understand if there are any spectral features that might stand out when compared to the average spectra. I tested my code on model data, and I was able to reproduce results found on various sites. When I ran my code on my spectral data set, and constructed a biplot, I got a very unusual shape, alomost like a semi-symmetrical ellipse. I have no idea what it is I am looking at, would be very grateful if someone could share their expertise. Thanks.
