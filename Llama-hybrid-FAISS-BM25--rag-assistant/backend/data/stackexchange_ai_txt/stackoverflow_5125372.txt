is GAE throttling me?

I have a Google App Engine HTTP resource that takes 20 seconds to respond. The resource does a calculation requiring very little bandwidth and no storage access. Billing is not enabled. If my desktop application spawns 100 threads to POST 500 times (each thread will on average POST 5 times). I believe that 500 POSTs use up just a little more than the freebie time for non-billing accounts, which is 6.5 CPU hours per 24 hour period. I might be about 10 POSTs over the limit because towards the end, about 10 of the 500 will fail even if I allow each request to retry twice. In any event, the fact that I'm a little over the limit probably does not affect the problem which prompted my question. My question is: the dashboard measurement "CPU seconds used per second" is about 17. I would like this to be 100, because after all, I have 100 threads. I'm not really good with Firebug or other monitoring tools so I have not proven that there is a peak of 100 outstanding requests on the wire-side of the Python standard library web methods, but I do print "hey" to the desktop console when there are 100 outstanding threads. It says "hey" fairly early so I think the number of CPU seconds per second should be a lot closer to 100 than 17. Is my problem on the desktop or is GAE throttling me and how can I get 100 CPU seconds per second? How can I get somebody at Google to help with this question? I think their "support" link just goes to "community-style" support.
