Start simple with character recognition on the Unipen database. You will need to extract pertinent features out of raw trajectory data in order to form what's commonly called a "feature vector". For instance you could resample the data using an interpolation scheme to end up with n tuples, each tuple containing information such as: position orientation velocity acceleration curvature etc Once you have a fixed size feature vector, you use it as the input to your neural network. Try MLP networks for a start. You will have to experiment in order to decide which features are best. If you need to get started on extracting features from Ink data, have a look at HP's Lipi Toolkit (note that their recognizers don't use neural networks though). You can also have a look at this 15 Steps to Implement a Neural Network tutorial .
