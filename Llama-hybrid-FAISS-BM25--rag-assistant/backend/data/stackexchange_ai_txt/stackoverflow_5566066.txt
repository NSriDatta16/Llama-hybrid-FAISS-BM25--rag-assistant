Comparing the MD5 results of split files against the MD5 of the whole

I have a situation where I have one VERY large file that I'm using the linux "split" command to break into smaller parts. Later I use the linux "cat" command to bring the parts all back together again. In the interim, however, I'm curious... If I get an MD5 fingerprint on the large file before splitting it, then later get the MD5 fingerprints on all the independent file parts that result from the split command, is there a way to take the independent fingerprints and somehow deduce that the sum or average (or whatever you like to all it) of their parts is equal to the fingerprint of the single large file? By (very) loose example... bigoldfile.txt MD5 = 737da789 smallfile1.txt MD5 = 23489a89 smallfile2.txt MD5 = 1238g89d smallfile3.txt MD5 = 01234cd7 someoperator(23489a89,1238g89d,01234cd7) = 737da789 (the fingerprint of the original file)
