How to bind the Selected Item to a Model with the Infragistics XamDataGrid?

I have the following model: public class Model : INotifyPropertyChanged { public ObservableCollection Elements { get; set; } public ViewElement CurrentElement { get; set; } } And the following grid where the parent DataContext is the above model: I want to bind the CurrentElement property to the Selected Item of the Grid, similar to how I would in a ListView : How would you suggest I do this?
