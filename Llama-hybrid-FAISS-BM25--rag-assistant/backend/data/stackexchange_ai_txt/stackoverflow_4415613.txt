Turning web pages into images and PDFs is a royal pain using PHP. Solutions often require OS level scripting, fake printer drivers, or screen capturing, which can make for a rather fragile setup. I ran into the same issue a few years ago and started working on native PHP extension that leveraged the Gecko engine to render HTML to PDF, but never finished it. The best answer I've seen doesn't quite turn a full web page into a PDF, but instead does XML to PDF. XEP by RenderX is the commercial tool Apple uses to produce developer documentation in many formats, including HTML and beautifully rendered PDFs, from an XML source. The great thing about using the XEP tool in conjunction with PHP is that PHP deals with XML very well, so you can pass generated XML to the XEP binary, let it do the conversion to PDF, then deal with the resulting PDF file in PHP.
