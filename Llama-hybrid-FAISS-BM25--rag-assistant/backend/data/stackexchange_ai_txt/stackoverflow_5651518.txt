Adding management-tools into a web-app often complicate deployment, is my experience. Especially when the use of your application grows, and you need to performance-tune it, dragging along a huge "backend" may be problematic. For sake of deploy-, scale- and test-ability, I prefer my applications to be small and focused. Sometimes it even pays off to have the entire admin-enviroment over REST-XML-services. But as other answers point out: this is more a "it depends" solution. These are my â‚¬0.02.
