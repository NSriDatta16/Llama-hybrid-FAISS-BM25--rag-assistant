rich:scrollableDataTable causing infinite posting loop

I'm getting some very strange behavior from a new scrollableDataTable component I'm trying to add. I have stripped its attributes and content down to the bare minimum and the odd behavior continues. So the problem is: When I hit the page that includes the file with my scrollable data table (Which is in a Modal window), the page seems to go on an endless submitting/re-rendering loop. As if it just keeps re-rendering the entire page or submitting the page. My code is attached. I'm using Richfaces 3.3.1 and JSF 2.0.4. main.xhtml: includeFile1.xhtml: test-details-tab.xhtml Edit Looking at my eclipse tomcat logs I can see that it is in fact re-rendering the page 2 times per second on average. Edit 2 Ok, so I've tried a very simple example in its own single seperate page. It is still not working, the endless resubmitting/looping is still occuring. I also put an editor component in, just to make sure it was not Richfaces 3.3 on my system....the editor works fine. #{messages[componentNavigator.currentComponent.id]} Edit 3 It turns out the version of JSF running is 1.2 Is it possible that this is the cause of the issue? Thanks
