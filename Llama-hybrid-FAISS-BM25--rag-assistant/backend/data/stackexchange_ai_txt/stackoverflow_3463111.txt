Redmine feature to configure multiple target versions for each ticket

In Redmine , I need an alternate to the Target Version field in a ticket. Basically, I would like to pre-define a large number of version numbers and then assign more than 1 version number to a ticket. For example a ticket can be assigned Software 1.2.0 and Hardware 1.1.0 . The List Format for a Custom Field will not work because you can only choose one at a time. I'd rather not create checkboxes either because the number of checkboxes will become huge. Any ideas? I also posted this ticket on the official Redmine forum Thanks! Chirag
