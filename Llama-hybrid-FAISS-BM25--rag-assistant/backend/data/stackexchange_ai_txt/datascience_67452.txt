If the dimensions are not linearly correlated, you may use an autoencoder to perform the dimensionality reduction. Just like PCA that can perform a reconstruction, but with non-linearity. Then, you can perform classification with the latent space. Autoencoder is a multi-dimensional auto-regressive model with a dimensional bottleneck somewhere in the middle. In general, it contains 2 neural networks, one encoder and one decoder. The encoder takes one data sample as input and it produces an output in latent space with a number of dimensions smaller than the input's. The decoder takes the encoder's output as its input and it tries to produce the original data sample as output. To train an autoencoder, we try to minimize the reconstruction error (the difference between the input sample and the reconstructed sample). The dimensional bottleneck in the middle will force the autoencoder to preserve as much information of the original input as much as possible with a smaller number of dimensions.
