alternative to JQuery form.submit() to do ajax post

I have a mvc2 application with a view like this Are you sure you want to approve this request? FYI, the controller returns a partial view back. I used to not have the jquery dialog and just simple a that used to work fine I added the jquery dialog and I have something like this to initialize the dialog. $("#dialogApprove").dialog({ autoOpen: false, draggable: true, resizable: false, buttons: { "Cancel": function() { $(this).dialog("close") }, "Approve": function() { $("#UserApprove").submit(); $(this).dialog("close"); } } }); The $("#UserApprove").submit(); does not seem to be doing an ajax post. It comes back with just the text from the partial view returned in a new page. I dont want to use the jquery form plugin which has .ajaxSubmit(). Is there any other way to force an ajax post from the jquery dialog "approve" button?
