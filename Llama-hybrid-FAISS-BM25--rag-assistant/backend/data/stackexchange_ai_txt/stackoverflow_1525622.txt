What's an elegant way to unify X,Y with (1,2), (1,-2), (-1,2), (-1,-2), (2,1), (2,-1) , (-2,1), (-2,-1)?

What's an elegant way to unify X,Y with (1,2), (1,-2), (-1,2), (-1,-2), (2,1), (2,-1) , (-2,1), (-2,-1)? Doing it this way seems error prone and tedious: foo(1,2). foo(1,-2). foo(-1,-2). ... ... ... And this way seems too expensive: foo(X,Y) :- L = [1,-1,2,-2], member(X,L), member(Y,L), abs(X,X1), abs(Y,Y1), X1 =\= Y1.
