Can't drag files to Solution Explorer

I am having an unusual problem. I have always been able to drag files and folder from my desktop or explorer to the solution explorer in visual studio and add the files to my project. No when I attempt to drag files I simply get the "stop" symbol. I am using Visual Studio 2008 running on Vista Home Premium 64 bit. Any ideas?
