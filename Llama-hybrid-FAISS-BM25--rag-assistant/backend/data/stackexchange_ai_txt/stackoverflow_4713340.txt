How can i get the flash player working

Am only looking to play some flash content on my page. found this code on the web and just copied it into my codes and changed the file name. However the intellisense underlines part of the code in green and says "File 'swfobject.js' was not found" this is the code I copied below. var s1 = new SWFObject('cmsflash.swf','player', '400', '300', '9'); s1.addParam('allowfullscreen', 'false'); s1.addParam('allowscriptaccess', 'always'); s1.addParam('flashvars', 'file=video.flv'); s1.write('preview'); and it underlines only (swfobject.js) saying file not found. the file i wish to display is named cmsflash and is in the root directory probably ~/cmsflash.swf where and what could be going wrong? the block where the flash should display is declared as follows The player will show in this paragraph Please Help THIS IS THE NEW CODE AFTER I IMPORTED THE SWFOBJECT FOLDER. var s1 = new swfobject('~/cmsflash.swf','player', '400', '300', '9'); s1.addParam('allowfullscreen', 'false'); s1.addParam('allowscriptaccess', 'always'); s1.addParam('flashvars', 'file=video.flv'); s1.write('preview'); I dont get any errors but the flash does not display at page load. After several editing and flash still does not want to appear so i some more editing by adding a declaration in the master page(site.master) as shown below var s1 = new SWFObject('cmsflash.swf', 'player', '400', '300', '9'); s1.addParam('allowfullscreen', 'false'); s1.addParam('allowscriptaccess', 'always'); s1.addParam('flashvars', 'file=video.flv'); s1.write('preview'); s1.write('preview1'); I also made a similar declaration in the child page just in case it was not supposed to be in the master page. so below is the code in the child page(default.aspx) var s1 = new SWFObject('cmsflash.swf', 'player', '400', '300', '9'); s1.addParam('allowfullscreen', 'false'); s1.addParam('allowscriptaccess', 'always'); s1.addParam('flashvars', 'file=video.flv'); s1.write('preview'); s1.write('preview1'); This is the location where i asked for the flash to appear. The player will show in this paragraph I even suspected the flash file was probably not able to display in tables so i went further to declare a "div" as follows The player will show in this paragraph But flash still would not show...
