Unit testing fake repository, how can I test the GetById method without first adding an entity?

My understanding is that you have to write unit tests that isolate functionality. So given a repository class that has this method: Entity GetById(Guid id) and a fake implementation (using a Dictionary for storage), how would you write a test without first adding an entity? Is it ok to use a known set of guids for testing? Then in the fake repository constructor I could fill the dictionary with a couple of entities where the guids follow a pattern, so that I can test the GetById() method with a guid that I know will return an entity. Thanks for reading! PS. This is my first time writing unit tests.
