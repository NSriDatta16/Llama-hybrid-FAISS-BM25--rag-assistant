example of embeddeding xterm in wxPython panel

I'm looking for an example or advice for embedding an xterm window in a wxPython panel. I think I can get the window ID of a panel with something like "wid=somePanel.GetHandle()" and I should be able to pass that to "xterm -use wid" but so far I'm not having much luck making that work.
