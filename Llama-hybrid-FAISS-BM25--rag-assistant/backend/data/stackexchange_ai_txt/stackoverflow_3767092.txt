Test often, commit often. If you don't do that already, I suggest to use a Continuous Integration tool, and ask/require the developers to run the automated tests before committing. At least a subset of the tests. If running all tests takes too long, then use a CI tools that spawns a build (which includes running all automated tests) for each commit, so you can easily see which commit broke the build. If the automated tests are too fragile, maybe they don't test the functionality, but the implementation details? Sometimes testing the implementation details is a good idea, but it can be problematic.
