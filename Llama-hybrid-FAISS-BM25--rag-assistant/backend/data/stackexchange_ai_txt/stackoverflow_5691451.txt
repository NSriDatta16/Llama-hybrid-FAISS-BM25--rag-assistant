Pretty much any book on C programming should cover the functions you need. As MByD pointed out, you'll want to use the functions fopen(), fwrite(), and fclose(). I imagine your code may include fragments that look something like /* Warning: untested and probably out-of-order code */ ... char **filename = { "image00.jpg", "image01.jpg", "image02.jpg", ... "image29.jpg" }; ... int index = 0; const int blocksize = 512; /* bytes */ ... index++; ... FILE * output_file = fopen( filename[index], "wb"); fwrite( output_data, 1, blocksize, output_file ); fclose(output_file); ...
