Problem predicting caret::train random forest ("rf") model

IÂ´ve been working in a random forest model for credit scoring in R. I've trained a model using caret::train . My data "df_samples_rf" has the next structure: control I get the next results: And: So I assume the model can perform well. Then I try to predict like this: rf_predictions Data "df_no_yes" has exactly the same structure and class variables as "df_samples_rf", predicted variable also have the same class and levels. results I run a confusionMatrix and get: confusionMatrix(results$rf_predictions, results$real) Why does caret::train have models with good ROC-AUC and classification metrics, and when predicting over a new set of data, I get so bad results? Am I doing something wrong? Applying the predict in the wrong way?
