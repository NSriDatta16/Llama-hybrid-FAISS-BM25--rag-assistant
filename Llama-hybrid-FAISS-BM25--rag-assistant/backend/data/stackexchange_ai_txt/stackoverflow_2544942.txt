Using Large Lists

In an Outlook AddIn I'm working on, I use a list to grab all the messages in the current folder, then process them, then save them. First, I create a list of all messages, then I create another list from the list of messages, then finally I create a third list of messages that need to be moved. Essentially, they are all copies of each other, and I made it this way to organize it. Would it increase performance if I used only one list? I thought lists were just references to the actual item.
