What kind of architecture should I learn to make good JavaScript based software?

I know Model-View-Controller well, have known about it for years and used it in terms of server-side development with languages like PHP. However, I am now working with JavaScript and building a big application with it utilizing SVG, Canvas among other great features modern browsers support. The project is big, so, the architecture behind it must not be fragile. JavaScript and MVC do not get on like a house on fire, because JavaScript is event-driven by nature. So, are there any architectures or anything else I should definitely learn, understand and implement? The software will have to deal with data. It already utilizes local storage and web SQL database. I need a Models, right? There is an UI, so I have Views? However, do I have Controllers? What about events? How do I structure everything? Architecture, architecture, architecture -- that's what I'm interested in. I'm fine with the language of my choice.
