What is the best statistical method for assigning cases to one of two groups?

I have a bunch of data (over a million cases) with a few variables. One of these variables classifies the data into one of two groups: premature and mature. I want to develop some statistical technique/function so that when I am given new cases whose group is unknown (premature or mature), I can use it to classify them into one of the two groups. From my knowledge it would seem that discriminant analysis is the best technique or maybe logistic regression? However my data is really unbalanced (more mature than premature). So should I purposely make it a 50/50 amount for my training data set and then use the technique? And is there any other technique that is effective in achieving what I aim to do that you would recommend? Thanks
