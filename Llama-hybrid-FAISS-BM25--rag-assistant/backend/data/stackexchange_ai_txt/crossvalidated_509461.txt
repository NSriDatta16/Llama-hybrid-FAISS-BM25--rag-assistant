1st or 2nd order of differencing

I have time series and I want to apply differencing to them. However I am not sure whether I should use 1st or 2nd order differencing. In this website ( https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/arimrule.htm ) it states that if the lag-1 autocorrelation is zero or negative, or the autocorrelations are all small and patternless, then the series does not need a higher order of differencing. If the lag-1 autocorrelation is -0.5 or more negative, the series may be overdifferenced However, in some resources it states that if ACF plot has negative autocorrelation at lag-1 it indicates overdifferencing. These are my ACF plots: Based on these which order of differencing should I use and why?
