in which situations use of positioning would be a better option than float?

How positioning can save our time if we use in place of float on some place in layout coding? How we can judge where positioning would give better result? For example (i added just for example) if this is a design So far i only use float + margin + padding, now if i can mix positioning and save time and get pixel perfection easily then float. Guide me Thanks in advance. Update 1: these are common elements of website. should i use positioning for any of them? The Header ---logo ---serch box ---The Navigation Menu ---top links ---Breadcrumbs The Text Area ---Paragraphs ---images( left , right or center align) ---Tables ---vertical ordered and unordered list The Sidebar ---vertical ordered and unordered list The Footer ---copyright ---Important Links (horizontal list) Form elements Update 2: Does positioning have any Compatibility issue(including IE6) than float? Is positioning is only good for fixed width design or it's good for both liquid and fixed?
