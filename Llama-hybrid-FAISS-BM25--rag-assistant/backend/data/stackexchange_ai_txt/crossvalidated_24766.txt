Is a Bayesian network doing feature selection?

I have just started playing around and reading about Bayes Nets. Here is a snippet of code using the bnlearn package in R, which seems to be a fantastic tool. install.packages("bnlearn") library(bnlearn) data This graph that is fit using the hill climbing algorithm has two nodes that are not directed: Outlook and wind. Is it fair to say that these random variables are unrelated to the others and a sort of feature selection is occurring?
