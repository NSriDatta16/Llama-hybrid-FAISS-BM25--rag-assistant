Too go slightly off on a tangent here, it is also perfectly possible to split the solution up on multiple source folders, but still have them in the same package. It won't make the organization of the source code particularly "organized" or nice, though. Then each source directory can contain a package named exactly the same (since the directory part of the package name is always relative), and when it is all compiled, they will belong to the same package. Here's a handy reference . That would result in something like this workspace --+-- src1 -- mypackage + -- Foo.java | + -- Bar.java +-- src2 -- mypackage + -- Baz.java where you can still access all the stuff in the files without explicitly importing them.
