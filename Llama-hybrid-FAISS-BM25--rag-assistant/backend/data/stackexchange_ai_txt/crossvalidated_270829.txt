Random forest regression produce different importance ranking

I've been working a random forest regression model with my own datasets using the randomForest package. The model produces a % var explained of ~27%. I also used the importance() function to produce a ranking of the relative importance of the variables, but everytime I use a different number for the set.seed() function, the random forest model produces a different ranking. It should be mentioned that I have several variables whose importance are relatively close. I am wondering is there a consistent way to produce the ranking of the variable importance?
