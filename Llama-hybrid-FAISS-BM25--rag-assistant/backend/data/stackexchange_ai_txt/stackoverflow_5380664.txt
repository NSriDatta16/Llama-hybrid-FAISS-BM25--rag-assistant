you will need to find the k'th smallest element using 'selection algorithm', which is O(n), and then iterate the array again and return each element which is smaller/equals it. selection algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm you will have to pay attention if you have repeats: you will need to make sure you are not returning more then k elements (it is possible if for instance you have 1,2,...,k,k,k,...) EDIT : the full algorithm, and returning a list, as requested: let the array be A 1. find the k'th element in A using 'selection algorithm', let it be 'z' 2. initialize an empty list 'L' 3. initialize counter note here that a 3rd iteration is required if your list might have duplicates. if it can't - it is needless, just change the condition in 4.1 to also note: L.add is inserting an element to a linked list and thus is O(1).
