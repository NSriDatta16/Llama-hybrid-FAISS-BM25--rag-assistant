Handling aggregate and individual data input to neural networks?

Consider a scenario where I have a lot of aggregate data as well as individual data that makes up that aggregated data. For example, Rotten Tomatoes, where aggregate data would be movie tags and overall critic and audience rankings, while the individual data would be each review. Is it possible to treat this as input to a neural network? Do I just repeat the corresponding aggregated data when feeding in each individual review to be classified? Is there a better way to do this?
