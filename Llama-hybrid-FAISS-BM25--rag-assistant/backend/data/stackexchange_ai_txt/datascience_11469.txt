How would I chi-squared test these simple results from A/B experiment?

I have results from an A/B experiment where users could do one of three things: Watch, Interact, or Nothing My data is like this: Watch | Nothing | Interact A: 327445 | 271602 | 744702 B: 376455 | 140737 | 818204 I tried to use the chisquared test bundled with scipy. I'm completely new to data science, but I believe this is the evaluation metric I would want. scipy.stats.chisquare([ [327445, 271602, 744702], [376455, 140737, 818204] ]) Power_divergenceResult(statistic=array([ 3412.38826538, 41532.93339946, 3456.72996585]), pvalue=array([ 0., 0., 0.])) This does not look like a valid result... I even tried adding an expected frequencies options, but without success. Maybe I'm missing something, either about evaluating this type of data or just not using scipy correctly. Can anyone help me?
