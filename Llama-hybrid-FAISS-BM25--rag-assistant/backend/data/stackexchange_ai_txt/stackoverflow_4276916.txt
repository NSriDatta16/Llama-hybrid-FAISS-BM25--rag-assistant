You need not only your OS to support multi-touch, but your controls too. Have you done the Hands on Labs for MFC and Multitouch? http://channel9.msdn.com/learn/courses/Windows7/Multitouch has several Native and MFC examples. If you don't have a real need in your app for two sliders moving at once, but were just trying it out, try something a little different, like zooming by pinching or panning by dragging two fingers, rotating etc. If you want multiple independent touches (ie not interpreted as a pinch zoom) the source code for games is your best examples.
