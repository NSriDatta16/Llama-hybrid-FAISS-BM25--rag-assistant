Model not singular but doesn't converge what could be the reason (lme4 in R)

I'm following up on this great answer regarding running Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover the reason behind lack of convergence and/or singularity for Mixed-Effects models. My model below doesn't convergence, however, I wonder why I don't get a convergence when model is not singular? NOTE: When we drop the correlation between intercepts and slope the model below becomes singular! i.e., lmer(math ~ ses*sector + (ses || sch.id), data = dat) library(lme4) dat
