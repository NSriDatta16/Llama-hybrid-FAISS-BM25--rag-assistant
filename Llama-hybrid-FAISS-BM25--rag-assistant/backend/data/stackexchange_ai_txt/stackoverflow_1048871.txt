How to change the format of specified lines in a RichTextBox

I have a winforms RichTextBox containing lots of lines of text (eg 2 MB text files), and would like to programmatically change the formatting of specified lines, eg highlighting them. How can I address the lines, rather than the characters? Is a RichTextBox even the best control for this sort of thing, or is there another alternative? I have tried the Infragistics UltraFormattedTextEditor, but it was at least a couple of orders of magnitude slower to display text, so no good for my longer files. Thanks!
