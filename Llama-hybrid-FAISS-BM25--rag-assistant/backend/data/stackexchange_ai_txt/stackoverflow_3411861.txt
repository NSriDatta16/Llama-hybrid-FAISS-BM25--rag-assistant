Using CSS instead of an image for logo, how do I...?

Ok so above is an image of pretty much what I'm trying to do. You see how the logo has a solid background behind it that reaches to the VERY top of the page (so there's no white at the top)... that's what I'm trying to do. This is my html for that part: NAME / SLOGAN HOME ABOUT SUBSCRIBE FAQ CONTACT LOGIN I'm pretty sure I could just add a image and position it there for the wrapper, so my logo would be over it, but I think that would be pretty inefficient. I mean there's just two solid colors, black and white... so couldn't that be done with CSS? When I tried to do it I ended up with a "block"... not what I wanted. There was still white at the very top. I want it more to be like, say, someone cut a piece out of the paper (where the black is) if that makes sense.
