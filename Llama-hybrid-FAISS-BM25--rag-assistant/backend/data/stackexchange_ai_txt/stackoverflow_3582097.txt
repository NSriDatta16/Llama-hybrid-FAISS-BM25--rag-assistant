I have somewhat the same problem. Have a project that is organizationally under a main project, but is not to be build with the main project. It is sat up as a standalone build on Hudson. Illustration: main sub1 sub2 sub3 So I thought that I could just add "/trunk/sub3/.*" in the "Excluded regional" field under the "Source Code Management" in the Hudson? But this does not seem to have any effect. The main project builds when I do changes under the sub3 project. Thought this was the intention of the "exluded regions" field.
