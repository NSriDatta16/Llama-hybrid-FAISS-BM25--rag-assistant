The difference between the two approaches is actually a difference between an Empirical Bayes versus a fully Bayesian approach to estimate the same thing. If you fit the mixed model using maximum likelihood, then you typically follow the first option, whereas, under the fully Bayesian approach from which you take posterior samples also for $\theta$ , you would go for the second one. I would not expect to see big differences with regard to point estimates between the two. But if you are also interested in the variance of these estimates, then the second approach accounts for the uncertainty in estimating $\theta$ whereas the first one does not. You could still use the second approach to get $\mathbf{b}_{\mathrm{new}}$ even you fit the model with maximum likelihood by approximating the posterior distribution of the parameters $[\theta \mid \mathcal{Y}]$ with a multivariate normal distribution with mean the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and covariance matrix the variance-covariance matrix of the MLEs.
