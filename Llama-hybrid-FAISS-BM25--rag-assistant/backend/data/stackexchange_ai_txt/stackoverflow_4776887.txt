If I'm following you correctly, you don't need to create any new handles in the layout files, you just need to re-assign the page template to use for the product page. In catalog.xml you'll see the xml that sets the page template for product pages as: Catalog Product View (Any) page/2columns-right.phtml ... In your theme's copy of catalog.xml or in a local.xml file just change the page template to be used on product pages using the existing handle for product pages . Use code like this: page/product-list.phtml ... That'll be enough to have Magento pull in your page template instead of one of its default templates. No need to declare your page template additionally in page.xml unless you want it to show up in drop-downs in the Admin Panel as well.
