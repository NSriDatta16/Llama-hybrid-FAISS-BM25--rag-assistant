Accounting Student taking Master in Stat, need your help regarding taking subjects

I had a Bachelor in Accounting and now I'm doing a Masters in Statistics. This is my first semester and I have to Choose at least 3 out of 6 offered subjects for this semester. These subjects Are: Mathematics for Statistics Applied Modeling Regression Analysis Bayesian Statistics Categorical Data Analysis Survival Analysis I'm going to take Math for sure as I believe its the base to understand the other courses. The problem is that I'm not sure what are the other 2 subjects that I should take. The reason behind this doubt is that my background in math is still not solid. So, I'm trying to know which two of these courses are the least dependent on math.
