In your case, the model binding will only fail when your views fail to follow the framework conventions. The first sign of that happening, is when your view doesn't show the expected result. The next one would probably be when your WatiN tests fail on posts. Technically, yes, this is indirect testing, but also the most pragmatic one. How would you else verify that all views adhere to the conventions, other than observe that they work?
