Fuzzy name and nickname match

I have a dataset with the following structure: full_name,nickname,match Christian Douglas,Chris,1, Jhon Stevens,Charlie,0, David Jr Simpson,Junior,1 Anastasia Williams,Stacie,1 Lara Williams,Ana,0 John Williams,Willy,1 where each predictor row is a pair full name, nickname, and the target variable, match, which is 1 when the nickname corresponds to the person with that name and 0 otherwise. As you can see, the way the nickname is obtained from the full name doesn't follow a particular pattern. I want to train an ML algorithm that, given the pair full name, nickname, predict the probability of match. My baseline is just trying to see the number of carachters that match, and features like that. However, I am thinking about an NLP approach using deep learning. My question is wether there are neural network architectures that are specific of this problem.
