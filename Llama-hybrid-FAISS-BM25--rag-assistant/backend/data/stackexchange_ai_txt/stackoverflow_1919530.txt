Flex: How can I drag the actual element rather than a proxy?

I'm trying to implement a dragging system which can only be described as similar to dragging the map on Google Maps. I can set up dragging easily in Flex, but unfortunately the standard model of dragging i.e. dragging an element proxy and dropping it in another element is not what I'm after. Is there anything built into flex where the actual element rather than a proxy can be repositioned in a different place within the same parent? Or will I have to hand code something using mouse events as you would if implementing a solution in JavaScript? Cheers, Chris
