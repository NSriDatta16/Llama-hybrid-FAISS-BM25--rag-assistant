iphone table view scrolls to bottom when launch

I am following Chapter 5 in O'Reilly Learning iPhone Programming. When I launch the app in Xcode, the list will scroll straight away to the bottom. When I try to drag the tableview upwards, it will go back to the last row when I release my mouse. Unfortunately I am unable to post the codes since it has many sections. Anyone has a clue what code might have caused this problem?
