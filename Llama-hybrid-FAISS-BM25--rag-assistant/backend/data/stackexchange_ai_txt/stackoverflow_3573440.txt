Most maintainable method to share code between multiple projects

Given multiple websites all running the same sourcecode, what's the best/most maintainable way to organise these into projects within visual studio? For example, say we have websites Red , Blue , and Green (etc). Their HTML may be different, but they are a functionally the same. Previously in one solution we have created one project Colour , which contains a generic version of the project. Red , Blue , and Green get their own project, and each technical page is set to use the C# in Colour . (That is, there's no unique C# for the individual implementations - all code files get removed). However, this approach leads us to ending up with multiple individual implementation dll's that do next to nothing, and also Other Stuff like javascript, css, and common images get duplicated accross projects. Ideally we'd like to be able to run each project in isolation, and sourcesafe sharing always seems like a terrible idea. Is there a Better Way? edit: forgot to mention, all business logic / data access is handled by a shared Business Layer project, so all the code for that is separate and shared.
