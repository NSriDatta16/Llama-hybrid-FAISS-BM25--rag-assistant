Is this a smart way to organize code in jQuery?

for the longest time I was writing all my code inside like this ... $(document).ready(function(){ $('.show_module').click(function(){ }); ... }); putting all sorts of click handlers in there. But recently I was introduced to a new way of doing things and I wanted to get a feel for if its a smart way of going about it. the idea is to have all the handlers in related functions and then have minimal code in document.ready above. So for example ... $(document).ready(function(){ page_handler(); // other functions follow }); function page_handler(){ $('.show_module').click(function(){ }); ... } This seems to allow organization of related handlers in functions and use document.ready as more of an initializer. I know in JavaScript functions and variables are 'hoisted' before code starts executing so do_something(); function do_something(){ } works for this reason, since the function is ready to use before do_something() is actually called, even though it appears before the actual function definition. I was wondering if the same thing happens here and how 'good' this idea/way of doing things is.
