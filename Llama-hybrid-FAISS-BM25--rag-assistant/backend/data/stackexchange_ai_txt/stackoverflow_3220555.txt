SQL Query to find the maximum of a set of averages

This is a query based on the Northwind Database in MS SQL Server 2005. First I have to get the average of the UnitPrice from OrderDetails table, and group it by ProductID for that particular column alone and alias it as AveragePrice. Then I need to find the maximum(AveragePrice) which is nothing but the max of previous column, how can I do it??? This is a kind of very tricky for me its taking me ages to think on it. select O.CustomerID, E.EmployeeID, E.FirstName+space(1)+E.LastName FullName, OD.OrderID, OD.ProductID, (select avg(DO.UnitPrice) from OrderDetails DO where OD.ProductID = DO.ProductID group by DO.ProductID) AveragePrice , from OrderDetails OD join Orders O on OD.OrderID = O.OrderID join Customers C on C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID join Employees E on E.EmployeeID = O.EmployeeID This is not a Homework question, am learning SQL, but am really stuck at this point, please help me.
