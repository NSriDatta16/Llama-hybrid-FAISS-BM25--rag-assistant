Using glmer to estimate treatment interactions

In my data, I have two treatment conditions with repeated measures for each subject. I would like to run a mixed logistic regression separately for each of my two conditions where my binary outcome DV (dependent variable) is regressed on my IV (independent variable) and also have a random slope and intercept fitted for each subject. So, I run the following: modelT0 In the above, D0 and D1 are data sets restricted to treatment conditions 0 and 1, respectively. What I would like to do is compare the estimated fixed effects coefficient on IV across conditions to see if it significantly changes. To do this, I pool D0 and D1 into a single data set, D, and create a treatment indicator that takes value 0 in D0 and 1 in D1. I then run: model I should be able to look at the fixed effects coefficient on treatment:IV to get my answer, but the issue is that for whatever combination of random effects I seem to specify, the coefficients from the pooled regression are slightly different from the regressions specified by treatment. So for instance, the fixed effect coefficient on treatment:IV plus the one on IV in model is not equal to the coefficient on IV in model1. Any idea about what I might be doing wrong or how to answer the question I have? Thanks! EDIT: As per Henrik's suggestion, I'm copying the random effects output of the models below: summary(modelT0): Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. subject (Intercept) 1.412e-07 0.0003758 subject.1 IV 1.650e+00 1.2844341 summary(modelT1): Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. subject (Intercept) 0.00378 0.06148 subject.1 IV 0.26398 0.51379 summary(model): Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.
