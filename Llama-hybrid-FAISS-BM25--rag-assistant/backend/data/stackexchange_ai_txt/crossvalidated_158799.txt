One common approach to de-correlation is principal component analysis . In your example above "revenue" and "income" would be combined into a single component that would reflect their linear dependence. The cool thing about PCA is you also get a second component that captures situations where revenue/income do not have the expected linear relationship. (e.g. income is unusually low for a given revenue number).
