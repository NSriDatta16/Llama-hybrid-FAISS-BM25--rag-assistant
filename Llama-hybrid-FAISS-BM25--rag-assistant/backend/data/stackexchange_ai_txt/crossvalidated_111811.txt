Write the problem as a Markov chain with nodes representing the different states of the system: how many balls are in each bucket (considering that you can exchange the first two buckets): (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 0, 0), â€¦ I think there are 48 important states. Calculate the edge probabilities of going from one state to another. Then, calculate the probability of hitting state (2,2,3,1) by iteratively filling the probabilities of arriving at the other 47 states. In computer science, this technique is called dynamic programming . I.e., P(0,0,0,0) = 1 P(0,1,0,0) = 1/4 P(1,1,0,0) = 1/4 P(1,0,0) + 1/4 P(0,1,0) = 1/8 etc.
