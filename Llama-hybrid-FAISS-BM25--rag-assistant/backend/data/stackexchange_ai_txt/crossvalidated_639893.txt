K-means clustering - weird PCA visualization

I performed PCA on 4 variables and are shown in this visualization: At first look it doesn't look convincing and the some clusters seem weird. The data was cleaned and standardized beforehand. Only continues variables with plausible skew were used. Used variables: PURCHASES: Amount of purchases made using the account ONEOFF_PURCHASES: Maximum amount spent on a single one-off purchase INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: Amount of purchases made in installments CASH_ADVANCE: Amount paid in advance by the customer When analyzing relative importance the outcomes make sense: Distributions: Distributions before standarization: Can I draw some conclusion from this graph? Are my clusters wrong?
