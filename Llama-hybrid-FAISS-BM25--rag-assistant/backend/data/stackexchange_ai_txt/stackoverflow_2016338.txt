I use a database with a table called config or settings. The table has two columns: name [varchar(255)] value [varchar(255)] This allows the easy storage of int's, float's, and short strings. Then I create two functions, GetSetting and SetSetting. These store a row and retrieve a row, respectively. I find that this simplifies the storing of values tremendously.
