InvalidOperationException: PostBack Trigger Cannot Find a Control within the ItemTemplate of a DataList

I would like to trigger a PostBack when the asp:LinkButton "addToCartButton" is clicked (see code below). I have declared a PostBack Trigger with the asp:UpdatePanel "updPnlProductsList" (see code below). Product listing &nbsp; Product Description In Stock Price &nbsp; Buy " CommandName="add_to_cart" class="newactionbutton" /> &nbsp; Unfortunately, when I run this code I get the error: InvalidOperationException: A control with ID 'addToCartButton' could not be found for the trigger in UpdatePanel 'updPnlProductsList'. Would someone please help me reference the 'addToCartButton' within the ItemTemplate of the DataList. Or maybe I can cause a PostBack in the asp:LinkButton code behind? I'm coding in C#. Kind Regards Walter
