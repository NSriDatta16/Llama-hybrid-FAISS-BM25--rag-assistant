Cash-flow prediction with machine learning

In our company we have huge incoming cash flows every day. Having a very good prediction on the incoming cash flows for the next working day would be for various reasons very useful. As for the data: I have every incoming payment of the last 2 years. Every transaction has the actual day of the payment, the day on which we expected the payment to be received, the amount of money paid and an unique identifier for the user. Of course we are only interested in the aggregated payments for one day. Due to our business we have a strong seasonality around the first working day of the month and an even bigger peak for the first working day of the year. How would you try to model something like that? I know that LSTM is often used for time series forecasting, but would that also be a good idea to try that out in our case? Or from experience do you have an idea which other model might be suitable for this prediction task?
