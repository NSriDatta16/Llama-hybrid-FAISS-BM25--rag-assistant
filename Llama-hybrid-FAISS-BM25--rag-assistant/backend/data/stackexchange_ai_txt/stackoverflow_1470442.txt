Are you ever calling Zend_Auth::getInstance()->getStorage()->write($identity) ? If you are authenticating through Zend_Auth::getInstance()->authenticate($adapter) it will write to storage for you, but if you are calling authenticate directly on the adapter, you are responsible for writing the identity to the storage.
