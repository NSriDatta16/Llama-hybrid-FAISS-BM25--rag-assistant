There are a number of useful tutorials to get you started. One simple approach is to create your new view using interface builder - the class you have already created. Now in your first tableview, you need to place code in the didSelectRowAtIndexPath to call the next tableview. If your class is something like SubView you would do something along the lines of... SubView * aview = [[SubView alloc] init]; aview.someproperty=index.path; [self presentModalViewController:aview animated:YES]; [aview release]; The code you use to do the above will depend on exactly how you want the subviews to load - and how you have written them to display the data you need. iPhone programming is not drag and drop. You have a lot to learn. The above should get you started, but I suggest you try some of the sample applications on the apple site and carry on from there.
