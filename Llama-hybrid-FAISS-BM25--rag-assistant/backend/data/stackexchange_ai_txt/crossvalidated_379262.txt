How many candidate models to include in AIC model selection?

Is there a rule of thumb, perhaps related to sample size, for how many models to include in AIC model selection? Too many may seem like fishing while too few would be insufficient. I'm familiar with the guideline of not more than one predictor variable per 10 measures, is there something similar for how many candidate models one should create? I've based my candidate models off hypotheses, but the number of candidate models quickly grows when I also model each variable separately, reduce my top performing models in various ways, and throw in some candidate versions including random effects. In my particular case, I am comparing logistic regression models using different combinations of the same 13 covariates, some including a random effect of individual and some not. My sample size is 520. I'm looking for advice for comparing models of the same general form
