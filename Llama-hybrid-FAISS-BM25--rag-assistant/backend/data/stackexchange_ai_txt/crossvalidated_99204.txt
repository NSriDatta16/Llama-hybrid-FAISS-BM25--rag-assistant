JAGS error re length mismatch in Node

I am trying to specify a logistic regression model in JAGS. I am encountering an error I haven't seen before, and haven't found a solution online. I would appreciate if anyone knew what was happening. data When I run this model I get the following error message: Error in jags.model("model.txt", data = Data, n.chains = 4, n.adapt = 1000) : Error in node dunif((-10),10) Length mismatch in Node::setValue
