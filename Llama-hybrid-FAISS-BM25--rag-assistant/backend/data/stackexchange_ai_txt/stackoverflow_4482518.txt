Setting up an 'environment' for an embedded Lua Script

I am embedding a Lua interpreter in a C++ application. I want to setup an 'environment' for running scripts, such that certain variables are made available to all scripts. For example, I want to expose READ ONLY objects Foo and FooBar to scripts, such that Foo and FooBar are available to all running scripts. Does anyone know how I can do this?. A snippet to show how to so this would be very useful.
