Is XML the best data interchange format when importing large amounts of data as a scripted routine in PHP?

If I have 50,000-100,000 product skus with accompanying information, including specifications and descriptions, that needs to be updated on a regular basis (at least once a day), is XML the best way to go as a data interchange format? The application is written in PHP, and I'm thinking SimpleXML to PHP's native MySQL calls (as opposed to using application hooks to dump data into the appropriate location in the DB). The server will be Linux-based, and I will have full root access. I know this is a rather generic question, which is why I made it community wiki -- I'm looking for an overall approach that is considered best practice. If it matters the application is Magento.
