I found the answer that I was looking for, though not from the comments. Thank you, though for your help. It turns out that MVC guru Rob Conery posted some time ago about using a PagedList. It's elegant pattern and according to the blog, ScottGu has used it in demos. Basically, instead of using IList and List , you use IPagedList and PagedList . PagedList : List , IPagedList . public interface IPagedList { int TotalCount { get; set; } int PageIndex { get; set; } int PageSize { get; set; } bool IsPreviousPage { get; } bool IsNextPage { get; } } There's more code to it, so check out Rob's blog. http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/aspnet-mvc-pagedlistt/
