MCMC - How to derive the acceptance ratio from Markov chain detailed balance?

Please explain how the acceptance ratio: $$\rm A(x\to y) =\min\left(1,\frac{P(y)q(y\to x) }{P(x) q(x\to y) }\right)$$ is derived from the detailed balance: $$\rm \frac{A(x\to y) }{A(y\to x)}=\frac{P(y)q(y\to x) }{P(x) q(x\to y) } .$$ Reading the articles but not sure how the ratio is logically derived from the detailed balance.
