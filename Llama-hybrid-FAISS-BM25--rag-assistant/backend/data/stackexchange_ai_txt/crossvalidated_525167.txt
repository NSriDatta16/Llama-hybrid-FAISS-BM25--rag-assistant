Box-Jenkins methodology in a Bayesian framework

I would like to know if the well-known Box-Jenkins methodology for time series analysis transfer directly in a Bayesian framework. For instance, does one analyze the autocorrelation plot and the partial autocorrelation plot before fitting the model? And what about testing for stationarity ? Thanks a lot
