If you are using R8, I guess you could use the DXL utilities to export the attachments uncompressed (via the UncompressAttachments property) and in an agent and dump that to the web browser. Prior to R8, you get the attachment with whatever compression the database uses. With earlier version of Notes, you can get an stream of the EmbeddedObject with Java. This seems to detach the attachment to a temporary file "under the hood".
