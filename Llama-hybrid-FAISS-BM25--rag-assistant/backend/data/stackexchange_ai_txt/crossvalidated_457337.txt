Yes there is but you need less aggregated data. You now only have 5 data points which is usually not enough for statistical testing. Could you maybe get the monthly or even daily data? When comparing 2 years you can do a t-test on the daily data for example with incident rate as numerical and year as grouping variable. When choosing to do a time series analyses you can try to predict incident rate with time using for example a regression analysis. If that is significant it means there is significant change over time in incidence rate. However, for both you need more detailed data! If not possible you can just compare the differences without any statistical testing and use your common sense.
