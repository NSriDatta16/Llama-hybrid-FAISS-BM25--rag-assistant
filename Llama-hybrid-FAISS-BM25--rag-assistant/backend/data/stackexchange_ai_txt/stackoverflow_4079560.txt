Let JavaEE Server log transaction informations

I'm developing Java EE 6-applications on GlassFish for some months now, but I still have the feeling that I don't fully understand how the container managed transactions (and the implications on the persistence context) work - although I have read a lot about the underlying basics. To get a better understanding, I would find it interesting if there was a possibility to let the Java EE-Server (for instance GlassFish) write to the log file when it starts/commits/rollbacks a transaction. Is that possible somehow?
