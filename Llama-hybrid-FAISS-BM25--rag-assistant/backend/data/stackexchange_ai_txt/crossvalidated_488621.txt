Does it make sense to use Focal loss for a tree based classifier like XGBoost?

I am working on a classification problem with an imbalanced data (0.2% of positive class). I've seen people using Focal Loss in deep learning in order to help the model focus on hard examples more. I'd like to know if this objective function could be used in a tree based model like Xgboost or LightGBM, any literature on the subject would be welcome as well.
