TortoiseSVN works perfectly fine for me on Windows 7, didn't have to do anything to make it work - just installed out of the box and been running fine ever since. Chances are there is actually something up with your SVN repo. Try entering c:\webserver\SVMRepository instead (if the repo is actually on your local machine). Otherwise, I would suggest using a simplified SVN server like VisualSVN for Windows, which does make life a lot easier, even for experienced developers.
