Gigantic arrays

I'm planning to store gigantic arrays into serialized files and read from them in order to display data within them. The idea is to have a simple, document-oriented, filesystem database. Can anyone tell me if this would be a performance issue? Is it going to be slow or very fast? Is it worth, filesystem is always really faster?
