As the reference for ContextMenu says, You cannot remove the Settings menu item from the context menu. The Settings menu item is required in Flash so that users can access the settings that affect privacy and storage on their computers. You also cannot remove the About menu item, which is required so that users can find out what version of Flash Player they are using. So you'll just have to live with the Settings and About items. For other default items, see the reference for ContextMenuBuiltInItems .
