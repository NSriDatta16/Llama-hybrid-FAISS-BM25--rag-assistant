In SQLite, "integer" is a 64-bit int, which is a long in C#. I suspect that's not the problem, though. SQLite does not enforce data types (except for integer primary key columns), so it's entirely possible that you have a record that has, say, a string stored in an integer column. This would explain the strange behavior where it sometimes works but sometimes does not (only the problem record would cause errors). After running into this scenario myself, I've changed my edmx file to always treat SQLite data as strings, e.g., a DefiningQuery of SELECT RowId, CAST ([data1] AS TEXT) AS [data1], CAST ([data2] AS TEXT) AS [data2], CAST ([data3] AS TEXT) AS [data3] FROM table1 with matching Insert/Update/Delete "stored procedures" defined in StorageModels .
