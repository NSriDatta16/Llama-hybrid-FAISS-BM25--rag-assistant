Feature engineering for interest-based age classification

I have a dataset which has users (rows) with the list of their interests (IABs), which looks like this user_id | gender | list of interests --------+--------+-------------------------------- user 1 | male | games, productivity user 2 | female | games, lifestyle, design user 3 | male | travel, games, messaging user 4 | male | messaging, blogging, lifestyle ... Since the number of unique interests are few (~500) and the number of rows are high (~67M), what are the feature engineering practices that I should follow to get an ML model score a better accuracy? P.S.: Simple model with one hot/count hot vectorization yields an accuracy of ~52%
