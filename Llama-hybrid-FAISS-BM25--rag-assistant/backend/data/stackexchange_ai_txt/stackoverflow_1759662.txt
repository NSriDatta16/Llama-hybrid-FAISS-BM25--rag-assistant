Text shadow in IE, alternatives

I have a need for text-shadow for inline, long, paragraph text in IE. I understand progressive enhancement, but the situation is different. I do absolutely need text-shadow, it's not a design issue, but a matter central to the function of my app. In any case, IE does not support CSS text-shadow. What are some alternatives? I know that some fonts have outlines that creates a similar effect as text-shadows, but does IE support web-unsafe fonts? What about dynamic image replacement? Is that a viable tactic? I'm thinking probably not, considering the length of the text. Does anyone have any suggestions? I've also considered forcing google chrome frame, but that's sort of a last resort thing if there are no other viable strategies. Thanks.
