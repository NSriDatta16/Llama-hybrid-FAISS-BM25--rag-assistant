Researchers may want to know if a result is being driven by a few extreme observations. If no, then what you do about outliers is arguably a moot point . If yes, then it matters that you take a reasonable/correct approach for your situation because it affects the result! Some extreme examples: If the outliers are clear measurement error (eg. negative weight), then it would be crazy/insane to publish a result that's driven by these bogus observations. If you're estimating average returns and the outliers are negative -100% returns (eg. firm bankruptcy), then excluding them would be dishonest/insane.
