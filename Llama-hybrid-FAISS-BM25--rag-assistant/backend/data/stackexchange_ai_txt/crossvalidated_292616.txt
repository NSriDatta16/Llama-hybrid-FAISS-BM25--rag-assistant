Meaning of Stationarity

If I have a time series that is completely non-stationary, that is, there is no way I can make it stationary (cannot see a deterministic trend and so on...), does it mean that I cannot make any prediction based exclusively on this time series? Shortly: Non-stationarity $\Rightarrow$ no prediction possible ?
