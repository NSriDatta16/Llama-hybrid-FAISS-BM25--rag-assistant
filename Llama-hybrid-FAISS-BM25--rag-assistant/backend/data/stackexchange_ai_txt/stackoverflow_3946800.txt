A lot of people think of maven in terms of dependency resolution, which admittedly is a big feature. But the most prominent purpose of maven IMHO is to provide a model for building a project that consists of a fixed build life-cycle where actions can be hooked into predefined phases. Thus providing a structure that simplifies the build and makes the build descriptor more readable. You immediately know by looking at the pom file what custom actions are hooked into the build and at what phases, whether tests are being executed or not, etc. building a war or a jar is similar for different projects and you can predict where to find information, this is as opposed to the 'free-form' style provided by ant where targets can be written and organized in a lot of different ways.
