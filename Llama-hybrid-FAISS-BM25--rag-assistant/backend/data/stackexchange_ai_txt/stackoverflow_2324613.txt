Exception handling with RenderAction Asp.Net MVC

We are using renderaction provided by MVC futures. We've noticed that HttpExceptions in child action methods are not propagated to the parent action. Even though a fragment has failed, we still see the parent request resulting in a 200, and this throws our error handling for a toss. Any suggestions on how this could be handled? Thanks, Varun
