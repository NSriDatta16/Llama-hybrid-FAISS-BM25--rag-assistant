Don't think image should really be last resort. You have no control over the HTML/CSS of the source page, so even if you craft a solution (probably by using JavaScript to parse out the desired snippet) there is no guarantee that tomorrow the site doesn't decide to change its layout. Even Jeff, who has control over the layout of stackoverflow.com, still prefers to screen-capture the site, rather than pull in the contents live. Now if your goal was to have the contents auto-update, that would be a different story. But still, unless you use some agreed-upon method of sharing content, such as RSS, your solution would be very fragile.
