VB.NET - WinForms - Prevent UserControl's resources being copied into the Form's local resource

I have a simple windows Forms application where in I have a usercontrol called "MyControl" derived from PictureBox. In this MyControl, I have the following code : Sub New() MyBase.New() Me.BackgroundImage = My.Resources.MyImage 'This is a project resource image End Sub Now when I drag and drop this MyControl into a form, I get the image and also those stuff. But the problem is that the BackgroundImage is being copied into the Form's local .resx file. So when I look into the form.designer file, I find the following : Me.MyControl1.BackgroundImage = CType(resources.GetObject("MyControl1.BackgroundImage"), System.Drawing.Image) This is a problem and also when I try to change the image in the control, it does not get reflected in the form's control instance. So this is a pain. How can this be solved? Guess this is going to be trial and error research, but please help.
