Your response variable is suspicious. If it is a continuous proportion, you may want to pursue beta regression (I have an example of a BR in R here: Remove effect of factor on continuous proportion data using regression in R . If it is the outcome of some number of Bernoulli trials (and you know the number), you should disaggregate and use logistic regression (or use a weighted LR). The following assumes the data are simply from a continuous variable, and happen to be within the (0, 1) interval. I think most of this may be covered by my answer here: Alternatives to one-way ANOVA for heteroscedastic data . In general, permutation tests are not recommended when you have heteroscedasticity. In your case, I might suggest using ordinal logistic regression. Since you have a 2x2, the post-hoc tests are just two 2-group comparisons, which could be done by repeating the original analysis on the stratified data. Under the assumption that the global test of the initial model is significant, I wouldn't even worry about multiple comparisons.
