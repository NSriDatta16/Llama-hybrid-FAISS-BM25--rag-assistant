The short answer is, "Yes, You can". What everyone said about provisioning, and multiple devices and everything was correct. From a simplistic point of view - when you run your app in the debugger (connected to the iPhone) - it actually installs it on your iPhone. So when/if you disconnect the phone from the debugger - it's still on your iPhone - and can be run just as any normal app. (With respect to your other question) You can provision certificates for up to 100 devices. So if your friend has a device, you can get his "UDID" (avaialble via iTunes). You can email him a provisioning profile (you generate) for his device and a copy of your app (provisioned under that profile). He drags-and-drops both into iTunes - syncs, and he has the app running on his machine. Note that these types of certificates only last for 3 months - so you'll need to generate a new one for him - or give him a "real" copy from the AppStore after release.
