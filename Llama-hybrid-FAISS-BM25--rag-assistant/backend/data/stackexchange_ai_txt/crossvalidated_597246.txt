Finding users who will buy. Intractable Numbers

I'm facing the following problem. I think I have it formulated right, but unsure how to proceed. Here is the problem statement. Assume there are $N$ users. For each user, I've an estimated probability that they would take an action. Call this $1- p_i$ . Now the $p_i$ is a p-value, an output from a hypothesis test, that tests whether they would not take the action; hence the term $1-p_i$ . So its not strictly the probability that the user would take an action. I want to estimate how many users in aggregate $T$ can I expect to take the action. A simplistic approach would be to simply sum up the probabilities $$ T = \sum_{i}^{N}1\times (1-p_i) $$ Would this be accurate? I'm concerned that the $p_i$ 's are not strictly probabilities so the above summation would not yield the expected total. Another approach I tried was the following. I replaced all the $p_i$ with an overall average $p$ (assume this is acceptable and their distributio is quite tight)/ The probability that at least one user would take an action is $1 - P(None)$ = $1 - p^{N}$ . Likewise the probability that at least 2 users would take an action is $1- {N \choose 2} p^{2}$ and so on. For $k$ users to take the action, it works out to $1-{N\choose k}p^{k}$ . The first question I have is Is the first / second method accurate? If yes, how do I go about computing these large numbers that may come out of computing the ${N \choose k}p^{k}$
