Google now has a way for you to enable crawling on AJAX pages. If your links contain "#!", then google will change that to "?_escaped_fragment_=" and request that document from your server. However, when it shows that page in the search results, it will show the original URL with the "#!". http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/learn-more.html
