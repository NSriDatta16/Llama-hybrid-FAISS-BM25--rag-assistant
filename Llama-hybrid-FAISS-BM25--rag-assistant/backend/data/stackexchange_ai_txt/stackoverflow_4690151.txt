Zend Sqlite utf 8

sorry to bother you. I'm wondering if using utf 8 in sqlite is the same of mysql therefore it's enough set this lines in application.ini resources.db.adapter = "PDO_SQLITE" resources.db.params.dbname = APPLICATION_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook.db" resources.db.params.charset = UTF8 resources.db.isDefaultTableAdapter = true or I should do a query in my bootstrap like PRAGMA encoding = "UTF-8"; BTW where does zf do the work (I mean in which class) ? Bye.
