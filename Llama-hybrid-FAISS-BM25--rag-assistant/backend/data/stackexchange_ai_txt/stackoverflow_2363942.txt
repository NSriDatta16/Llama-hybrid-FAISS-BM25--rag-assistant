I'm seeing blog comments on a system protected by reCAPTCHA where the page loads and 1 second later the post was made successfully. The User-Agent was nonsense (in this particular case it claimed to be running Ubuntu 9.25/Firefox 3.8), the referrer was from a completely unrelated site with no link to us. This is clearly automated.
