Skills that school doesn't teach you

I'll be graduating soon with a master's degree in electrical engineering. I have a lot of experience with the theoretical side of machine learning through courses and research, but all of my experience with ML/data science is through Matlab. Does anybody have insight as to skills that employers will expect me to add before I get a job? I've been looking at postings and it seems like most of the things that I'm not as sharp with are: SQL, Hadoop, Python, and R. Are Python and R both necessary, or would that be redundant? Is SQL and Hadoop something employers will overlook? Because quite frankly I find learning both to be unbearably boring. Lastly, am I missing anything from this list of skills?
