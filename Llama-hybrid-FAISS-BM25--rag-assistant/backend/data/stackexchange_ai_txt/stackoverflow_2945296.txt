I tried using centerOffset and for some reason the image was in the right position when zoomed in, but as you zoomed the map out the image would move away from where it was supposed to be. The fix to this was setting the image frame with the offset. Here's the code I used (You can leave out the callout stuff if you don't have a callout), I used the pins from here ) #pragma mark MKMapViewDelegate - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)aMapView viewForAnnotation:(id )annotation { if(![annotation isKindOfClass:[MyAnnotation class]]) // Don't mess user location return nil; MKAnnotationView *annotationView = [aMapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:@"spot"]; if(!annotationView) { annotationView = [[MKAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:@"spot"]; annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure]; [(UIButton *)annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView addTarget:self action:@selector(openSpot:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; annotationView.enabled = YES; annotationView.canShowCallout = YES; annotationView.centerOffset = CGPointMake(7,-15); annotationView.calloutOffset = CGPointMake(-8,0); } // Setup annotation view annotationView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"pinYellow.png"]; // Or whatever return annotationView; } Adjust centerOffset and calloutOffset as needed to suit your image, and desired center point, and callout point.
