Prof. E. Parzen, perhaps somewhat envious that he didn't propose the innovative methods of Box and Jenkins, suggested this approach of over-fitting and then stepping down. It fails for many reasons (many of which Flounderer has nicely summarized), including not identifying and remedying Pulses, Level Shifts, Seasonal Pulses and Local Time Trends. Additionally, changes in parameters over time or changes in error variance over time need to be considered. I wrote a piece that you might be interested in. It is called "Regression vs Box-Jenkins" and is available from http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/24-regression-vs-box-jenkins One comment about Darlington's procedure reflecting time, time*time, time*time*time*time as predictors. In the absence of Intervention Detection leading to the isolation of outlier effects, it is quite possible (and incorrect!) to conclude for higher powers of time. Beware non-statisticians performing statistical analysis as you would be wary of statisticians performing brain surgery. In fairness one might also add beware of non-time series statisticians/mathematicians trying to perform time series analysis with limited training in time series analysis. Other posters (particularly whuber) on this list have repeatedly warned against using this "fitting approach", mostly in a univariate setting. This warning also applies to causal models. Hope this helps.
