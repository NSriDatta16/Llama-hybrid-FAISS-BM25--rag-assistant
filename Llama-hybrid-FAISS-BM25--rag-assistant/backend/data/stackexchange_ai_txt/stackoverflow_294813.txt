Embedding web browser window in Java

Does anyone know a way to open up an instance of the operating system (Windows/Linux/Mac) browser within a Swing window that is integrated into a Java application. No other actions would be performed other than opening a given URL. Currently, we open a new browser window because the Java embedded browsers have been insufficient. However, from a user interaction standpoint this is less than desirable. I'm curious if a solution for this was part of the 1.6 Java release. So far my google searching has not turned up anything of note. Are there any closed-source libraries that do this?
