In terms of tools there's a variety of IDEs available such as: FDT Flash Develop Flash Builder (formerly Flex Builder) Frameworks you might like to get started on: Flixel Push Button Engine Services you might want to look at: GamerSafe (mtx) Mochi Media (ads, social, mtx) Player IO (multiplayer + highly scalable user databases and file storage) Playtomic (analytics mostly ... disclaimer: it's mine) I have personally produced about 20 games now in Flash and also come from a .NET background (although I was using Flash first, just .NET most). I mostly use: Adobe Fireworks Adobe Flash (this is the least-programmer like IDE but the most visually creative one, it's difficult to wean yourself off of after a decade of the alternatives not existing) Adobe Flash Builder for the CPU/memory profiling is an invaluable component Kindisoft SecureSWF , I don't use this very much but depending on the nature of your game you might want to encrpyt/obfuscate your code since SWF files are very easy decoded / reconstructed into FLAs
