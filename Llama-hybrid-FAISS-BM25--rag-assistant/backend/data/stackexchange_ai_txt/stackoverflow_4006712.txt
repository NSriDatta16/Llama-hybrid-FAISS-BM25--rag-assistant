The Dictionary object is not adding new empty values with this approach. What it's doing is pre-allocating a backing storage for the data it will later be asked to add. The end goal being that the average insert case does not require an allocation to complete. Instead it finds a slot in the existing bucket array to place itself. The reasons for some of the other items you mentioned like prime numbers and hash code are properties common to most hashtable style implementations. Instead of going over them each here i'm going to point you to the wikipedia article on the subject http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
