Are there any Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) libraries for Javascript or PHP?

I find myself drawn to the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism for describing domain specific languages, but so far the implementation code I've found has been written in languages like Java and Haskell that aren't web server friendly in the shared hosting environment that my organization has to live with. Does anyone know of any PEG libraries or PackRat Parser Generators for Javascript or PHP? Of course code generators in any languages that can produce Javascript or PHP source code would do the trick.
