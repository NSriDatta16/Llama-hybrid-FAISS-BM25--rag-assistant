PHP Autoformat Paragraph tags

This is a fairly basic question however I've only ever managed to find three answers. I want to autoparagraph unformatted content that may or may not contain other html elements. The two good to go functions are the wordpress wpautop , HTMLPurifier AutoFormat.AutoParagraph and lastly some random addParagraphsNew . However the first is incompatible with my applications license, the second doesn't add line breaks within the paragraph tags and the third is flakey. Does anyone know on a commercially suitable licensed script that allows html content that has line breaks and double line breaks to be converted into and tags? I believe the HTMLPurifier option is probably the best way to go my hacking into the AutoFormat.AutoParagraph plugin to get it to add line breaks but I was hoping was something slightly easier. Lazy I know.
