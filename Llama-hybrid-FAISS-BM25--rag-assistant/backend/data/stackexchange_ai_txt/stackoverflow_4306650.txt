How to select a list item and show the details dynamically?

Im using jQTouch to make a mobile version of my website, and i need some help. Im using html5 storage feature. I have a list of jobs and I want to click on one job, and shows that job information in another div. This is my code: var uid; var job_name; for (var i=0; i ' + job_name + ' '); $("li#job_" + row['id']).bind('tap', function(){ $("#job_detail").html(row['id']); }); } The jobs are listing ok, but when I tap on one of them, always shows the last job. Thanks!
