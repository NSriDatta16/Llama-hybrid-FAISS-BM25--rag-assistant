Can't you approach this in a Bayesian way? Place a beta prior on $p$ , and then toss the coin repeatedly. After each toss, the posterior is updated and you check the amount of posterior probability for values above $p_0$ . Here is some rough code. I am assuming that p > p0, and using p0 = 0.5. # reference value p0 p0 prob_threshold = prob_threshold){ break } } As @whuber points out, you probably want some additional termination criterion. Here, I run at most 100 trials for example.
