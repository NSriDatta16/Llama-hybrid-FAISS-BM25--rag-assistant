Showing status of current request by AJAX

I'm trying to develop an application which modifies a couple of tasks of the famous Online-TODO List RememberTheMilk (rememberthemilk.com) using the REST API. Unfortunately the modifying takes a lot of time, so I want to give a feedback to the users. My idea was just to display a couple of text lines (e.g. modifying task 1 of n...). Therefore I used the periodically_call_remote on my page and called a which reads a Singleton. In the request I store the text that should be displayed in the same singleton. But I found out, that once I set up a request, the periodically_call_remote does not update the specified div. My question to this: 1. is this a good way to implement this behaviour? 2. if it is, how do get the periodically_call_remote to work during a submit?
