Assuming no transaction can be recorded without reservation (check-in date, total nights, $$ spent)... Your target definition is lack of transactions, and no correlation will occur with your feature variables if the latter are defined before the start of that 12-month period. Alt1. Separate known churners (date of last transaction is known). For Non-churners scrap 12 months of transactions. They will have an artificial "last known transaction date", but be noted as "nonchurners". Create feature variables relative to last known transaction date. (I can think of a few, like weekly spend for last 3 weeks, longest time between nights etc etc.) Alt 2. Consider a stretch of transactions (say 6 months), as a Markov chain input, to estimate which events correlate with any spend in the following X months (say 12 months). You will find certain "paths" that predicts no spending better. Experiment with the 6-months, maybe making it longer or shorter. The choice of X redefines the target seamlessly (X=12 is your current setting). Alt 3. Lika alt 1, but use all data from non-churners up till todays date. Hope this gets you started (if not already done!). Let us know if you succeeded with this project!
