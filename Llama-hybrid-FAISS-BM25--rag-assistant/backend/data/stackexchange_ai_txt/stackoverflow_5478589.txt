Let's say your basic image is 100x100 pixels, and you have a bunch of 10x10 tiles. You want to mosaic the basic image with 400 of the little tiles, so each tile comprises 5x5 pixels in the basic image. For each 5x5 part in the basic image, determine the average RGB values for those pixels. For each tile, determine the average RGB values. Match up the average RGB values of each 5x5 part to the closest match from the tiles. Then create your mosaic. You'll need to scale the tiles down to 5x5 to keep the image size the same, though.
