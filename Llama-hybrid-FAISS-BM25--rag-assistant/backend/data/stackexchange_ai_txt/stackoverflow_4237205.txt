Check the UCI machine learning repository out for real datasets. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set for example. Check the data set description for more information about it. Even the Naive Bayes classifier will give great results on this dataset (over 95% cross-validated accuracy). With some variable selection you can even get to 100%, if I remember correctly.
