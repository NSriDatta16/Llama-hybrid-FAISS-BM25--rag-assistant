Check out django-piston Piston is a relatively small Django application that lets you create application programming interfaces (API) for your sites. It has several unique features: Ties into Django's internal mechanisms. Supports OAuth out of the box (as well as Basic/Digest or custom auth.) Doesn't require tying to models, allowing arbitrary resources. Speaks JSON, YAML, Python Pickle & XML (and HATEOAS.) Ships with a convenient reusable library in Python Respects and encourages proper use of HTTP (status codes, ...) Has built in (optional) form validation (via Django), throttling, etc. Supports streaming, with a small memory footprint. Stays out of your way.
