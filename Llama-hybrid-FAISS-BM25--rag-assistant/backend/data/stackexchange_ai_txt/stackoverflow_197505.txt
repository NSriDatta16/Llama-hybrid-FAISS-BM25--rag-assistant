Is it not the ui.draggable? If you go here (in Firefox and assuming you have firebug) and look in the firebug console youll see I am doing a console.dir of the ui.draggable object which is the div being dragged http://jsbin.com/ixizi Therefore the code you need in the drop function is drop: function(ev, ui) { //to get the id //ui.draggable.attr('id') or ui.draggable.get(0).id or ui.draggable[0].id console.dir(ui.draggable) }
