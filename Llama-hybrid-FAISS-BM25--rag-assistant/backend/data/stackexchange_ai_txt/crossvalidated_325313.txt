Difference between train.RMSPropOptimizer and tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer (tensorflow)

I am implementing an autoencoder. The cost function I am trying to minimize is mean square error. When I use RMSPropOptimizer, the output is good. But with GradientDescentOptimizer, the output is not good. So can anyone please explain the differences in between these two optimizer ?
