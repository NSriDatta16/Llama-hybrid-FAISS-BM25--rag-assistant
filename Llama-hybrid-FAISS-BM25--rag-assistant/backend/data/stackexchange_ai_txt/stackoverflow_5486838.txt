No Idea how to create a specific MapReduce in CouchDB

I've got 3 types of documents in my db: { param: "a", timestamp: "t" } (Type 1) { param: "b", partof: "a" } (Type 2) { param: "b", timestamp: "x" } (Type 3) (I can't alter the layout...;-( ) Type 1 defines a start timestamp, it's like the start event. A Type 1 is connected to several Type 3 docs by Type 2 documents. I want to get the latest Type 3 (highest timestamp) and the corresponding type 1 document. How may I organize my Map/Reduce?
