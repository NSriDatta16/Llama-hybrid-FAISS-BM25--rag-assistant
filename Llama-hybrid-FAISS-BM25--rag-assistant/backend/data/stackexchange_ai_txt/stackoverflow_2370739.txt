Things which are more likely to affect your final EXE size (not exhaustive list): Whether you static or dynamically link to libraries (dynamic link is smaller since the library code is not inside your EXE) It's possible use of many template classes eg. vector , vector , vector will cause code bloat, since each instantiation of vector with different types is compiled separately Compiler settings, eg. optimisation, size vs. speed, inlining (lots of inlining can make code larger), whole program optimisation if supported Linker settings, eg. if supported, removing redundant or identical data. Can help reduce size. In short splitting code up in to more translation units probably will have no effect - same code, just reorganised. It might even make things worse if your compiler does not take in to account whole program optimisation, since each translation unit has less information about your program in it.
