A VAE models a distribution as $$\log P(x) = \log \int P(x|z)P(z) dz \geq E_{z \sim q}[\log P(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q(z)||p(z))$$ As you can see, there is no direct relationship between the variance of $q$ and the probability the model assigns to a given datapoint $x$ . In fact decreasing the variance on $q$ could increase the KL term, resulting in lower log likelihood. Anyway I suggest using the ELBO or a monte carlo estimate of the integral to determine how much probability the model assigns to a particular image.
