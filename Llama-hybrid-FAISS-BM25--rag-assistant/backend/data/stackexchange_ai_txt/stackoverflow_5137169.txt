I'm unsure if there is a immediately-usable monotouch-based md2 project or codebase, however, with the help of http://www.google.com/codesearch , I came across various C#-based md2-handling code fragments, maybe you could adapt any of: vcmdlnet.googlecode.com jawws.googlecode.com opimmframework.svn.codeplex.com Halolz m2d (XNA[touch?]) Also, CSat and Meshomatic are C# libraries for loading other model formats, such as Wavefront's Obj format. However, these might require a little work also to port to Monotouch. Hope this helps. Cheers Rich
