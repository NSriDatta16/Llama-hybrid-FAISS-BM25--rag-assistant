What is asked here is to actually compare the average time that two people work. So the null hypothesis is something you want to check against something else. Here you want to check if the average time that Michael works is different (either has larger or smaller value) than the average time that Bernard works. So, the null hypothesis is H0: the average working hours for Michael are equal to the average working hours of Bernard. You test this hypothesis against the alternative H1: their working hours differ . To test such a hypothesis, you perform a t-test (for comparing two means). This test though assumes that your data follow Normal distribution. You compare the t-statistic value that you found with the theoretical values from the t-table to find the significance of your result. Check this link to understand why you use the t-table and what are the degrees of freedom and how you get the p-value: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat500/node/50
