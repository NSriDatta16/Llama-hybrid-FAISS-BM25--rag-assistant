Where are the diagnostics/logs storage tables?

I have a problem deploying a WebRole (WCF service) to Azure . My WebRole keeps showing buzy for at least 30 minutes, until I abort it. I deploy through Visual Studio 2010. Iâ€™m looking for some trace information and there is a few blogs that have pointed me towards storage tables called WADInfrastructureLogsTable and WADLogsTable . I have set up the configuration settings with my storage account like this: I have no tables at all in my storage account. Not even after I have deployed Hello World apps successfully. My Blob container holds a vsdeploy- and a wad-control-container, and I have 4 queues. How will these tables be created? public override bool OnStart() { var dm = DiagnosticMonitor.GetDefaultInitialConfiguration(); dm.Logs.ScheduledTransferPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5); dm.Logs.ScheduledTransferLogLevelFilter = LogLevel.Verbose; DiagnosticMonitor.Start("DiagnosticsConnectionString", dm); Trace.WriteLine("OnStart"); // For information on handling configuration changes // see the MSDN topic at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166357. RoleEnvironment.Changing += RoleEnvironmentChanging; return base.OnStart(); }
