Hosting Java Web Start application for inclusion into Linux distros

I authored a Java freeware (closed source) product that I deploy on a web host and distribute via JNLP, inclusive Linux clients. I plan to suggest this product for inclusion into several Linux distro, if possible "as is" (JNLP-based). Can I already contact distros, or I need to reconfigure something (deploy on another host, convert JNLP to something, etc.)? What is your experience?
