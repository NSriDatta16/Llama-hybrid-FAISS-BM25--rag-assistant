New to data Science. Which techniques best to use Large data set in insurance company?

Dataset Features Insurance underwriting dataset for 8 years. age location amount insured some other features...(medical evidence) Not all feature will be available to all applicants. Target Variable Decision on whether the applicant can be insured Question What techniques can be used and which ones would work best? Outline a high-level overview - I do not think I have to go into too much detail as I do not have any data. Things I have considered I am thinking to first slice the data and analyse it in parts and see can I find a pattern. Regression analysis could be carried out. Possible Logistic regression? I could take a sample and perform hypothesis tests? I know that this is an ideal machine learning situation. I don't have any experience in this field and I think I am better to stick with methods I have some knowledge of. I know this is very ambiguous, but a little nod in the right direction and I would be very appreciative.
