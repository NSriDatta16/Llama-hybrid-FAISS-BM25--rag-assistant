How to extract and plot autocorrelated random effects in glmmTMB with an irregular time series?

My question is similar to this question , but with an additional question on top of it. In the code below from the reproducible example data question: glmmTMB with autocorrelation of irregular times , they show how random effects (intercepts) of mixed models without autocorrelation terms can be extracted and plotted. # Make data frame according to example linked above: library(dplyr) library(lubridate) library(glmmTMB) df % arrange(DateTime) %>% group_by(Year) %>% mutate(times = lubridate::decimal_date(DateTime) %% 1) %>% ungroup() ) df3 % mutate(YearF = as.factor(Year), times = glmmTMB::numFactor(times)) %>% select(N, DayYear, YearF, times) ) # Construct a model without autocorrelation: mod However, in the glmmTMB models that I use, this approach does not work because I have incorporated random effect intercepts with autocorrelation terms into the models. I have an irregular time series, so the autocorrelation is modelled with the ou(times+0|YearF) structure where numeric times are encoded in the factor levels of 'times'. I want to produce a plot for the random intercept of year on the response variable (N) while accounting for autocorrelation. But I am struggling to extract the random effect of year separately from the random effect of year associated with a specific time in the time series. (When I extract the random effects, there is only a random effect associated with each of the 'times' in the time series). Would it be worth it to specify a separate random effect (1|YearF) in my glmmTMB model before specifying the autocorrelation structure ou(times + 0 | YearF) ? Then the model looks like this: mod3
