A full-blown client/server database like MySQL or SQL Server would probably be overkill for a single user. But you'd probably get some use from an embedded/file-based engine like SQLite or SQL Server CE , especially if you want to do more with the data than just look up single records by ID. If you did the data storage yourself, you'd have to write loads of code to get records meeting certain criteria, and i all but guarantee you won't do as well at it as the people who do it for a living.
