The following is a Bayesian answer to "Out of 10,000 new products, how many are expected to fail if all the former 100,000 produced didn't fail?", but you should consider the sensitivity to different priors. Suppose that $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are conditionally independent and identically distributed, given $\Theta=\theta$, such that $X_1\mid\Theta=\theta\sim\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta)$, and use the conjugate prior $\Theta\sim\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)$, with $a,b>0$. For $m For $m+1\leq i\leq n$, we have $$ \begin{align} \mathrm{E}\left[X_i\mid X_1=0,\dots X_m=0\right] &= \Pr(X_i=1\mid X_1=0,\dots X_m=0) \\ &= \int_0^1 \Pr(X_i=1\mid \Theta=\theta) \,f_{\Theta\mid X_1,\dots,X_m}(\theta\mid 0,\dots,0) \,d\theta \\ &= \frac{\Gamma(m+a+b)}{\Gamma(m+a+b+1)} \frac{\Gamma(a+1)}{\Gamma(a)} = \frac{a}{m+a+b}\, , \end{align} $$ in which we used $\Theta\mid X_1=0,\dots,X_m=0\sim \mathrm{Beta}(a,m+b)$. Plugging in your numbers, with an uniform prior ($a=1,b=1$) you expect a failure rate around $10\%$, while a Jeffreys-like prior ($a=1/2,b=1/2$) gives you a failure rate close to $5\%$. This predictive expectation doesn't look like a good summary, because the predictive distribution is highly skewed. We can go further and compute the predictive distribution. Since $$ \sum_{i=m+1}^n X_i \;\Bigg\vert\; \Theta=\theta \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n-m+2,\theta) \, , $$ conditioning as we did before we have $$ \begin{align} \Pr&\left(\sum_{i=m+1}^n X_i=t \;\Bigg\vert\; X_1=0,\dots X_m=0\right) = \\ &\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\binom{n-m+2}{t} \frac{\Gamma(m+a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(m+b)} \frac{\Gamma(t+a)\Gamma(n-t+2)}{\Gamma(n+a+2)} \, , \end{align} $$ for $t=0,1,\dots,n-m+2$. I'll finish it later computing a $95\%$ predictive interval.
