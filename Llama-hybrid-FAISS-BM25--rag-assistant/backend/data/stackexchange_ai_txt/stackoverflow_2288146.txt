I have performed 100 inserts/deltes and tested on both DBCP and C3PO. DBCP :: testOnBorrow=true impacts the response time by more than 4 folds. C3P0 :: testConnectionOnCheckout=true impacts the response time by more than 3 folds. Here are the results : DBCP – BasicDataSource Average time for 100 transactions ( insert operation ) testOnBorrow=false :: 219.01 ms testOnBorrow=true :: 1071.56 ms Average time for 100 transactions ( delete opration ) testOnBorrow=false :: 223.4 ms testOnBorrow=true :: 1067.51 ms C3PO – ComboPooledDataSource Average time for 100 transactions ( insert operation ) testConnectionOnCheckout=false :: 220.08 ms testConnectionOnCheckout=true :: 661.44 ms Average time for 100 transactions ( delete opration ) testConnectionOnCheckout=false :: 216.52 ms testConnectionOnCheckout=true :: 648.29 ms Conculsion : Setting testOnBorrow=true in DBCP or testConnectionOnCheckout=true in C3PO impacts the performance by 3-4 folds. Is there any other setting that will enhance the performance. -Durga Prasad
