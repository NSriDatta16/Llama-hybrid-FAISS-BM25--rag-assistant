Another point - this is related but not necessarily the only explanation: Supervised learning algorithms may be either generative or discriminative . For example, Generative classifiers: Assume a functional form of $P(Y)$ , $P(X|Y)$ Estimate both $P(Y)$ , $P(X|Y)$ from data (training), which leads to the joint probability $P(Y, X)$ (this makes it a generative model), then use Bayes rule to get $P(Y|X)$ Discriminative classifiers: Assume a functional form of $P(Y|X)$ Estimate $P(Y|X)$ directly from data (training) Most of the Bayesian classifiers, such as naive Bayes, Markov models (MRFs, HMMs), and similar Bayesian graphical models are generative. Some examples of discriminative models are logistic regression, CARTs, SVMs, and CRFs (as opposed to MRFs). The Bayesian framework can be modified to see how different supervised learning algorithms behave, and why some models may compared one vs. the other, or model the joint probability and make a prediction based on that. As for kNN, since I don't want to get embroiled in what is going on here: Is KNN a discriminative learning algorithm? Have fun.
