The company I work for embeds Groovy into a Java/Spring website, which is deployed on a number of sites. The scripts are stored externally of the compiled WAR file, and allow us to manipulate some of the site logic without having to roll out new WAR's to each site. So far, this approach has worked very elegantly for us. A particularly nice feature of Groovy is that it can closely resemble Java code, which makes it very easy to port existing Java classes to it.
