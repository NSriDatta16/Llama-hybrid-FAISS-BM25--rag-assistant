You can implement all of this is you want -- it's been done many times before, but nothing prevents you from doing it again. What would be a better use of your time is to make sure you understand the separation of concerns you listed above (which are generally right) and identify the most efficient integration of existing frameworks to leverage (e.g., Hiberante, Spring, Guice, etc). There are multiple answers for that one (and no shortage of opinions!), but all things being equal, the less frameworks you have to integrate, the easier and better fitting it's likely to be. Spring has a very well known framework which covers many of these things, so it would be wise to start there. It also allows you to work with other frameworks (i.e., you can use selective parts of Spring). For example, you can use Spring for dependency injection and use a different MVC framework.
