Any easy way to plot a 3d scatter in Python that I can rotate around?

Currently I'm using matplotlib to plot a 3d scatter and while it gets the job done, I can't seem to find a way to rotate it to see my data better. Here's an example: import pylab as p import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d as p3 #data is an ndarray with the necessary data and colors is an ndarray with #'b', 'g' and 'r' to paint each point according to its class ... fig=p.figure() ax = p3.Axes3D(fig) ax.scatter(data[:,0], data[:,2], data[:,3], c=colors) ax.set_xlabel('X') ax.set_ylabel('Y') ax.set_zlabel('Z') fig.add_axes(ax) p.show() I'd like a solution that lets me do it during execution time but as long as I can rotate it and it's short/quick I'm fine with it. Here's a comparison of the plots produced after applying a PCA to the iris dataset: 1. mayavi 2. matplotlib Mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data, but MatPlotLib looks more professional. Matplotlib is also lighter.
