Also please note that NOT every file does have a GUID. The GUID mechanisim is mostly used for .lnk files in order to keep the association when a the traget is moved. Only $Volume and the targets of link files have these GUIDs. Furthermore you can set them by hand. Their advantage is that the GUID should not clash between volumes, while the file ID does. the FILE_ID is actually 48 bit of MFT_RECORD_NUMBER and 16 bits of MFT_SEQUENCE_ID
