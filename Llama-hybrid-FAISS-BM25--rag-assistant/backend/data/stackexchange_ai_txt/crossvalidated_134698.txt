The results of clustering depend significantly upon the similarity metric (which points are "close," and which "far"), and the metric may depend upon the units used for each variable, weightings, and so on. If the average value of one feature value (your Show 1 minutes, for example) is much larger than others, clustering will depend upon that. Depending upon your application, you might want to treat each show's effect "equally," in which case you should rescale each column or whiten your data (make each have zero mean and unit variance). In sum, data representation and preprocessing (e.g., scaling) will depend upon your task at hand.
