MATLAB is running out of memory but it should not be

I'm trying to apply PCA on my data using princomp(x) , that has been standardized. The data is . This runs our of memory which is too be expected except for the fact that this is a new computer, the computer holds 24GB of RAM for data mining. MATLAB even lists the 24GB available on a memory check. Is MATLAB actually running out of memory while performing a PCA or is MATLAB not using the RAM to it's full potential? Any information or ideas would be helpful. (I may need to increase the virtual memory but assumed the 24GB would have sufficed.)
