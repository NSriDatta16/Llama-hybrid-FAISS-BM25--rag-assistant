How to organize views, partial views and their view models?

I'm developing in asp.net mvc2. I am beginning to create a lot of views and partial views, for most of which I've had to create a view model. This is looking like soon it's going to become unmanageable to remember what view goes with what model. I've tried to use inheritance in my view models as much as possible. I'm wondering how others manage this in their projects?
