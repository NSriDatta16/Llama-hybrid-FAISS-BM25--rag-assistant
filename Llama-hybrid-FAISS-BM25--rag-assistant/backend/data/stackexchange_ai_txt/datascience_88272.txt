Recommended ways of building data science teams

I'm not sure if this questions belongs to this place. But I will be very interested in knowing the answer. I work for the Public Administration in Spain. We want to build a data science team, and in order to do it well, I want to know what in other large companies (like a bank, for example) are doing: How many people usually work in the area of data science? And how are they distributed into teams? What are their roles? With respect to projects, how many people work for a particular data-science project? If you work for a big company and can answer this questions, I will be really grateful.
