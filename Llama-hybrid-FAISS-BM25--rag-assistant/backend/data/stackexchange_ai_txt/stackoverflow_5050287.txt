While testing a component, you have to test only it's interface (input, output, exceptions), without considering or even knowing it's internal implementation (even better if one programmer writes test cases and the other does the implementation, please refer to XP and TDD techniques). So, the only thing you have to test are public methods. To ensure, that your private (helper) methods are written correctly, simply use code coverage analyzer (please checkout Code Coverage tools for PHP ) and cover as much code as possible with your test cases. Your solution will guarantee you a maintenance nightmare. Test cases and component implementation should not be coupled in any way, because coupling would need to be bulletproof or otherwise you'll have to test it too.
