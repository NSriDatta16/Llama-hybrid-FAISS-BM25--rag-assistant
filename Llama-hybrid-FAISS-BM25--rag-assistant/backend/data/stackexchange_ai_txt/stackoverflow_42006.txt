Similar to what GingaNinja said, if all you care about is management of binary files at different revisions, most revision control systems will work for you. However, if you are looking for a tool that will display the changes in the actual images, you might be hard pressed to find a recommendation of a tool here. I would start by asking on a graphic artist forums.
