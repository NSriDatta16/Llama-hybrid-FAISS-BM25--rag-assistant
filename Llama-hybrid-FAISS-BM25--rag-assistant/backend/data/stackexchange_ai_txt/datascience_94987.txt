An algorithm to extract the purpose of a document

I want to build an algorithm to extract the purpose of the document (scientific papers for example) by extracting the sentences that state the purpose. I don't have many annotated data so I might use a semi-supervised learning algorithm. I was thinking of training a Q/A algorithm (using Bert for example..) but I want something to be specific to the purpose task.. Any idea or keywords that might help ? Thanks!
