Importance sampling is a form of sampling from a distribution different from the distribution of interest to more easily obtain better estimates of a parameter from the distribution of interest. Typically this will provide estimates of the parameter with a lower variance than would be obtained by sampling directly from the original distribution with the same sample size. It is applied in various contexts. In general sampling from the different distributions allows for more samples to be taken in a portion of the distribution of interest that is dictated by the application (important region). One example might be that you want to have a sample that includes more samples from the tails of the distribution than pure random sampling from the distribution of interest would provide. The wikipedia article that I have seen on this subject is too abstract. It is better to look at various specific examples. However, it does include links to interesting applications such as Bayesian Networks. One example of importance sampling in the 1940s and 1950s is a variance reduction technique (a form of the Monte Carlo Method). See for example the book Monte Carlo Methods by Hammersley and Handscomb published as a Methuen Monograph/Chapman and Hall in 1964 and reprinted in 1966 and later by other publishers. Section 5.4 of the book covers Importance Sampling.
