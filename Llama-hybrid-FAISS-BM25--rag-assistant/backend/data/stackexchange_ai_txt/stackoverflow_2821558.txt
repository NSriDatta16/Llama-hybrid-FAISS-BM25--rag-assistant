What would be the best .NET 2.0 type to represent .NET 3.5 HashSet ?

I'm writing myself a class library to manage Active Directory. I have an interface: Public Interface ISourceAnnuaire(Of T as {IGroupe, ITop, IUniteOrganisation, IUtilisateur}) Readonly Property Changements As Dictionary(Of T, HashSet(Of String)) End Interface This Changements property is used to save in memory the changes that occur on a particular element that is part of the source. However, I am stuck with .NET Framework 2.0. What would be the closest .NET 2.0 for HashSet(Of String)?
