How to calculate the MLE for transition probabilities of markov chains of higher order?

my question is: I need to calculate the MLE for the transition probabilities of a Markok chain of order 2 â‰¤ k I've calculated the MLE for Markov chain of order 1 on a previous exercise; but I don't understand where to start for the higher order. If someone could help me, I'll be thankful.
