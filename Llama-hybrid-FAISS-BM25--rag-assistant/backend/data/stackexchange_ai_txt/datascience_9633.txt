Score probability groups with Random Forest in R

I would like to use RF in order to get a score probability of a binary outcome, in order to know groups with higher probability of buy something. Like this: fit First Question, When I perfom auc of the pract$PREDICTION I get 1! It is because overfiting? Should I use out of bag instead of pract, like this?: pract$PREDICTION Second Question: With test$PREDICTION I want to make groups ordered by the score prob, like this: test$score[test$PREDICTION >= 0 & test$PREDICTION 0.3 & test$PREDICTION 0.9 & test$PREDICTION How can I measure how good my model is? by doing the same segmentation group in the pract$PREDICTION and then comparing how right and how wrong both tests are in each group ? This make any sense?
