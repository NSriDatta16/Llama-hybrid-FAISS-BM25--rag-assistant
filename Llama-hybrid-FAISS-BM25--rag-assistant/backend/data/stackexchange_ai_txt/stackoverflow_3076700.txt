it depends on how you retrieve the query results. The most elegant way is to use the iterator, as e.g. shown in: http://basex.org/code/QueryExample Apart from that, you could extend your XQuery by returning an additional newline: xquery for $Book in /Libbraray/Literaturelist/Literature/Title return (fn:data($Book), ' ') Note, however, that the additionally output space character cannot be suppressed.
