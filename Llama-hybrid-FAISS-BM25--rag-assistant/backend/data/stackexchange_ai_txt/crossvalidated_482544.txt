Your interpretation is sufficient. Your model is fully saturated with time dummies. The omitted time dummy (i.e., $k = -1$ ) is your reference period. You could use a more distant pre-event period but most papers I have encountered use the period before treatment as the baseline. I wouldn't get too caught up with interpreting all these interactions. Rather, organize them into a table where you can easily juxtapose your coefficients or estimate more complex dynamic specifications. If you're partial to graphical displays, then try plotting your coefficients to show how effects evolve before and after treatment exposure. A picture is worth a thousand words.
