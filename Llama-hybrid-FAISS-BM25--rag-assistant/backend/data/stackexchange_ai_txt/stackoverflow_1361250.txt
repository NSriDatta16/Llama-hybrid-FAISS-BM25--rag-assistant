Firefox Extension Development - Data Storage - is Firefox Preferences a good place?

I have developed a Firefox add-on that needs to save some user-data in the local machine. Right now, I use the filesystem functionality that Firefox provides to create some folders and files in the user's system. Portability is a problem. I designed it for Windows XP. But, Vista's folder structure is different (inside the app data). Linux is completely different. I do an OS check and create/read/write files accordingly. Suddenly, I need to support Macs! I thought why not save the data in the Firefox preferences. I will use the Preference Manager. On an average, the total amount of data hardly goes beyond 100KB. But the thing is, in rare cases, the data could get quite big - a few megabytes in the worst case. So, is it a good idea to save it as preference values? I know that is not what it is meant for, but it will save me a lot of headaches. Even if it is a bad idea, just let me know about the performance or other issues (if any) of storing that much data in preferences. Thanks.
