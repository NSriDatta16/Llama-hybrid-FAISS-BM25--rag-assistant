Is dimensionality reduction useful for convolutional neural networks?

I understand that classical dimensionality reduction methods are generally speaking could contribute to (vanilla) neural network. But I'm unsure about the dimred application for the input images for convolutional NNs, because I interpret the convolutional layers themselves before the flattening and dense layers as a kind of dimension reduction. Is it a correct reasoning or dimred could also contribute to the efficiency of CNNs?
