Two cointegrated time series share a common trend on the long run but there can exist large discrepancies between them on the short term. The optimal look back period would be the very beginning of the data generating process at work in your phenomena. Unfortunately, you are limited to a finite data sample to estimate this potential cointegration relationship and nothing can guarantee that those data points were not sampled during a period with high or small discrepancies. So I would definitely go for the largest data set available as it is the less likely to be mislead by a "one-time" perturbation. NB: all of this is true provided that the data generating process remain the same during the whole time of observation. Now, you might want to consider applying a Chow test on your data in order to check for any structural break in your series.
