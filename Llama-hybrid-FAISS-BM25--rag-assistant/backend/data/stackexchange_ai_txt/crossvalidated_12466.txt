Examples of text mining with R (tm package)

I spent three days dabbling with tm after reading a draft paper by a friend where he explored a text corpus with UCINET, showing text clouds, two-mode network graphs and Single Value Decomposition (with graphics, using Stata). I ran under a large number of issues: on Mac OS X, there are issues with the Java behind libraries like Snowball (stemming) or Rgraphviz (graphs). Could someone point out not packages – I have looked at tm , wordfish and wordscores , and know about NLTK – but research, if possible with code, on textual data, that successfully uses tm or something else to analyse data like parliamentary debates or legislative documents? I cannot seem to find much on the issue, and even less code to learn from. My own project is a two-month parliamentary debate, with these variables informed in a CSV file: parliamentary session, speaker, parliamentary group, text of oral intervention. I am looking for divergence between speakers and especially between parliamentary groups in the use of rare and less rare terms, e.g. "security talk" against "civil liberties" talk.
