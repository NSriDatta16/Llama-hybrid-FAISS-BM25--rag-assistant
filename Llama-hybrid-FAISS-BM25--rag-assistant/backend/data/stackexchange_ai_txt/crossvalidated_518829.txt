Statistical Significance of survey

I recently conducted a survey comparing the generated responses of 2 chatbots. Each participant was asked to complete two tasks: Select a generated response as "best" between 2 generated responses. Rate a generated response with a number from 1 (very bad) to 5 (excellent). This task was done 2 times one for each chatbot. Each participant completed the survey once. So according to the 1st task, I gathered $N=308$ samples, from which $N_1=170$ prefer the 1st response while the remaining $N_2=138$ the 2nd one. Consequently, I have a ~55% win rate of the 1st chatbot. According to the 2nd task, I gathered $N=308$ samples for each chatbot. The average rating of the 1st chatbot is $μ_1=3.5$ and of the 2nd is $μ_2=3.37$ . I would like to test the statistical significance of the above results. (For the 2nd task I thought that using an independent one-tailed t-test was a good idea but the normality criterion is violated). Which test method I should use for each task?
