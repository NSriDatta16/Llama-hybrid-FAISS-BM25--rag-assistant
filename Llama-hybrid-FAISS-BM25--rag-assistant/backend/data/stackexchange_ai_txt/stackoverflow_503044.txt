I'm going to put in some answers to my own question, based on what I have found: 1) you can do this easily in the full-fat desktop WPF with a flow document full of paragraph, hyperlink, run and related objects. This is what I am doing now, I am not trying to solve this problem in Silverlight any more. 2) Use Silverlight 4 You can't do this in Silverlight 2 or 3. However Silverlight 4 has a RichTextArea Control which, when readonly, supports this kind of display of flow layout with inline hyperlinks, and so acts like a cut-down version of FlowDocument and related classes from WPF. Silverlight 4 also allows Embedded Web browser control to display HTML content, if you can make it look that same across Windows versions (i.e. IE versions) and on Mac and potentially other platforms. 3) You can probably do something like this in Silverlight (any version) by building up a string of HTML and injecting it into the DOM to show it in the part of the page that's outside the Silverlight control. It sounds entirely workable, but in my opinion, too clever by half.
