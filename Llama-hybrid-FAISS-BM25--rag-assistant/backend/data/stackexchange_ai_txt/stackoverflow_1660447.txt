JQuery code not working

Why is the following code giving an exception? function SetText(index, text) { try { $('p')[index].innerHTML = text; } catch (ex) { alert(ex); } } $(document).ready(SetText(2, 'Damn')); the exception is: TypeError: $('p')[index] is undefined This is my code file: /// function SetText(index, text) { try { $('p')[index].innerHTML = text; } catch (ex) { alert(ex); } } $(document).ready(SetText(2, 'Damn')); This is 1st Paragraph This is 2nd Paragraph This is 3rd Paragraph This is 4th Paragraph This is 5th Paragraph
