Popular symmetric positive definite matrices with explicitly known eigenvalues (at least largest eigenvalue)

I am looking for popular symmetric positive definite matrices with explicitly known eigenvalues (at least largest eigenvalue) arising as autocovariance matrices in time series (for example). In fact, any positive definite matrix is a covariance matrix. For example, if we consider the equicorrelation matrix $(1-\rho)I+\rho J$ where $J$ is the matrix of all $1'$ s, then we have an explicit expression for all the eigenvalues. What about the Toeplitz matrix $\Sigma$ where $\Sigma_{ij}=\rho^{|i-j|}$ ? I searched for this but it seems we do not know an explicit formula for the leading eigenvalue although some asymptotic results are known. So, is the equicorrelation matrix the only matrix with well known eigenvalues among the autocovariance matrices arising in time series? I would be glad to know other examples.
