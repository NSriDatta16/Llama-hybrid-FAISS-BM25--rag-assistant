The WebBrowser control responds to the WM_GETDLGCODE message with DLGC_WANTARROWS | DLGC_WANTCHARS. That's why it won't handle certain keys such as Tab, Back and Delete. It told the parent to not handle those keys. You can write a windows hook then call the webbrowser control's IOleInPlaceActiveObject ::TranslateAccelerator implementation. Check "WebBrowser Keystroke Problems" by Scott Roberts, Microsoft Internet Developer April 1999 for more details.
