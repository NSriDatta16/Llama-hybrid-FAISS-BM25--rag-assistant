How to correct pattern in residuals when using a negative binomial distribution? Is it due to overdispersion?

I have a large dataset with the count data and I computed the following full model (covariates are all scaled) : myModel As a matter of fact, my dataset is made of sites that are monitored from one full night up to several nights in a raw, several times. However, when I draw residuals VS fitted values, I obtain this graph : Thus, even if I'm using a negative binomial distribution, it seems that I still have a strong pattern. I tried to fix it by correcting what seems to be a little zero inflation using ziformula = ~1 or ziformula= ~some_of_my_covariates (p-value = 0.04 with testZeroInflation(myModel) ) but it doesn't correct this pattern (the graph is almost the same). I also tried to correct it using dispformula = some_of_my_covariates (covariates were chosen because they showed an obvious pattern when drawing them VS fitted residuals). But it didn't work either. I was thus wondering : If I was right and if even when using negative binomial distributions, residuals VS fitted shoudn't have any pattern. If it might be due to overdispersion? What are the possible options to correct it? Thank you! Here an edit following Robert Long answer. The graphs that I get when I use the DHARMa package :
