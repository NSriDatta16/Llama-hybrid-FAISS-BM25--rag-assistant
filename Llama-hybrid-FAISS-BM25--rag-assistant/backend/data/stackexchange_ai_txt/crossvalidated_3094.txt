Some of the Bioconductor 's packages (e.g., ShortRead , Biostrings , BSgenome , IRanges , genomeIntervals ) offer facilities for dealing with genome positions or coverage vectors, e.g. for ChIP-seq and identifying enriched regions. As for the other answers, I agree that any method relying on ordered observations with some threshold-based filter would allow to isolate low signal within a specific bandwith. Maybe you can also look at the methods used to identify so-called "islands" Zang, C, Schones, DE, Zeng, C, Cui, K, Zhao, K, and Peng, W (2009). A clustering approach for identification of enriched domains from histone modification ChIP-Seq data . Bioinformatics, 25(15) , 1952-1958.
