This, like most early LISPy homework problems is an exercise in thinking recursively and/or thinking in terms of induction. The way to start is to ask yourself simple questions that you can answer easily. For example, if you had been asked to write something that gave you the first element in each list, I would thing about it this way: Given a list of lists: What is first-element of every list in the list '() ? (easy - null ) What is first-element of every list in the list '(a) ? (easy - a , or maybe an error) What is first-element of every list in the list '((a)) ? (easy - (a) ) What is first-element of any list in the form '(anything) , where anything is a list? (easy - (first anything) ) What is the first element of every list in the form '(anything morestuff) ? (easy - (cons (first anything) (first-element morestuff)) ) What is first of an atom? either the atom or an error (depends on your point of view) What is first of null? nil . What is first of a list? (car list) From here we can start writing code: ;; here's first, meeting questions 6-8 (define first (lambda (l) (cond ((null? l) nil) ; Q7 ((atom? l) l) ; Q6 (t (car l))))) ; Q8 ;; with first we can write first-element, meeting questions 1-5 (define first-element (lambda (l) (cond ((null? l) nil) ; Q1 ((atom? l) (first l)) ; Q2 (t (cons (first (car l) (first-element (cdr l)))))))) ; Q4-5 Now this isn't your homework (intentionally). You should play with this and understand how it works. Your next goal should be to find out how this differs from your assignment and how to get there. With respect to MAPCAR? Don't worry about it. You need to learn how to solve recursive problems first. Then you can worry about MAPCAR. What is the point of this assignment? To help you learn to think in this mode. Dang near everything in LISP/Scheme is solved by thinking this way. The reason I went with all the questions to break it down into the parts that I'm worried about. If I'm given the task "how do I do foo on every item in a list?" I should answer the questions: How do I do handle null? How do handle an atom? How do I do handle on the first element on the list? How do I handle everything else? Once I've answered that, then I figure out how to actually do foo. How do I do foo on null? How do I do foo on an atom? How do I do foo on a list?
