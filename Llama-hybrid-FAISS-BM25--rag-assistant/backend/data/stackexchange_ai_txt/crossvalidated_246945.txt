It basically means that, say if the agent wants to go up, there's 80% possibility for it to successfully reach one square above, and 20% chance to end up in somewhere else (probably because of something like, a sudden tornado in the way). This is often represented by a probability distribution $p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a)$, where $s_t$ is the current state, $s_{t+1}$ is the next state, and $a$ the action it takes.
