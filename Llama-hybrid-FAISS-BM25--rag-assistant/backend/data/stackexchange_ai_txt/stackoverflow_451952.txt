What is the correct way to backup ZODB blobs?

I am using plone.app.blob to store large ZODB objects in a blobstorage directory. This reduces size pressure on Data.fs but I have not been able to find any advice on backing up this data. I am already backing up Data.fs by pointing a network backup tool at a directory of repozo backups. Should I simply point that tool at the blobstorage directory to backup my blobs? What if the database is being repacked or blobs are being added and deleted while the copy is taking place? Are there files in the blobstorage directory that must be copied over in a certain order?
