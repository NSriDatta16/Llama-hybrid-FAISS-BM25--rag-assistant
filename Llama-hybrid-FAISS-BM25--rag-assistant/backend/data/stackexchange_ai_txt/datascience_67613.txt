I can give you some hint of doing so with deep learning approaches. It's easy to use gensim and sklearn python libraries. First, you need to extract the word embeddings which are vector of numbers to represent a word, and then take the average of the words within a sentence is a way of fining that vector representation for your sentence. So extract your word embeddings using this guideline here . After that try cosine similarity using sklearn to compare how closely they are realted.
