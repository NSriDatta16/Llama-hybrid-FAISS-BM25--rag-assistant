While I do not object to the practical impossibility (or impracticality) of a Monte Carlo resolution of this problem with a precision of 6 decimal places pointed out by whuber , I would think a resolution with six digits of accuracy can be achieved. First, following Glen_b , the particles are exchangeable in a stationary regime, hence it is sufficient (as in sufficiency ) to monitor the occupancy of the different cells, as this constitutes a Markov process as well. The distribution of the occupancies at the next time step $t+1$ is completed determined by the occupancies at the current time $t$. Writing the transition matrix $K$ is definitely impractical but simulating the transition is straightforward. Second, as noted by shabbychef , one can follow the occupancy process on the 450 odd (or even) squares, which remains on the odd squares when only considering even times, i.e. the squared Markov matrix $K^2$. Third, the original problem only considers the frequency of zero occupancies, $\hat{p}_0$, after $50$ Markov transitions. Given that the starting point has a very high value for the stationary probability distribution of the Markov chain $(\mathbf{X}^{(t)})$, and given that focus on a single average across all cells,$$\hat{p}_0=\frac{1}{450}\sum_{i=1}^{450}\mathbb{I}_0(X_i^ {(50)})$$we can consider that the realisation of the chain $(\mathbf{X}^{(t)})$ at time $t=50$ is a realisation from the stationary probability distribution. This brings a major reduction to the computing cost, as we can simulate directly from this stationary distribution $\mathbf{\pi}$, which is a multinomial distribution with probabilities proportional to 2, 3, and 4 on the even corner, other cells on the edge, and inner cells, respectively. Obviously, the stationary distribution provides directly the expected number of empty cells as $$\sum_{i=1}^{450} (1-\pi_i)^{450}$$ equal to $166.1069$, pot=rep(c(rep(c(0,1),15),rep(c(1,0),15)),15)*c(2, rep(3,28),2,rep(c(3,rep(4,28),3),28),2,rep(3,28),2) pot=pot/sum(pot) sum((1-pot)^450)-450 [1] 166.1069 which is quite close to a Monte Carlo approximation of $166.11$ [based on 10‚Å∏ simulations, which took 14 hours on my machine]. But not close enough for 6 decimals. As commented by whuber , the estimates need to be multiplied by 2 to correctly answer the question, hence a final value of 332.2137,
