Multinomial logistic regression: How to calculate the baseline probability that increases by Exp(B)?

I have troubles finding an answer to my question, regarding a multinomial logistic regression model, with a single continuous predictor. Let's say these are the absolute frequencies in the categories that I am predicting: Category A: 32 Category B: 11 Category C: 85 Category D: 44 Category E: 10 I ran a multinomial logistic regression with a single continuous predictor and Category C as the baseline. In the model "Category A vs. Category C", the ODDS-Ratio for my predictor was 1.20. A one point increase in the predictor increases the probability of preferring Category A over Category C by 20%. Now that's nice! However, how do I calculate the "probability of preferring Category A over Category C"? Intuitively, I would look at how many chose A instead of C, in the subgroup of people that either chose A or C. Something like this: n (Category A) / ( n (Category A) + n (Category C) ) - That would be 27,4%. However, I feel that I might do something wrong when I do not take into account that subjects had to choose between 5 categories. And I can not figure out how I would calculate the probability of choosing A over C in this set of 5 given options.
