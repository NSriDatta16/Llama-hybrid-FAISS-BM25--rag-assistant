The fact that 'animate' changes what it is animating to a block element is not an issue if what you are trying to slide left or right is positioned with float:left and whatever is next to it is also positioned with float:left $('#pnlPopup #btnUpdateButton').assertOne().animate({ width: "toggle" }); if #btnUpdateButton is styled with the following then it slides quite nicely and pushes the content to the right. #btnUpdateButton { float: left; margin-right: 5px; }
