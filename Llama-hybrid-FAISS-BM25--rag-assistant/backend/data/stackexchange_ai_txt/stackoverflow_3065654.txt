You'll have to subclass NSTokenField to get the functionality you want. Be sure and call setWraps: YES. When the contents of the token field changes, you'll have to calculate the required size of your token field and resize it yourself. Same with adding a scroll bar. After the height of the token field reaches some size, you'll insert a scroll view into the field. Conversely, when the recalculating of the token field size is less than the critical size, you'll remove the scroll view. This is a considerable amount of work (I've found) to get it work correctly. Apple says that the NSTokenField "provides tokenized editing similar to the address field in the Mail application", but it's really not that similar at all since it doesn't have resizing built in and drag and drop is problematical for anything except text.
