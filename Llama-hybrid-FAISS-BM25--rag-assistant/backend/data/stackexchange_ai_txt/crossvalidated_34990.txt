Can we simply compare the predicted percentages of the outcome between studies?

I used the multinomial logistic regression to predict the percentages of students who voted 'acceptable', 'uncertain', and 'unacceptable' to natural ventilation use in three observed classrooms during cool and hot seasons. The sets of significant IVs of the cool and hot season cases were different; for example, the effect of window size (i.e. small, medium, large) on the acceptance of natural ventilation was significant for cool season case but not for hot season case. Question 1: how can I compare the percentages of 'acceptable' votes of the two seasons? Can I look at the differences in the predicted percentages between two seasons directly? Question 2: how can I compare the percentages of 'acceptable' votes of students in the rooms with different window size? Thank you. Please forgive me for my bad English as I am not a native English speaker.
