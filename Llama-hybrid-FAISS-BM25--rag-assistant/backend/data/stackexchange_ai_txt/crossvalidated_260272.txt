What is difference between 'transfer learning' and 'domain adaptation'?

Is there any difference between 'transfer learning' and 'domain adaptation'? I don't know about context, but my understanding is that we have some dataset 1 and train on it, after which we have another dataset 2 for which we want to adapt our model without retraining from scratch, for which 'transfer learning' and 'domain adaptation' help solve this problem. According to the field of Convolutional Neural Networks: By 'transfer learning' I mean 'finetuning' [1] In this case [2] it's unsupervised, but should 'domain adaptation' always be unsupervised?
