Derive the variance of the standardized normal of sample mean

I have solved the following problem and felt a little bit uncertain about the my answer. Here is the problem. Let $Y_i \in L_{2}$ for $i=1,2,...,N$ be a scalar random variable with iid with $\mu_Y=E(Y_i)$ and $\sigma_Y^2=var(Y_i) \lt \infty$ . The sample average is defined as $\overline{Y_N}=\sum Y_i/N$ . Suppose that $Z_N= \frac{\overline{Y_N}-E(\overline{Y_N})}{\sqrt{(var(\overline{Y_N}))}}$ Derive $Var(Z_N)$ If the limit of $Z_N$ exists, it will be nondegenerate. How can I derive $Var(Z_N)$ ? At first glimpse, I think $Var(Z_N)$ is equal to 1. 1.) However, can we use the moment generating function to prove that $Var(Z_N)$ =1. If yes, what I have to do is just to show that the moment generating function of $Z_N$ is similar to the moment generating function of the standard normal? 2.) Is this also a link to Chi square? Helps and comments are highly appreciated.
