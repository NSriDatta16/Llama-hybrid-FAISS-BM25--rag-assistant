We are running a payroll system for 900+ people on VMWare with no problems. This has been in production for 10 months. It's a medium sized load as far as DB goes, and we pre-allocated drive space in VM to prevent IO issues. You have to defrag both the VM Host and the VM slice on a regular basis in order to maintain acceptable performance.
