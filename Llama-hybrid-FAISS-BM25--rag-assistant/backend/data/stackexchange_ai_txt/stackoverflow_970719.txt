You can call QModelIndex::model() from within the ItemDelegate 's paint() method, since it has a QModelIndex parameter. This gives you the TableModel for the data, which you can programatically decide what colour the cell's button will be. However, this is still not as elegant as I'd hope. Does anyone know a better way to change the appearance of table cells when in both the up and down button push states?
