Another option is to use CSS locators. They're normally less fragile than XPath. For example, to target a div with a class of .myDiv you can use the locator "css=.myDiv". If the specified element has other classes the CSS locator will still work, although the XPath equivalent would change from "//div[@class='myDiv']" to "//div[contains(@class, 'myDiv']". Also, CSS locators tend to be faster than XPath across browsers.
