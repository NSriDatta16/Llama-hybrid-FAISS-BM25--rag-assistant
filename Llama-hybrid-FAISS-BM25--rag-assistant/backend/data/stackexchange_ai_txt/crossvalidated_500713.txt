What are the good ARIMA models for this time series?

I have an exercise in which the plot of the time series $X$ , its ACF, and its PACF are given. Moreover, the plot of the time series $Y = \text{diff}(X)$ , its ACF, and its PACF are also given. From plots of $X$ , I propose $X \sim AR(3)$ . From plots of $Y$ , I propose $X \sim ARIMA(10,2,1)$ . Could you please evaluate my model suggestions?
