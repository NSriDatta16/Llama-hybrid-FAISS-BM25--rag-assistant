Is a policy $\pi(s)$ on Markov decision process a random variable?

Citing Wikipedia : The goal in a Markov decision process is to find a good "policy" for the decision maker: a function $\pi$ that specifies the action $\pi(s)$ that the decision maker will choose when in state $s$ . Once a Markov decision process is combined with a policy in this way, this fixes the action for each state and the resulting combination behaves like a Markov chain (since the action chosen in state $s$ is completely determined by $\pi(s)$ and $\Pr(s_{t+1}=s'\mid > s_{t}=s,a_{t}=a)$ $\Pr(s_{t+1}=s'\mid s_{t}=s,a_{t}=a)$ reduces to $Pr(s_{t+1}=s'\mid s_{t}=s)$ $Pr(s_{t+1}=s'\mid s_{t}=s)$ , a Markov transition matrix). A policy that maximizes the function above is called an optimal policy and is usually denoted $\pi^*$ . A particular MDP may have multiple distinct optimal policies. Because of the Markov property, it can be shown that the optimal policy is a function of the current state, as assumed above. Can the policy be considered a random variable?
