How to make WPF Combobox's Dropdown stays open & Placement

I want to have the Combobox editable and with the dropdown stays open. At the moment with these properties been set: IsEditable="True" IsDropDownOpen="True" StaysOpenOnEdit="True" Whenever the user click on the input textbox or the focus is changed to other controls, the dorpdown closes. So I updated the template (the one included in WPF Theme : BureauBlue) to have the Popup IsOpen="true" in this particular case that makes the dropdown stays open, but now when user drag&move the window's position, the dropdown will not update its position automatically and stay in the old position. How can I make it automatically update its position while it is open ?
