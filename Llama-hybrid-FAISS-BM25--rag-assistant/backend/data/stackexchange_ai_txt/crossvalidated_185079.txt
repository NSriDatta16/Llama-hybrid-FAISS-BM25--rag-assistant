Under some reasonable assumptions, IV estimates give you the average treatment effect for "compliers", folks whose participation is changed by the instrument. With 2 distinct instruments, the two sets of compliers are going to be somewhat different. For example, if costs are the instrument, these units do not participate when costs/distance are high but do participate when costs are low would be the compliers. In a heterogeneous treatment effect world where earnings don't respond to schooling identically, the average causal effect will be different for two groups since they consist of different people (though there may be some overlap). Also, there's a long tradition of people arguing that these two instruments are not valid for this research question. They could be biased in different ways, which is another potential reason why they could be different, even if there's no heterogenous treatment effect.
