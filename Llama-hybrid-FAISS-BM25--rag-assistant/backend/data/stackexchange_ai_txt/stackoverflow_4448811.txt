How to deploy existing Sitecore 6.2 site to new enviroment?

I want to deploy a Sitecore test site I've been playing with from a single developer platform (everything on one local PC) to something more like a test environment (dedicated IIS and SQL servers, virtual access to IIS). I don't really need to worry too much about team development and source control right now, though development will continue locally with packages deployed to the test environment. Is there any best practice documentation for doing this? Can I simply install an empty Sitecore instance on the IIS and then copy everything over (editing connection strings to point to correct DBs etc)? If so it best to use the installer or the zip file? Aside from ensuring correct server configuration (.NET version, security settings etc) is there anything I should be paying particular attention to? Thanks in advance.
