We can fit this data with an equal mixture of the uniform distributions on $[0, 17965]$ , $[17965, 27401]$ , $[27401, 44607]$ , and $[44607, \max]$ . To get the right average, the max should be $114238$ . In that distribution, the 90th percentile is $44607 + (15/25)(144238-44607) = 104385.6$ , and $$P(50000)=75\% + \frac{50000-44607}{114238-44607}25\%\simeq 77\%.$$ This is probably the simplest distribution that fits the data, so it's a reasonable starting point for further refinements.
