Using regularization with logistic regression

I have a data set of 3000 observations with 9 variables, and I'm trying to predict whether water are safe for drinking. Regular multivariate logistic regression isn't that good at forecasting, and also none of the coefficients is significant, even if I run univariate logistic regression. This is why I thought of regularization, but I wasn't able to found an explanation of this and when it is appropriate to use. Also, if it exists, if be happy for a reference to R functions.
