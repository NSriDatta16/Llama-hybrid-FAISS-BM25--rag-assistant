How could I make the SurfaceView and Button have a different orientation in a Activity

I hava a simple program about video recording . I use the surfaceView to show the preview screen. and I also want to put some buttons on the screen. I put all the component mentioned above into a XML file which is "ipcam.xml" I use MediaRecorder , SurfaceView , SurfaceHolder to complete this program because the preview screen does not orientate correctly when I rotate my phone. so I use "setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE);" but , the button in the program is always in LANDSCAPE direction . it will not auto change direction when I rotate my phone , but the preview is ok!! so is there anyway to solve this problem. Thank you all very much in advance. you can see this picture , I put my phone in vertical direction the preview screen seems OK but the button is in horizontal direction , i don't want it. https://newslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~poc7667/123.png
