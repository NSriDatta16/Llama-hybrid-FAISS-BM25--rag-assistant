If this is the case, yes, I agree with Jeffery; read the Excel Help under 'Advanced Filter' and pay attention to the 'Unique Records' section. That said, if you are looking to have only a portion of the URL searched, that'll require a little set up, still using Advanced filter. Follow the direction to set up a 'Criteria' range. For instance, if you need to remove all URL's with "google" in a column. Example: Your data table is in range A4:B10004 A4 is a heading = "URLs" B4 is a heading = "Sample Header" Criteria Range: A1 = Heading = "URLs" A2 = Search Criteria = "<> google " Advanced Filter: In the Advanced Filter Dialog (Data > Filter >Advanced Filter...). Select 'Copy to another Location' List Range = "A4:B10004" Criteria Range = "A1:A2" Copy To = "H1:I1" (can be somewhere else on active sheet) Check 'Unique Records Only' Click OK This will return a list of unique URLS that does not include the keyword 'google'.
