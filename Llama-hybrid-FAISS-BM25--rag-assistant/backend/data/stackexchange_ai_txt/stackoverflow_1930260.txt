In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) you can highlight an object name in the Object Explorer and press Ctrl-C to copy the name to the clipboard. There is no need to press F2 or right-click, rename the object to copy the name. You can also drag and drop an object from the Object Explorer into your query window.
