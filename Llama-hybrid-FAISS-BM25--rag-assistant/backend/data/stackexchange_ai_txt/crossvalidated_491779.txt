Because this generalizes nicely to other types of regression models. That way we can express them all in a similar way (possibly with a link function - in your linear regression case the link function is just the identity function). This makes it easier to think of them in a similar way (and also to have similar programming interfaces to them). E.g. logistic regression can be expressed as $\text{logit}(E(Y_i)) := \text{logit}(\pi_i) = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ , with $Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$ , Poisson regression as $\log(E(Y_i)) := \text{log}(\mu_i) = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ , with $Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i)$ and so on.
