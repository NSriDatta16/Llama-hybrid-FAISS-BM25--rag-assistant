WPF TreeView similar to Organizational chart with connecting lines

I have modified my treeview to look like an Org chart using the example shown in the Code Project website (Author Josh Smith). I need connecting lines in the treeview to make it look exact to org chart. I found references pointing to the below site http://wpfblog.info/2008/05/26/turning-a-treeview-into-an-org-chart-with-connectors/ But I am not able to view the content. Probably the webpage has been moved. Can anybody help?
