How many dimensions does a neural network have?

I'm asking because when we visualize something like gradient descent, we usually visualize it in two or three dimensions like so: I understand that we do this to make visualization possible, but if we weren't thinking about visualizing it, how many dimensions would there be? Is it the number of channels at each layer in the neural network? So for ResNet50, it would be 64, 128, 256, and 512 at different points? And during the fully connected layer, it's 1000 dimensions. Are these the numbers to look at when thinking about how the optimizer works? Does the input image affect this at all? Image credit: https://shashank-ojha.github.io/ParallelGradientDescent/
