My Environment: Fedora 8; WAS 6.1 (as installed with Rational Application Developer 7) The documentation is very poor in this area and there is a dearth of practical examples. Using the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Ant tasks To run as described here, you need to run them from your server profile bin directory using the ws_ant.sh or ws_ant.bat commands. Script for listing installed apps. Example run from: /opt/IBM/SDP70/runtimes/base_v61/profiles/AppSrv01/bin Command: ./ws_ant.sh -buildfile ~/IBM/rationalsdp7.0/workspace/mywebappDeploy/applist.xml A Deployment Script Build/Deploy an EAR to WebSphere Application Server 6.1 Notes: You can only run this once! You cannot install if the app name is in use - see other tasks like wsUninstallApp It probably won't start the app either You need to run this on the server and the script is quite fragile Alternatives I would probably use Java Management Extensions (JMX). You could write a file-upload servlet that accepts an EAR and uses the deployment MBeans to deploy the EAR on the server. You would just POST the file over HTTP. This would avoid any WAS API dependencies on your dev/build machine and could be independent of any one project.
