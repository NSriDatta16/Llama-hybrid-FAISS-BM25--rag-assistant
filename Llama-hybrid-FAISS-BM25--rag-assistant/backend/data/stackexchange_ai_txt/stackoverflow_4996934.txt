The very basic idea is that images contain tons of redundant information that your eye cannot see. For instance if you changed the last bit on each pixel there would be no visible change as almost all of the information about the color is the other bits. So you can encode messages using the last bit (the most basic algorithm). The histogram however will be changed and a large message will easily be detectable. As far a decoding the message itself, well, the message itself is probably using public key encryption so you will never know what the actual payload was. Steganography unlike cryptography is considered broken if Eve (who is eavesdropping and practising steganalysis) knows that there is a message at all. The assumptions are based on that Alice and Bob are being watched and any communication is sign that they are up to something (aka prisoners, restrictive governments, all governments in the future hehe ;-)) And of course the algorithms become much more complex that just flipping the last bits, but encoding data that will not affect the structure of image (and become vulnerable to statistical attacks.) : I read this book last summer and I thought is was an excellent introduction (it has a lot a psuedocode of the algorithms used) http://www.amazon.com/Steganography-Digital-Media-Principles-Applications/dp/0521190193
