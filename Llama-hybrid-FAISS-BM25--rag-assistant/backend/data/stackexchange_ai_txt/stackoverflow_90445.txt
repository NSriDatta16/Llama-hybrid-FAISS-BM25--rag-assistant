It may not exactly fall into the 'grep' category, but I couldn't get by on Windows without a utility called AgentRansack . It's a GUI-based "find in files" utility with regex support. It's dead simple to right-click on a folder, hit "ransack.." and find files containing what you're looking for. It is extremely fast too.
