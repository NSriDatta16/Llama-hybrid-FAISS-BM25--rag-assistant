I got it to work finally. I took a different approach though. Create a new ASP.NET Server Control Project Copy class into default cs file and renamed namespace. Add default TagPrefix to line above namespace declaration. [assembly: TagPrefix("mynamespace", "mycustomtag")] Add ToolBoxData to line above class copied. [ToolboxData(" ")] Build project into dll Copy dll to bin directory of Web Application Reference dll in Web Application Project Add controls to toolbox by adding creating a new toolbox item from the dll Drag and drop control from toolbox into aspx page This adds the appropriate Register directive at the top of the aspx page and fixed all the warnings I received. The auto complete also works in this case as well. Below is the code. " SelectCommand="spTbl_Select" SelectCommandType="StoredProcedure"> No Data.
