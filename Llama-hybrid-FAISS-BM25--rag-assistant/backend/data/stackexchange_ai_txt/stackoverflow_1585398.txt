Linq with DataTables vs plain SQL

I'm working on an app that generates reports that are basically standard SQL operations (sum/average on data grouped by A/B where X=Y etc) the parts of the query can be defined by the user at runtime. as implemented, the raw data is in a a DataTable and I "parse" the query parameters into a linq expression (basically query operands map to DataTable column names). it's nifty and all, and wasn't much work, but I'm not entirely sure why I don't just put the data in a SQLite table and just use actual SQL, and just create query strings from the user's input. I know this is pretty broad, but is there some advantage that I'm missing now that down the line might prove linq to be a better implementation choice? the only thing that comes to mind is that if I want to move beyond a DataTable to my own classes for some reason, I can still use linq to query them.
