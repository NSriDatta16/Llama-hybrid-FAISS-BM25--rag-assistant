Your data set is $X_{10\times 216}$. The first thing I would do is SVD. For background material, see Wall, Michael E., Andreas Rechtsteiner, and Luis M. Rocha. "Singular value decomposition and principal component analysis." A practical approach to microarray data analysis. Springer US, 2003. 91-109. SVD will give you independent, characteristic time series (which may well exhibit seasonality based on your comments). If you think the dynamics between the bridges is constant over the 18 years, you can go ahead and fit your 10 DLMs to these 10 (or less) characteristic time series. I wouldn't worry about using too many explanatory series (e.g. 10), the irrelevant ones will have parameter loadings very near zero (see next paper, Keane and Corso , Fig.2). If you think the dynamics between the bridge animal counts evolved (perhaps a shopping mall arose in the middle), you may want to use sliding windows to perform SVD. The changing eigenspace adds a layer of complexity. But, you can track the evolution of the eigenspace, and carry forward your Bayesian posterior distributions from "yesterday" to prior distributions for "today", accounting for evolution in the eigenspace as described in Keane, Kevin R., and Jason J. Corso. "Maintaining prior distributions across evolving eigenspaces: An application to portfolio construction." Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2012 11th International Conference on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2012. This second article is very similar to what you want to do, just applied to stock returns rather than animal counts.
