gzipping up a set of directories and creating a tar compressed file

My bash fu is not what it should be. I want to create a little batch script which will copy a list of directories into a new zip file. There are (at least) two ways I can think of providing the list of files: Read from a file (say config.txt). The file will contain the list of directories to zip up OR Hard code the list directly into the bash script The first option seems more straightforward (though less elegant). The two problems I am facing are that I am not sure how to do the following: Provide the list of directories to the shell script Iterate over the list of directories Could someone suggest in a few lines, how I can do this? BTW, I am running on Ubuntu 10.0.4
