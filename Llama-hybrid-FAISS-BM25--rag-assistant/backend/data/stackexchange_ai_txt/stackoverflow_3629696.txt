I actually ask an interview question to weed out people who don't have basic SQL knowledge but claim it on their resume that this is a direct implementation of. It can lead to a good conversation about database design, normalization, de-normalization etc. What I'd want to see is the basic join syntax that goes hand in hand with the relationship table you've created. "Select subject from subjects inner join relations on relations.subject_id = subjects.id where relations.student_id = ?". Taking it the next step you get to "Select subject from subjects inner join relations on relations.subject_id = subjects.id inner join students on relations.student_id = students.student_id where students.name = ?". allowing you to query without pre-fetching the student id if you don't want to expose your internal database keys to the external user. The question mark is for variable binding, its rare that its a reasonable practice to not escape inputs for database interactions. Variable binding for queries is an easy way to get good coverage on that issue. I love asking this design problem as an interview question because it can quickly lead to discussions about SQL injection, how to sanitize web form input, and general best practices in data management, web application development and database design.
