On Creating an Interoperable Network Matrix

Complete self taught novice here. Question Are there any popular standards, or commonly used formats for representing/saving/sharing/serializing a network? Background I built a simple but very large (5.5m nodes, 16.7m edges) network matrix using my own python code. But if I wanted to use this matrix with other data science tools what format should I use? Currently I have it in a giant csv file with headers and "1" representing edges. Which I think is called a binary matrix. Goal I want to make use of any benefits present in using binary files, or formatted flat files that would help me learn other tools.
