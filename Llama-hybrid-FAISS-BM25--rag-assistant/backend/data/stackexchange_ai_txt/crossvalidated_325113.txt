Tuning of Hyperparameter

Are there any advanced packages that allows automated tuning of hyperparameters for neural network and traditional machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, random forest (using method like Bayesian, random search etc. that could allow faster discovering of best parameters)? I heard of hyperopt but seems there are some problems , and not sure it can train traditional machine learning algorithms?
