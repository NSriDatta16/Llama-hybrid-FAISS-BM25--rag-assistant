Using DBpedia you could do something like this... SELECT ?river ?riverName ?length WHERE { ?river . ?river ?length . FILTER (?length > 50000) ?river ?riverName . FILTER (lang(?riverName) = "en") } ORDER BY ?riverName I'm assuming the length property in DBpedia uses meters, but you should check. You can test the query at http://dbpedia.org/sparql . If this was homework and I just gave you the answer, I'd encourage you browse around at http://dbpedia.org/page/Rhine to see how I came up with it :)
