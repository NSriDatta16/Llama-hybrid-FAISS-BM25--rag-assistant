I would avoid things like "move the codes around". This is called "Programming by Coincidence" (see The Pragmatic Programmer ). Programming like this won't make you a better programmer. Instead, you should take out a paper and pencil, and start thinking how things should work. Then, read the code and carefully write what it actually does. Only when you understand, go back to the computer terminal.
