Python Simulation: Total Website Traffic Qty Estimation using Personas Segments

I need to estimate future website traffic & conversion volume based on: 1) Baseline historical averages for 6 differing types of traffic segments 2) How each of those distinct visitor segments interacts with 5 unique content groups After searching the internet I've concluded modules exist that can easily be adapted to fit my assumptions. Reference the following article which describes an overall traffic queuing application: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-simpy.html?dwzone=linux Please advise if there's a more realistic alternative approach or pre-existing modules to tweak. Thank you in advance for your kind consideration and support.
