Wait the end of subprocesses with multiple parallel jobs

I'm running some subprocesses from python in parallel. I want to wait until every subprocess have finished. I'm doing a non elegant solution: runcodes = ["script1.C", "script2.C"] ps = [] for script in runcodes: args = ["root", "-l", "-q", script] p = subprocess.Popen(args) ps.append(p) while True: ps_status = [p.poll() for p in ps] if all([x is not None for x in ps_status]): break is there a class that can handle multiple subprocess? The problem is that the wait method block my program. update : I want to show the progress during the computation: something like "4/7 subprocess finished..." If you are curious root compile the c++ script and execute it.
