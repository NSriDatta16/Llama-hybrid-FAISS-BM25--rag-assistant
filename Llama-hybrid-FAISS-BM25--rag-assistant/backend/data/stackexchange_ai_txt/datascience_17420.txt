Masking numbers in plotly time series plot

I'm interested in masking all non-zero values in a plotly time series plot. Is there a way to simply not include the zeroes when rendering the plot, and connect all data points greater than zero? I tried limiting the range in the layout, but this did not change what was plotted: import plotly.graph_objs as go import plotly.plotly as py data = [go.Scatter( x=data['timestamp'], y=data['units_sold'])] layout = go.Layout( yaxis=dict( range=[2, 15])) fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout) py.iplot(data) Here is the general structure of my code as a Pandas dataframe: import pandas as pd d = {'timeseries' : [801, 802, 803, 804, 805], 'units_sold' : [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]} pd.DataFrame(d)
