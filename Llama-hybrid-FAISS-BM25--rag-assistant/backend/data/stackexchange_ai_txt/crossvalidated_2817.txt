I seem to recall that it is possible to perform PCA by computing the eigen-decomposition of X^TX rather than XX^T and then transform to get the PCs. However I can't remember the details off-hand, but it is in Jolliffe's (excellent) book and I'll look it up when I am next at work. I'd transliterate the linear algebra routines from e.g. Numerical Methods in C, rather than use any other algorithm.
