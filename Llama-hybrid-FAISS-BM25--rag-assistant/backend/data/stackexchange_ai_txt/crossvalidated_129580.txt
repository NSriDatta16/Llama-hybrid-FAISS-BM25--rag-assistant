Applicability of Hilbert-Huang Transform for linear trend analysis

I have a question about the applicability of the Hilbert-Huang Transform / empirical mode decomposition (HHT/EMD). Suppose I have a time series dataset in which there is probably an N-year periodic component, some shorter-period periodic components, a linear trend, and noise. Unfortunately, my dataset is considerably shorter than N years. My goal is not to find the periodic components (though that would be mildly interesting), but to more accurately find the linear trend, by removing the influence of the periodic components. Is HHT/EMD useful for this? Can it help me make a more accurate determination of the linear trend than simple linear regression analysis would do?
