Textbook definition of Data augmentation

I'm trying to find a textbook definition of Data augmentation. We all know what it is, but I'm having a hard time finding a reliable source which I can cite for my paper: The Wikipedia article on Data augmentation misquotes an article by Shorten & Khoshgoftaar which doesn't actually present a definition. There are many definitions in blog posts , but these are not reliable sources. It doesn't help that there is a Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm with the same name cluttering up search results. Any clues?
