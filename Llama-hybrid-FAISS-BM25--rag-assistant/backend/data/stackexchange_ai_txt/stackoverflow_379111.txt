These may be some helpful hints.. Comments - figure out what a small chunk does and comment it so you understand it when you refer back to it later. Syntax highlighting - make sure you're viewing code with something that will color-code the query. Indentation - reorganize the query to make sense for you.. tab things over, add carriage returns. For example: select ID, Description, Status from ABC where Status = 1 OR Status = 3 could be better written as: select ID, Description, Status from ABC where Status = 1 OR Status = 3 with a more complex query, you'd see a much bigger benefit.
