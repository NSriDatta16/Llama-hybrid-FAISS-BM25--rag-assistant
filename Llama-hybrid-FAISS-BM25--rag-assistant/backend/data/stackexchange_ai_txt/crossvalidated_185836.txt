Which cost function out of Logloss, AUC & overall error is better for unbalanced classes & why?

Why does Logloss & AUC perform better than overall error for unbalanced classes? How to choose between Logloss & AUC or unbalanced classes? FYI - I am referring to objective / cost function of the classification algorithm. Example: xgboost packages provides option to choose logloss, auc or overall error as the objective function.
