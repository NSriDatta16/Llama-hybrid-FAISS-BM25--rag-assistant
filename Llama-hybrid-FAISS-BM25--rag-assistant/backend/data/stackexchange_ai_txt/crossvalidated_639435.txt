Neural Network Classification - targetting class probability and not the class themselves

Let's say I have a binary classification problem; two classes $A$ , $B$ that I want to predict from a bunch of features. But, I am also given a (predicted - will be close to accurate) probability that it is class $A$ and a probability that it is class $B$ . Let's say $0.78, 0.22$ respectively. It is these probabilities that I want to target in my problem. If I just go the standard route of $BinaryCrossentropy()$ loss, then the net knows nothing about these probabilities I want to target. Does this now turn in to more of a regression problem? Or maybe a classification problem but with a custom loss function?
