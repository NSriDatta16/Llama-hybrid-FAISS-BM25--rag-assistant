I'm afraid (to the best of my knowledge) this is basically impossible with LaTeX. A LuaTeX-based solution might be possible, though. It's not actually clear to me, however, that " a ", for example, shouldn't appear at the end of a line. Although I might be used to different typographic rules. (Is there anything wrong with the line break in the last paragraph? :) )
