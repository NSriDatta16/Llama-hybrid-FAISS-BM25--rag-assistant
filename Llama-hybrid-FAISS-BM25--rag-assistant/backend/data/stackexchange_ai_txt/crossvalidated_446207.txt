The method that you use can benefit from the fact that these 128 numbers have temporal relations. One common way to achieve this is to use discrete cosine transform (DCT)as a pre-processing step. After DCT you can use your classifier of choice. In this way given the proper use of model complexity control tools, you can achieve a more compact model with a temporal signal. I would start with logistic regression as the baseline model and then increase the complexity if it improves the performance. SVM seems rather a reasonable choice after DCT considering the number of data points that you have.
