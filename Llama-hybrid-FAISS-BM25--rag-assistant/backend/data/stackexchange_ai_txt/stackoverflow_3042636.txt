"Complex" UI usually entails not "writing" it but building it within Visual Studio with point and click. All the callbacks and eventing code is inserted by itself. There is almost nothing like that on python side. I'd say go for C# straight out. There is one nagging thing though. If you are true Pythonista, the static typing will get to you very very quickly and you will want to start throwing heavy objects at random people. If that point comes think about building out the UI with C# and embedding IronPython as a scripting engine for implementing your business logic. That could be a tolerable middle ground.
