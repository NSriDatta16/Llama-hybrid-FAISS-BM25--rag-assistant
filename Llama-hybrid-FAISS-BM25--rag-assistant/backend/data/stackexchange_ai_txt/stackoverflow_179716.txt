Average difference between dates in Python

I have a series of datetime objects and would like to calculate the average delta between them. For example, if the input was (2008-10-01 12:15:00, 2008-10-01 12:25:00, 2008-10-01 12:35:00) , then the average delta would be exactly 00:10:00, or 10 minutes. Any suggestions on how to calculate this using Python?
