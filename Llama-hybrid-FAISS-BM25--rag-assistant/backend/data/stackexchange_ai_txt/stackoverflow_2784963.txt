I wrote a Django/Ajax library that organises this for you. You write your template as such: {% load ajax %} {% adjax_include "event/_event_list.html" %} In your view you would do something like: import adjax @adjax_response def view_listings(req): events = models.Event.objects.all() adjax.render_to_response("event/_event_list.html", {'events': events}) There is also a template tag that flags a single value for replacement, eg {% adjax event.title %} and then adjax.update(request, event, ('title', 'description', 'id')) in the view. But this is only single objects currently, not query sets. It's a good idea though, I might quickly implement it. See http://adjax.hardysoftware.com.au/how/
