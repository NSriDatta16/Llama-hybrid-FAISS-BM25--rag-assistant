How to move a form while the mouse is being held down?

I have a Windows form which does not have a border, titlebar, menu, etc.. I want the user to be able to hold the CTRL key down, left-click anywhere on my form, and drag it, and have it move. Any idea how to do this? I tried this, but it flickers, a lot: private void HiddenForm_MouseMove(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Button == System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Left) { this.SuspendLayout(); Point xy = new Point(this.Location.X + (e.X - this.Location.X), this.Location.Y + (e.Y - this.Location.Y)); this.Location = xy; this.ResumeLayout(true); } }
