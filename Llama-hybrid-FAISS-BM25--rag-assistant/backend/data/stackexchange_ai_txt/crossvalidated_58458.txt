Seems that what I was looking for is the intraclass correlation . edit: In statistics, the intraclass correlation (or the intraclass correlation coefficient, abbreviated ICC) 1 is a descriptive statistic that can be used when quantitative measurements are made on units that are organized into groups. It describes how strongly units in the same group resemble each other. While it is viewed as a type of correlation, unlike most other correlation measures it operates on data structured as groups, rather than data structured as paired observations. The groups in the above description are the factor levels from the question. Instead of calculating a correlation coefficient based on pairing observations at each factor level (either all pairwise or after randomly splitting the data set in 2), I calculated the ICC (did so using the R ICC package).
