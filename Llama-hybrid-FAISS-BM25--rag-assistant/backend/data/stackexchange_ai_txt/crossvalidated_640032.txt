One class never gets predicted, regardless of the model

I'm working on a classification problem from a dataset containing three classes, with proportions {"0":0.43, "1":0.25, "2":0.30} . However, whenever I train a model, it never predicts class "1" (literally ZERO predictions). Even weirder, this happens regardless of the model I train (tried the usual, SVM, RF, tree boosting, etc.). So I guess there is something in the data that I did not catch, but the fact that there is not even one or two predictions for class 1 is really disturbing. Attached is the distribution of my test set, vs. the distribution of my predictions (here for a baseline SVM) : Thanks.
