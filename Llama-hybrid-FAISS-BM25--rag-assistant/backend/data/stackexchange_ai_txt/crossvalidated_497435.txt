Steady state distribution overdetermined linear system

I am trying to find the steady state distribution of the transition matrix given by the discrete and time-homogeneous Markov Chain with state space $S \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ . The transition matrix is the following: $$P=\left|\begin{array}{ccccc}1 / 2 & 0 & 0 & 1 / 2 & 0 \\ 1 / 2 & 1 / 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 / 4 & 1 / 2 & 0 & 0 & 1 / 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 / 2 & 1 / 4 & 1 / 4\end{array}\right|$$ With the aid of computational tools(quantecon package), i've managed to find that the steady state vector $\pi$ equals: $$\pi=\left(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\right)$$ However , when trying to solve $$ \pi=\pi P $$ subject to $$ \pi_{0}+\pi_{1}+\pi_{2}+\pi_{3}+\pi_{4}=1 $$ i came across the overdetermined system: $$ \left[\begin{array}{ccccc} -1 / 2 & 1 / 2 & 1 / 4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 / 2 & 1 / 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 / 4 \\ 1 / 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 / 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 / 4 & 0 & -3 / 4 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c} \pi_{0} \\ \pi_{1} \\ \pi_{2} \\ \pi_{3} \\ \pi_{4} \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right] $$ Which i tried to solve by using np.linalg.lstsq . The answer given by NumPy was: $$\operatorname{array}([2.28689719,1.3709223,0.86916554,0.57995555,0.22107943]))$$ which does not correspond to the solution initially mentioned. What am i doing wrong? I suspect it has something to do with the rank of the matrix, but i am not sure. Whatever the reason may be, the calculations should give the same result. Thanks in advance, Lucas
