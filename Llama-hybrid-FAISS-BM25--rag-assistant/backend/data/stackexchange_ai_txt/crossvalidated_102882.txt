Steps done in factor analysis compared to steps done in PCA

I know how to perform PCA (principal component analysis), but I would like to know steps that should be used for factor analysis. To perform PCA, let us consider some matrix $A$, for instance: 3 1 -1 2 4 0 4 -2 -5 11 22 20 I have calculated its correlation matrix B = corr(A) : 1.0000 0.9087 0.9250 0.9087 1.0000 0.9970 0.9250 0.9970 1.0000 Then I have done eigenvalue decomposition [V,D] = eig(B) , resulting in eigenvectors: 0.5662 0.8209 -0.0740 0.5812 -0.4613 -0.6703 0.5844 -0.3366 0.7383 and eigenvalues: 2.8877 0 0 0 0.1101 0 0 0 0.0022 General idea behind the PCA is to choose significant components, form new matrix which have columns eigenvectors, then we need to project original matrix (in PCA it is zero centered). But in factor analysis, for instance we should choose components that have higher that $1$ singular value, also then we are using rotation of factors, please tell me how it is done? For instance in this case. Please help me understand factor analysis steps, as compared to the PCA steps.
