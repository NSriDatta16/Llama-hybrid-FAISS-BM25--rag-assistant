about power of sizeof operator in C++

I am reading Modern C++ design. It was mentioned about sizeof opeator as following description. Following paragraph is explained from generic programming point of view. There is a surprising amount of power in sizeof: You can apply sizeof to any expression, no matter how complex, and sizeof returns its size without actually evaluating that expression at runtime. This means that sizeof is aware of overloading, template instantiation, conversion rulesâ€”everything that can take part in a C++ expression. In fact, sizeof conceals a complete facility for deducing the type of an expression; eventually, sizeof throws away the expression and returns only the size of its result. My question is what does author mean sizeof returns its size with out actually evalutating the exression at runtime. And also in last line it was mentioned that sizeof throws away the expression. Request help in understanding these statements, it would be good if it is done with example. Thanks
