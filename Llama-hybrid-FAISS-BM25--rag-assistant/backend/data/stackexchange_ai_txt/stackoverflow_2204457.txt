How can I add SOAP Headers to a WSDL generated Borland C++ Builder 6 application

Using a WSDL that requires a SOAP HEADER for Authentication (fragment below) code that gets generated when creating a web service client via the "WSDL Importer" has no concept of the Authentication Headers and there are no examples in BCB6 C++ Examples/WebServices directories that show how, and nothing on Web that I can find. Anyone with BCB6 C++ (not Delphi) have an example of adding SOAP Headers to a TRemotable subclass?
