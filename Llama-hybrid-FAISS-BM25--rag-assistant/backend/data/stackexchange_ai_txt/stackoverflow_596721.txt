I have done some extensive research on using Artificial Neural Networks for classification of underwater sound sources. The algorithm seemed to work quite well, especially that I devoted a big portion of the work on figuring out what combination of fourier transform coefficient composed the best set for the classification (with Principal Component Analysis).
