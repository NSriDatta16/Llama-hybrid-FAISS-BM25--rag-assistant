Usage of global variables is general discouraged in most languages, and R is no exception. Very often short function use short and generic variable names, which could be populated in the global environment. It is safest to a) include all the variables in the function definition b) not to assign default values. E.g., write f=function(a,b), rather f=function(a=0,b=NA).
