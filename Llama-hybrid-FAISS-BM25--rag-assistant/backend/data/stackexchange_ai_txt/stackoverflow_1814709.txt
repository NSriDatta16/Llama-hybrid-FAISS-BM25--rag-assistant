Ruby is all about productivity and programming fun, however there are several reasons why Ruby is elegant: Pure OOP: Everything is an object, so you don't have to distinguish between primitive and object types. It supports both Functional and Imperative programming paradigms: that leads to both concise and readable code. It supports the Principle of Least Surprise : which supports readability. It has closures and blocks: which is really cool for doing Internal DSLs . It has a robust Metaprogramming API : which empowers writing Internal DSLs as well. It's very good at scripting tasks: handling text and xml files and doing administration related stuff(it's being used widely by system admins now a days). It has a very cool and supportive community: you will find support and help whatever your problem is. This community supports modern and fashional coding techniques as well like TDD and BDD . The sum of all the above is that using Ruby you can have: Concise code: Compared to Java and C++, at least you can save yourself 50% of code typing. Readablility. Thus having readable and concise code -> less code to write -> less code to test and maintain -> Productivity . I shouldn't forget to mention the great supportive community behind Ruby.
