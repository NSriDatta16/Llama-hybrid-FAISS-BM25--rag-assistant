They are two completely different memory measures. Working set is the amount of RAM your program uses. It is a constantly changing number and affected by how much RAM other processes need. You can't run out of RAM, Windows makes RAM available to you by swapping mapped pages out to the paging file. Private bytes is the amount of virtual memory your program uses that isn't shared with any other process. On a 32-bit machine, you have 2 gigabytes of virtual memory available. It needs to be shared between code and data. You get OOM when there isn't enough space left in the addressable amount of virtual memory to fit the requested allocation. Yes, it is the more accurate number. Asking for 100 megabytes at a time is risky. Virtual memory space can get fragmented and after a while there might still be lots of free virtual memory but not a hole that large enough to fit 100 megabytes. A jagged array solves this problem because it is an array of arrays, the required chunks are much smaller so can easily fit whatever holes are left. A 64-bit operating system completely solves this problem. Your program has many gigabytes of address space available, in practice limited only by the maximum size of the paging file. You simply can't run out of big holes.
