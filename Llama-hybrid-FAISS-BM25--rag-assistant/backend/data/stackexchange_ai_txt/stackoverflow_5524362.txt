How to save a large fractal image with the least possible memory footprint?

I'm currently working on fractals, and when it comes to fractals, detail is a must. However, since I am using Java, I run out of heap space once I get past about 2000x2000px. Yes, I could increase the heap space, but that's not a very elegant solution. So my question is: Are there any image formats where I could write the pixel data as I calculate it? If there are multiple, which ones are the easiest to understand? (The Java libraries only support writing whole images at a time, from what I know). Thanks!
