Or should I write a query that just yanks all the columns.. No. Just today there was another question about that . If possible, could you help me understand what aspects of a query would be relatively costly compared to one another? Is it the joins? is it the large number of records pulled? is it the number of columns in the select statement? Any useless join or data retrieval costs you time and should be avoided. Retrieving rows from a datastore is costly. Joins can be more or less costly depending on the context, amount of indexes defined... you can examine the query plan of each query to see the estimated cost for each step.
