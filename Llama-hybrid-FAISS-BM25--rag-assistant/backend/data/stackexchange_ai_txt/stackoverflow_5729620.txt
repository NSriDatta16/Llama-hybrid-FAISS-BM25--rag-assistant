Just a wild guess: There is something called "web accelerator", a browser plugin that pre-fetches links, so when you decided to click on one, it was already cached. It shouldn't be caching things that look like queries, but maybe some detects your URLs as suitable for prefetching. Since it runs in browser, it will at very least see all URLs that javascript added to the document (by means of document.write or DOM access). A "web accelerator" can also be implemented as part of web proxy. It seems less likely, because it would have to interpret the javascript, but if the URLs appear in the javascript in full, it might simply be grepping any text for anything that looks like a URL and might find them. This would explain why the requests are spread out (such thing would fire a couple of requests each time a real user visits the site), why the user agent strings correspond to actual browser (if it's browser plugin, it uses it's user agent string) and why they jump all over the place (they simultaneously try to prefetch several links and probably the heuristics picking which ones it should be does not work well with your site).
