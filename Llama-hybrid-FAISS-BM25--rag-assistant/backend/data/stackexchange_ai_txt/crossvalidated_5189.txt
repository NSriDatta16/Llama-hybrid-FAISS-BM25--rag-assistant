Getting started with time series in R

With some great help from this forum, I have been able to get up and running with some basic time series analysis in R. Right now, my needs are mostly univariate time series. Here is my question: I can read in daily data from database into a data frame. I have two columns, date which is understood by R as POSIXct and the second which is the value of interest and numeric. What is the best, most straightforward way to make this a ts object where R understands the start/end dates and represents daily observations dynamically? It seems to me that I shouldn't be required to (when coercing my object to a ts object) manually tell it the start and end dates when the data frame is already has it. For some context, I have been able to aggregate other data from daily to weekly, but find myself doing things in ways that just seem long and unnecessary considering R already understands my raw data as time. As you can tell, I am new to R and time series in R, but I figure that since R is so powerful, there probably is a pretty easy way around my issues.
