R train random forest for positive or negative predicitve value, not accuracy

I am working with random forests on financial data (predicting if stock rises versus falls). I figured out that I get better performance, if I build one model for "rising" and one for "falling". When building the models with best features sets I then just manipulate the cut-off values of my probabilities (e.g. > 0.85 for "rising"). Yet, is there a way to a priori train random forests (or other models) for positive predictive value performance (so. it should only predict "rise" with a low false positive rate - I dont care about accuracy)
