If you're trying to implement a drag-and-drop operation of some sort, the Drag... events (DragEnter, DragDrop etc.) on the receiving picture box are what you want to use. Basically, you start the drag operation using the DoDragDrop method of the source control, and then any control that you drag over will have its Drag... events raised. Search "DoDragDrop" on MSDN to see how to implement this.
