It makes it easier for others to follow your writing if you define notation you're using. Personally I would prefer not to read a long paper to gather this information. 1.) When you say: This equation becomes easier because we select a uniform prior, whose density is constant. Take note of this point because I made an arbitrary choice of prior. this does not necessarily work with your model. The distribution $p(x_k)$ might not be the same for all time points. It would be if a) your hidden Markov Chain was stationary, and b) the stationary distribution it admitted was your uniform distribution. 2.) Then you say, "$X^i_k|y_k \sim y_k-w_k$." This would be true if the previous was true, and if $f$ is the identity function, which I don't think you specified. 3.) When you write $w^i_{k-1}\frac{p(x_k^i|x_{k-1}^i)p(x^i_k|y_k)p(y_k)}{p(x^i_k|y_k)p(x^i_k)}$, you have made it less simple, because you probably do not have the ability to evaluate $p(y_k)$ or $p(x_k^i|y_k)$. 4.) Lastly, if you choose $g$ and $f$ to be linear, then you can test your derivations empirically. This is the situation that a Kalman filter would work in, and a Kalman filter is able to directly evaluate the conditional likelihoods at each time step.
