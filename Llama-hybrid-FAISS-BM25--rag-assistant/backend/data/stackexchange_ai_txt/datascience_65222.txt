Multi label text classification from thousands of labels

I don't have machine learning experties, but I'm working on a project that has text classification requirements in it. The easiest approach I was able to understand was using fasttext.. It worked, but the accuracy is terrible. The problem is that we are trying to classify academic publications with multiple labels out of thousands of labels. I've followed all the best practices to clean the training data and followed the fasttext tutorials, but still the prediction quality is 15% max. So my question is, is fasttext the right solution to this problem? What other solutions can be used if otherwise? Can you guide me to any examples or tutorials similar problems (multi-label out of VERY LARGE set of LABELS)?
