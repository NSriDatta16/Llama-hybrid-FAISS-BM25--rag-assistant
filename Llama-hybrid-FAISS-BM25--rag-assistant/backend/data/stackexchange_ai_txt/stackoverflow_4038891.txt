There's different types of coverage: Method level coverage (what C++ compilers used to do) Line level coverage Symbol level coverage (most C# coverage tools provide this) Branch level coverage (many Java coverage tools provide this) I think your confusion is coming in to play because you are thinking in terms of symbol coverage while your tool is giving you branch coverage. Here's the distinction: Symbol coverage will measure whether you have reached each symbol (i.e. bunch of code up to a ';' character). The below line contains two symbols: int i = 0; int j = 3; Branch coverage measures each condition in both the true and false values. In your example you had 4 different conditions listed, each of which have a true branch and a false branch. In order to fully test each branch, you need a test for each of the following conditions: string ends with char y, char before last is e string ends with char y, char before last is a string ends with char y, char before last is neither a nor e string does not end with char y With the code you wrote, you will probably experience something unexpected. You will get something_awesome no matter what if the string ends in y. If the string ends with 'ey', then it is not ending with 'ay'. If either of those conditions are true you get something awesome. Write the tests and see for yourself.
