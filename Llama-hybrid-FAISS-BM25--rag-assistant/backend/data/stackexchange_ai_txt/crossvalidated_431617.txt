Finding optimal cutoff point

.Hello,everyone. I am studying the influence of one biomarker on multiple disease characteristics, and I would like to calculate its cutoff point. I created univariate ROC curves to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of this biomarker for each characteristis, and it's obviously that I have obtained different cutoff values. Could I combine this AUCs in order to obtain one general, optimal cutoff point? (something like multivariate analysis with multiple outcomes?) Thank you in advance for you help! Thank you for your attention and your answers! But your answers consider the case when we have MULTIPLE independent variables (predictors) and ONE dependent variable (outcome). However, I have MULTIPLE outcomes.
