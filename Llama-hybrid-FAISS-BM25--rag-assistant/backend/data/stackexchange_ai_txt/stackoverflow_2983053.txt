How to use custom drawing in QGraphicsViews in PyQt?

I need to view QGraphicsScene in 2 QGraphicsViews with condition that they have different scale factors for items in scene. Closest function which I found is drawItems() , but as far I can understand, it must be called manually. How to repaint views automatically? I have these two code fragments in program: class TGraphicsView(QGraphicsView): def __init__(self, parent = None): print("__init__") QGraphicsView.__init__(self, parent) def drawItems(self, Painter, ItemCount, Items, StyleOptions): print("drawItems") Brush = QBrush(Qt.red, Qt.SolidPattern) Painter.setBrush(Brush) Painter.drawEllipse(0, 0, 100, 100) ... Mw.gvNavigation = TGraphicsView(Mw) # Mw - main window Mw.gvNavigation.setGeometry(0, 0, Size1, Size1) Mw.gvNavigation.setScene(Mw.Scene) Mw.gvNavigation.setSceneRect(0, 0, Size2, Size2) Mw.gvNavigation.show() __init__ works, Mw.gvNavigation is displayed and there are Mw.Scene items in it, but drawItems() isn't called.
