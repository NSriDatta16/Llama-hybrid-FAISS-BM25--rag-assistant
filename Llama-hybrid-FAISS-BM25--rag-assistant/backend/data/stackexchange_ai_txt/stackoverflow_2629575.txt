Could you provide more details regarding "a specific file from a folder"? What rules would you use to identify a file manually? I wouldn't say going through the GUI is the best way for such cases. If there is anything, that you can use for recognition of a file, stored in the file/folder system, I would try going through the back-end. A simple example to illustrate. Counting total number of text files contained in a folder, and storing a path of the all Excel files found. Dim sFolder Dim FSO, objFolder, objFile, objXLSList Dim intTXTCount sFolder = "C:\TEMP" Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") Set objXLSList = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary") Set objFolder = FSO.GetFolder(sFolder) intTXTCount = 0 For Each objFile In objFolder.Files If Regex_Test(objFile.Name, ".*\.[t,T][t,T][t,T]") Then intTXTCount = intTXTCount + 1 End If If Regex_Test(objFile.Name, ".*\.[x,X][l,L][s,S]") Then objXLSList.Add objXLSList.Count, objFile.Name End If Next Thank you, Albert Gareev http://automation-beyond.com/
