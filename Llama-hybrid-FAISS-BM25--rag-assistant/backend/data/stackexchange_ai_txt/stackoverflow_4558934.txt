Setting List = List - having a brain dead moment

I'm sure this is easy. Infact I'm sure I've done this before... I have a class of MyClass which has 2 parameters TheString and SomeInt Somewhere, in another class I declare an List MyClassList and a List StringList Both have the same number of items. I want this to set all "TheStrings" in each MyClass from MyClassList equal to the corresponding String from StringList I set MyClassList = StringList Now I know this wont work because they're different types. I think I've got to overload the assignment (=) operator but I can't see how this is done. I suppose I could always provide a method to call from MyClass, but that isn't quite so elegant. What would be the most elegant solution? Thanks Thomas
