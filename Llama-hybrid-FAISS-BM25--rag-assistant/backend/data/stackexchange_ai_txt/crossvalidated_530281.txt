Scaling a gene expression data generates NA values

I would like to analyze the prostate gene expression data which has a link named 12859_2005_967_MOESM4_ESM.tgz in the site here . In a paper I read, the author scaled the predictors in the training set before fitting a logistic regression model. Hence, I need to scale the predictors in the training set to unit variance before the analysis. However, my program code (in R ) generated NA values after scaling the data. What can be the reason for this? The code is below: library(R.matlab) library(dplyr) data $prostate.data colnames(X) prostate.label y % slice(train.ind) test % slice(-train.ind) trainx % select(-"y") trainy % select("y") trainx
