I agree with Zach's answer, GEE is inherently a frequentist technique. There are Bayesian analogs to estimating equations (see also the last chapter of Small and Wang's book ), but it's not exactly the same thing. The only property of the Tweedie family that is needed by GEE is the power law relationship between mean and variance. So, in principle there is no reason you couldn't fit a GEE that is consistent with a Tweedie outcome. For example, there is a function called geeglm in the R package geepack that accepts GLM family objects. You could pass in the tweedie family from the statmod package.
