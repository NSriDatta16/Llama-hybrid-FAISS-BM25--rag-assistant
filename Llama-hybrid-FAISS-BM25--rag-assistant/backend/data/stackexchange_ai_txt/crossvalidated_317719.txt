I am assuming the individual's age in your model is time invariant, thus, you will not be able to use fixed effects. This is important because since an individual does not experience both being "young" and "old" you cannot estimate any within person differences. Furthermore, a random effect is also not that helpful since you observe each person in your sample, and it is not a subset of the greater sample so you do not care to estimate random effects. What you can do is control for any parameter that you think is driving a person-level effect and then use your age indicator in an interaction term in your model. This will tell you how the average young/old person reacts.
