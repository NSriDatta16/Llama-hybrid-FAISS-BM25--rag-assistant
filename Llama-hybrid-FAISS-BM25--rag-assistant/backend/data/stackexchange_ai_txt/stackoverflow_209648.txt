I have used both CC.net and TeamCity. I am tasked with setting up and installing TeamCity for my organization (5 developers). Our organization uses some uncommon practices and tools (at least, for orgs of our size), such as Perforce for source control and multiple build agents running on heterogeneous operating systems, which caused some initial setup headaches. However, the support via email was absolutely top-notch in getting everything set up. I received answers to my dumb questions in literally minutes. The interface is intuitive and responsive, as well as feature-packed. The product feels very expensive. Configuration is easy, and the web interface is intellegent enough to update itself without any restarting of the agent or server services, or even refreshing of the page. I feel like we're using just about every advanced feature of the product and have found no bugs at all so far. Ndepend integration, nested NAnt scripts, Perforce version labeling, you name it, we're doing it. I highly recommend TeamCity to anyone looking for a continuous integration server, or any build server, really.
