Here are some thoughts, although please be forgiving as it's hard to get to the root of your challenge without a little more context for the data and the purpose of the graph. First, the data sample itself seems less than adequate. Indeed, it has gaping holes: no data from 12/5 to 12/11? With data, it's garbage in, garbage out. From that perspective, one of your challenges would be to start getting more consistent data. The line graph falsely implies there is data for the 12/5 to 12/11 date range. Was the "Confidence" level on 12/8 really 38? Maybe it was 0? Maybe it was 140? The point is, we don't know, yet the connected line graph (by it's very nature) is faking us into thinking we do know. Also, if you're going to use a scale of "days", then I don't understand how you can have multiple values for a single day and try to plot all of those? (Maybe that's not what you're doing... .) I would think you would want to take the average of each of the categories grouped by day and have those groupings be your daily data values. And if you don't have data for a day, then refrain from plotting data you don't have.
