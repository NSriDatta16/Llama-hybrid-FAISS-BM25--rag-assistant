A Bayesian approach to the problem works out neatly. The reference posterior (see equation 6) of $\phi\equiv{p_A/p_B}$ is $\phi^{ref}\sim{}B'(\phi;x_A+1/2,x_B+1/2)$ , where $B'$ is the beta prime distribution and $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the number of observations of $A$ and $B$ from the independent trials. Notice that the posterior distribution of $\phi$ is parameterized only by the counts of observations of $A$ and $B$ , so the results of the analysis are the same whether the counts came from 500 rolls or 2000 rolls. The beta prime CDF is the regularized incomplete beta function, $I_{\frac{\phi}{\phi+1}}(x_A+1/2,x_B+1/2)$ The posterior likelihood that $\phi>1$ (i.e., $p_A>p_B$ ) is $1-I_{1/2}(10.5,44.5)\approx{7.97\times10^{-7}}$ In R: pbeta(0.5, 10.5, 44.5, lower.tail = FALSE) #> [1] 7.972998e-07 As Bernardo and Ram√≥n point out, the analysis works out similarly with the parameter $\theta_{A|AB}\equiv\frac{\phi}{\phi+1}$ , which is the probability that the die shows $A$ given that the result of the roll is either $A$ or $B$ . The reference/Jeffreys posterior of the probability of a Bernoulli trial is given by the beta distribution: $Be(\theta_{A|AB};x_A+1/2,x_B+1/2)$
