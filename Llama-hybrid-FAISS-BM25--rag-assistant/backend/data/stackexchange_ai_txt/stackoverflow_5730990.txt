flowdocument pagination - forcing elements to appear on a new page

when i print a flow document, I want certain elements - paragraphs, tables - probably marked with some attached property to: be transferred to a new page if they do not fit entirely on the previous one or always appear on a new page. Has anybody done it already or has an idea how to do it? Cheers
