Comparing across groups and classifying (as in DFA) with non-normal data

I study birdsong, and am examining the structural song differences across multiple geographic groups (101 individuals across 3 groups), as measured via ~20 structure-related variables. I had hoped to conduct a PCA to reduce the number of variables, followed by a MANOVA to compare across groups and a discriminant function analysis to classify the individuals based on structure. The problem is that some of the original variables are very non-normal in distribution and, as a result, a few of the resulting principal components are non-normal -- one so much so that typical transformation methods (eg., log10) do not help. The PCs do not meet the normality assumptions of the MANOVA and DFA (assessed by plotting and testing the residuals in SPSS). A noteworthy wrinkle is that the individuals (or sub-group, if you want) that is causing the non-normality is really where the story of my results lies... in how they don't fit with the rest of their group. So, in a way, the thing I am most interested in is what is keeping me from proceeding with this analysis. With all that in mind, I am looking for some advice on how to proceed... whether it's getting to a place where I can use MANOVA/DFA, or perhaps an alternative to DFA that does not require normal distribution. One possibility is that, if I can find such an alternative, I could use the classification results as justification for a different grouping arrangement, which may lead to the data fitting the assumptions of the MANOVA, such that I could then proceed with that. Apologies for any concepts that I have mucked up, I am learning on the fly to some degree.
