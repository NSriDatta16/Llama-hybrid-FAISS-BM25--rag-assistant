I have another solution for you, but it's a bit more radical, and a bit more of a conceptual one. You could create your own indexes, using azure table storage. Create partitions based on each word in your documents, as all tables are indexed on the partitionkey, per word search should be fast, and just do memory joins for multiple word searches.
