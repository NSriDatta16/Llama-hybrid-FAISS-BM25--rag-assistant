Heavy-tailed RBF kernel function

I'm trying to run a SVM regression on some data and I want to use ksvm from kernlab or svm from e1071 . But the number and type of kernels available is too restrictive. So I'm thinking of writing my own kernel function. Let's assume I want to write the kernel for heavy-tailed RBF for which the formula is $$ K(x_i, x_j) = \exp\left(-\gamma * ||x_i^a - x_j^a||^b\right) $$ How do I do this? I found several instances where people do something similar to the following code. kp=function(xi,xj){ diff Is this correct or is there something else that is needed? Also how do I get the best values of a , b and $\gamma$ for my data?
