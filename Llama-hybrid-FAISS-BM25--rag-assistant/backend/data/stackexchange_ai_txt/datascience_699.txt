From my experience only some classes of queries can be classified on lexical features (due to ambiguity of natural language). Instead you can try to use boolean search results (sites or segments of sites, not documents, without ranking) as features for classification (instead on words). This approach works well in classes where there is a big lexical ambiguity in a query but exists a lot of good sites relevant to the query (e.g. movies, music, commercial queries and so on). Also, for offline classification you can do LSI on query-site matrix. See "Introduction to Information Retrieval" book for details.
