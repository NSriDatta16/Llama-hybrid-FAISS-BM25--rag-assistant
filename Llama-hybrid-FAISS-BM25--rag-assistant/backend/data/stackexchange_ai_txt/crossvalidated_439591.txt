Forecast accuracy rolling window

What is the best way to get a measure of how well an ARIMA model can predict a timeseries when doing an out-of-sample rolling window? I cant use MPE cause it contains zeroes. What I am looking for is actually a span that states: " The prediction has an average error span between ... % and ... %. How do one find that out?
