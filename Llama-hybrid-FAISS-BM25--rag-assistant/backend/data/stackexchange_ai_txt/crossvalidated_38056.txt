Has "Understanding Monte Carlo Markov Chain" by Roberts and Tweedie ever been published?

In Monte Carlo Statistical Methods by Robert and Casella, I saw there is a reference to Understanding Monte Carlo Markov Chain (Springer Series in Statistics) by Gareth O. Roberts and Richard L. Tweedie published in 2004. I searched this book on the internet and didn't find its availability. On Amazon, one link says it was published in 2008 and another link says it will be in 2015.
