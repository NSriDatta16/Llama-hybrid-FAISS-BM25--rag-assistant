I can provide you with a workaround, although it's not perfect it should probably be a good estimate. You use a persistent storage mechanism (properties files, db, whatever) to keep track of the number of created beans. You use IObjectPostProcessors to update the count of initializations On the first run, obviously the value will be 0 On the subsequent runs, you use the last count to estimate the number of initializations that are to be done. Of course, this is not accurate, but it should provide a good estimate most of the times.
