This is a good question, one that I will be subscribing too :) I am still relatively new to web dev, and I too am looking at a lot of code that is largely untested. For me, I keep the UI as light as possible (normally only a few lines of code) and test the crap out of everything else. At least I can then have some confidence that everything that makes it to the UI is as correct as it can be. Is it perfect? Perhaps not, but at least it as still quite highly automated and the core code (where most of the "magic" happens) still has pretty good coverage..
