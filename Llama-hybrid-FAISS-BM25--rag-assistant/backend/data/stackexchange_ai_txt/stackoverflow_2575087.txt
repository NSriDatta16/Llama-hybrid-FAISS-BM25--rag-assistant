If you're looking for books on refining your craft in C++ as a language, you don't get much better than Scott Meyers' Effective C++ and More Effective C++ and Herb Sutter's Exceptional C++ , More Exceptional C++ and Exceptional C++ Style . All are packed with invaluable information on bringing your facility with the language from the intermediate to the advanced level. System-level programming is specific to operating system, so the books diverge based on your platform. Ones I've found very helpful (albeit not C++ specific) are: Windows System Programming , by Johnson M. Hart, Advanced Windows Debugging , by Mario Hewardt and Daniel Pravat, and Linux System Programming , by Robert Love. All of these books (as well as Peter Alexander's excellent suggestion of Modern C++ Design ) are available on O'Reilly's Safari service, which is a pretty cost-effective way of doing a lot of technical reading on the cheap and well worth checking out if you're considering going on a studying binge.
