Well there are 3 ways I can see for you: -1) use the fact that variable passed are passed by reference. this way you can modify directly the object in your function and not have to worry about return values -2) you can simple create a array of objects: Object[] returnTab = new Object[numberToStore]; (this is not very pretty I find) -3) create a ReturnObjectContainer object public class container { public ObjectA a; public ObjectB b; Arraylist list = new list(); ... //add whatever you need to store }
