You don't have to ToString() it; you should be able to access its Name through GetType() (which is pretty much the same thing). Either way, because it's a private class and not accessible from developer code, I think you're stuck with a "magic string" if you need to verify that it is specifically a RuntimeType. Not all "best solutions" are as elegant as we'd like. If all Type parameters you'd get are actually RuntimeType objects, you can look for the base class as was suggested in another answer. However, if you can receive a Type that isn't a RuntimeType, you'll get some "false positives".
