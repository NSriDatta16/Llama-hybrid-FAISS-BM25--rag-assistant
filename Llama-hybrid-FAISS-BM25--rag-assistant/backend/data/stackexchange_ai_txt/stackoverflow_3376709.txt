This is just how WebKit inspector denotes a TextNode You are seeing more than one textnode surround anchor tags. If you dump childNodes for that div, it looks like this: 0: Text 1: HTMLParagraphElement 2: HTMLDivElement 3: Text 4: Text 5: HTMLAnchorElement 6: Text 7: HTMLAnchorElement 8: Text 9: HTMLParagraphElement 10: Text 11: HTMLParagraphElement 12: Text 13: HTMLParagraphElement 14: Text In side the element inspector, those nodes marked as Text will be surrounded with quotes. This is just a feature of the element inspector. Any idea what those are and how I'd strip them out of the DOM to have clean, continuous text? Some browsers support innerText For example, run this on that site: document.querySelector('.asset-body').innerText
