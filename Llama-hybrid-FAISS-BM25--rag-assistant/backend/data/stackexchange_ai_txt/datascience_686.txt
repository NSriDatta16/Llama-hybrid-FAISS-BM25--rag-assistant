State of the art appears to be "paragraph vectors" introduced in a recent paper . Cosine/Euclidean distance between paragraph vectors would likely work better than any other approach. This probably isn't feasible yet due to lack of open source implementations. Next best thing is cosine distance between LSA vectors or cosine distance between raw BOW vectors. Sometimes it works better to choose different weighting schemes, like TF-IDF.
