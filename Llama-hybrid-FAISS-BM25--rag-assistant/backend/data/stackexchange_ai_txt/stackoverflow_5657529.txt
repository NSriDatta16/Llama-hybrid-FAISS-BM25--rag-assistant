It would be wise to track the progress in both a server side database and in the client's local storage if a constant internet connection is not necessary. Evercookie is a controversial javascript api that aims to provide local storage using any means available including standard cookies, Flash shared object, Silverlight, browser history and HTML 5 storage. Data should persist when the user is offline and when the connection is restored, sync the cookie and database with whichever data has greater page number for the given book. Droid has Flash and the Flash shared object data is a "cookie" available to both desktop and web-based apps. With great power comes great responsibility: http://samy.pl/evercookie/
