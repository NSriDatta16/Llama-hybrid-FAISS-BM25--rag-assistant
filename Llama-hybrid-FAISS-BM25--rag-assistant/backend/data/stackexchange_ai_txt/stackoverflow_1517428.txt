Coming from a Visual Studio background, what do you recommend I use to start my VERY FIRST Python project?

I'm locked in using C# and I don't like it one bit. I have to start branching out to better myself as a professional and as a person, so I've decided to start making things in my own time using Python. The problem is, I've basically programmed only in C#. What IDE should I use to make programs using Python? My goal is to make a sort of encyclopedic program for a game I'm playing right now, displaying hero information, names, stats, picture, etc. All of this information I'm going to parse from an XML file. My plan is for this application to be able to run under Windows, Linux and Mac (I'm under the impression that any code written in Python works 100% cross-platform, right?) Thanks a lot for your tremendous help brothers of SO. :P Edit: I guess I should clarify that I'm looking for an IDE that supports drag and drop GUI design. I'm used to using VS and I'm not really sure how you can do it any other way.
