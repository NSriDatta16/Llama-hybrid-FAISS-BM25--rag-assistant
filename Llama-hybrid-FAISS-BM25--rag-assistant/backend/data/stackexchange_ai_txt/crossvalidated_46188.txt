All of the parameters required by caret models are "hyper parameters" that control the type of model fitted to the data. It's a good idea to choose these parameters using cross-validation , which is what caret does. In the case of the support vector machine, you don't really need to understand what these parameters represent, because you probably shouldn't choose them by hand. Just try a reasonable range of values and select the best ones based on cross-validated error. (hint: this is exactly what caret does by default!) If you're dealing with time series data, note that caret isn't really setup to handle this situation by default, and you may need to construct your own mechanism for cross-validating time series data .
