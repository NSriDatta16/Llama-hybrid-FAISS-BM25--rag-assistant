Are POD types always aligned?

For example, if I declare a long variable, can I assume it will always be aligned on a "sizeof(long)" boundary? Microsoft Visual C++ online help says so, but is it standard behavior? some more info: a. It is possible to explicitely create a misaligned integer (*bar): char foo[5] int * bar = (int *)(&foo[1]); b. Apparently, #pragma pack() only affects structures, classes, and unions. c. MSVC documentation states that POD types are aligned to their respective sizes (but is it always or by default, and is it standard behavior, I don't know)
