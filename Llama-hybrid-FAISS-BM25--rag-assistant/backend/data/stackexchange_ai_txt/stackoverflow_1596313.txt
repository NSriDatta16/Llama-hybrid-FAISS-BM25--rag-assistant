Good luck. What you want to do is pretty much impossible on a desktop PC. Best you could probably do would be to measure the from-the-wall power draw at idle, and when running your program, with as few other programs as possible running at the same time. Average the results over 100 or so runs, and you should have a value with accuracy of a few percent (standard statistical disclaimers apply). On a Microchip device, it should be easier to calculate the power consumption, since they publish (average) power consumption values for the various modes, and the timing is deterministic. Unfortunately, there are so many differences between a processor like that and your desktop processor (word size, pipelining, multiple-issue, multiple processes, etc, etc) that there really won't be any effective way to compare the two.
