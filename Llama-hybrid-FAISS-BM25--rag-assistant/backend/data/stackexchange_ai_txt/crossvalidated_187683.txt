R randomForest has classification error of zero for different counts of a given class

This may be an obvious/basic random forest question, but here goes.. Given the Iris dataset we tried two different number of trees. Here are the results for 50. Notice in particular that the setosa was ostensibly classified correctly with 36 observations: i.e. zeros on its non diagonals of the confusion matrix: fit Now let us try an unreasonably small number of trees - five. Notice that the setosa was chosen as the class 32 times (vs 36) - yet the classification error for it is still zero? fit I am missing something basic here: how can the the number of chosen instances for a particular class vary yet the classification error remain unaffected?
