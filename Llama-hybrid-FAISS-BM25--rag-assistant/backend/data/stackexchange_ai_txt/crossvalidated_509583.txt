Simple answer: $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0 $$ because y is not a function of X on your structural equation. If you go through the reduced form (and I ll take some liberties of notation here, assuming you are using Control function approach:) $$ y = \alpha + \beta *z + \theta \lambda + u_1 $$ where $ \lambda $ is the generalized residual from your order probit (something similar to the Inverse mills ratio). Your marginal effects is also zero: $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0 $$ Because you need to assume $ \lambda $ is assumed constant. Wooldridge (2010) does a similar analogy for the IVprobit model (see section 15.7.2 pg 588). If you are trying to implement this in Stata by hand, (creating your predict program or using expression or similar), Stata may be trying to estimate marginal effects as follows: $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0 +\theta \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial x} $$ But this will be incorrect. In fact, again for IV probit, that is what -margins- would do for Stata 14, Stata15, and Stata 16 until an update that happened last year. Hope this helps.
