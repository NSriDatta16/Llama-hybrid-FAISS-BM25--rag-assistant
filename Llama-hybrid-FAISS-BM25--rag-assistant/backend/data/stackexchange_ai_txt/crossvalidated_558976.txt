There is no single best way of constructing a confidence interval. In the below graph you see some different possibilities of a 95% confidence interval for a z-test . In this graph the confidence interval is expressed as the boundaries in term of the amount of $\pm \sigma$ deviation from the observed $X$ and taken as a constant independent of $X$ (you could make confidence intervals with different shapes/sizes depending on $X$ ). For instance for the percentage on the left tail, $q_1 = 0.025$ , you get the middle interval which is $[\bar{x} -1.96\sigma, \bar{x}+1.96 \sigma]$ . The symmetric confidence intervals (in the middle on the graph, wich is based on a two-tailed hypothesis test), divides the attention equally to both sides. It is advantageous because it doesn't favor any side but also because it is a smaller confidence interval compared to the other choices. On the extreme of the graph, we see confidence intervals based on one-tailed hypothesis tests. These confidence intervals are larger for the z-test, but the boundary on one side is closer to the mean. So there are advantages and disadvantages and which is chosen depends on the application. (For more about those disadvantages and advantages, see also Why does $\mu > 0$ (or even $\mu > \epsilon$) "seem easier” to substantiate than $\mu \neq 0$? ).
