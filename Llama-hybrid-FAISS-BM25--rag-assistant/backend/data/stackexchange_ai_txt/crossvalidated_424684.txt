What you want is a model that relates the expected distance $E[D]$ to the count $C$ . If you thought the three samples functioned differently, you could estimate three separate regression models of the form $E[D|C,S=s']=\beta_{s'0}+\beta_{s'1}C$ , where $S$ is the sample variable and $s'$ is one of the samples (i.e., a , f , m ). This would give you three different estimates of the relationship between count and distance. You could also also run a single regression model for the whole sample using subsample indicators. Let $g_{s'}$ be a dummy variable that is equal to $1$ if the observation is in sample $s'$ and $0$ otherwise. Now you can specify the following regression model: $$E[D|C,S]=g_{a}(\beta_{a0}+\beta_{a1}C)+g_{f}(\beta_{f0}+\beta_{f1}C)+g_{m}(\beta_{m0}+\beta_{m1}C) \\ =\beta_{a0}g_{a}+\beta_{a1}g_{a}C+\beta_{f0}g_{f}+\beta_{f1}g_{f}C+\beta_{m0}g_{m}+\beta_{m1}g_{m}C$$ To get a single number that represents the marginal effect of count on distance, you could take the average of the group-specific $\beta_{.1}$ s (i.e., $\frac{\beta_{a1}+\beta_{f1}+\beta_{m1}}{3}$ ). If you though the group-specific slopes were all the same, you could estimate a simpler model ignoring group membership as follows: $$E[D|C,S]=\beta_{a0}g_{a}+\beta_{f0}g_{f}+\beta_{m0}g_{m}+\beta_{1}C$$ Your approach involves estimating the following model: $$E[D|C,S]=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(g_{a}(C-\bar{C}_a)+g_{f}(C-\bar{C}_f)+g_{m}(C-\bar{C}_m)) \\=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}((g_{a}+g_{f}+g_{m})C-(g_{a}\bar{C}_a+g_{f}\bar{C}_f+g_{m}\bar{C}_m)) \\= \beta_{0}-\beta_{1}(g_{a}\bar{C}_a+g_{f}\bar{C}_f+g_{m}\bar{C}_m)+\beta_{1}(g_{a}+g_{f}+g_{m})C \\= \tilde{\beta}_{a0}g_{a}+\tilde{\beta}_{f0}g_{f}+\tilde{\beta}_{m0}g_{m}+\beta_{1}C$$ So, you're still estimating the same effect, $\beta_{1}$ , which will have the same value regardless. The only difference will be in the interpretation of the group intecepts $\tilde{\beta}_{.0}$ , which now is a bit more challenging to interpret after group mean centering. So, centering buys you nothing, but it doesn't make things much worse. Just fit the model you want to fit without manipulating the data. I recommend the first approach because it's fairly simple and doesn't require any constraining assumptions. If you're willing to make the assumption that the slope is the same, then just fit the second model.
