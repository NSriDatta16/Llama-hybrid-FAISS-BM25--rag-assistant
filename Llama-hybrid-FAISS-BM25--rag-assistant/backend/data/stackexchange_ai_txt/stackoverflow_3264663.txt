PHP Hourly Calendar, Running through timestamps stored in database

I have a MySQL table titled 'my_cal' with a column titled 'start_time' for particular events in the calendar. The way items are added to the database, there are no overlapping events. There also may not be an event for a particular day/time either, in this case we leave it blank or put a blank value. My problem lies in the fact that running 00:01AM to 23:59PM for each day sequentially would be easy, but I want to get the data as: Mon 00:00, Tues 00:00, Wed 00:00, etc, etc Mon 01:00, Tues 01:00, Wed 01:00, etc, etc Mon 02:00, Tues 02:00, Wed 02:00, etc, etc This is to build a table with 25 Rows (24 hours of the day + 1 for title), and 8 columns (7 days of the week + 1 hourly title) Here is an example of how the calendar should look as far as HTML Table structure goes: http://www.wmnf.org/programs/grid I have made an attempt at getting this to work, Running through the MySQL results, and saving them as $data[$hour_of_the_day][$day_of_the_week] I would then have recursive while() loops for each hour, and then each day, $hour=0; while($hour > 24) { $day=0; while($day > 8) { if(isset($data[$hour][$day])) { echo "event"; } $day++; } hour++; } I believe this may get me by, but it does not seem very elegant. I also wanted the time the calendar started to be 6:00AM, and not 12:00AM. I wanted the first day listed to be today - 3 (to center the calendar on today) I.e: $calendar_begin_day = date("j", mktime()) - 3; I am looking for any way to make this easier, as I want it to run as efficient as possible due to large hit count. Thanks
