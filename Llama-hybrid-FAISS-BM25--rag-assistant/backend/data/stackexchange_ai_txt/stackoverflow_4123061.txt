The following thread summarizes almost everything. First, it explains that m2eclipse doesn't and won't support anything from the Maven Eclipse Plugin anymore because: Sonatype doesn't maintain it. It causes them too much troubles. Second, it states that the m2eclipse way to handle additional project natures and builders is to write project configurators : (...) we encourage writing configurators to add the natures and builders you want based on what it available in the POM. See this link for a guide and this project for some existing configurators for checkstyle, findbugs, pmd.
