Wow! A lot of good questions for video. Unfortunately I didn't have to deal with Flash Video to much, but here is what I've used to get the job done ( decently encoding FLV for progressive download) : Best Practices for Encoding Video with the VP6 Codec , the table at the bottom of the article for High and Low Motion are really handy. Optimal Frame Dimensions for Flash Video and Robert Reinhardt's New Flash Video (FLV) Bitrate Calculator with the MAC and WIN projects on that page and the updated ( AVC/H.264 ) AIR version of the app here . Have a look on Robert Reinhardt's blog/books/etc. I hope these resources are a good start.
