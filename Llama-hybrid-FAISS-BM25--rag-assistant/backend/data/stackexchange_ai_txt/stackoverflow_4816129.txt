Ant XSLT task vs. Java task

I've inherited a project which contains an ant build file. We are in the process of upgrading libraries, and when we did our ancient XSLT translator began flaking out. I've attempted to replace the calls with ant's XSLT task, however it throws some errors in our translators (xalan at the command line throws no such error). Is there a way to use the fileset in combination with a java task? It would sure beat having to repeat the majority of the call umpteen times. The only thing I can really think of is passing a variable to a sub-ant task, but perhaps there is a better way?
