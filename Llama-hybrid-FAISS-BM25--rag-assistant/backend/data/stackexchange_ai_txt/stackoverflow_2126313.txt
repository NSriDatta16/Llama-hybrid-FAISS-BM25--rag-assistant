Mule ESB is flexible and very light weight. It can run stand alone (recommended deployment) or you may embed it in a java, web or Java EE application. Many users like to run Mule applications as web apps in Apache Tomcat or MuleSoft Tcat . It all depends on your environment, IT requirements and the SOA architecture you have chosen. If you are hosting your services in Mule, in addition to using it as your bus, then standalone is usually a good choice. If you are hosting you services in an application server or are deploying to a large datacenter where you already have a standard application server deployed and operation procedures in place, embedding Mule in your web app or Java EE container may be a better choice. There is more information on deployment options for Mule ESB at http://www.mulesoft.org
