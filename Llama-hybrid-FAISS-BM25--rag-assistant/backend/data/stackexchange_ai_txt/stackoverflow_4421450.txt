When you are a server, you can receive some interesting info about the client that access you. One of the parameters is telling you the "User Agent", or in simple words the browser type. In PHP it's in the array $_SERVER ( http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php ). In Dot Net, I think it's part of the HttpRequest class ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httprequest.aspx ). On real-time, you can "ask" those params what are the client type (IE, Firefox, or an independent client), and react to it like preventing download.
