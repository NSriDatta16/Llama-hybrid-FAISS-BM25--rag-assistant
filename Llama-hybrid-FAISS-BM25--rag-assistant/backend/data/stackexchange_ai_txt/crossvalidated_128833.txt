Some hints on your question 2 re environmental characteristics. A. Care is needed in interpreting estimated coefficients as small, since their size will depend on the units in which both the independent and the dependent variables are measured. It may be helpful to consider what the percentage effect on the dependent variable is of a 1% change in an independent variable. B. Characteristics such as air pollution may be subject to threshold effects, that is, they only become important when they exceed a certain level. To allow for this, you might consider using as an independent variable not the absolute level but the excess over a threshold level (and zero if below that level). They may also vary over time, with occasional peak levels being much more important than average levels. A suitable variable then might be 'number of days in a year on which a threshold level was exceeded'. Having said that, you do as Analyst has said need sufficient variation in the characteristics and prices to obtain meaningful results.
