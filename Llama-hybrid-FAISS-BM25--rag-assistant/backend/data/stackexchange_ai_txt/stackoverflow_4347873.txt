Changing font smoothing for my application alone and not the global windows font smoothing settings

I have a Windows application written in C++, and using Win32-API. I want to change the font smoothing of my application programmatically, thus allowing the user of my application to choose between "none", "standard", and "cleartype". I use SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETFONTSMOOTHING, ... ) to change the smoothing type, however this changes the global system settings of Windows, and effects all other applications. Is there any way to change the smoothing for my application alone? Edit: Clarification - I'm embedding another window within my window, and thus I have no control over the fonts within the embedded window. Thank You
