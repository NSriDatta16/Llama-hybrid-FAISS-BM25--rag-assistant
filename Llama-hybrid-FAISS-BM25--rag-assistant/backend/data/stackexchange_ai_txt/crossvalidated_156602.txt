How to compute total risk of a person?

For a given disease there are some risk factors. I have compute total risk of a person, given presence or absence of individual risk factors. Also risk ratios for different risk factors are available from literature. Following table shows different risk factors, their associated risk ratios and whether they are present or absent (0 or 1) in a this given person: Risk_factor Risk_ratio Risk_factor_present AA 2.3 1 BB 1.5 0 CC 3.1 1 DD 2.7 0 EE 1.6 1 What would be the risk of this person as compared to one without any risk factors? How can I compute this value and its confidence interval? Will simple average be sufficient (taking value of 1 if risk factor is absent)? Do I need any further information? Thanks for your insight.
