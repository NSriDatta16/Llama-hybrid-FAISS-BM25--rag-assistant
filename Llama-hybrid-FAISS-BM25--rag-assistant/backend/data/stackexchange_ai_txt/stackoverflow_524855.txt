The Matisse GUI builder has pretty good support for the "JTabbedPane" control, if that's what you're looking for. You can drag the TabbedPane container into your forms, then drag other containers onto it to create new tabs. If you're looking for more advanced behavior, such as hiding/showing different containers when the user presses different buttons, you will need to write some code; the GUI builder isn't equipped to handle this.
