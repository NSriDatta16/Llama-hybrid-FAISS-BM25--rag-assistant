Why Adjusted R^2 falls if I include both individual and time fixed effects?

I have a (probably simple) question on fixed effects estimation. I am trying to do baseline growth regressions of log GDP per capita against a number of covariates and, in line with the literature, I include both country and time dummies. The panel is unbalanced with 19 countries, 10-53 periods, resulting in 763 useful observations. In R this is can be done with plm(lgdp ~ lpop + lxr + lman + lman2 + lSB + lSI, data = df, model = "within", effect = "twoways") or lm(lgdp ~ lpop + lxr +lman + lman2 +lSB +lSI + factor(ISO) + factor(year) - 1, data = df) Function plm balance the R^2 for the inclusion of dummies, while lm clearly does not and result overfitted. The problem is that I obtain (Adjusted R^2, AIC, BIC respectively): 0.32, 1839.5, 1876.6 for the pooled ols 0.67, 473.1, 593.7 with country fixed effects 0.35, 1524, 1802.2 with time fixed effects 0.065 , 142.6, 504.3 with both country and time fixed effects. the R^2 is obtained from plm , while the AIC and BIC are computed on the lm . The specification with two effects is clearly the best, but why does the adjusted R^2 fall so steeply? I thought this could be due to multicollinearity, but a VIF analysis does not show particular problems concerning the country and time factors. Could it be due to the fact that 763/(6+19+54) = 9.8 observations per parameter on average?
