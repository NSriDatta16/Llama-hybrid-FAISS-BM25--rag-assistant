For univariate kernel density estimation, the bandwidth can be estimated by Normal reference rule or Cross Validation method or plug-in approach. For multivariate kernel density estimation, a Bayesian bandwidth selection method may be utilized, see Zhang, X., M.L. King and R.J. Hyndman (2006), A Bayesian approach to bandwidth selection for multivariate kernel density estimation, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 50, 3009-3031
