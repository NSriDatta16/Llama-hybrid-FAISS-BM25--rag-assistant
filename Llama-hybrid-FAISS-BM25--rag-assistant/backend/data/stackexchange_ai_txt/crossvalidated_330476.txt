Technique to find spurious correlations among huge number of time series datasets?

I came across this tongue-in-cheek website that lists lots of spurious correlations. It's not lost on me that the author's main point is to discourage the brute-force-search of correlations, but his website has encouraged me to do the same (but with plausible examples) at my employer. My job is to discover new insights (but not cause-effect relationships per se) in our hundreds of thousands of financial time series data sets, and I'm hoping this approach will make me a more efficient employee. Is there a name associated with this brute force approach? I would like to research it further. Aside from the obvious requirement of thorough follow-up / vetting any of potential discoveries, what other practical or implementation considerations should I be aware of? Are there any open source (e.g., Python or R) libraries that make this brute force search easier?
