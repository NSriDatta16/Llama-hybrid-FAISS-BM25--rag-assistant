I figured it out myself and want to share it so maybe it helps others with the same question. It's a little odd answering own question but as I read this is quite acceppted or even encouraged . Anyway, I found this great vignette by Terry Therneau, where he describes how to set a new reference after running a cox regression. I compared the results to the results of the idea I posted in the question and they are the same! So at this point I would say yes, one can recalculate the hazard ratio as suggested in the question. # load library require(survival) # fit model mfit $y + outer(ageterm$ se, c(0, -1.96, 1.96), '*') hr_therneau
