Is there an upper limit on the number of divs in a document before performance is degraded?

I'm working on a site that will be showing a lot of information via divs. Its basically a chart out of divs. The way its setup is I've got an outer div with a set size that you can scroll the contents around (click and drag like google maps). From here I can 2 ways of going, have 1 large inner div that is moved around with all the chart divs within it. This would be by far the easiest approach. The other option I see is a tiled approach where I break the large inner div up into smaller divs and dynamically add/remove them as needed. The chart itself is potentially 1999425014 pixels square. Each point is made up of 6 divs and there are 100,000+ points. What would be the best way to move forward?
