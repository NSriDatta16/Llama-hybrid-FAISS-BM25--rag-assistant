Why do exponentiated values differ when the un-exponentiated regression coefficients of opposite sign are the same absolute value?

I need to reverse the direction of effects for a series of binary logistic regressions. In theory, I should be able to change the sign, because the magnitude of the effect shouldn't be any different whether it is positive or negative. To test that, I reverse coded my outcome variable and re-ran a series of regressions. Sure enough, the absolute values were identical, but opposite in sign. However, when I exponentiate the coefficients, the percent change in outcome for a 1 unit increase in predictor is quite different in size. Why do the exponentiated coefficients differ in magnitude when the un-exponentiated coefficients are identical in absolute value? A specific example: original outcome beta : -0.646, exponentiated to 0.524, thus 47.59% decrease in Y per 1 unit increase in X (1 - exponentiated coefficient, expressed as %); reverse coded outcome beta : 0.646, exponentiated to 1.908, thus 90.79% increase in Y per 1 unit increase in X (exponentiated coefficient - 1, expressed as %) Why does the negative effect show a ~47% decrease, but the positive shows a ~90% increase?
