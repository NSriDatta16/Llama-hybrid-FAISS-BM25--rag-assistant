I would recommend start giving parts of real assignments you have and make everything to be able to use his code. In other words train him as replacement for yourself. This way you will commit yourself to allocating time to work with junior and he will be able to see "real life". By working on real assignments and hearing lively feedback he will be able to get p to speed rather quickly. Drawback of this approach is that it is possible that it will have too narrow focus on you particular project. So be sure to show the trainee possible alternatives and encourage trade-offs analysis to widen his professional horizon.
