Why are the cluster analysis results using raw data the same as the ones using PCA scores?

I have read around a lot and tried different ways to carry out my cluster analysis. In the first case, I have carried out a hierarchical cluster analysis on my raw data (200 watersheds and 16 variables) in matlab and mapped the clusters. My second attempt incorporated carrying out a Principal Components Analysis on the raw data and then using the scores as inputs to my hierarchical clustering. The clusters produced in both cases are the exact same, which I did not expect. Can anyone explain to me why they are the same?
