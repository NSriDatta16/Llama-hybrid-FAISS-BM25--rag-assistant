A time series of spectra suggests to me a kinetics experiment , and there is a well-established amount of chemometric literature about this. What do you know about the spectra? What type of spectra are they? Can you reasonably expect that you have only two species, educt and product? Can you reasonably assume bilinearity, i.e. the measured spectra $\mathbf X$ at a given time are a linear combination of the component concentrations $\mathbf C$ times the pure component spectra $\mathbf S$: $\mathbf X^{(nspc \times nwl)} = \mathbf C^{(nspc \times ncomp)} \mathbf S^{(ncomp \times nwl)}$ You say that you want to estimate an exponential decay (in the concentrations). This together with bilinearity suggests to me multivariate curve resolution (MCR). This is a technique that allows you to use information you have (e.g. pure component spectra of some substances, or assumptions on the concentration behaviour like the exponential decay) during model fitting. A good starting point in the literature is: Anna de Juan, Marcel Maeder, Manuel Martínez Romà Tauler: Combining hard- and soft-modelling to solve kinetic problems, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 54, 2000. 123–141. A good starting point in the internet is http://www.mcrals.info/ The UseR! Chemometrics book discusses it at the very end Implementation in R: package ALS As far as I know, it is quite common to smooth the concentrations according to some, e.g. kinetic, model but it is far less common to smooth the spectra. However, the algorithm allows to do so. I asked Anna in summer whether they impose smoothness constraints, but she told me they don't (and good spectroscopists hate smoothing instead of measuring good spectra ;-) ). Often, it is not needed, neither, because aggregating the information from all the spectra will already yield good estimates of the pure component spectra. I did smooth "component spectra" (in fact, principal components) twice lately ( Dochow et al. : Raman-on-chip device and detection fibres with fibre Bragg grating for analysis of solutions and particles, LabChip, 2013 and Dochow el al. : Quartz microfluidic chip for tumour cell identification by Raman spectroscopy in combination with optical traps, AnalBioanalChem, accepted) but in these cases my spectroscopic knowledge told me that I'm allowed to do this. I quite regularly apply a downsampling and smoothing interpolation to my Raman spectra ( hyperSpec::spc.loess ). How to know what is too much smoothing? I think the only possible answer is "expert knowledge about the type of spectroscopy and experiment". edit: I reread the question, and you say you want to estimate the decay at each wavelength. However, is that true or do you want to estimate the decay of different species with overlapping spectra?
