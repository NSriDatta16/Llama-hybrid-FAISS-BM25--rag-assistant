You should probably look at WWW::Mechanize , which is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent that is oriented towards that sort of website automation. In particular, see the agent_alias method . Some websites do block connections based on the User-Agent, but you can set that to whatever you want using Perl. It's possible that a website might also look for other request headers normally generated by a particular browser (like the Accept header) and refuse connections that don't include them, but you can add those headers too, if you figure out what it's looking for. In general, it's impossible for a website to prevent a different client from impersonating a supported browser. No matter what it's looking for, you can eventually duplicate it. It's also possible that it's looking for JavaScript support. In that case, you might look at WWW::Scripter , which is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that adds JavaScript support. It's fairly new and I haven't tried it yet.
