pca on polar coordinates?

I have a dataset composed of 123 rows (time bins) and 20 columns (variables) The question I have is the following. each row,column pair has a radian value and a radius value. If I convert these pairs to a complex number I have effectively take a 123x20x2 real dataset and converted it to a 123x20 dataset composed of complex numbers. Can I then feed this complex dataset into a pca? If so my loadings are now complex and when I try to determine the R^2 of each variable for the component the sum of all R^2 should add to 1 but no longer does due to the imaginary number part. Is this allowed? if so why do the loadings of a component not add to 1 ( sum(loadings(:,1).^2) ~= 1 but should equal 1)
