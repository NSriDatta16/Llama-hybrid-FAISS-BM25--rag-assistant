From the Article: The simplest form of personalization is to record information about the user, and then to make that information available whenever the user logs on. This requires a kind of persistence that goes beyond session state; to create true personalization, you'll want to create a database that associates the saved information with a particular user, and that persists indefinitely. http://ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2004/10/25/libertyonwhidbey.html
