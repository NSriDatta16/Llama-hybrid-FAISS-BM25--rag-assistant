Is your NewView class set up to receive touch events in the first place? ("User Interaction Enabled" checkbox set in Interface Builder, or, userInteractionEnabled BOOL property set to YES in UIView )? Is a UIView below NewView in your view hierarchy (i.e. a child of NewView ) consuming touch events in a touchesBegan:withEvent: method?
