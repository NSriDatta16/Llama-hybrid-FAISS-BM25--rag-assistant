The way we ended up going about this was to add storage of a clients timezone as part of their user configuration. That way we know exactly where they are and you can use the built in conversion features of Framework 3.5 to perform all conversions between Local and UTC (this takes into account daylight savings) See here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb382770.aspx I am assuming that you have authenticated users, but then if you are storing user selected dates in your database it's a fair bet.
