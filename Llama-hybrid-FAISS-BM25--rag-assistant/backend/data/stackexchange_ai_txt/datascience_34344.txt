Bias simply takes care of variables which are unaccounted for i.e you did not include it in X . All Machine Learning and Neural Nets do is approximate a function. All functions can be represented as a series of exponentials using Fourier Transform which basically means a function can be expressed as a sum of many other special functions. In this series there is a constant term to adjust the elevation of the curve above the x-axis. This constant can be thought of as the bias. Thus it basically takes care of the fact that when all variables are 0, a function need not be 0.
