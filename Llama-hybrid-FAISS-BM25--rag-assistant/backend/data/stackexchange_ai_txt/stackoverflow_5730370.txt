Wireshark (libpcap) only knows the Ips, transport protocol (UDP/TCP) and the ports. With this info it try to decode the frames with a candidate protocol "decoder". Usually it make mistakes. If you want more accurately protocol identification you have to use a deep packet inspection analyzer. more info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection
