How can t-SNE or UMAP embed new (test) data, given that they are nonparametric?

I have started using the UMAP method for dimension reduction which is a similar method to t-SNE, Diffusion Maps, Laplacian Eigenmaps, etc. The named dimension reduction methods have in common that they are non-parametric, i.e. there is no easy straightforward way to embed new data. In the UMAP package for python and R, however, such an embedding for new data is possible . During my research I could not find any source describing how these predictions are generated. I have read through the UMAP paper . Does anyone know how UMAP predictions are generated in the package from a mathematical point of view?
