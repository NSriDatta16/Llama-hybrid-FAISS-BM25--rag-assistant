OK, so let's assume the following (forgive me for re-clarifying the question): You have a number of rows of some form, with delete links, and you want to confirm that the user actually wants to delete it? Let's assume the following HTML: Some Item 1 Delete Some Item 2 Delete Some Item 3 Delete So I'm assuming the same PHP script can run the delete, picking up on the mode parameter: I'm going to give two solutions to this on the JavaScript side - the first with an inline, slightly ugly solution, the second using jQuery ( http://jquery.com/ ), and unobtrusive JavaScript. Ok, so for the first, I would bind on the onclick event of each link. Some Item 3 Delete Then create a JavaScript function: //This will get called when the link is clicked. function checkDeleteItem() { //show the confirmation box return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this?'); } As I said, I don't like that solution, because it is horribly obtrusive, and also not particularly robust. Now, the jQuery solution: //Do all this when the DOM is loaded $(function() { //get all delete links (Note the class I gave them in the HTML) $("a.delete-link").click(function() { //Basically, if confirm is true (OK button is pressed), then //the click event is permitted to continue, and the link will //be followed - however, if the cancel is pressed, the click event will be stopped here. return confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this?"); }); }); I heartily recommend this solution over the previous one, since it is much more elegant and nice, and is generally best practice.
