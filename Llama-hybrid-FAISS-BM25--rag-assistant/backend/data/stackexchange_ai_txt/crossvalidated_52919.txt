##problem x If I understand correctly what you're looking for, maybe this helps. You're trying to figure out the distance between to random points, who's X values are generated from unif(0,30) and Y values are generated from a unif (0,40). I just created a million RV's from each of those to distributions and then bound the x and the y to create a point for each of them. Then I calculated the distance between point 2 and 1 all the way to the distance between points 1,000,000 and 999,999. The average distance was 18.35855. Let me know if this isn't what you were looking for.
