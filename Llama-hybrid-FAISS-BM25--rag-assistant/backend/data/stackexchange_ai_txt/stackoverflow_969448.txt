Generalized Suffix Tree Java Implementation

I am looking for a Java implementation of the Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) with the following features: After the creation of the GST from say 1000 strings I would like find out how many of these 1000 strings contains some other string 's'. The search must be quiet fast, as I need to apply the search on about 100'000 candidate strings of average length 10.
