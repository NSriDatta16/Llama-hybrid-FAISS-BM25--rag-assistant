How to apply distance metrics to compare bar plot (nominal histogram) data

I have a data set for libraries, I would like to find the (Similarity / dissimilarity) among it based on book category, so for each category there is single value represent the number of books that belong to that category, total frequency refer to total books found in that library. I have normalized data due to each library containing different numbers of books, as attached. My question: in order to apply these metrics for my data, how to calculate each of them to find distance (similarity) between lib1 and lib2 as an example. Some of these used metrics used for image retrieval and it is not suitable for nominal data. •kullback-leibler-divergence •histogram intersection distance •Jensen-Shannon divergence •chi-squared distance library-name Total-no(books) Art business medicine music lib1 66 6 6 31 11 lib2 86 9 0 12 11 lib3 120 14 0 0 12 ... lib1000 133 15 33 2 5
