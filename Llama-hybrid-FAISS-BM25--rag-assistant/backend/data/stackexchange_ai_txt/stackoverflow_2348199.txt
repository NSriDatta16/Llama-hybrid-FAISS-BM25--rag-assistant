In your question you mentioned that you're using MooTools for "Ajax, drag and drop, and some minor effects". While Mootools can do that well, (and I may get blasted for saying this) in my opinion you're not really using Mootools for the right reason. We use Mootools in our applications, and really we cannot think about substituting JQuery for it. If the aim is to write object oriented, long term maintainable code that other applications in your organization can leverage, Mootools wins hands down. And just selector speed is a wrong criteria to judge by (though I believe Mootools is up there now). Most places in our code we already have references to the elements we want to change. The most time is spent in actually manipulating the DOM once you have the element, and in our internal tests (will try to publish them) Mootools is much faster than JQuery in the usual kind of operations we perform. Our applications are the kind where we rely on previously built Mootools controls (built by us or others) to create application screens using data coming in from Web Services.
