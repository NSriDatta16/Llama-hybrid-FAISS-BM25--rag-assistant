Ordinal Logistic Regression - Strange Results

I've been having struggling with the analysis of ordinal categorical data that I have (against 3 binary categorical explanatory variables). The problem is that for one of my data sets,running ordinal logistic regression in SPSS gives an unusual result, which raises questions about the validity of this statistical testing approach to my data: Full SPSS syntax and output can be accessed here The question arises: why is no statistical result given for the non-redundant level of the age variable, StErr = 0, confidence interval does not exist, logit Estimate so high…? Exponentiation of logit gives some ridiculously high odds ratio… It’s like a perfect result with 100% certainty? Is this statistical test and outcome valid? Can someone explain what is happening in layman's terms? Should I be using a different statistical test than ordinal logistic regression? And please suggest how I should analyse and report it for a scientific publication. The raw data can be viewed for further insight: I have also made available the SPSS data file in case you wanted to run the test for yourself: Access here: SPSS .sav file I have also attached a visualisation of the data in the form of stacked columns, to help you to quickly familiarise yourself with the character of my data.
