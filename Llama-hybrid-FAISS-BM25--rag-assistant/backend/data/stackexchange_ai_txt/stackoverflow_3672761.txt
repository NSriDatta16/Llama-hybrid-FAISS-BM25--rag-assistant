R Time series - having trouble making bollinger lines - need simple example please

Learning R language - I know how to do a moving average but I need to do more - but I am not a statistician - unfortunately all the docs seem to be written for statisticians. I do this in excel a lot, it's really handy for analysis of operational activities. Here are the fields on each row to make bollinger bands : Value could be # of calls, complaint ratio, anything TimeStamp | Value | Moving Average | Moving STDEVP | Lower Control | Upper Control Briefly, the moving avg and the stdevP point to the prior 8 or so values in the series. Lower control at a given point in time is = moving average - 2*moving stdevP and upper control = moving average + 2*moving stdevP This can easily be done in excel for a single file, but if I can find a way to make R work R will be better for my needs. Hopefully faster and more reliable when automated, too. links or tips would be appreciated.
