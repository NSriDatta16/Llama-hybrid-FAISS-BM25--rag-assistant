Can you describe what you're doing a bit more? From the sounds of things it's a CAD tool. In this case, I may do something a bit different but also common. I would firstly suggest make everything as context-sensitive as possible, and then, do this: Place very very common and general functions at the top Create a entirely new window for managing the rest of the buttons The new window will sit off on the second monitor of the user. It can be large and extravagent, and contain searching and large icons for getting around inside it. Specifically, however, I may also add an ability for it to be navigated very fast, using the numpad. You may detect, in the main window, when the numpad has focus and is being used, and take that as input to searching for specific commands in the offset window. Perhaps you can group them all so 100 functions exist per group, and for functions of type X, you start with a "9". I don't know your user base, and this would be only appropriate if people start to become experts in the software, but I think it's not a bad model in-general (a window off to the side to manage all these actions).
