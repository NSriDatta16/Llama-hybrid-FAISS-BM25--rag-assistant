A related problem is finding the average depth of such a tree. Note that if you clip all the leaf nodes in your tree (of which there are n = E(X) = 1/(1-2p) on average), you will get an ordinary binary tree of size n/2 (with 0 1 or 2 children for each node instead of 0 or 2.) The number of such trees is the Catalan number C((n-1)/2), and the expected depth of the tree grows as ~sqrt(n/2) = O(sqrt(1-2p)). (Trees of other depth have exponentially decaying probability, so it is safe to expect tree size roughly equal to the expected tree size.)
