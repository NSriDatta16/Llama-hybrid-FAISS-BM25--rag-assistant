How to capitalize first letter of first word in a sentence?

I am trying to write a function to clean up user input. I am not trying to make it perfect. I would rather have a few names and acronyms in lowercase than a full paragraph in uppercase. I think the function should use regular expressions but I'm pretty bad with those and I need some help. If the following expressions are followed by a letter, I want to make that letter uppercase. "." ". " (followed by a space) "!" "! " (followed by a space) "?" "? " (followed by a space) Even better, the function could add a space after ".", "!" and "?" if those are followed by a letter. How this can be achieved?
