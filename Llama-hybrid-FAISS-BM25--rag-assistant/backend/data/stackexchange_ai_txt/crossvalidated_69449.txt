Anomaly detection with one-class SVM

As I understood from my experimentation on some multivariate data-sets, anomaly detection (AD) heavily depends on the underlying distribution of data. Like, for ex., you can devise a method to detect anomalies supposing a Gaussian distribution for your data, and then end up with a failure if it is actually a power-law... Then a visual investigation followed by a "fit a model" approach seems to be the best way for AD. And I started to think that ML algorithms like one-class SVM is useless in most situations for AD. So here is my silly and novice question: "Suppose you have a data-set with many variables (IDs) distributed in many ways (some gaussian, some power-law). How one can use a one-class SVM approach in this situation without taking care of distributions"? Or do I need to study SVMs in more detail?
