What's the best way to have a "repeating field" in SQL?

I'm trying to set up a table that links two records from a different table. These links themselves need to be correlated to another table. So at the moment, my table looks like this: link_id (primary key) item_id_1 (foreign key) item_id_2 (foreign key) link_type (metadata) However, the links between items are not directional (i.e. it should make no difference whether an item is the first or second listed in a link). Ideally, I'd like for the item_id field to just appear twice; as it is I'll have to be careful to always be checking for duplicates to make sure that there's never a record created linking 12 to 14 if 14 to 12 already exists. Is there an elegant database design solution to this, or should I just adopt a convention (e.g. id_1 is always the smaller id number) and police duplication within the application? Thanks in advance!
