For a Normal distribution, the expected value, a.k.a. the mean, equals the mode. In general, not only is the expected value not only not the most likely (or at highest density), but it may have no chance of occurring. For instance, consider the random variable X which equals 0 or 2, each with probability 0.5. Then EX = 1, but the expected value,1, has 0 probability of occurring, while 0 and 2 are both modes of the distribution. The quote "the expected value of x is what one expects to happen on average" is non-technical layman's language, which as evident by your confusion, only serves to confuse matters. Expected value has a very specific meaning in probability as being the mathematical average. Whereas in layman's language, an expected value or "on average" may be something expected to typically occur. These can be reconciled if "on average" is interpreted as being the mathematical average of what occurs. Expectantly yours, Joe Average
