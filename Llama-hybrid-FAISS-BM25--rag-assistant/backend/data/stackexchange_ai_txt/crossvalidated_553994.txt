How do you sample without a sampling frame?

I want to research the returns to education in my city as well as assess whether people who have studied abroad on average earn more than those who have studied within the country. The data required for this does not exist so I want to collect the data myself using questionnaires but the problem is that there isn't any sampling frame I can use to select the people I would distribute the questionnaires to. I imagine that distributing the questionnaires to the first n employed people i find will not be good for making inferences. So what can be done in situations like these where you do not have a sampling frame and there is nothing known about the population of interest?
