JavaScript/jQuery: Animate li movement within a list?

I've got some code that's basically identical to the jQuery UI Sortable example here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#default This allows users to re-order LI elements within a UL. I've now run into a situation, though, where I want to animate the LIs changing position... basically as if the user had dragged them herself. This is proving to be a lot more difficult than I'd expected, since I'm not animating a change that can be expressed in CSS, so jQuery's animate() isn't going to help. I could solve the problem by doing some math and absolutely positioning the list elements, but that seems downright ugly. Is there an elegant way to animate my list elements moving around?
