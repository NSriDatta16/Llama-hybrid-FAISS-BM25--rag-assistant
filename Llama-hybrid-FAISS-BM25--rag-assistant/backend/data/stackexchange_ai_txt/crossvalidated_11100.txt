Assuming your design is the following: sex is a between-subjects IV (with two levels) stimulus is a within-subjects IV (with 3 assumed levels) condition is a within-subjects IV (with 2 levels) all IVs are fully crossed Then this is what you can do to run the full analysis, or to just test for a main effect of sex (generating some data first): Nj Now with the data set up, you can use aov() , but you won't get the $\hat{\epsilon}$ corrections for the within-effects. > summary(aov(response ~ sex*stimulus*condition + + Error(subject/(stimulus*condition)), data=dfL)) Error: subject Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) sex 1 2.803 2.8030 0.51 0.4843 # ... snip ... You can also use the Anova() function from the car package, which gives you the $\hat{\epsilon}$ corrections. However, it requires your data to be in wide format. You have to use multivariate notation for your model formula. > sexW dfW # between-model in multivariate notation > fit # dataframe describing the columns of the data matrix > intra library(car) # for Anova() > summary(Anova(fit, idata=intra, idesign=~stimulus*condition), + multivariate=FALSE, univariate=TRUE) Univariate Type II Repeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming Sphericity SS num Df Error SS den Df F Pr(>F) (Intercept) 17934.1 1 98.930 18 3263.0403 Using the ez package and the command suggested by @Mike Lawrence gives the same result: > library(ez) # for ezANOVA() > ezANOVA(data=dfL, wid=.(subject), dv=.(response), + within=.(stimulus, condition), between=.(sex), observed=.(sex)) $ANOVA Effect DFn DFd F p p Finally, if the main effect for sex is really all you're interested in, it's equivalent to just average for each person across all the conditions created by the combinations of stimulus and condition , and then run a between-subjects ANOVA for the aggregated data. # average per subject across all repeated measures > mDf summary(aov(response ~ sex, data=mDf)) # ANOVA with just the between-effect Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) sex 1 0.4672 0.46716 0.51 0.4843 Residuals 18 16.4884 0.91602
