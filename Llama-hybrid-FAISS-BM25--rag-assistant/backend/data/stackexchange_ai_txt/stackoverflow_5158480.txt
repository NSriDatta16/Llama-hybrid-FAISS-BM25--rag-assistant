Basically, everything in Javascript is an object. If you said var a=3; a['n']=4; references to 'a' would still return 3, but a also has a member 'n' which has value 4. So when you say addn['n'] = 3 you are adding a new member to addn, and not affecting the function in any way. I strongly recommmend reading How good c habits can encourage bad javascript habits. In describing all the things you can do wrong, it's a great intro to the way objects work in Javascript.
