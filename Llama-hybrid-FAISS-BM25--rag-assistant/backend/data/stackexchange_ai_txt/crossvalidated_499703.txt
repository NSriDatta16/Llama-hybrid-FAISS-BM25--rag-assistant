What is the precise relation between the eigenvalues of a covariance *function* and the eigenvalues of a covariance *matrix*?

Assume we have a temporal Gaussian Process $\mathcal{GP}(t;\ m,k)$ (GP) with mean $m$ and covariance function (aka. kernel) $k$ on some compact time interval $[0,T]$ . Then, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ and eigenfunctions $\phi$ of k are, for a pre-defined measure $\mu$ , defined as the solution of the Fredholm integral equation, written $$ \int k(t,t^{\prime}) \phi(t)\ \mathrm{d} \mu(t) = \lambda \phi(t^{\prime}). $$ See eq. (4.36) in [1] for more details. I am interested in how the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ , $i \in \mathbb{N}$ , relate to the eigenvalues of a corresponding covariance matrix $K \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ for some fixed times $0 \leq t_1 \leq \dots \leq t_N \leq T$ , with entries $$ K_{ij} = k(t_i, t_j)$$ coming from evaluations of this same cov function $k$ . I suspect that there is a strong connections between the eigenvalues of the cov function $k$ and the cov matrix $K$ for the following reason: The wikipedia article on the Karhunen-Loeve theorem, which makes use of the eigenvalues of the cov function $k$ [2], somehow is related to the eigenvalues in PCA [3], that is to the eigenvalues of the cov matrix $K$ . Unfortunately, I do not understand the explanation in [3]. Therefore I am asking the question here on what the relation between these function and matrix eigenproblem is. As a pointer, a colleague told me to look at the equivalent kernel (Section 7.1 in [1]) which apparently describes how GP regression behaves in the limit of continuous data [4], i.e. if $N \to \infty$ . I can intuitively see how this might relate the above function eigenproblem to the matrix eigenproblem, but I could not find any explicit statement on such a relation.
