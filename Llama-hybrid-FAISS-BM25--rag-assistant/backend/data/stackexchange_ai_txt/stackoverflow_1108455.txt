Magento XML layout with custom modules

I'm trying to include a custom template into the checkout process on the shipping page. I want that template to adopt the functionality of its parent template so I can use any of the shipping variables within the template. However I can't get magento to load the template. Here is my XML (the header scripts are adding successfully). My module is called Tm_ShippingDate js_css calendar/calendar-blue.css can_load_calendar_js --> js calendar/calendar.js can_load_calendar_js --> js calendar/lang/calendar-en.js can_load_calendar_js --> js calendar/calendar-setup.js can_load_calendar_js --> --> I then have this in my checkout shipping.phtml template getBlockHtml('shippingdate') ?> Thanks
