Signs of model over-fitting

I have created a Random Forest model to predict dataset values. It works all right, but now I'm testing if results can be improved with Keras LSTM. I don't have much experience with Keras, but I've built a model and made sure to implement variable learning rate. So now when I run it I see that MAE and RMSE are both very low - considerably lower than in the most accurate version of RF model, but at the same time accuracy is extremely low. To me it feels like a sign that the model is over-fitting like crazy. Am I correct to assume this based on this limited data? Thanks.
