Can I stop my detailLabel from resizing when I set UITableviewCellAccessoryCheck?

I have several UITableViewCells which are used to choose a setting. Touching one checks it and un-checks the previously checked cell (if any). I am using the UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle cell style and have about a paragraph of text in each detailLabel . When I set the accessory to UITableviewCellAccessoryCheck my detailLabel resizes, moving the text in a visually unappealing way. I want the detailLabel text to retain its position regardless of whether it is checked or not. I thought I might be able to get the width of the checked accessory view and pre-emptively shrink the detailLabel width. Is this the correct way to do it? Must I wait until the cells are about to appear or can I do it as they are created in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath ? Do I have to set the detailLabel's resize mask differently?
