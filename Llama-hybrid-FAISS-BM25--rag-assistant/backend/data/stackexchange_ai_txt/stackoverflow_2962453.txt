After reading the article posted earlier I thought I would try an alternate approach. looking at the localrun.testconfig in a text editor I saw that the assemblies that contained code coverage data were in the section below The only reference to a web project was in the section: So to get code coverage working in TFS: In VS IDE, double click the localrun.testconfig , then click Code Coverage and then manually add the MVC assembly by clicking the Add Assembly... button. You will get a warning message about duplicate assemblies, tell it to use this new file. What this does behind the scenes in the localrun.testconfig is add a CodeCoverageItem entry with the MVC assembly and removes the AspNet section from the CodeCoverage section of the file. This has the added benefit of not starting up a local web server every time you run your tests. But it may have a detrimental effect on any Watin type tests and coverage.
