I'll try to answer my question: The probability that y=+1 is: $p(y=+1 |X,\beta) = \sigma(\beta^TX)$. To estimate the $\beta$ values, you'd normally use something like logistic regression. In this case, they assumed a Gaussian distribution on the parameters $\beta$ (assuming a mean of 0 and variance >0 (to avoid overfitting)), and thus they have the prior probability on $\beta$ (i.e., $p(\beta)$ ). They then compute the posterior density $L(\beta) = p(\beta) p(X|\beta,y).$ Plug in $p(\beta)$ that we previously got from the Gaussian distribution (before). The MAP estimate is then the $\beta$ that maximizes $l(\beta)$. Something like that. They also used something with Laplace priors to avoid overfitting, and a cyclic coordinate descent as an optimization. Hope it's correct.
