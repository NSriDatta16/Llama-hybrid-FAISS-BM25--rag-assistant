As a way of drilling LINQ into yourself LINQPad is great, and if as a developer you're planning on staying within the Microsoft ecology, then that's probably a good thing. Yes, there are a number of things you can't do in LINQ that you might need another tool for, whether that's SQL Management Studio or Visual Studio, however as you can drop down to SQL in the language some of these are mitigated if you can remember the SQL for it: Create new tables Modify existing tables Create SQL Agent Jobs Import/Export data Obviously these are mostly "management" activities. While LINQPad won't give you the execution plan, it will give you the SQL that is going to be run.
