Clustering time series when each object has multiple time series

I'm trying to cluster my customers in terms of their buying pattern throughout 7 years. Each customer has the quantity they bought at each quarter for 7 years for 10 products. So there are multiple time series for each customer. I would like to cluster customers based on their buying pattern (I also want to make sure that the algorithm also considers the correlation between one's buying patterns of different product. Which clustering method should I use? Is it possible to use SAS, SPSS or R to compute this? Thanks!
