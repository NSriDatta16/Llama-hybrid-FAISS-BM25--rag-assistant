int rMax = Color.Red.R; int rMin = Color.Blue.R; // ... and for B, G var colorList = new List (); for(int i=0; i You are setting rMin = 0 and rMax = 255 . Thus you are essentially setting rAverage = 255 * i / size; You don't have the code for gAverage and bAverage listed, but if it were truly equivalent you'd be seeing a gradual trasition from black->gray->white, with no other hues at all. It seems likely that what you want is to iterate over the different hues at a constant lightness/saturation. See here for an example C# class which does that, and here for an explanation of the equation.
