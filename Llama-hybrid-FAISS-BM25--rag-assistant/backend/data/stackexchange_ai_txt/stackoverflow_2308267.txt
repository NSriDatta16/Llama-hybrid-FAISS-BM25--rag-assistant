None that I know of. Unless you're using an API that handles it for you, you have to keep track of the information manually. And even if you did use an API just for mouse drags, it'd do the storing itself and likely just pass back the current X and Y, and the difference in X and Y, since the API wouldn't know what you want done with the information. You'd be handling a little bit less information, but saving only about 5 lines or so of code to get the same result.
