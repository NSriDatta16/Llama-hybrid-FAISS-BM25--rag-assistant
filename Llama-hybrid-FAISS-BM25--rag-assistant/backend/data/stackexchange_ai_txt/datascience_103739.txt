Not sure what language/framework you are using for your experiments but, you should try to deep seed your models so that performance is decoupled from random as much as possible. See an example here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html Ideally, you would want to have some sort of optimisation methodology in place, where attention: {True, False} is a hyperparameter alongside others.
