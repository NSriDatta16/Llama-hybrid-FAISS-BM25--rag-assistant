Is deep learning a must in a Data Science MSc programme?

I am reading the programme outline of this two-year MSc in Data Science and I found that it has no deep learning content (as in many other european ones). I am no expert but as far as I've seen I think that DL is going to be a heavy weight of ML algorithms for a long time. Do you think it is a bad idea to take a strong focus on classical models (e.g. bayesian) instead of teaching DL in a Data Science/ML MSc?
