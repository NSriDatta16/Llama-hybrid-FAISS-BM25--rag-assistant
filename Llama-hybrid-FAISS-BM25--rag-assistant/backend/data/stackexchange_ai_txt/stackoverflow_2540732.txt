You execute a HEAD request - this returns a response with null content. HtmlUnit nevertheless tries to create a page. To do so, it creates an input source with url and content (which is null) and gives it to a parser. An when a parser tries to parse the input source it sees a null content and uses the URL to retrieve the content anew. So it's actually not the HtmlUnit which makes the second requests, it's the XML parser. And that's why the user agent is Java and not the HttpClient.
