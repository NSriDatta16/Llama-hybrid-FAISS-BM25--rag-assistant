Classifiers for small data sets and low dimensional features?

I have a small data set (under 100 samples) and 5 input features. I often hear about how neural networks are prone to overfitting under such conditions and that naive Bayes is likely to underfit. What approach should I try then ? I should mention that the chosen classifier must return the probability/likelihood of belonging to a certain class and not just return the class without any provided uncertainty.
