Yes, you can use the :include option to do the join. RosterSlot.find(:all, :include => [:skill], :order => "skills.name ASC") The :order option takes a SQL fragment, so skills is a reference to the plural database table name. The :include takes an array of Active Record Associations. See http://www.railsbrain.com/api/rails-2.3.2/doc/index.html?a=M002313&name=find for more info.
