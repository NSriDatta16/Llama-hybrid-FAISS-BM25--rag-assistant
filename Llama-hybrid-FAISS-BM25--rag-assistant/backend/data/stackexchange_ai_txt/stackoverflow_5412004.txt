How do I submit an app through Xcode 4's organizer? I'm getting an error

I installed Xcode 4, thinking it would be similar to Xcode 3, and now I cannot get my binary to the App Store using organizer which I believe is the proper way to do this. Has anyone got this working properly? Not sure what setting I need to update - All I get is an "invalid binary" message. Of course, it is a critical update I need to submit.
