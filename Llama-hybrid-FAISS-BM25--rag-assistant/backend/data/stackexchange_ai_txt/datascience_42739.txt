Perceptron Primitive Boolean Functions

Thanks for reading. I'm currently reading Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning (I'm a beginner into ML), and I'm on chapter 4 about perceptrons. I'm really confused about this paragraph: I understand the AND but I'm still not so sure how OR can be represented. For example, if the inputs are: $X_1 = +1$ $X_2 = -1$ In that case, using his logic for OR we would end up with the perceptron actually outputting -1, because: $1*0.5 + -1*0.5 - .3 = -.3$ The function would give us a negative number. Is he wrong about the OR function? How would a single perceptron act as an OR ? Thank you!
