Some things I do in PHP (where mistakes are easy and often catastrophic): Turn on all the syntax highlighting cues in Vim. There's a lot turned off by default (do :help php to see them). I'm thinking of adding a few error-highlighting things of my own... Using a pre-commit hook in git to syntax-check ( php -l ) every changed file. It only prevents basic errors getting in, but it's better than nothing. Writing wrappers around the database classes to make parameterised prepared statements brain-dead easy compared to typing out normal queries - $db->q1($sql, $param1, $param2) to fetch a single column of the first row, and so on. Configuring it (via the Xdebug extension) to spit out gigantic HTML tables of debug info for even trivial warning messages, so it's impossible to ignore them. On the dev server, that is. On production they get silently logged instead. Making things short, simple and obvious. I spend a lot of time just refactoring stuff for the sake of making smaller files. Using the explicit control structure syntax to avoid having several "}"s in close proximity. Proofreading code before it's checked in. I've got into a habit of maximising the window, then setting an absurdly large font size. If I can only make sense of it when I can see 132C x 50R on screen at once in a tiny font, it's too long to begin with.
