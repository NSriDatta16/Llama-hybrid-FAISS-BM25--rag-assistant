I was searching for an answer to the the same question (that's how I found your post) and I came across this: http://chriscavanagh.wordpress.com/2008/10/03/wpf-easy-rounded-corners-for-anything/ Not sure it will work for you if you have a more complex shape that you would like to use as the clipping path, but if you are just looking to round some corners that will scale automatically, I suggest you check it out. It uses a VisualBrush bound to a border element instead of a clipping path. So far I have found it to be a pretty elegant solution for my needs.
