You could try mysqlcheck . Your specific requirements may be different, so check the docs, but something along these lines might help: mysqlcheck -u root -p --auto-repair --check --optimize --databases The --optimize flag is probably the most important in your case. Be sure to note the comments in the first paragraph of the docs about the locks that are placed on tables while this command is running.
