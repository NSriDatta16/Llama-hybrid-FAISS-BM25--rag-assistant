I am running into the same problem. I admit that I may have taken a nontraditional route, embedding a tab bar in a NavController, and now I'm kinda seeing why they say not to do it. Well, whatever, it makes sense for my app, even if it is a total pain to implement. My problem is that once I pushed a Modal VC onto a TabController subview (which is, in turn, a subview of the overarching NavController View, which has control of the top NavBar... which turns into a delegation nightmare) and then dismiss the MVC, the view that comes back is pushed up under the NavBar. Doesn't happen when I add or push any other subviews, just with MVCs. [self.view setFrame:(CGRect)] does seem to do the trick, if I call it right after [self dismissModal...]. However, it has to be called on all subviews of my tab bar controller , or even the other lists are shunted up under the bar. Poopy. Makes things a headache, but not unsolvable. But I agree, this is a new bug with 3.x (or maybe it's one of those double-edged "new features"), and it's downright annoying. I'm downloading 3.1.2 SDK now, and hopefully it addresses this. Gonna comment my [setFrame] lines and see what happens. But hopefully, if it's not solved in this version, it will be soon. Until then, it seems that the solution is a lot of (admittedly hackerish and repetitive) code. EDIT: Nope, updating didn't help. Poop. Back to the code I go, to hard-define the position of every screen. Awesome. Hopefully the size of Nav and Tab Bars doesn't ever change. EDIT 2: Hey! I solved it! (i R prowd.) Seems the problem was that, when my MVC was dismissed, my view got passed back to the tab bar controller, which had "forgotten" it had a nav bar above it. Don't tell me how, I'm probably way out of documented territory by now. But, I solved my particular problem by simply redefining the [subview.view setFrame:0,0,width, height] after returning from editing. Not sure why this made any difference, but in the app it did, because no longer is the first one and a half rows of my table view sneaking up under the nav bar. So I really have no advice, just find the right place to put [(appropriateViewController).view setFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height]; Not sure why it works but it does. Isn't that the worst kind of error?
