Bayesian Logistic Regression with brms and comparison model with R

Yesterday, I asked how to conduct a Bayesian logistic regression in another post. I have been advised to use the brms R package. I have conducted this analysis, but being a beginner in statistics and coding, I need to know if my analysis is right. I have a data set with one binary outcome ("Object"). Participants had to choose between two objects. I want to check if this choice was not influenced by a continuous predictor ("PHQ"). First, I have fitted a bayesian logistic regression model with Non-Informative Priors following tutorial of Fang & Van de Shoot ( https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/generalised-linear-models-with-brms/ ). Could you help me to interpret these outputs? I see that the credibility interval contains the 0. Does could be in favour of an absence of effect of the predictor on the outcome? How to interpret estimate in a report? Second I have repeat the procedure to fit e null model without predictor. I have used the LOO function to compare the two models. How can I interpret that? How is it informative for my hypothesis that PHQ (predictor) does not predict the binary outcome (Object)? Thanks.
