I don't know about safest, but I can offer you an alternative method. I learned to do it this way: PROGRAM infinity IMPLICIT NONE INTEGER :: inf REAL :: infi EQUIVALENCE (inf,infi) !Stores two variable at the same address DATA inf/z'7f800000'/ !Hex for +Infinity WRITE(*,*)infi END PROGRAM infinity If you are using exceptional values in expressions (I don't think this is generally advisable) you should pay careful attention to how your compiler handles them, you might get some unexpected results otherwise.
