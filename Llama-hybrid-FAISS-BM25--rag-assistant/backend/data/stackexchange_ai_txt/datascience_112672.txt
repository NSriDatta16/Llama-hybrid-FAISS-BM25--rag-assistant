Using Query Function formulas in Google Sheets helps in extracting the keywords from any URL so that is 1 such method that can be used efficiently. For Example: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=messenger%20app&c=apps https://play.google.com/store/search?q=torch&c=apps https://play.google.com/store/search?q=personal%20loan%20app&c=apps https://play.google.com/store/search?q=pnr%20status%20in%20india&c=apps These are the URLs I need keywords from then Here is one method you could try.... If the first cell that has the link is in A2, put this into cell B2, and drag down: =REGEXREPLACE(INDEX(SPLIT(INDEX(SPLIT(A2,"="),2),"&"),1),"%20"," ") alternatively, for a single cell arrayformula (so no need to drag down), just put this into B2: =ARRAYFORMULA(IFERROR( INDEX(SPLIT(REGEXEXTRACT(REGEXREPLACE(SUBSTITUTE(A5:A, "&", "="),"%20"," ")&"(", "\=(.+)\="), "="),,1))) Alternatively the formula below works fine too. =SPLIT(INDEX(SPLIT(INDEX(SPLIT(INDEX(SPLIT(B2, "/"),4),"="),2),"&"),1),"%20")
