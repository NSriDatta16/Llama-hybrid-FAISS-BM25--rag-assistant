What's the difference between convolutional neural network and convolutional auto encoders?

What's the difference between convolutional neural network and convolutional auto-encoders? This paper explains both but I find it hard to pinpoint the difference: http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/icann2011stack.pdf Many thanks!
