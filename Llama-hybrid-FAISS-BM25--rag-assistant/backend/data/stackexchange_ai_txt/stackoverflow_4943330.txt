Do you need this to work "three-way"? So setting any of the three properties ListBoxItem.IsSelected CheckBox.IsChecked Item1.IsSelected will affect both of the other properties? Unfortunately, there is no such Binding in WPF so you're gonna have to do a little extra work. Update As pointed out by Robert Rossney, a much better solution for this is to bind ListBoxItem.IsSelected to Item1.IsSelected CheckBox.IsChecked to ListBoxItem.IsSelected Updated Xaml
