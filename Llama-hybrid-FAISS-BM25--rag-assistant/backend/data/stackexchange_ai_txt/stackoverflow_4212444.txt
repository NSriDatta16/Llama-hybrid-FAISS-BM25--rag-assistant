If I understand correctly you want to point the user to an install/download link for the appropriate mobile app for their device, based on the user agent, but don't know what to do if the user agent isn't recognized/supported. In that case, I'd recommend you provide links to all the supported mobile platforms for the users information/choice. The user might have a compatible device but not be using it at the moment, might be shopping for one, or might even be using a compatible device but have customized their user agent to be something else (which can be a smart strategy for working around websites that force you into limited or broken mobile versions when they detect a mobile browser's useragent) I'd also recommend showing all the supported mobile links when a desktop browser is detected. In fact it might be better to just show all of them all the time, but show the detected-appropriate one first, or bigger.
