Auto Transfer of logs from server to server

I was wondering how to use php to do an auto transfer of log files weekly from one server to a cloud account. I have all the passwords and what not, I am just confused on how to set this file up. As a site I am running stores log files, we are trying to "push" them weekly to our cloud storage. Any help would be appreciated.
