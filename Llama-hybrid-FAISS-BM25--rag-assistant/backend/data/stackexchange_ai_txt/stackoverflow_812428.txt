How to schedule SSIS package to run as something other than SQL Agent Service Account

In SQL Server 2005, is it possible to schedule an SSIS package to run something other than the SQL Agent Service Account? I've got an SSIS package that makes a connection to a database and runs a stored procedure. My criteria is that I will not specify usernames/passwords in a package or package configuration, so I want to use integrated authentication. The problem is that by default a step in a job runs as SQL Agent Service Account, and our server group does not want to grant that account execute rights on the stored procedures that my package will execute. So we're trying to find a way to specify a different account in the step, so the package will run under a different context. Is that possible?
