JQuery droppable problem

I'm having trouble with the JQuery's droppable feature. I have modified JS from here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ $(function() { $("ul.draggable li").draggable(); $("div.droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { alert('Hello World'); } }); }); One Two Three Drop here The JQuery works fine if I set draggable and droppable as IDs of the HTML elements. However when they're classes only the draggable functionality works, the drop feature doesn't seem to do anything, and the alert function does not get executed. Any help would be great.
