This Markov network can only model pairwise correlations, whereas the RBM can model higher order correlations thanks to the latent variables. The RBM is a universal approximator of distributions, (2) is not. To answer you questions, given an RBM in general you can't come up with an equivalent (2). In the same way that in general you can't approximate a kernel SVM with a linear SVM. Given (2), you can always come up with the equivalent RBM.
