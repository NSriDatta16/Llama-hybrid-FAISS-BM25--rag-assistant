Call Asp.Net webforms server control method using jQuery .ajax method

I'm trying to create a web forms server control and really wanted to leverage jQuery to handle the client side interaction. So far I've not found any examples to being able to directly call a server control using the jQuery .ajax functionality and I'm wondering is it even possible? I know I could go down the web service or Http Handler route but my aim is to create a control that can be dropped into existing sites and utilise session but with no intention of needing to use ViewState. Can this be done? or do I have to use the ScriptControl and Asp.Net Ajax functionality?
