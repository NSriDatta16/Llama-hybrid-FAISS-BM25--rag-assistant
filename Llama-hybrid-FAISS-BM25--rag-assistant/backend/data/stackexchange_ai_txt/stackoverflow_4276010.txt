WPF Ribbon: DataTemplate causes BindingExpression path error

I've run into a small problem using the WPF RibbonControl (October 2010 version). My idea was to bind the ItemsSource property of a RibbonGroup to my viewmodel, and use a DataTemplate to create RibbonButtons as needed. This works, but it causes a binding error (one for each button) when you show the window: System.Windows.Data Error: 40 : BindingExpression path error: 'IsDropDownOpen' property not found on 'object' ''RibbonContentPresenter' (Name='PART_ContentPresenter')'. BindingExpression:Path=IsDropDownOpen; DataItem='RibbonContentPresenter' (Name='PART_ContentPresenter'); target element is 'RibbonButton' (Name=''); target property is 'NoTarget' (type 'Object') Here is a code fragment, the viewmodel is replaced by an array of strings, but the issue is the same: Button 1 Button 2 Button 3 Button 4 Button 5 Button 6 Again, it works, but the binding error is a bit annoying. Is there any way to get rid of it?
