This is not about predict the distribution of X intuitively this is the problem of fitting a distribution to data, which consists of finding a mathematical function which represents in a good way a statistical variable. This is usually done by experience: when you have a set of data, based on its clinical meaning and on the histogram of observed data, you can define a family of distribution that your data can eventually fit. From the family of distribution that you define previously, you can estimate the parameter(s) for each single distribution. With the estimated parameters, you can evaluate the goodness of fit following some methodologies/criteria. Sometime, we face a situation that there is no absolute distribution that fit best to the data, may be there are 2-3 distributions with more or less the same quality of fit, may be your data is the average/sum of two/three distributions.
