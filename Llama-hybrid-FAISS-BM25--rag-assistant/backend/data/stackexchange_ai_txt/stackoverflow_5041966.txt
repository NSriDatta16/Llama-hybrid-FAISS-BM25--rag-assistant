Dependency injection in domain object extension methods

I'm creating a node based web CMS system in asp.net mvc. Having read some books on dependency injection I've split my solution up into multiple projects and using abstractions (abstract classes and interfaces). I can't figure out how to solve the following type of code in my web project: myDomainObjectNode.GetChildNodes (); I could accomplish this if the domain object had a reference to an INodeRepository but that would mean that I have to carry this dependency around in all domain objects which is a hassle, especially when having to create new instances. Is having dependencies (mainly repositories) in you domain object a bad thing? My other idea is to achieve this using extension methods. However, extension methods are static on a static class which itself cannot be constructed using an IoC. I could solve this using a Singleton for the INodeRepository and having it set by the IoC. This doesn't feel like an elegant solution... do you have any other ideas or input? Thank you!
