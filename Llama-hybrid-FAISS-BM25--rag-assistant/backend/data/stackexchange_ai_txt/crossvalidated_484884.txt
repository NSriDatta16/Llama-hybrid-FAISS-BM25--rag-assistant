Have you tried running a Random Forest model with all of the data? Since each tree is trained in random data subsets with substitution, it could yield quite unbiased results. From personal experience, you could also try to use partial least squares, where in the k-fold cross validation, instead of being random, you could assign all the complaints about some individual 'x' to the same group ; therefore, it would be much less biased (I developed a PLS model where I have a dataset with properties very similar to yours, and the results were very good!)
