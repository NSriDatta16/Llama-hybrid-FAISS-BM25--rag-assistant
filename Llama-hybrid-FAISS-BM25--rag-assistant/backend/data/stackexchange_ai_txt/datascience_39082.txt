As I commented on your post - I think you have a problem with your environment. If you cannot solve that, you should file a bug with the spacy team on their GitHub. I tested the same code and could only see a difference in results compared to the website when using language models of different sizes. If you installed the English model using the default command: python -m spacy download en , then you get the smallest model by default. You should be using the medium-sized model to produce their results. I compare the two below The script import spacy # Small setup nlp_small = spacy.load('en') tokens_s = nlp_small(u'dog cat banana') # Medium setup nlp_medium = spacy.load('en_core_web_md') tokens_m = nlp_medium(u'dog cat banana') # large setup would use 'en_core_web_lg' ... print('Results using small model:\n') for token1 in tokens_s: for token2 in tokens_s: print(token1.text, token2.text, token1.similarity(token2)) print('\nResults using medium model:\n') for token1 in tokens_m: for token2 in tokens_m: print(token1.text, token2.text, token1.similarity(token2)) The output Results using small model: dog dog 1.0 dog cat 0.53906965 dog banana 0.28761008 cat dog 0.53906965 cat cat 1.0 cat banana 0.4875216 banana dog 0.28761008 banana cat 0.4875216 banana banana 1.0 Results using medium model: dog dog 1.0 dog cat 0.8016855 dog banana 0.24327648 cat dog 0.8016855 cat cat 1.0 cat banana 0.28154367 banana dog 0.24327648 banana cat 0.28154367 banana banana 1.0 The results are clearly better when using the medium sized model - and they match the results on the website. Here is the spacy version as used within a conda environment to produce these results: n1k31t4@n1k31t4~$ conda list | grep spacy spacy 2.0.12 And the Python version information: n1k31t4@n1k31t4:~$ ipython Python 3.6.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul 26 2018, 09:53:17) Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 6.5.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help. Although I ran the script on Linux (OP used MacOSX) and my Python version is slightly newer... I wouldn't expect these things to explain the difference in results.
