You basically answered it yourself with the edit but something a bit more elegant would be better. I.e. Don't delete them all first, just determin which need to be added, which need to be deleted and which need to just remain. E.g. (air code) List selectedSubscriptions; //This is passed in from the form using the model binder List mailingListsToRemove = GetCurrentMailingLists(); //Looks odd but bear with me List mailingListsToAdd = new List (); //Loop through all the mailing lists they had selected foreach (string selectedMailingList in selectedSubscriptions) { //if the mailing list exists in the list to remove, remove it from that list //because they obviously don't want it removed //Remember that this list also contains their current lists. if (mailingListsToRemove.Contains(selectedMailingList)) { mailingListsToRemove.Remove(selectedMailingList); } else //If it's not in the list to remove then add it { mailingListsToAdd.Add(selectedMailingList); } } So at the end of that loop you should have two lists - one containing all the mailing lists that the user wants removed and one containing all the new mailing lists they want to be subscribed to. The mailing lists that they were already subscribed to and still wish to be subscribed to should just be left alone. HTHs, Charles
