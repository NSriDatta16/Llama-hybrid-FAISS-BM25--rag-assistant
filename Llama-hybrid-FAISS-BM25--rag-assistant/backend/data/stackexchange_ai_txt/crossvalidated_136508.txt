My view is that the $F$ test of statistical significance of the interaction effect is less important than the subjective nature of the interaction, as evidenced by the plot. The plot tells me that it is reasonably sensible to compare the overall averages of Depression and Top , but it'd be silly to compare those averages with the overall average of Slope -- whether or not these comparisons are statistically significant. Basically, I'd say to avoid doing comparisons that don't make sense -- so my advice is do not ignore the warning note in this case. If the curve for Top were fairly parallel with the other two, that's when you could ignore it. In general, I suggest looking at enough plots that you can tell what's going on, and then restrict your post-hoc testing to things that are sensible. Since P is continuous, you're really fitting straight lines (they look curved because you chose unequally spaced points). You can compare the slopes of these lines: R> lstrends(Dens.LMER, pairwise ~ Contour, var = "P") $lstrends Contour P.trend SE df lower.CL upper.CL Depression -0.00681143 0.004901195 39.68 -0.01671957 0.003096714 Slope -0.03376293 0.010533875 41.88 -0.05502295 -0.012502911 Top -0.01306992 0.010499548 41.97 -0.03425936 0.008119525 Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value Depression - Slope 0.026951501 0.01161827 42.00 2.320 0.0639 Depression - Top 0.006258486 0.01158716 41.81 0.540 0.8520 Slope - Top -0.020693015 0.01487290 41.99 -1.391 0.3545 P value adjustment: tukey method for a family of 3 tests The comparison between the shallowest and largest slopes has an adjusted $P$ value of about $.06$.
