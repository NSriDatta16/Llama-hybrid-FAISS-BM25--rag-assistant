Bind an event of a slider control

In the view ( AudioView.xaml ) i have written the following code Note: Also there is file AudioView.xaml.cs . In the view model class( AudioViewModel.cs ) i defined the following property public event DragCompletedEventHandler AudioSliderChangedCommand; and in the constructor of view model class ( AudioViewModel.cs ) this.AudioSliderChangedCommand = new DragCompletedEventHandler(OnAudioSliderChanged); During the compilation i am getting the following error Error 8 DragCompleted="{Binding AudioSliderChangedCommand}" is not valid. {Binding AudioSliderChangedCommand} is not a valid event handler method name. Only instance methods on the generated or code-behind class are valid.
