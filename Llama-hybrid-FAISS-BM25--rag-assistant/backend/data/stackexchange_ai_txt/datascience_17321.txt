TF-IDF Regression & Machine Learning

I would like to take a set of documents where each document already has an assigned popularity change value ("trending", i.e. -10%, +25%, etc.), and create a machine learning model that would be able to predict a "trending" value for a new document. After creating TF-IDFs for all documents, dropping some of the rarest words that only appear in 1 document, possibly removing stop words, etc., I'm a little lost. Is it the right approach to use some kind of sentiment analysis model that would train the TF-IDF vectors on the popularity change values? I am also thinking about how to train a regular regression model for this task, but it doesn't seem like an easy choice to integrate with TD-IDF data.
