jQuery UI Drag + drop after AJAX call

I'm using a AJAX call to create a new droppable box. Now within that box I want to create another droppable container after a successful drag and drop event into that box. I don't want to create a recursive call, however. $("#box").click( function (e) { // Create container // Create addDrop droppable first container (with class .droppable) }); }); function addDrop(){ $(".droppable").droppable({ /* blah */ drop: create new droppable container ? }); }); What would be the best way to create containers that are droppable after an AJAX call?
