You might want to take a look at some literature on the subject. One I might recommend is: Three-dimensional bin packing problem with variable bin height by Yong Wua, Wenkai Li,Mark Goh and Robert de Souza European Journal of Operational Research Volume 202, Issue 2, 16 April 2010, Pages 347-355 It is basically discussing the packing of boxes into a larger box. It provides some pseudocode which might be helpfull as well.
