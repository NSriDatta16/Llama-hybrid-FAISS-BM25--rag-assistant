XHTML is a lot more strict than ordinary HTML, and therefore it is hard (or even impossible, depending on the framework you use to build it) to get it right. I've seen many web pages that claim to be XHTML and fail big time at it (silently serving their content as "text/html" so the page loads at all). As long as the whole HTML generation process, I mean all of it , has not been abstracted away into a framework, I venture to say it is impossible to guarantee that the outcome of a web page generation process is valid XHTML. But - many popular languages in use today (the majority, I guess) build HTML directly, with all the error potential of humans who don't know the spec by heart, or just don't care if a inside a is valid or not. Apart from that it has no apparent enormous advantages over HTML that would justify it's use, especially if all you want is "build a web page for the display in a browser". HTML 4.01 is well supported among user agents and does a good job. Personally, I don't see a really good reason to move to XHTML. I don't say there are none, the topic is just a lot more academic than one might think.
