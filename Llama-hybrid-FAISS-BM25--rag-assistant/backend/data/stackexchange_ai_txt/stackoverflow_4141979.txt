Decoding escaped html data with newlines using C#

I am using jquery ajax to send data from a . to a server where the data will be stored in a SQL database. If the TextBox contains Line1 Line2 Line3, The following string is getting passed to the server comments=Line1%0ALine2%0ALine3 (data encoded using javascript's escape function). However, I am unable to parse this on the server ( using C# ) I tried these approaches, and none of them worked. (Request.Form["comments"]).Replace("\r\n"," "); (Server.UrlDecode(Request.Form["comments"])).Replace("\r\n"," "); All suggestions welcome. I don't know where I am messing up( client side or the server side ), but it's not working. The ultimate goal is to store the data in a SQL Server Database for later retrieval. Thanks for helping!
