A module is just a way of organizing things. In a multi-module build, you can build an entire tree of artifacts in one step (remember the Joel Test ). However, each of these will be an individual artifact, which can individually be referenced as a dependency. Here is a sample layout, packaging in parentheses. root (pom) - project1 (jar) - project2 (war) -> references project1 as dependency - project3 (jar) - project4 (war) -> references project3 as dependency - project5 (ear) -> references project2 and project4 as dependency call mvn install in the root directory to build the entire tree. The assumption here is that project1 is only used by project2 and project3 is only used by project4. Otherwise here is a more complex scenario. root (pom) - project1 (jar) - project2 (jar) - project3 (war) -> references project1 and project2 as dependency of scope provided - project4 (war) -> references project1 and project2 as dependency of scope provided - project5 (ear) -> references project1 through project4 as dependency So, modules take away the work of building several projects independently, but you still need to manage your dependencies yourself.
