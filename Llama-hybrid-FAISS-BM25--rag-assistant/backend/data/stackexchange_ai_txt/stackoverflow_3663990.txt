How to balance bandwidth load in file streaming?

when it comes to stream big files it seems like nginx 1Gbps upload throughput link is small to handle transfer data from 3-4 storage servers. The cause of my problem is bottle neck in proxy - all data go through loadbalancer. Webservers downloading files from storage and streaming files over http (now through one nginx as loadbalancer). Is it possible configure nginx to don't mediate in data streaming (static and dynamic data will be directly from webservers) and only balance requests? If not what shoud I use?
