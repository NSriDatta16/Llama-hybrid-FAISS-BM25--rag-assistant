The problem you run into most of the time on VPS is IO wait. Do you run your virtual machine off of a disk image, if so try defragmenting your drive. Or did you dedicate a partition to it? Edit: I would suggest to: either try defragmenting the drive that has the disk image either try dedicating a partition to the virtual machine, instead of using a disk image all together. (ideally the first partition on the drive, since this will have the lowest random access time) Running off a disk image works, but since you're working on top of a filesystem, the disk image might be fragmented throughout the disk. Good luck, hope it helps...
