NSAttributedString as a Transformable Attribute in Core Data Entity

In the Core Data Programming Guide under "Transformable Attributes" here . It is stated "You can now use the attribute as you would any other standard attribute, as illustrated in the following code fragment:" The follow line of code is listed newEmployee.favoriteColor = [NSColor redColor]; I am trying to do something similar in my code but it doesn't work. Here is my code: In Entry.h: @interface Entry : NSManagedObject { } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSAttributedString * contentString; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate * date; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSManagedObject * journal; @end and in Entry.m: @implementation Entry @dynamic contentString; @dynamic date; @dynamic journal; - (void)awakeFromInsert { [super awakeFromInsert]; self.date = [NSDate date]; } @end Elsewhere I have this code: Entry *newEntry = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Entry" inManagedObjectContext:[self managedObjectContext]]; newEntry.contentString = [[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"MyString"] autorelease]; newEntry.journal = self.journal; The line newEntry.contentString = [[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"MyString"] autorelease]; is equivalent to newEmployee.favoriteColor = [NSColor redColor]; As far as I can tell however this doesn't work. I get a runtime error: 2010-10-13 09:02:08.577 JournalMaker[2437:a0f] Cannot create NSData from object MyString{ } of class NSConcreteAttributedString I have no idea what this error message is supposed to mean. Can someone explain?
