What you are showing here is the weighted average of $Rating$ , potentially for one subject. In order to decide whether this is above or below average, you need a sample of subjects over which you will do the same calculation and then you can calculate the average of the weighted averages of all subjects to get the sample's mean. Then, you will be able to compare any other subject's weighted average to that number. Let $R$ be an $n*k$ matrix, of $n$ results for $k$ subjects, $w$ your weights vector with the importance of each result and $1_{n*1}$ , $1_{k*1}$ are $n*1$ and $k*1$ vectors respectively, with all elements equal to 1. Then the weighted average of each subject is equal to the vector $r$ $$r=[\operatorname{diag}(w)R]^T1_{n*1}$$ and the average of the weighted averages of all subjects $\mu_r$ is $$\mu_r=\frac{r^T1_{k*1}}{k}$$
