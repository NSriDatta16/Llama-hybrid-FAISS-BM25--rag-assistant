You can do this if you use the InnoDB storage engine CREATE TABLE `folder` ( # id = PK `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, # folderId = self referencing FK to id `folderId` int(10) unsigned default NULL, # siteId = FK to id in site table `siteId` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (folder_id, site_id) REFERENCES folder(id, site_id) ) ENGINE=INNODB; It didn't test it but it should work. See FOREIGN KEY Constraints . If you want/have to use MyISAM, of course you can do this logically the same way as you do it with the "normal" foreign key constraints.
