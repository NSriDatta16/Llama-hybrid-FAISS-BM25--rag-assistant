Weighing Maximum Likelihood Estimations

I'm trying to arrive at a time series of optimized parameter values $Z_t$ that maximizes the likelihood of occurrence of a specific time series $Y_t$ . There is a subsample within the sample that requires greater accuracy. So, I have 7 samples within a time series $Y_i (Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_7) $ , all of which follow a binomial distribution. The MLE function used assumes all the distributions to be binomial and iid. I am particularly interested in assuring that $Y_7$ is more accurate/ there are lesser errors around the series. My teacher suggested weighted MLEs and weighting the subsample at a weight greater than 1 to reduce the errors around the particular subsample. The way we could go about it is either by increasing the number of occurrences of the particular sample by n, or by manually increasing the negative likelihood value of $Y_7$ before summing it up. However, I am a bit confused. Wouldn't this manually increase the probability of occurrence of $Y_7$ in our sample? Shouldn't we use some correction factor to correct its probability once we have calculated it?
