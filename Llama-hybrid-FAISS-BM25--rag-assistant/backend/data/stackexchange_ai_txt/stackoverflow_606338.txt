I guess you copied and pasted, right? Anyways here's a little note: When you drag controls on a form in VS Designer, vs generates code for these controls "usually in InitializeComponent()". VS writes the references in your class (e.g form1.cs) like the following: private System.Windows.Forms.TreeView treeView1; this is just declaring a variable of type System.Windows.Forms.TreeView this variable (itself) is stored on the stack, because it's just a reference, a reference that doesn't point to any actual heap objects till now (i.e NullReference). Now this reference is useless and you can't use it unless you initialize it and tell it to point to a real object on the heap, and that's what VS does for you in the designer, it simply adds the next line to InitializComponents: this.treeView1 = new System.Windows.Forms.TreeView(); And this is the line that you forgot to copy to the other class, which left your reference uninitialized (i.e still NullReference), hence when you tried to use it, a NullReferenceException was thrown. I guess this is your problem or at least this is how i could understand it. Forgive me if i failed to understand you!
