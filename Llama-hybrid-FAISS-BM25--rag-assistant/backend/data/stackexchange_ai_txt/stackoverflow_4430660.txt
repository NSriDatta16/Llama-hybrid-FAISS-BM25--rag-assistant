Hubert, have you tried storing the query into a separate variable and then calling the execute() method on it? I mean something like: $good_query = Doctrine_Query::create() ->from('...') ->innerJoin('...') ->where('...', false) ; $evil_query = Doctrine_Query::create() ->from('...') ->innerJoin('...') ->where('...', true) ; $this->categories = $good_query->execute(); $this->evil_query = $evil_query->execute(); It seems like both attributes ( categories and evil_query ) are pointing at the same object.
