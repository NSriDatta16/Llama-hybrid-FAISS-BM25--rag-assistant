In epidemiology, sometimes we are interested in calculating RRs than ORs. When the rare disease assumption is not valid (i.e. event rate is more than 10%) we cannot interprete odds-ratios as relative risks in logistic regression. In order to calculate risks in this case, we used modified Poisson regression (cf. reference below) with robust error variance.
