ANOVA non-normal distribution of residuals - variance estimates

Let's assume that the normal distribution of residuals assumption is not met when we perform an ANOVA. I understand that it will probably lead to inaccurate inferential results regarding p-values and CI coverage. But what about the within and between group variance estimates? Are they necessarily biased? I am sorry if this topic was already discussed but I did not find my answer.
