Traverse all transitions in a state machine

I need some help in traversing all transitions in a state machine. (all-transitions is a coverage criteria) I have a state machine and I want to cover all transitions with minimum number of paths from source to target/abort state. ex: A->B B->B B->C B->D so paths are: A->B->B->C, A->B->D
