Error while conversion of Nhibernate query to generic list

I have a simple entity called EmployeeEntity with properties ID , Name , Age , Organisation , and Designation . I am just querying the database using the query IQuery query = session.CreateQuery( "select Name, Designation, Age, Organisation FROM EmployeeEntity " + "group by Name, Designation, Age, Organisation"); IList employee = query.List (); // Throws error but on conversion to my type, it's throwing an exception: Could not execute query[SQL: SQL not available] with InnerException : The value "System.Object[]" is not of type "NHibernateTest.EmployeeEntity" and cannot be used in this generic collection. Parameter name: value though it works fine using this query: IQuery query = session.CreateQuery("select e FROM EmployeeEntity e group by e"); IList employee = query.List (); but I don't want to select all the columns because I don't need them.
