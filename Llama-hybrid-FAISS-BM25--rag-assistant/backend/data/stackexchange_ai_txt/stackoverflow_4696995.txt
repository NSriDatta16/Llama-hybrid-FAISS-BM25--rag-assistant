Strictly speaking, the short echo tag and the standard PHP tag do different things (and are sometimes used together). Using and its short tag equivalent in a single file is inconsistent, and both forms of short tags are now discouraged now as they're scheduled to be deprecated in PHP6 . However. CodeIgniter processes the echo style tags as a basic template engine (much like Smarty's tags). I strongly recommend using the echo tags in CodeIgniter views for variables, as they make the view read more clearly as HTML/XML/etc. Versus: The alternative is to plug in a library like Smarty, so that you're views are as close to their target file format as possible. I've found that reducing that noise is important for debugging and maintaining views.
