If you need something similar to the torrents way of writing to a file, this is how I would implement it: Open a FileStream on Thread T1, and create a queue "monitor" for step 2 Create a queue that will be read from T1, but written by multiple network reader threads. (the queue data structure would look like this: (position where to write, size of data buffer, data buffer). Fire up the threads :) Anyway, from your comments, your problem seems to be another one.. I have found something in, but I'm not sure if it works: If you want to write data to a file, two parallel methods are available, WriteByte() and Write() . WriteByte() writes a single byte to the stream: byte NextByte = 100; fs.WriteByte(NextByte); Write() , on the other hand, writes out an array of bytes. For instance, if you initialized the ByteArray mentioned before with some values, you could use the following code to write out the first nBytes of the array: fs.Write(ByteArray, 0, nBytes); Citation from: Nagel, Christian, Bill Evjen, Jay Glynn, Morgan Skinner, and Karli Watson.
