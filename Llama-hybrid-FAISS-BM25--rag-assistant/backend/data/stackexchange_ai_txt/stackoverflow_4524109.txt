The answer is no . OSGi fragments don't have their own class loader and they are seen as part of the host. They can't inject the new code into replacing the existing class. The common usage of fragment is providing different implementations for different hosts. Another bundles who require its capability(exported by the host bundle) won't depend on the concrete implementation. Bundle already is the atom concept of OSGi, you should provide newer version of it if you want to patch something.
