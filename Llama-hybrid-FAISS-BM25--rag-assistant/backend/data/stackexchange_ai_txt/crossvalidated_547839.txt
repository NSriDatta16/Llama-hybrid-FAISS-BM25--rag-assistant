Does thinning in JAGS/Stan reduce computational time for simulating a chain of a given length?

Question Let's say we have a complicated model whose posterior distribution we want to draw from using MCMC. To do this, we simulate a chain of total length $N=10,000$ . For the sake of this question, we'll ignore burn-in/warm-up and the issue of using multiple chains, but suppose we have the option of thinning to retain only every $k$ -th iterate. The final number of iterates retained from the chain would be $S=N/k$ . My question is whether there is a difference between two following thinning options in terms of how long it takes JAGS to simulate the full chain of $N=10,000$ iterates: - Option 1. Run the chain without any thinning - Option 2. Run the chain with thinning Background There's a growing consensus that, for most purposes, analyzing a thinned chain of length $S is less statistically efficient than analyzing the full unthinned chain of length $N$ . However, an argument for thinning is that it reduces computational burden in terms of requiring less computer storage, which can be helpful for models with many parameters: if you're limited to only storing posterior samples of length $M$ , it's better to get that posterior sample by thinning a chain longer than $M$ , since the thinned chain will have a larger effective sample size due to reduced autocorrelation. I'm trying to understand whether another reason to use thinning might be that it makes it easier to obtain a long chain, by reducing the computational time it takes to get to, say, $N=10,000$ iterates. If that's the case, might it be preferable to use a thinned chain of length $S$ rather than an unthinned chain of length $S$ ?
