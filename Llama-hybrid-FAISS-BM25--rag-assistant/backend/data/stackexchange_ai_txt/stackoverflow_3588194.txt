As Brad Larson pointed out, this is for Mac, not for iPhone. Yes, NSMutableArray is the best option. However, arrays store objects, and center is a struct! One solution is to wrap the center struct with NSValue : yourArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:2]; //Don't worry, capacity expands automatically [yourArray addObject:[NSValue valueWithPoint:image.center]]; //later [[yourArray objectAtIndex:whatevs] pointValue]; (This is very similar to, for example, wrapping an int with NSNumber for storage in an array.)
