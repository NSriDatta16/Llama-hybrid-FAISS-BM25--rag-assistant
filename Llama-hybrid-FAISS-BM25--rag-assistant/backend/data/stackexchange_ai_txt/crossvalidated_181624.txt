One important application lies in demographics, e.g., forecasting the development of age pyramids, which are really nothing but time-varying histograms, which in turn are density estimators. Try your approach on that. Here are a few ideas about how to get longitudinal demographic density data. I finally went with the German dataset, which had the finest granularity, giving the annual pyramid in 1-year steps - most other datasets only binned each year's pyramid in 5-year-age bins. If you find a better source of demographic density time series, please tell us at that thread. Hyndman and Shang (2009) is a paper on forecasting functional time series. They apply their method to fertility rates. I'd also recommend the rainbow package for R also by Shang and Hyndman, for visualization of functional data. Or you can visualize your forecasts using animations. Here is a little animated GIF I created for the future German population pyramid (men on the left, women on the right):
