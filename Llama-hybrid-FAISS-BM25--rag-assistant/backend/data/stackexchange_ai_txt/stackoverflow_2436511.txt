Though you can in a sense alter (some of) the contents of a page from CSS, its use is discouraged and it is not up to the task you want to handle . From quir]{smode : " I feel that we shouldn't use the content declaration at all. It adds content to the page, and CSS is meant for adding presentation to the page, and not content. Therefore I feel that you should use JavaScript if you want to dynamically generate content. CSS is the wrong tool for this job. "
