Using code coverage on it's own is mostly pointless, it gives you only insight if you are looking for unnecessary code. Using it together with unit-tests and aiming for 100% coverage will tell you that all the 'tested' parts (assumed it was all successfully too) work as specified in the unit-test. Writing unit-tests from a technical design/functional design, having 100% coverage and 100% successful tests will tell you that the program is working like described in the documentation. Now the only thing you need is good documentation, especially the functional design, a programmer should not write that unless (s)he is an expert of that specific field.
