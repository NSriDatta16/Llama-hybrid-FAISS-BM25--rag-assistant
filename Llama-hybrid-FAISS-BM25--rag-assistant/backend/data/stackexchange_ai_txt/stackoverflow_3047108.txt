Advantages: Faster than normal form (by how much?) Simpler queries for basic operations (no joins) Slightly easier to impose maximum limits Disadvantages: Extensibility Added business logic (What if a customer closes their first account? Shift the others?) Wasted space (considerable if the average user doesn't have 3 accounts) Aggregate metrics more difficult to obtain (i.e.: exact total number of accounts) You can't claim your DB is normalized Both options are valid given the requirements. If possible, benchmark the difference and see if the performance, and calculate the storage difference to see if it's worth it for your deployment. However , I would likely opt to use a trigger to impose the account limit since that would provide the easiest maintainability, not waste disk space and future developers won't wonder why I can't even get 1NF right.
