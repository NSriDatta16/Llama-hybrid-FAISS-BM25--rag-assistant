is there a convenient way to filter by a group column in XtraGrid GridView without displaying that column?

this is a continuation of my previous question is there off-the-shelf convenient way to filter by a group column in XtraGrid GridView? . I was told to set GridView.OptionsView.ShowGroupedColumns to true, but that simply sucks. I don't want to waste horizontal space in my grid showing the group columns - it is sufficient to show them as group headers. I only want to have nice filter textboxes for those columns on top. Any other suggestions short of rolling my own?
