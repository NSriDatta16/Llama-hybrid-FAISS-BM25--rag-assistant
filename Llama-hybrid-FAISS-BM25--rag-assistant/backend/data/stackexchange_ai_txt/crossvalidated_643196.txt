Hypothesis Testing for Means & Proportions. t-test vs z-test

How can I convince my teacher that he is wrong in this task? We were given the following task and my teacher says I have to use a z-test.

Before installation, employees had an average of 12.7 sick days per year over the years with a standard deviation of 1.2 days. In the two years following installation, the average was 11.4 sick days. Determine whether health has actually improved using a 95% confidence interval assuming that the standard deviation has not changed. Can it be confirmed that the health of the employees has improved? I calculated the t test because there is a rule that if the sample n, in this case the 2 years, are smaller than 30, then it should you can use the t-test. Since n=2 and less than 30, I thought the t-test was the right choice. Can I use this rule and are there other options too, that proof that the t-test is the right choice? Click for the n
