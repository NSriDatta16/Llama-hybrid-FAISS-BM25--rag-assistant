How do I convert an NSHttpCookie to a System.Net.Cookie in MonoTouch?

I have a MonoTouch iPhone app that does federated sign in via the Azure Access Control Service. The login is done via an embedded UIWebView browser. When the login is done, I want to transfer the cookie into my app. I have access to the NSHttpCookieStorage.SharedStorage.Cookies collection, so I can find the cookie. But in order to call the back end services, I need to have a System.Net.Cookie that I can put into a CookieContainer to send to the service. How do I convert between the two... is this the only way? NSHttpCookie cookie = NSHttpCookieStorage.SharedStorage.Cookies[0]; System.Net.Cookie newCookie = new System.Net.Cookie() { Name = cookie.Name, Value = cookie.Value, Version = (int) cookie.Version, Expires = cookie.ExpiresDate, Domain = cookie.Domain, Path = cookie.Path, Port = cookie.PortList[0].ToString(), // is this correct?? Secure = cookie.IsSecure, HttpOnly = cookie.IsHttpOnly };
