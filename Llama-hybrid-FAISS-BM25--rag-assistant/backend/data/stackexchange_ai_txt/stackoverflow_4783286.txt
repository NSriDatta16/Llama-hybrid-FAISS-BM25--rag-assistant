This is pretty tough to do. The easiest way to do this would be by using the Xcode Organizer panel and then looking at the applications that you have installed. If it is one of your applications (matching your dev credentials) then Xcode will give you the option to download the application's sandboxed folders (docs, temp, etc). From memory, you cannot do this to another application that doesn't belong to you. So in short you are safe to include data in your app. Honestly though, if someone wants to get to that data, they always will given enough time and resources (thats my opinion about all security).
