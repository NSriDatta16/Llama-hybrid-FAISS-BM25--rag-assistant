No, that actually does not always follow. Suppose X, Y, and Z are discrete with joint distribution proportional to this: X | Y | Z | Prob times 16 ---|----|------|-------------- -1 | -1 | 1 | 1 -1 | 1 | 1 | 3 1 | -1 | 1 | 3 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 -1 | -1 | 1000 | 4 -1 | 1 | 1000 | 0 1 | -1 | 1000 | 0 1 | 1 | 1000 | 4 X/Z and Y/Z have approximately the (negative) correlation structure shown in the top four rows, whereas X and Y are modestly correlated, matching on average 10 times out of 16. I know you asked for X and Y to have unit variance, but that can be accomplished by rescaling them, which does not alter the correlation. If X and Y are correlated conditional on Z for every value of Z, that should be good enough. Also, if X and Y are independent of Z, that might help, but I am not sure. UPDATE: It is sufficient to add "Z is independent of (X, Y)". Covariance is greater than 0 if and only if correlation is zero, so I'll prove it using covariances. This proof easily extends to the case where Z and (X,Y) are not independent, but X and Y are correlated conditional on Z for every value of Z. $$Cov[\frac{X}{Z}, \frac{Y}{Z}|Z] = Cov[X,Y|Z]/Z^2 = Cov[X,Y]/Z^2 > 0$$.
