Unable to understand the drawable structure inside res folder

I am newbie as far as android application development is considered. I am little bit confused about drawable folders. In the tutorials available on the android developer site they have mentioned about the drawable folder. But when I create android 2.3.3 application I see three folders drawable-hdpi , drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi . I know that this for screen resolutions. If I have an image as a resource I have to create equivalent three images with different sizes and put these images into these three folders. But for example, I am working on a localization (German) with images. Should I create folder drawable-hdpi-de-rDE similarly drawable-mdpi-de-rDE and drawable-ldpi-de-rDE or should drawable-de-rDE be sufficient? If drawable-de-rDE is sufficient what will happen if it is run in mdpi or ldpi? Please clear my doubts regarding this. Thanks Pankaj
