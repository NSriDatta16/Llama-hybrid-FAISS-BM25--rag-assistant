It was only after I had first deployed my app that I realised some users were behind firewalls... off to work to test it. Rather than do a test for a '407 authentication required' I just do the same Proxy setup whether it might be needed or not... System.Net.HttpWebRequest req = (System.Net.HttpWebRequest)System.Net.WebRequest.Create(uri.AbsoluteUri); //HACK: add proxy IWebProxy proxy = WebRequest.GetSystemWebProxy(); proxy.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; req.Proxy = proxy; req.PreAuthenticate = true; //HACK: end add proxy req.AllowAutoRedirect = true; req.MaximumAutomaticRedirections = 3; req.UserAgent = "Mozilla/6.0 (MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; DeepZoomPublisher.com)"; req.KeepAlive = true; req.Timeout = 3 * 1000; // 3 seconds I'm not sure what the relative advantages/disadvantages are (try{}catch{} without proxy first, versus just using the above), but this code now seems to work for me both at work (authenticating proxy) and at home (none).
