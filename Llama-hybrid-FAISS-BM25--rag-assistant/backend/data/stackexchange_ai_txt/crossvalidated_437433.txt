Analysing serial dependence in binary sequences

Suppose, I have a generator of a binary time series $x_t$ . The generator produces a $1$ with probability $q$ , except when there was a previous trial and the previous trial was a $1$ : in this case the generator slightly increases the probability of a $1$ by $c$ , i.e. the probability now is $q+c$ . Now, as a mere observer of such a time series, do I have any chance to proof, that $x_{t-1}=1$ increases the chance for a $1$ at time point $t$ ? Can I quantify by how much, i.e. $c$ ? Can I dissociate this from a generator, which instead increases the chance of a $0$ following a $0$ ? Can I reconstruct $q$ ?
