It usually makes little sense to average over different series' RMSEs, since these may be on very different scales. What does make sense is averaging some kind of relative RMSE. For instance, for each series, you could run a simple benchmark forecast, like the overall mean. This gives you an $\text{RMSE}_{\text{benchmark}}$ in the holdout sample. Now you run the forecasting method $A$ you are actually interested in, which gives you an $\text{RMSE}_{\text{A}}$ in the holdout sample. Finally you can look at the relative error in your series, $$ \frac{\text{RMSE}_{\text{A}}}{\text{RMSE}_{\text{benchmark}}}. $$ This indicates by how much $A$ outperforms the benchmark in terms of RMSE. And these relative measures can be compared between different series, so you can indeed take averages.
