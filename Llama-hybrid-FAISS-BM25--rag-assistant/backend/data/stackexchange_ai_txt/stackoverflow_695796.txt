Bluntly put, no - sort of - yes, but. Any workaround is non-optimal and involves using an "IBlank" as a master WCF interface (where your interfaces derive from IBlank), and two endpoints, one implementing IProductMgmtBIZ and the other implementing ICustomerMgmtBIZ. I don't have my dev machine in front of me, this might involve some other overrides. So, at the WCF level you're screwed unless you want to have two WCF ServiceHosts (which is perfectly reasonable). In short, the workaround is inelegant. Its easier to have two WCF endpoints on the same port with a different extension.
