First, you should not run those versions of memcached. They have lots and lots of known bugs and are many years old. Secondly, we add stats to memcached quite frequently, so if these libraries are complaining when they encounter new stats, you should complain to their authors. Also, I don't believe cmemcache is maintained. It's based on a deprecated memcached C library that has several known bugs. Users of that library are encouraged to migrate to libmemcached.
