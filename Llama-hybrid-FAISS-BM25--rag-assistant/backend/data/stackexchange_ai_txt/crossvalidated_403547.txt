Array of samples from multivariate gaussian distribution Python

I am trying to build in Python the scatter plot in part 2 of Elements of Statistical Learning. First it is said to generate 10 means mk from a bivariate Gaussian distribution N((1,0)T,I) and labeled this class BLUE. Similarly, 10 more were drawn from N((0,1)T,I) and labeled class ORANGE. I draw one such mean from bivariate gaussian using from numpy.random import multivariate_normal as mvnorm cov = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] mean_or = [1,0] mean_bl = [0,1] m_or = [0]*10 m_bl = [0]*10 for i in range(10): m_or[i] = list(mvnorm(mean_or,cov)) m_bl[i] = list(mvnorm(mean_bl,cov)) Is there a more elegant way to generate a vector of 10 means in python, a one-liner replacing the for-loop here ? Side question : what difference between drawing samples from $N((1,0)T,I)$ and $N((0,1)T,I)$ ?
