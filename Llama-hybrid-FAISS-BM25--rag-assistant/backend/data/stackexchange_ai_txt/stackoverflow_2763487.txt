O_DIRECT bypasses the OS's cacheing systems. A SAN may be a very fast storage system, but generally it's going to be somewhere else over a network link and proxied/hidden behind various other layers. By using O_DIRECT, which eliminates local cacheing, you force InnoDB to hit the storage system directly every time.
