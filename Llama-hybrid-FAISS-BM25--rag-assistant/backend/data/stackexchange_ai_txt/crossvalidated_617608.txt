You have an outcome of interest: if some stock market increases or decreases. While I have my doubts about how useful this is, a binary outcome is a fine place to start practicing machine learning. You also have predictor variables that you will consider, which you calculate from your text analysis. Thus, you are asking if this text-based feature is predictive of whether or not the stock market increases or decreases. After you did this, you got a model that has poor performance. There are a few reasons for that. Is there a reason to believe that the text-based data would be predictive of the stock market? There must be economic and political reasons for stock market movements, and you seem not to capture such data. Even if the Tweets contains a great deal of information that is predictive of stock market movements, is your way of extracting information from the Tweets one that should preserve that information? While investor sentiment about investments might be reasonably regarded as predictive of stock market movement, your Tweets capture much information that is unrelated. For instance, a Tweet like, "I feel so down after my date stood me up," has a negative sentiment, but I see little connection to the stock market. I would expect much of Twitter to deal with the kind of Tweet I gave above instead of investor sentiment about investing. I see a huge issue leading to your poor performance being that your features probably just do not have much to do with investing and should not be expected to be predictive of stock market movements.
