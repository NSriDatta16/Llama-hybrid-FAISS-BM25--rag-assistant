I think I solved it: Using "helper", I can achieve to use other image instead, like this: $("#big_img").draggable({ helper: return $(" "); }); I just need to center it to the mouse cursor, but that I think won't be a problem. Then, removing the dropped element won't be a problem either. So, I won't need to restore the image as it is not really moving. :) If you have another alternative, I will be pleased to read it.
