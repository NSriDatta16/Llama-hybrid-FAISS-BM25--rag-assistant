getFilename function - Manifest File for cache

I'm following an tutorial in Johnathan Stark's Building iPhone app book. It's teaching how to use a manifest file to do offline storage. As you can see, it's searching all the directories and outputting the file names. My question is about the 0 and the 1 in this line getFilename(), 0, 1 I know what getFilename does, but what is the 0 and the 1 doing? Thanks for your help. IsFile() && $file != "./manifest.php" && substr($file->getFilename(), 0, 1) != ".") { echo $file . "\n"; $hashes.= md5_file($file); } } echo "# Hash: " . md5($hashes) . "\n";
