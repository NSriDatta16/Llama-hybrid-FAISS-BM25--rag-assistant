What are the Advantages of R over Python in Statistics?

So I'm a budding quant, but came from an Economics background so what I learned first was R and, of course, have fallen in love ever since. However, I recently started doing research on why Python seems to be more valued in the finance industry, and based on many stack exchange questions (which I provide for context: here , here , and a reddit thread here ), determined that, essentially , Python has two advantages: more robust integration with other languages and tools (C, VBA, etc.) bit faster when it comes to overall statistical analysis However, R also has its clear Pros, which seem to be superior visual representation of data (ggplot2) access to cutting edge statistical and numerical methods What I am interested in is the latter ; however, I can't find too much research on what specific analysis R can do that Python can't. Would the more advanced statisticians and analysts here weigh in on this? I know Python has access to Tensorflow for deep learning and an advantage there, but are there any non-parametric analyses or non-linear models that Python won't have access to for the foreseeable future?
