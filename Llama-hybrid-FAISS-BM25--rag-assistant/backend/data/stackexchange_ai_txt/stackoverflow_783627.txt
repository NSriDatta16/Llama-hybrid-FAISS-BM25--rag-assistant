I'm currently working with a customer who is in the process of standardizing on VB.NET. The main reason is, as you mentioned, the fact that the majority of the employees have 10+ years of experience with VB and COM. They feel that going to VB.NET makes the most sense as a career path, even though they're well aware that very little of their existing knowledge base can be leveraged going forward. Given this fact, they also considered moving to C#, which indeed seems to be the most used language on the .NET platform today. However, given the great amount of new knowledge they already have to learn in order to start using .NET, they preferred to go for a language with a familiar synthax. In my opinion this proves exactly the purpose of VB.NET. That is to help bring the large base of VB developers in the world over to .NET, giving them the ability to use a language that "feels" familiar to them. Also, the backwards compatibility layer built in VB.NET makes it possible to port existing (large) applications written in VB to new platform one piece at a time, while keeping them running.
