It depends on the algorithm you choose to avoid collisions. If your implementation uses separate chaining then the worst case scenario happens where every data element is hashed to the same value (poor choice of the hash function for example). In that case, data lookup is no different from a linear search on a linked list i.e. O(n). However, the probability of that happening is negligible and lookups best and average cases remain constant i.e. O(1).
