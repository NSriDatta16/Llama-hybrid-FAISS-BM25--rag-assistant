Difference between consistent and unbiased estimator

I have a problem where I have to think of an example to explain a practical example of consistency and unbiased. The example I thought of is the sample mean. Consistency is when the estimator (sample mean) reaches the population mean when the sample size becomes infinity. Unbiasedness is when the estimator (sample mean) will on average equal to the population mean for any sample size. Is my analogy correct here?
