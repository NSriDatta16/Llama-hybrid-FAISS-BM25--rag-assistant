How to modify Presicion and recall of GLM (Logit) in R?

I fit a logistic regression model with an unbalanced population in R. The problem that I am getting is I have 0.4 for precision and 0.0018 for recall, so I want to modify the threshold in order to get close both indicators (precision and recall) Do you have any function in R to modify the cutoff? I have seen some work arounds in Python, but the code that I need is in R.
