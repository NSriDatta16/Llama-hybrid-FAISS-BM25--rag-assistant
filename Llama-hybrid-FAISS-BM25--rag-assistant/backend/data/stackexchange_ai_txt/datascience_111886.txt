Best Python Library for Spiking Neural Networks?

I'm trying to experiment with Spiking Neural Networks and I'm wanting to use a high-level programming language like Python. I've come across some libraries, i.e., snnTorch , Brian 2 , ANNarchy , BindsNET and so on. What is the best library? Is there a detailed list / comparison somewhere?
