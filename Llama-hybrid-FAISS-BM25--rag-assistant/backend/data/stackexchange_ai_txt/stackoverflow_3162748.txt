jQuery global events and performance?

I was in search of a way to show a status indicator using jQuery and I found a solution in the jQuery Cookbook, it showed this solution (function($) { $(document).ready(function() { $('#ajaxStatus') .ajaxStart(function() { $(this).show(); }) .ajaxStop(function() { $(this).hide(); }); ..... })(jQuery); then it cautioned, If you experience performance issues in your application, it may be because of the cost of event propagation if there is a significantly large number of elements. In this case, setting global to false may give you a performance improvement. So first should I use the solution showed above and will it be a performance issue as my site and js code gets larger and larger? Should I avoid jQuery global events, just turn it off like the paragraph says? Lastly, how do you guys show a simple indicator while an ajax request is being performed?
