Unit of Measure Conversion Library

What is the best/most elegant way to abstract out the conversion of units of measures in the client, based on a user-preferred unit of measure setting? For example, let's say user A's preferred unit of measure is "metric", while user's B's preference is "imperial". Now lets say I've calculated the area of something in meters squared. When I go to display the value I need to use different conversion factors for each user (eg, "1 meter = 1.09361 yards"). Or say I've calculated the fluid volume in mL . User B's view will get calculated using the conversion "236.588237 mL = 1 US cup". Is there an existing javascript library that anyone here knows about that handles these trivial UOM conversions?
