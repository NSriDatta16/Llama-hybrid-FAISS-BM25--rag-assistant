iPhone Keyboard key value return

I would like to know if a method like touchesBegan for touches Event exists for the iPhone keyboard. I mean just how to know when I press a key, which value is it. (Don't display it on UITextfield or UILabel but display it with an NSLog for example). Is there any way?
