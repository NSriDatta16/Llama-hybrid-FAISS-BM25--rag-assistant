It is often remarked that clusters should be modelled with random intercepts when we can consider the clusters to be samples from a wider population of such clusters. However, this is just one of several criteria to be used when deciding whether to model a factor as fixed or random. Others include: - the number of levels of the factor - whether there is interest in the "effect" of the factor itself With 5 team s on average per division, and with 33 division s, the first of these is not an issue. As for the second, nothing in the OP suggests that the "effects" of team and division are of interest. I see nothing wrong in fitting a mixed model to these data, with team nested within division and computing a variance partition coefficient (which is stated as an objective of the study).
