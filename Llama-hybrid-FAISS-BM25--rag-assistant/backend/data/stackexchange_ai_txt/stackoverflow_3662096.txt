WPF FlowDocument Binding

I am using Microsoft's XAML/HTML converter to convert HTML from a database into a XAML string. The Microsoft converter seems to be formatting the text correctly, but I'm having trouble binding the output to a XAML object. For example, using the following HTML: Hello world. I will get the XAML output: Hello world. Assuming the HTML is coming into the WPF application as the "Text" property of a database object, I then use Binding and Converters like so: Unfortunately, this just prints the XAML to the page and doesn't parse it. I'm assuming this is because I'm binding to the TextBlock and that's the expected outcome. My question is how do I bind this output a FlowDocument related control like a Paragraph, Run, Section, or whatever? Note: I realize there a quite a few threads dedicated to converting HTML to XAML. I have referenced most of them, but they are all lacking on this specific step. Any help or links are appreciated, thanks in advance.
