Access a private variable of the super() class in Java - JChart2D

I have extended a class in Java that has a private variable that I want to get the value of before it is changed. There are no methods to access this variable in the super class. I have tried super().m_zoomArea (the variable is in the ZoomableChart class of jChart2D). The variable is updated when the mouseDragged method is called. I have overridden this method and would like to get the value of the variable before it is updated.
