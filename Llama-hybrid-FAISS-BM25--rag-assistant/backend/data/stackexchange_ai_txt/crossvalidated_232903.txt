In neural network, what is the good way to represent ordinal/ratio data such as age, hour, day of week?

I know that age is often represented as a numerical feature. For example in linear regression, it is common to use one single independent variable (IV) to represent it. However, one single IV cannot capture non-linear relationship. In some other models, such as factorization machines, it is advised to use dummy variable in order to capture feature interaction. So what is the good way to represent ordinal/ratio data in neural network, especially deep learning models? Numerical feature? Dummy variable?
