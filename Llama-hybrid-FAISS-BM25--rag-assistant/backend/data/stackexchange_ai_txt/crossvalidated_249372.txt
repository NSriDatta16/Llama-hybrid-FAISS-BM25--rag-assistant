You could proceed as follows: Change training input: Say, a shipment took 3 days to deliver and day 2 was a holiday. You could change the target variable in your training set from 3 to 2 (and similar for all other cases). You fit the model without having to think about holidays. Adjust predictions: When your predictions are produced you adjust them by adding back holidays: If the predicted delivery time is 5 days and there is a holiday on day 2 and 4 you change the prediction from 5 to 7. This eliminates the need for feature engineering. Of course, this assumes holidays have no other effects on the delivery time (which I think is reasonable).
