Ordinal logistic regression with non-negative independent variables

If I understand things correctly, we want to look at $log(p/(1-p))$ since we want the independent variables to be able to take on any real value. But what if you know your independents can never be negative? Wouldn't it make more sense to simply look at $p/(1-p)$ in that case? (if so, how would the syntax for such a model look in R?)
