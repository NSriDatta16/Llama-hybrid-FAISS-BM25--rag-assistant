How to change the default parameters for newfit() in MATLAB?

I am using net = newfit(in,out,lag(j),{'tansig','tansig'}); to generate a new neural network. The default value of the number of validation checks is 6 . I am training a lot of networks and this is taking a lot of time. I guess it doesn't matter if my results are a bit less accurate if they can be made considerably faster. How can I train faster? I believe one of the ways might be to reduce the value of the number of validation checks. How can I do that (in code, not using GUI) Is there some other way to increase speed. As I said, the increase in speed may be at a little loss of accuracy.
