Which attribute selection method to use in clustering in R

I have a number of time series with around 5000 rows. Each row has 6 attributes and a class assigned. My problem is to determine which attributes are more effective in the classification using R, preferably (Similar to ANOVA analysis in regression where some of the variables are determined to be insignificant). The attributes are qualitative as well as quantitive. How to handle qualitative ones? And more importantly how to determine which attributs are effective in classes?
