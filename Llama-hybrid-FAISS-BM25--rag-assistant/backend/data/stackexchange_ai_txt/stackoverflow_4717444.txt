You could bind the data to a parent element that is a relevant container for each value. So for example, say you have a #dragAndDropContainer, in which there are many drag and droppable items, then as soon as a drag event fires (i.e. a drag begins), you could (in jQuery), execute: $('#dragAndDropContainer').data('lastDragged', $(this).attr('id')); And then just query $('#dragAndDropContainer').data('lastDragged') every time you need to.
