It's hard to tell what might be wrong without knowing what your data actually is. I suspect that it might be organised into rows like a bitmap, but sometimes bitmap format data requires that rows be a multiple of 4 bytes in length (with unused padding at the end, see BMP file format ). If this is the case, your y value might become larger than you expect. You may need to take such padding into account.
