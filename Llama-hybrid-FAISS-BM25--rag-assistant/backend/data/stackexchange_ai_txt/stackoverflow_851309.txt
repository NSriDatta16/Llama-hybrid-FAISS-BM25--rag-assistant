If you are into an organized style of reading, and prefer an good ol' book, start here. http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Firefox-Building-Internet-Applications/dp/0596102437 It will get you started on the basics on XUL, which is in turn used to build the addons. If you have a touch in javascript, it will definitely help you. Else, Start here. https://developer.mozilla.org/En You can start learning what all you will need to start developing firefox addons, or even firefox itself. If you are fairly proficient in Javascript and DOM, then, just jump here. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developing_add-ons . The only problem might be, they are as not comprehensive for a newbie programmer. If you have some professional background in programming, and can pick up a language from sample codes, then start here. But I would definitely suggest a well organized book, like I mentioned above. There are very few XUL book in the market, this was my first google result, so just linked it here. Search for XUL on http://www.amazon.com/ .Choose one, atleast a book published after 2006-07. [edit] Just found out this good article http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_development
