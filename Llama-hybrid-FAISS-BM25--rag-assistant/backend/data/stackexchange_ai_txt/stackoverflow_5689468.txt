If you are using the POCOs as an external data contract, you may want your model to you different entities/classes in order to prevent loose coupling between your external contracts and how your application works. On retrieval of a data contract, you could retrieve the matching entity from the context, then inject values from the data contract into the entity/entities, using a tool such as ValueInjecter.
