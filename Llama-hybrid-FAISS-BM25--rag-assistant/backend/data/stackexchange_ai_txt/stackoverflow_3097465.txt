Do you honestly expect to have a sort_order value that maxes out at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 ?! Assuming zero based, INT is still pretty large at a max of 2,147,483,647... Depends on your queries, but I'd look at using it in a covering index before a stand alone one. MySQL has a space limit on indexes , you're likely to hit the ceiling if you define an index per column: Prefix support and lengths of prefixes (where supported) are storage engine dependent. For example, a prefix can be up to 1000 bytes long for MyISAM tables, and 767 bytes for InnoDB tables.
