How to retrieve XML into Oracle PL/SQL via an HTTP Post transaction?

I'm trying to implement the "blog this" function from Flickr using the BloggerAPI to my pl/sql based CMS. When Flickr sends me the posting transaction, the HTTP transaction looks like this: POST /pls/website/!pkg.procAPI HTTP/1.1 Host: www.mydomain.com Accept: */* User-Agent: Flickr Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 1220 Expect: 100-continue blogger.newPost NO_APP_KEY 1 markj markj This is a test post from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/r/testpost&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;flickr&quot; src=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/images/flickr_logo_blog.gif&quot; width=&quot;41&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a fancy photo sharing thing. 1 But my server is responding with an HTTP-400 Bad Request and the error message is "Signature Mismatch or Missing '='" and my pl/sql procedure never gets a chance to process the request. I suspect that the flexible parameter passing is getting hosed when looking at the message, but I don't know how else The process to get the available blogs seems to work ok, but the content of the request doesn't have all the html entities as part of the message: POST /pls/website/!pkg.procAPI HTTP/1.1 Host: www.mydomain.com Accept: */* User-Agent: Flickr Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 304 blogger.getUsersBlogs NO-APP-KEY mark markj Is there a way to get the xml data from the body of the http request directly? or some other approach I'm over looking? Thanks, Mark.
