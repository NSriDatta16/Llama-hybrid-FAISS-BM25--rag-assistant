How to make the effects of jQuery's $(element).css() persistent?

For example, with a font-size switcher/button, if I use $('#container p').css('font-size', '24px'); it works as expected, but if I later add paragraph elements to the container (via ajax, etc), they are not styled with the updated font-size. I am aware that this is the intended behavior of the .css() method. I am simply asking: What's the proper approach to changing a style for a CSS selector, and making those styles persistent?
