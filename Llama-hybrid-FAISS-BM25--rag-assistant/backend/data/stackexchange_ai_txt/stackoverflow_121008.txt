Perhaps you should compute reputation on something based on the ratio of votes:views. This might discourage the populism going on and focus people's attention to providing answers across a breadth of less popular but still valid and relevant questions - questions that might actually be of interest to someone. I would actually like to do some editing and tidying up of posts - Many posts could be improved by a bit of editorial work, filling out detail or providing links to other sources. However, without a dedicated exercise in karma-whoring (on what would be off-topic posts for me) it's very unlikely I would ever my rep up to the level where I have permissions to do this in my real areas of expertise where I might actually have something of value to say.
