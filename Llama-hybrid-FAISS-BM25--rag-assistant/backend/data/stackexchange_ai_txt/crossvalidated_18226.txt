I will not re-iterate the very good points already made in other answers, but would like to add a somewhat different perspective. What I say here is somewhat philosophical, not necessarily drawn from professional experience, but from a mixed background in the physical sciences, complex systems theory and machine learning (and, I have to admit, largely undergraduate statistics). One substantial difference between machine learning and classical statistical approaches (that I am aware of) is in the set of assumptions that are made. In classical statistics, many assumptions about the underlying processes and distributions are fixed and tend to be taken for granted. In machine learning, however, these assumptions are explicitly chosen for each model, resulting in a much broader set of possibilities and perhaps a greater awareness of the assumptions being made. We are seeing more and more that systems in the world around us behave in complex, non-linear ways, and that many processes do not obey assumptions of normality etc. typically present in classical statistics. I would argue that, due to the flexibility and variety of model assumptions, machine learning approaches will often lead to a more robust model in such cases. There are strong model assumptions built into phrases such as "magnitude of effect", "causal relation", and "degree to which one variable affects the outcome". In a complex system (such as an economy), these assumptions will only be valid within a certain window of possible system states. With some observables and processes, this window may be large, leading to relatively robust models. With others it may be small or even empty. Perhaps the greatest danger is the middle ground: a model may appear to be working, but when the system shifts, fail in a sudden and surprising ways. Machine learning is no panacea. Rather, I see it as a search for new ways of gleaning meaning from our observations, seeking new paradigms that are needed if we are to deal effectively with the complexity we are starting to perceive in the world around us.
