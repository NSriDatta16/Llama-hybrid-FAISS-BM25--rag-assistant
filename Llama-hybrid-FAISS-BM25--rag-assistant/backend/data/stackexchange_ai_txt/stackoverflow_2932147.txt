It depends on how much you are actually updating on the screen as part of your code, (i.e. number of cells updated), and how many sheets are there, how many sheets/cells refer to sheet your code is updating and how many formulas are present in the whole workbook. Each time you change some thing in the sheet, Excel re-calculates all formulas. So if your code is not updating too many sheets/cells but your workbook has many formulas then turning off the screen update might not help you at all. One more thing to consider for perfomance is Calculation property, set this to xlCalculationManual to turnn off the auto recals and turn it back to xlCalculationAutomatic at the end. Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual One more thing to conside is Events, if one or more of those sheets have Worksheet_Chnage or Worksheet_Calculate event handlers each change that your code is doing will trigger them and your code need to wait till they return. So turn it off during your code. Application.EnableEvents = False In most of my code, I usually use this On Error GoTo lblError Dim bEvents As Boolean, iCalc As Integer, bScrnUpd As Boolean bEvents = Application.EnableEvents iCalc = Application.Calculation bScrnUpd = Application.ScreenUpdating Application.EnableEvents = False Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual Application.ScreenUpdating = False '-----------------------My code Application.EnableEvents = bEvents Application.Calculation = iCalc Application.ScreenUpdating = bScrnUpd Exit Sub 'reset them even if you are exiting due to error lblError: Application.EnableEvents = bEvents Application.Calculation = iCalc Application.ScreenUpdating = bScrnUpd Debug.print Err.Description
