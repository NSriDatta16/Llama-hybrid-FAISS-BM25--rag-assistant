The skewed data here is being normalised by adding one(one added so that the zeros are being transformed to one as log of 0 is not defined) and taking natural log. The data can be nearly normalised using the transformation techniques like taking square root or reciprocal or logarithm. Now, why it is required. Actually many of the algorithms in data assume that the data science is normal and calculate various stats assuming this. So the more the data is close to normal the more it fits the assumption.
