How do I call a JavaScript function on page load?

Traditionally, to call a JavaScript function once the page has loaded, you'd add an onload attribute to the body containing a bit of JavaScript (usually only calling a function) When the page has loaded, I want to run some JavaScript code to dynamically populate portions of the page with data from the server. I can't use the onload attribute since I'm using JSP fragments, which have no body element I can add an attribute to. Is there any other way to call a JavaScript function on load? I'd rather not use jQuery as I'm not very familiar with it.
