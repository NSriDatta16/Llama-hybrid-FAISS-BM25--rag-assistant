Depends on what you mean by efficient . If you want state-of-the-art predictive performance, you should dig into deep learning, convolutional networks and the like. Those techniques are very computationally intensive, though. So if by efficient you mean low training complexity, you want to be looking at the opposite end of the spectrum.
