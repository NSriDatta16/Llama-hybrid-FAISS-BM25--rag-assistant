MySQL can certainly match or beat Oracle in speed. I've done it numerous times myself. Ok, so I had to use various table types like black hole, merge, innodb, and myisam in just the right laces. And it took me a few days to get everything working just right. The Oracle DBA got things working in an hour or two. MySQL is fine for 98% of the sites out there, maybe more. But it is fairly easy to bring it to a crawl without a lot of data if you don't know what you are doing. Oracle is quite a bit harder to bring to a crawl, but it can still be done. I've worked with both with datasets in the hundreds of millions of records (tiny by some measures). MySQL takes quite a bit more attention. No database can scale indefinitely, which is why nosql "databases" are becoming so popular. I think the real question is if MySQL is "good enough" for what you need to do. The price is certainly right. The same could be said about PHP. Why does Facebook use MySQL? Could you imagine what it would cost them to buy enough Oracle licenses!? It's good enough.
