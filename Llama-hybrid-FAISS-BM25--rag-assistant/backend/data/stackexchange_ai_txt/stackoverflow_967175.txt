In the 1960's, data management systems were invented/conceived/elaborated which were all based on the idea that data can be organized hierarchically. IMS being one of them. The fallacies/deficiencies/shortcomings of those systems immediately became clear to anyone intensively using them (for one, they tend to lead to 'query biases' : in hierarchical systems, it is often easy to query which contracts exist for a given customer, and at the same time almost impossible to query which customers are involved in a given contract). All those deficiencies have ultimately led to the invention of the relational model. So if you want to know whether XML is suitable as a solution for ANY DATA MANAGEMENT PROBLEM WHATSOEVER, ask yourself this : "is XML hierarchical in nature or not ?". The success of XML in the marketplace only proves the correctness of the observation that "those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it".
