Hehe, this is probably not very helpful, but... neither. :) I would have trunk at the very top level, with the projects and solutions organised underneath that alongside each other in a flat structure . Then I would use the svn:externals property on the solution directories to pull in the appropriate projects to the correct location in each developer's working copy. The reason I'd organise things this way is that it gives you the benefits from both your option A and your option B. So, if developers only want to check out a single solution, they are free to do so. Likewise they can also check out the entire trunk if they'd rather do that instead (and they are able to do so without getting tags and branches). Also, this approach of having a single trunk makes it far easier to tag or branch the entire repo, if ever you need to do that.
