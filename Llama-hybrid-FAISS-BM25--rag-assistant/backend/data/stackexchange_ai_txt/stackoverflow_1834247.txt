Can I use the xmodem protocol with PySerial?

I have a working connection with my serial device via PySerial, but I also want to transfer files via the xmodem protocol as part of my program. Which would be the most platform-neutral way to do this? Worst case, I could close() my serial.Serial object in Python and use subprocess to call upon /usr/bin/sb , but that seems inelegant. I'm currently on Ubuntu 9.10 and am using a USB-TTY adapter. Any ideas?
