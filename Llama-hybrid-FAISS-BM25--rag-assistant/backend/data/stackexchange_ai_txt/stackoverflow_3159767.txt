I am working on a website that does exactly that (sorry for the non-english stuff): http://moveit.canassa.com/cartao/4/ The link is now broken but here is a jsFiddle that shows what I am talking about: http://jsfiddle.net/canassa/Z9N3L/ The "toy" div is using a position absolute: .toy{ width: 100px; height: 25px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; } The problem with the position absolute is that the toy will be relative to page and not the "wall" container, in order to fix that you must make the wall container relative: #wall{ position: relative; overflow: hidden; } The overflow:hidden is also a nice trick that I found. It makes the draggable objects go "under" the wall container. There is no big secret to make it draggable, using jQuery: // Creates a toy div inside the wall $(MV.wallId).append(' '); box = this.getBox(); // return the "toy" that I've just created. $('#' + this.getId()).draggable(); // make it draggable
