How to distinguish between User Control load on form and load when runtime

I created a user control using C# for windows form application. This user control has some properties. In runtime, if the user does not enter values for this properties I want to show a message box and exit the application. The problem is when I write the checking code in the Load event of User Control. When I drag & drop it on the form the message box will appear. private void UserControl1_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e) { if (_getFirstPageArgument==null || _getFirstPageArgument.Length==0) { throw new Exception("Some Message"); } } How do I distinguish between load on the form and load on run time?
