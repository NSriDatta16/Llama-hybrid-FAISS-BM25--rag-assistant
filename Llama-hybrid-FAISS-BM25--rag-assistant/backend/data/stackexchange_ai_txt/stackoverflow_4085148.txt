I suggest you use gdb to debug your code and check where the segmentation fault is arising. That will give you a good hint of were to start looking, even though you don't remember to have done any modification. There is plenty documentation on the web. These are the basics: shell> gdb myprogram gdb> backtrace #lists the steps until the segmentation fault arises gdb> select 2 #You can select any step you want (e.g. 2) gdb> print number #print variables to hack around There are a lot of features for gdb. I think this will give you a hint quickly. Don't forget to use a version control system the next time. It's a safe and nice way of having your code organized and clean, and off course!, to avoid these terrible accidents. (SVN or GIT are cool enough)
