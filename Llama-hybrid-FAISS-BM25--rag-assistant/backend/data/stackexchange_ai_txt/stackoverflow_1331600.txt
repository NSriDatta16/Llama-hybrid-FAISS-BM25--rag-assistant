A simple but not perfect solution would be to sum the individual components (RGB) and the larger this value the 'lighter the color'. So for a high value you could use black as the foreground, and for a low value, use white. You could then improve this method, making specific cases for greyscale colors (R = G = B), which, except for very dark grey, won't display white text well. Edit: This of course means you need to know the format of RGB storage in your hex value, standard 24bpp storage is 0x00RRGGBB for the 8 hex digits.
