The default is readable, usable, but does not adhere to or suggest any coding standard. I think the reason IntelliJ doesn't use the Javadoc tags in the default, is so that it avoids possible interference with any coding/javadoc standards that might exist in development shops. It should be obvious to the user if the default needs to be modified to something more appropriate. Where I am working, the use of author tags is discouraged, for various reasons.
