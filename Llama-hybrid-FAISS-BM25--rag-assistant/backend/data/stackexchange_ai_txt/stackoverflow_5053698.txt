Problem with Ganymed API

I am writing SSH Client code using Ganymed API's. When I am trying to execute a command remotely through my code it showing nothing and Program execution is not stopping. My putty giving correct output for same command. When I am issuing some basic commands it working fine. I am doing this in windows environment. I also tried using JSCH API's. But it also giving me same behavior. Can any one tell me what is wrong and any suggestions please. Thanks, Narendra
