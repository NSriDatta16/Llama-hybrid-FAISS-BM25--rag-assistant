MySQL AVG() value not resetting on every row

I have this very weird results when trying to fetch the AVG() field from my "reponse" field. Query : SELECT AVG(Reponse.note) as noteMoyenne, Categorie.titre, Autorisation.typeEvaluateur, COUNT(DISTINCT Autorisation.id) as nbEvaluateur FROM reponses as Reponse, categories as Categorie, questions as Question, autorisations as Autorisation WHERE Reponse.question_id = Question.id AND Question.categorie_id = Categorie.id AND Reponse.note != 0 AND Reponse.evaluation_id = $id AND Autorisation.evaluation_id = $id AND Autorisation.complete = 1 GROUP BY Categorie.titre, Autorisation.typeEvaluateur ORDER BY Categorie.id; I would expect the results to be something like : noteMoyenne Cat typeEvaluateur nbEvaluateur 4.0225 Cat1 TypeA 3 **1.6425 Cat1 TypeB 1 3.4123 Cat2 TypeA 5 .... But it seems like the average is kept for the every single categories and then reset when there's a new Category. Actual data returned : noteMoyenne Cat typeEvaluateur nbEvaluateur 4.0225 Cat1 TypeA 3 **4.0225 Cat1 TypeB 1 3.4123 Cat2 TypeA 5 .... Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm kinda lost with this. Thanks!
