XML Element with Variable Attributes

I"m pulling down data from GetListItems using SP Web Services. I want as much data as possible since I'm storing that off into a local XML document. I'm also trying to create a TSV from the data. The returned XML is something like this: There's actually closer to 60+ attributes per row, and the problem is the returned attributes per "row" aren't consistent (e.g. some have 60, some have 67, some have 59, etc). If I explicitly ask for the attributes by name, it's not a big deal: foreach (System.Xml.XmlNode listItem in nodeListItems) { if (listItem.Name == "rs:data") { for (int i = 0; i etc, etc. I tried parsing through all the attributes using something like for (int k = 0; k to get the possible attributes, but I realized it would only pick up the first row, which may or may not have the maximum attributes possible. I thought about parsing through the entire thing. Though it's unlikely, I also have no real way of knowing if the "biggest count" row contains every combination. Is there a more elegant solution to with "null" (missing) attributes and determining all the attributes to create an acceptable "column list"?
