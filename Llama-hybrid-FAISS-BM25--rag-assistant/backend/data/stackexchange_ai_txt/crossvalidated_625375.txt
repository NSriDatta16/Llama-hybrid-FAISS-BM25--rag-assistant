Can MDP or reinforcement learning method be used on an And-Or graph?

I want to perform a pathfinding task in a graph using RL, I consider each node of the graph as a state, but there are and/or relations between these states.So I'm wondering if I can still use the traditional MDP or RL methods in that case, and if not how can I improve it, or is there any other way? (Besides AO*)
