Do you need to seasonally adjust covariates prior to ARIMAX modelling?

I found lots of answers in regards to how handle seasonality in dependent variable (time series) though canâ€™t find a definitive answer if we need to seasonally adjust the covariates as well? My main focus would be ARIMAX and Multiple OLS
