Statistical significance test using python

I’m new to statistics and data science. I’m working on a dataset where I found that the energy consumption during peak period of covid (mar 2020 to sep 2020) is 7% greater than the last year (mar 2019 to sep 2020) power consumption for a particular group of customers. My question is how should I test for significance? Means how to find out whether that 7% change is significant enough or not? Are there any pre built libraries in python to do this? If not how should I achieve this using python?
