Computationally simple pseudo-Gaussian distribution with varying mean and standard deviation?

This picture from Wikipedia has a nice example of the sort of functions I'd ideally like to generate: Right now I'm using the Irwin-Hall Distribution, which is more or less a polynomial approximation of the Gaussian distribution...basically, you use uniform random number generator and iterate it x times, and take the average. The more iterations, the more like a Gaussian Distribution it is. It's pretty nice; however I'd like to be able to have one where I can vary the mean. For example, let's say I wanted a number between the range 0 and 10, but around 7. Like, the mean (if I repeated this function multiple times) would turn out to be 7, but the actual range is 0-10. Is there one I should look up, or should I work on doing some fancy maths with standard Gaussian distributions?
