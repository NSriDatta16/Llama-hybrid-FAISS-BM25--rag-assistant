Why are analytical solutions possible for some optimization problems but not possible for others?

For example, an analytical solution is possible for linear regression (i.e. the normal equations) but it is not possible for logistic regression but logistic regression can be optimized with gradient descent. However, both solutions involve taking the gradient wrt to the weights. With linear regression the gradient is set to zero and we solve for w. But with logistic regression the gradient is used for updating the weights in gradient descent. So is the real reason that logistic regression cannot be solved analytically because it is impossible to solve for w if we set the gradient equal to zero?
