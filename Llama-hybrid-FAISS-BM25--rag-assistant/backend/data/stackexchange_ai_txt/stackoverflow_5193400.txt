Given your constraints you could try zipping the XML before inserting into the DB as binary. This should significantly reduce the storage cost of this data. You mention this is bad for performance, how often are you reading from this snapshot table? If this is just stored it should only effect performance when writing. If you are often reading this are you sure the performance issue is with the datastoreage not the parsing of 10MB of XML?
