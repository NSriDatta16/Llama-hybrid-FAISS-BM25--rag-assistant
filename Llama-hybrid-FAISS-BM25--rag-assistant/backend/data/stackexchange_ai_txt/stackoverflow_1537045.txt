There are "standards" and there are "standards". Most folks mostly mean that a standard is passed by a standards-writing organization: ISO, ECMA, EIA, etc. Lawyers call these De Jure Standards. There's the force of law. Further, there are "De Facto Standards". Some folks, also, corrupt the word by adding "Industry Standard", or " vendorname Standard". This is just meaningless marketing noise. A De Facto Standard is something that's standardized in practice (because everyone does it and agrees they're doing it that way) but it is not backed by some standards organization. Python has a De Facto Standard, not a De Jure Standard.
