Spacy custom POS tagging for medical concepts

We are a group of doctors trying to use linguistic features of "Spacy", especially the part of speech tagging to show relationships between medical concepts like: 'Femoral artery pseudoaneurysm as in ==> "femoral artery" ['Anatomical Location'] --> and "pseudoaneurysm" ['Pathology'] We are new to NLP and spacy, can someone with experience with NLP and Spacy explain if this is a good approach to show these relationships in medical documents? If not what are the other alternative methods? Many thanks!
