You are right, while even the credible sources sometimes claim differently , the correct formula is $$ \hat p = \frac{1}{mn} \sum_{i=1}^m x_i = \overbrace{\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m}^\text{we have m trials} \overbrace{\frac{x_i}{n}}^{\substack{\text{proportion of successes} \\ \text{in single Bernoulli trial}}} $$ since if you calculated ordinary arithmetic mean of $X$, you'd get average number of successes in $n$ trials, i.e. $E(X) = n \hat p$.
