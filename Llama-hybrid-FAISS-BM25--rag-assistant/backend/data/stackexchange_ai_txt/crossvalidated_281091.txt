Regression with review scores containing excess zeroes

Here is an imaginary problem, representing something I am dealing with right now. We have a set of movies with averages scores ranging from 0 to 10, such that the target is a continuous variable. By default all movies were given a score of 0. Over time some of the movies have been given a score, while others have yet to receive one. The distribution might look like so: Clearly there is some movies, that still need a 'true' score, and we want to predict that score, given the actually scored ones. However , we have no way to separate 0 target samples that were defaulted to 0, from those that have actually been scored a 0. As such, by training a regressor on the full data set, would incorrectly result in a skew towards 0 scores. But fitting a regressor on only non-zero targets, would likewise skew the regressor towards non-zero scores. I can think of two approaches to deal with this problem: Filter out 0 defaulted movies by first classifying 'scored' / 'not scored', hopefully separating default 0's from scored 0's and then fitting a regressor on the 'scored' classified samples only. Ignoring 0 scores all together when fitting the regressor, hoping the model extends nicely to 0 scores. However I do not feel confident in either. What I think I am looking for, is a regressor that can deal with 0 values explicitly, so that a bias can be added towards the true distribution.
