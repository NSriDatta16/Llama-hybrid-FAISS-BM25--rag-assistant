First note that if you know the percentage and the denominator, then you also know the numerator. So, for example, if you know for a specific class (in your example, the class is state) that the ratio of positive to negative classes in a class is $0.6$, and the denominator of the ratio is $10$, then you immediately know that there are 6 positive (y = 1) cases in that class. 4 negative (y = 0) cases in that class. With this information you can, in principle, create a new dataset expanding your grouped data. In this example you would end up with 6 rows for the class with $y = 1$. 4 rows for the class with $y = 0$. Now you can use this new dataset to fit a logistic regression. In practice, you simply observe that each row in this imaginary expanded data set contributes one term to the loss function $$ L = \sum_i y_i \log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i) $$ and each of the expanded rows in a class where $y = 1$ contributes the same amount , with the same thing holding for the rows where $y = 0$. So, instead of actually physically creating the expanded data set, we can just apply integer weights to the terms in our loss function $$ L = \sum_i w_i y_i \log(p_i) + w_i' (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i) $$ where the $w$s and $w'$s are the number of positive and negative cases in each class.
