Analysis of accuracy data in R with 4 possible answer choices

I am working on my Master's thesis in linguistics where I employ a picture selection task as a secondary (comprehension) task within a self-paced-reading online experiment. Participants have the choice of selecting 1 of 4 available pictures (there is 1 correct target that matches a previous sentence, 1 competitor that is somewhat similar to the target but not really an accurate choice and 2 competitors that are completely unrelated and would yield an obvious incorrect answer). I am using this accuracy measurement in an exploratory manner and I am not sure what statistical method would be the best fit in this case. From what I have read, using logistic regression (generalized linear model) seems to be recommended, but I am not sure this is the way to go. Just to recap: a target selection would be an obvious correct choice, a competitor selection would not exactly be inaccurate, but informative that participants ignore the depicted difference between the target and the competitor, while the distractors can be thought to be a completely inaccurate response. I would be very, very grateful for your advice. It is important to me to use an accurate way of analyzing things and since I do not have much experience with statistics, your help is very much appreciated.
