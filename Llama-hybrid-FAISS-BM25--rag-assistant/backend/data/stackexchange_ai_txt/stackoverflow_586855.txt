I think this happens because of the outer tag which doesn't do anything useful in FF anyway. You can easily verify this theory by omitting it for testing. If I'm correct, I suggest you use SWFObject to render the embedding code. Alternatively, you could add some CSS trickery to hide that border in FF.
