Looks like you need to get a better book! In this code argv is a pointer with no storage allocated to it and pointing at random memory (or probably NULL ). When you dereference it with argv[0] = ... , your code ends up trying to write to random memory. Your variable declaration should be something more like: char *argv[3], *envp[1];
