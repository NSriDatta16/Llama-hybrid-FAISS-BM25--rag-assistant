How do I return an entity that is a query of multiple tables

I have a web service that uses the Entity Framework for storage and exposes a public API for CRUD operations. If I have an entity such as User which has a 1 to many relationship with a Car entity, how do I easily return in my web service method of GetUser(int userId) a instance of user that looks like this: public class User{ string Id; IEnumberable Cars; } Does this work by default within the entity framework, because I assume that the Cars property is lazy when using it on the server side.
