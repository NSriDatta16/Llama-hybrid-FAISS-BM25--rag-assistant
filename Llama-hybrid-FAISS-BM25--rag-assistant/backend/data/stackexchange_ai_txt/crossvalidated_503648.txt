isKL Divergence Asymmetry at Zero

So, I'm aware that the KL divergence is asymmetric, and furthermore that it has to be asymmetric in order to be compatible with Bayes' Law. But there's one particular asymmetry that confuses me. Let $$KL(P\Vert Q) = \sum_x P(x) \lg\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$ across whatever the domain of $P,Q$ is. Then if $P(x)$ goes to zero, the equation remains well defined; the contribution to $KL(P\Vert Q)$ tends smoothly to zero as well. But if $Q(x)$ goes to zero, the integrand diverges, and $KL(P\Vert Q)$ can explode. From the Bayesian perspective, though, these two cases should be symmetric. Certainly, if you start with an infinite certainty that something cannot occur ( $Q(x)=0$ ), no finite amount of evidence will ever convince you otherwise ( $KL(P\Vert Q)=\infty$ makes sense). But if you start with finite certainty, it should also take you an infinite amount of evidence to convince you that something is completely impossible ( $P(x)=0$ , but $KL(P\Vert Q)\neq\infty)$ . What am I missing here?
