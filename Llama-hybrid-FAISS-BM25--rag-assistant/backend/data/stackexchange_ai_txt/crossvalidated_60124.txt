Constructing a missing-dummy; why doesn't SPSS recognize the 'missings'?

A short question concerning the constructing of a 'missing-dummy', which I will consequently add to my logistic regression. This missing-dummy gives value '1' to the cases where data concerning a specific variable is missing and value '0' to the cases which have data. I've used this command in SPSS, but in some way the missing values are not recognized. ( recode v204 (-2 -1=1)(else=0) into authomis ). A cross-tabulation of v204 and authomis shows that the missing-dummy only has a '0'-category, regardless the fact that there are over 400 cases (on a total of 40.000) which have a missing on variable v204. Has this to do with how the missings are marked in variable v204? I can't think of any other reason. Hopefully you can. Thanks in advance.
