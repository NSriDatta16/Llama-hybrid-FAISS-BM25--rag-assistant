non flash multi file upload for php

looking into multi file - drag and drop - upload scripts. we were using swfupload until flash 10 destroyed it. the other options we are investigating are java and google gears. what would you recommend and do you know of libraries/examples/frameworks that support these options like the swfupload. thanks, Josh
