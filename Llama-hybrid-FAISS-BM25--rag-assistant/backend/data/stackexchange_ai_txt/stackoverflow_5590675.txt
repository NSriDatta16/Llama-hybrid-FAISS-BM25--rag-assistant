First case: this.c=a; This sets the c property of the object (that b is called on) to a reference to the function a . Any function can be called (even via a reference) using the () syntax, which is what alert(d.c()) does. Second case: this.c=a(); This calls a , and sets c to the result (i.e. return value) of a , which is the string "ok". Then, retrieving the value of c with alert(d.c) will yield the same result as your first example, but it is arrived at in fundamentally different ways. One way stores a reference to the function itself, and calls it when its value is needed, while the other calls the function right away and stores only the result for later retrieval.
