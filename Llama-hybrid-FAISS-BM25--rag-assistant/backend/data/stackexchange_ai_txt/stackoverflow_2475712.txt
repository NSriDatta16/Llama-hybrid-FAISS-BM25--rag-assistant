The compiler itself does the verification of the interface. TDD does the validation of the interface. You may want to check out code contracts in c# 4 as you are slightly bordering into that area in how you phrase the question. You seem to have bundled a few concepts together, and you are understandably confused. The short answer to your question is that you've probably misheard/misunderstood it. TDD will drive the evolution of the Interface. TDD tests the interface by verifying that coverage is achieved without involving the concrete types (the specific ones that implement the interface). I hope this helps.
