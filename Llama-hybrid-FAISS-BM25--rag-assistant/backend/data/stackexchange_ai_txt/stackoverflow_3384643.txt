How to build an undo storage with limit?

I want build a data structure to store limited undo buffer, take store 6 dict data for example with below pseudocode: rawdict1 = {1} buffer = [{1}] rawdict1 = {2} buffer = [{2}{1}] # {1} stored on the postion rawdict1 = {3} buffer = [{3}{2}{1}] ... rawdict1 = {5} buffer = [{5}{4}{3}{2}{1}] # max length limited to 5 rawdict1 = {6} buffer = [{6}{5}{4}{3}{2}] # {1} has been deleted because exceed the limit when I want to restore the rawdict1 later, I can use something looks like: rawdict1 = buffer[5] # restore the 5th dict. My question is, can existing buildin data type or standard library type can be used for such a purpose? And is it possible such a structure can store multi-types in one structure instance, say, if I want to store dict and self-defined class in one go? Thanks! Rgs, KC
