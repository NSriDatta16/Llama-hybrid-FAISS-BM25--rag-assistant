Look at 37signals and how nice their web UIs are (mostly HTML + AJAX). It's a good example of web applications that work. One of the things to remember are to make sure you don't break the web paradigm. If users want to see two things side by side, they should be able to duplicate the window and let the web browser do the windowing. For WPF, there are a lot of new visualization paradigms. You can find some examples on the sites for various control toolkit providers: Xceed , Telerik , Infragistics . They have demo programs for the different ways they help you organize screens in an application. When developing complex composite applications in WPF, you could also start at the Patterns and Practices Prism site. It's an InProgress set of practices for planning and developing complex composite (smart client style) applications in WPF.
