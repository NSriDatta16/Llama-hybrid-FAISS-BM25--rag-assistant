Automating Firefox configuration settings

During web development work, I need to be able to quickly switch various config settings in Firefox. In particular I need to be able to: 1) Switch off cookies 2) Switch off javascript 3) Switch my user agent (I have the user-agent switcher add-on installed) and then back again. Instead of doing this manually, it would be great if i could add a "macro" button to my toolbar that I could simply click to toggle the three settings above. Anyone know if this is possible? Btw - Firefox Profiles doesn't really cut it. You can't dynamically switch profiles within a specific Firefox instance, which I need to be able to do. Btw2 - I got excited when i saw Greasemonkey, Chicken Foot, but it looks like these can only automate browsing/DOM tasks, and not with firefox configuration settings. Thanks Richard.
