Simple introduction to MCMC with Dirichlet process prior?

I'm looking for a simple and easy to read introduction to using MCMC with a dirichlet process prior. Or perhaps using MCMC in any machine learning scenario, eg Gaussian Process. I've been circling around various papers and tutorials (Neal, Teh, Sahu, Ghahramani, Ferguson, Escobar and West, ... ), but I can't find anything that explains in straightforward procedural terms, specifying explicitly each equation I would need to implement MCMC for DP or GP. Edit: I got this far: my mcmc dp progress
