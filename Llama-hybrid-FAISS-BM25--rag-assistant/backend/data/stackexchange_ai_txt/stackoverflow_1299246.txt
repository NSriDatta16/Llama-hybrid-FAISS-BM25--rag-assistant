In 3.5 (Galileo) in the preferences there is a group named Usage Data Collector. In that category you can find a checkbox to turn off the data capture. There was a similar option in 3.4 (Ganymede), but it is not open in my computer. Or you can try using P2 to completely uninstall the plugin. It won't harm anything.
