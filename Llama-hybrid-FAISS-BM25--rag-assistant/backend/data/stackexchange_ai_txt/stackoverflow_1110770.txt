Magento Inheriting and Re-Using Template Variables

Is it possible to pass a variable from a parent template to a child template. For example, if i wanted to put some repeated HTML in a separate template that was included within a foreach loop in its parent template getChildHtml('item_info'); } ?> I would want to be able to access the $item variable within the item_info template. Thanks
