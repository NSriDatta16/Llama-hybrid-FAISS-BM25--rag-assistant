Using Ruby, what is the most efficient way to check if any key in a hash matches any values within an Array

I want to compare the keys in a hash of parameters against an array of elements for a match. For example: params = {"key1", "key2", "key3"} params_to_match = ["key2","key3"] I could do this, but I'm sure there is a much more elegant way to acheive the same result params.each_key{|key| if params_to_match.include?(key.to_s) return end }
