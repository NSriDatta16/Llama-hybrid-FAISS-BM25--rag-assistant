Get string value from http response with Mechanize

I'm currently integrating facebook into my current app and I've succeeded in retrieving the access_token using the following code: url = "#{url}?#{client_id}&#{client_secret}&#{code}&#{redirect_uri}&type=client_cred" agent = Mechanize.new page = agent.get(url) The page object above has a body which contains text something along the lines of access_token=XXXXX I just want to pull out the access_token value. I can get the entire string simply by writing: page.body But I was wondering is there a way to get the access_token value without resorting to regular expressions etc?
