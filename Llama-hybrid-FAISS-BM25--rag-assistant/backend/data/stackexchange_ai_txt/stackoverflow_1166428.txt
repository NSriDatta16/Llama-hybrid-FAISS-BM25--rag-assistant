Iphone GUI physics code

When you drag an iphone GUI element like a list, it scrolls in a physics correct way, and also has a nice bounce effect at the end. I would like to write a GUI element in my game, without using UIKit. I wonder where is the code implementing this, and if I can use it instead of trying to write something similar. Any ideas?
