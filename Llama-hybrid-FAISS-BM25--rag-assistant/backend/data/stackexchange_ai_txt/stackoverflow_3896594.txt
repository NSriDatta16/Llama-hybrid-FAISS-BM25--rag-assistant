I'll try process substitution. To clarifily, I have a cron'd shell script . The cron entry is similar to: /usr/script/myscript.sh > /usr/log/myscript.log inside the script is a line similar to: command | mailx -s "Subject" recipient Since stdout from 'command' is being piped into the mailx command, it does appear in the log file 'myscript.log', but I want it to. I tried capturing it into a variable but the line feeds appear to be lost that way. I could use a temporary file, but I was hoping for something more elegant.
