Multi-class classification v.s. Binary classification

A training set has five classes including: "label-A", "label-B", "label-C", "label-D", "others" But the problem is much simpler - it is to determine whether each input belongs to "label-ABCD" or "others" . In this case, there are two solutions to solve this problem in my mind. Solution 1: Train a 5-classes classifier, when the classifier predicts the input as "label-A" or "label-B" or "label-C" or "label-D" , we relabel it as "label-ABCD" . Solution 2: Train a 2-classes classifier, we relabel the data as "label-ABCD" which is labeled as "label-A" or "label-B" or "label-C" or "label-D" . And then it becomes a binary-classification problem. My questions are: Which way can the model get a better performance in " theorem "? In real case, these two cases get almost the same performance by a CNN classification model, and I am wondering if I adopt a weaker classifier like C4.5, Naive Bayes, SVM...which method will win? Thanks!!
