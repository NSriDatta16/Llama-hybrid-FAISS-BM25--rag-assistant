In plain language, why is there no VIF for binary outcome regression models?

As far as I know, the variance inflation factor is not computed with pseudo-$R^{2}$ or generalized $R^{2}$ in binary outcome models (e.g. logistic regression). Are there other measures of multi-colinearity than VIF appropriate to such models? Why ought or ought not we think about multi-colinearity in such models?
