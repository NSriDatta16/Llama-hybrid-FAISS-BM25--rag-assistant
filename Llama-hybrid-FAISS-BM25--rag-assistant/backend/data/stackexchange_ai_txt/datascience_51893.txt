How to optimize the lambdas of a hybrid loss in a deep learning model

I am using a generative adversarial deep learning model (GAN) with a hybrid loss represented by a linear combination of four losses with three $\lambda$ 's, something like: $total\_loss = loss_1 + \lambda_1\times loss_2 + \lambda_2\times loss_3 + \lambda_3\times loss_4$ . Is there a way to optimize these $\lambda$ 's towards the best performance? provided that the computational complexity is not trivial. If my objective is for $loss_4$ to be minimum, should I use a high value for $\lambda_3$ compared to the other ones? But, how would that affect the overall performance, as all the models used in the GAN might play an important role in the final result. NB. $loss_1$ is based on MSE measure, while the other losses are based on $l_1$ norm.
