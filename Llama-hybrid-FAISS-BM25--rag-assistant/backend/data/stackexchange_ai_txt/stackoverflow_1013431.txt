A few tips I've found helpful in my own work: I maintain a personal wiki page for each project that contains all project-related data. Since it's just for my personal consumption, I can organize each one organically as needed. Keep a questions log (on the wiki page or elsewhere) that crop up throughout the course of the project. Rather than bombarding your client with random emails or accidentally forgetting to ask a question in a timely fashion, keeping a log will let you send one coherent and compiled email every few days with project-related questions. Do all development locally (MAMP, XAMPP, etc). This way your client is never accessing the website when you're working on it, therefore bypassing unnecessary confusion (why I am getting blank screens now?!? They were working 5 minutes ago!!). Push from local development to your staging server via Capistrano . This can be done again for production. Much easier to keep track of any build scripts (minifiying JS, for example) and is much more efficient than FTP Use SVN to manage all assets - content, templates, comps, your working site, database exports, etc. A well-organized repo won't get out of hand if you set it up right from the start. Never hurts having an extra backup, even if you know you're never going to touch a file again.
