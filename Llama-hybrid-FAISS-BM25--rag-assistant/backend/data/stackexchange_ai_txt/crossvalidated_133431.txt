One option would be to approach this as a classification problem, rather than a time-series prediction problem. Find customers who canceled, and create a feature vector of their usage of each feature, concatenated over several months before cancellation. For example if you had usage data on two features (F1/F2) and three-month window (M1-M3), your feature vector would look like [F1_M1 F2_M1 F1_M2 F2_M2 F1_M3 F2_M3]. Then, you need to mine for many negative examples, by grabbing random three-month windows from customers who did not cancel, and computing the same features. You can then use any standard machine learning classification machinery (e.g. SVM) to try to find features which discriminate between these two groups. If this has above-chance accuracy, then you can use the decision value of this classifier (how strongly it believes you are in the "cancel" class) as a signal that a user is about to cancel. Exactly how you set the time window will depend on some intuition about your product. You may also want to try using features from, say only 2-3 months before cancellation and see if you can predict cancellation 1 month ahead of time (which gives you more time to retain that customer).
