I just started using jQuery as well, and have found it to be very helpful. For me, the biggest advantage is having some really nice intellisense in VS for it, and not having to look up every archaic method in the world to accomplish simple tasks. To me, it just seems a lot better organized than plain old javascript, and like someone else said, it has a ton of good built in libraries.
