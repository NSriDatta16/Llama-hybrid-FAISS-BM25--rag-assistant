nosql example, which engine?

a) I have 1000000 domain names b) Every domain has about 100000 sites c) each site has about 10000 visits daily / (5000 unique visits daily) d) As the owner of all those websites, I want to see, how many visitors on selected sites I had in a selected periods of time, for example: How many unique visitor were from 4th December 1987 to 23 April 2010 on mydomain.com/tutorials How many unique visitor were from 30 August 1996 to 16 July 2009 on yourdomain.com/reference ? For a traditional SQL database this is a pain. What is the smartest approach ? What storage engine to use ? I have only SQL knowledge. Any additional resources greatly appreciated.
