Besides the AUC and Kohonen's kappa already discussed in the other answers, I'd also like to add a few metrics I've found useful for imbalanced data. They are both related to precision and recall . Because by averaging these you get a metric weighing $TP$ s and both types of errors ( $FP$ and $FN$ ): F1 score , which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall . G-measure , which is the geometric mean of precision and recall . Compared to F1, I've found it a bit better for imbalanced data. Jaccard index , which you can think of as the $TP / (TP + FP + FN)$ . This is actually the metric that has worked for me the best. Note: For imbalanced datasets, it is best to have your metrics be macro-averaged .
