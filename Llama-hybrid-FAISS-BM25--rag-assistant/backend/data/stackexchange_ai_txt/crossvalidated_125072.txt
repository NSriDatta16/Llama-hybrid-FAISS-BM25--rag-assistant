Machine Learning for Text Classification

I am new to Machine Learning.I am working on a project where the machine learning concept need to be applied. Problem Statement: I have large number(say 3000)key words.These need to be classified into seven fixed categories.Each category is having training data(sample keywords).I need to come with a algorithm, when a new keyword is passed to that,it should predict to which category this key word belongs to. I am not aware of which text classification technique need to applied for this.do we have any tools that can be used.
