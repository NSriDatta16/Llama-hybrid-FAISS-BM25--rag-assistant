Android Instant Speech to Text voice recognition

I don't have much experience with Android, but was asked by a hearing-impaired friend if there is a way to essentially "stream" voice to text on a mobile device. I've used and looked into the android built in api, but it seems that only sends the speech off for processing after the speech input is completed. I'm looking for something that works contiguously (similar to how Dragon works with microsoft word). Perhaps there is already an app that does this. If not, is there a way to implement this with the current Android OS/API? Any suggestions appreciated.
