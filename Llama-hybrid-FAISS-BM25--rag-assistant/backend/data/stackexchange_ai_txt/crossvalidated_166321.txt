What exactly does it mean to and why must one update prior?

I'm still trying to understand prior and posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. In this question , one flips a coin. Priors: unfair is 0.1, and being fair is 0.9 Coin is flipped 10x and is all heads. Based on this evidence, P(unfair | evidence) ~ 0.653 and P(fair | evidence) ~ 1-0.653. Apparently: Both priors (originally 0.1 and 0.9) must be updated. â€“ user3697176 Apr 27 at 4:38 What exactly does it mean to update a prior ? I'm not sure I understand Wiki. Like we replace 0.1 and 0.9 with 0.653 and 1-0.653 and then run another experiment and continue to do so until the priors stabilize? Question 2 might just follow from 1 but anyway: Why must they be updated? I'm guessing because 0.1 and 0.9 are sufficiently far from 0.653 and 1-0.653. If that is right, how far must they be from 0.1 and 0.9 to say that priors must be updated? What if evidence gave us 0.11 and 0.89? If that is wrong, why then?
