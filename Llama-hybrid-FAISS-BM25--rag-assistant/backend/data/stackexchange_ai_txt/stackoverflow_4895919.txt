wxPython Binding Problem

I'm playing with wxPython event bindings in order to make a dragging algorithm. However I've encountered a problem, when the mouse is not directly over my frame the event doesn't trigger. This becomes a problem while dragging seeing as if the mouse escapes the frame (like if the user moved it quickly), the frame neglects to update it's position. Is there anyway to change the bindings so that they trigger even if the mouse isn't over the frame in question? Snippet: self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_DOWN, self.relative_mouse_position) self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.wid_unbind) Snippet: def relative_mouse_position (self, event): cx, cy = wx.GetMousePosition() x, y = self.GetPosition() RelX = cx - x RelY = cy - y self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOTION, lambda event: self.wid_drag(event, RelX, RelY)) def wid_drag (self, event, RelX, RelY): cx, cy = wx.GetMousePosition() x = cx - RelX y = cy - RelY if x
