Inspired by ThinkJet's answer, I think that another factor that comes into play is, "To what extent are we willing to forgo database independence in order to provide faster, cheaper development of more performant applications?" If the company's emphasis is that all code must be portable between databases then there is little point in using anything other than the most simple RDBMS, and the improvements and advantages that Oracle and Microsoft have provided count for nothing. It takes very little to break true database independence, and my philosophy is that you should throw yourself wholeheartedly into leveraging every feature that you've paid for -- SQL enhancements, PL/SQL, etc.. Others may differ, of course.
