border does not enclose all of the div's elements

i'm now starting designing with proper mark-up and organization. and now, i have problem with my div border. it does not enclose all ot the div's content. this is my html snippet: Latest Shop Items: Ballpen Php 90.00 and here's my css: div#paneMiddle>div{ /*All divs that are children of div#paneMiddle*/ width:590px; margin:5px 5px 5px 5px; position:relative; border-color:#FFCC33; border-style:solid; border-width:thin; position:relative; } why doesn't this work? thanks
