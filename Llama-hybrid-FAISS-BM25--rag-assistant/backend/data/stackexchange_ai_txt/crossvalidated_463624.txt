Inverse transform method on MCMC generated uniform draws

I understand that it sounds like why would anyone do this, but are there any references that use the inverse transform method to draw correlated samples from a distribution $F$ using MCMC samples from $U[0,1]$ or even QMC generated draws from $U[0,1]$ ?
