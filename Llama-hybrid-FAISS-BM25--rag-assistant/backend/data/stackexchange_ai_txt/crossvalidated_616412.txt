Time series forecasting for the next three months

I have a time series dataset that records the number of passengers per day. Based on this data, I need to make predictions for the next three months at the monthly level. The provided plot illustrates the number of passengers in different areas of the city since 2019. Each line represents the passenger count observed in a specific area. The data also exhibits weekly seasonality . However, I am currently facing the following issues: what models can be used to predict values on the long run? How can I predict the values for the new areas (since Nov-2022) in the next three months, considering the limited available data? Should I treat each area as a separate time series ? As evident from the plot, there is noise and a downward trend between certain dates,how can I smooth out this noise without affecting the chosen prediction model? I am new to time series forecasting.
