Basically, you have two types of search parameters: textual and spatial. You can probably use one type to filter the results you got from the other. For example, for someone looking for a .NET developer job near Atlanta, GA you could either first retrieve all the .NET developer jobs and filter for location, or retrieve all jobs around Atlanta and filter for .NET developer ones. I believe the first should be faster. You can also store the job locations directly in Lucene, and incorporate them in the search. A rough draft is: Indexing: 1. When you receive a new 'wanted' ad, find its geo-location using the database. 2. Store the location as a Lucene field in the ad's document. Retrieval: 1. Retrieve all jobs according to textual matches. 2. Use geometrical calculations for finding distances between the user's place and the job location. 3. Filter jobs according to distance. Lucene in Action has an example of spatial search similar in spirit. A second edition is in the making. Also, check out Sujit Pal's suggestions for spatial search with Lucene and Patrick O'Leary's framework . There are also Locallucene and LocalSolr , but I do not know how mature they are.
