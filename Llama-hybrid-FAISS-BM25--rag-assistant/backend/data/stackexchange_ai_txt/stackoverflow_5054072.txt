Almost good I have only a few improvements: variables moves to the top Inside produceNumbers and your while you have small repeat. I recommend refactor this Small advice: Code should be like books - easy readable - in your run() method firstly you call produceNumber and then askForAnswer. So it will be better if in your code you will have the same order in definitions, so implementation askForAnswer before produceNumber. But it isn't necessary Pay attention to have small methods. A method shouldn't have much to do - I think that askForAnswer you could split to two methods
