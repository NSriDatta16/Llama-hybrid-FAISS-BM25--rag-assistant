how to cache cms block in magento for sessioned and non-sessioned visits?

For a Magento enterprise site, I have a CMS page (home page) which includes a certain block of code, 'my-products.phtml', using the following method within the CMS page content: {{block type="catalog/product_list" template="catalog/product/my-products.phtml"}} The problem is that this block is really really slow and needs to be cached. The containing CMS page is cached for non-sessioned visitors, but once a user logs in, the page and the included block don't seem to be cached at all. There's no session-specific code within the block so I'm wondering how to ensure that it is cached even when a user is logged in?
