There are lots of ways of summarizing the relationships between time series that don't require precise synchronization. @Honi suggests one. This paper, Recurrence Plots of Dynamical Systems by Eckmann, Kamphorst and Ruelle (Europhys. Lett., 4, 91, pp. 973-977, 1987) discusses some others as well as proposing their own method. Here is the abstract: A new graphical tool for measuring the time constancy of dynamical systems is presented and illustrated with typical examples. In recent years a number of methods have been devised to compute dynamical parameters from time series. Such parameters are the information dimension, entropy, Liapunov exponents, dimension spectrum, etc. In all cases it is assumed that the time series is obtained from an autonomous dynamical system, i.e. the evolution equations do not contain the time explicitly (emphasis added). It is also assumed that the time series is much longer than the characteristic times of the dynamical system. In the present letter we present a new diagnostic tool which we call recurrence plot ; this tool tests the above assumptions, and gives useful information also when they are not satisfied. As the examples will show, the information obtained from recurrence plots is often surprising, and not easily obtainable by other methods. And for an application of this approach, see Sornette and Zhou's paper Non-parametric Determination of Real-Time Lag Structure between Two Time Series: the “Optimal Thermal Causal Path” Method ( http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408166v1 ).
