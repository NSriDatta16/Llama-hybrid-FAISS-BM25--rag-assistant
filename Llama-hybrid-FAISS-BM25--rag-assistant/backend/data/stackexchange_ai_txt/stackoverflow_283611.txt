If I recall correctly, light userdata is actually just a pointer. They all share the same metatable. They are mostly used to pass around addresses of C data. Full userdata is probably closer of what you need if you must access it from the Lua side. Their metatable would allow you to access it like it was a regular Lua table, for example. You might be also interested by Roberto's library for converting data to and from C structs for Lua 5.1 . Or not. Depends on your needs... :-)
