First, you create another column that is a string concatenation of the first three, and drag down: =TRIM(A2) & TRIM(B2) & TRIM(C2) Then, you use this formula for Total_Hours, and drag down: =SUMIF(D:D, D2, E:E) My example uses your sample, and inserts a new column D for the concatenation. End Result: Month Week Year Concat Hours Total_Hours 1 2 2011 122011 8 12 1 2 2011 122011 4 12 1 2 2010 122010 7 7 1 2 2009 122009 5 5 Of course, I'd use Named Ranges for anything that's likely to change.
