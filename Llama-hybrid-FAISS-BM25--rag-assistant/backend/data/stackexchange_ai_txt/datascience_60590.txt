Why does the neural network keep giving out the same output for every input?

Made a neural network using TensorFlow's Keras that is supposed to match an IP to one of the 7 type of vulnerabilities and give out what type of vulnerability that IP has. model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), tf.keras.layers.Dense(50, activation=tf.nn.relu), tf.keras.layers.Dense(7, activation=tf.nn.softmax) ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500) xs is the list of IPs and ys is its corresponding vulnerability from 0 to 6 (seven in total). The output for this remains the same for every input, i.e.,: [[0.22258884 0.20329571 0.36828393 0.11352853 0.04444532 0.02388807 0.02396955]]
