Should the day of the week variable be splitted into 7 columns or is one enough? Time-series forecast

I have time-series data, in which I added a variable "dayofweek" with the day of the week varying from $0$ (Monday) to $6$ (Sunday) (Python's default). I'm using boosting models like GBM and XGBoost to forecast my data. However, should I use a dummy/binary variable for each day of the week or is it the same using one single column for all of them? Date y dayofweek 01-03-2020 200 6 02-03-2020 250 0 03-03-2020 333 1 04-03-2020 333 2 05-03-2020 200 3 06-03-2020 150 4 07-03-2020 260 5 08-03-2020 300 6 Vs Date y Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 01-03-2020 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 02-03-2020 250 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 03-03-2020 333 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 04-03-2020 333 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 05-03-2020 200 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 06-03-2020 150 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 07-03-2020 260 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 08-03-2020 300 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 I know that these types of models work well with tabular data, but is there any significant difference in results by using dummy/binary vs one single column for days of the week?
