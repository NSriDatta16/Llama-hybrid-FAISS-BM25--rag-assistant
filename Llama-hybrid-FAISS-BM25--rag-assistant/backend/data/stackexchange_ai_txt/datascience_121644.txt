These features can indeed be used for regression, and in my experience helped a little bit (been awhile since I looked at Titanic ;). I ended up combining them: train_set['Relatives']=train_set.SibSp+train_set.Parch test_set['Relatives']=test_set.SibSp+test_set.Parch though I was using SVMs so your mileage may vary, hth.
