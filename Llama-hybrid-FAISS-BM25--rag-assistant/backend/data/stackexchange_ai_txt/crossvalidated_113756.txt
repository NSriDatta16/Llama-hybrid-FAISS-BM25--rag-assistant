import kernlad model to caret

I'd like to test the anova rbf kernel included in the kernlab package in caret . Following excelent tutorial ( https://topepo.github.io/caret/custom_models.html ) I've come up with the following code: SVManova I then asked for the model to train some dataset: set.seed(100) #use the same seed to train different models svrFitanova But I get the following error: Error in train.default(x, y, weights = w, ...) : The tuning parameter grid should have columns C, sigma, degree, eps I don't see why this error occurs.... tune grid has four columns as requested... Any ideas? Thanks
