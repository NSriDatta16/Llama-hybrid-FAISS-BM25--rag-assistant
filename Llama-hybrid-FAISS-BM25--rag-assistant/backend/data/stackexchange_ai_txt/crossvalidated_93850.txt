Question 1 You arrived at $$E(y_t) = \frac{\alpha_0 +E(\tau_t)}{1-\alpha_1}$$ You want $E(y_t) = E(y_{t+k}) = \mu_y$, a constant. Obviously, this will hold if and only if $E(\tau_t) = E(\tau_{t+k}) = \mu_{\tau}$, a constant. So mean-stationarity of $y_t$ requires mean-stationarity of $\tau_t$. Question 2 Things we can do with a stationary process we cannot do with a non-stationary process: for example under mean-stationarity, the sample mean of a series of realizations of the process is a consistent estimator of the true mean of the process. Assume now that the process is upward trending, and you have a series of realizations from it. Taking the average value of this series is meaningless, evidently -and has nothing to do with the true mean of the process. Even the things we can do with a non-stationary process, go by different rules -for example, finite-sample and asymptotic properties of estimators are different. Hamilton's Time Series Analysis , although 20-years old, remains a standard introductory treatment to estimation and inference under non-stationarity.
