Emotion detection from text

I am doing a project where I will have to detect emotions from reviews gained by users (through comments). My task is to classify the comments in at least 5 types of emotions that is: happiness, satisfy/unsatisfied, disappointment, sadness, joy. Can I find an already existing model trained for emotion analysis where I can analyze the emotions in each comment. My output needs to give whether the comment is happy or sad/angry etc. I am willing to use the RNN technique. Can someone please help me with my project? Thank you.
