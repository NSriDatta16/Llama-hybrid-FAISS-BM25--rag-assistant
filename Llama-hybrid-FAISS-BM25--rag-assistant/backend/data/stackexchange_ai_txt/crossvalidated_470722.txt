How to select a set of MCMC samples with some probability?

I have a set of samples gathered using MCMC of random variable $X$ . Let's call this set $X_s$ . How to select a subset of samples $S$ such that $$ Probability(X_s(S) 0.01 $$ I want to gather a set $X_s$ of samples so that the joint probability of any sample from the complement set having value less than the constant is less than 0.01.
