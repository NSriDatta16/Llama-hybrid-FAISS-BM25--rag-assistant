From https://system.data.sqlite.org : System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET adapter for SQLite. System.Data.SQLite was started by Robert Simpson. Robert still has commit privileges on this repository but is no longer an active contributor. Development and maintenance work is now mostly performed by the SQLite Development Team. The SQLite team is committed to supporting System.Data.SQLite long-term. "System.Data.SQLite is the original SQLite database engine and a complete ADO.NET 2.0 provider all rolled into a single mixed mode assembly. It is a complete drop-in replacement for the original sqlite3.dll (you can even rename it to sqlite3.dll). Unlike normal mixed assemblies, it has no linker dependency on the .NET runtime so it can be distributed independently of .NET." It even supports Mono.
