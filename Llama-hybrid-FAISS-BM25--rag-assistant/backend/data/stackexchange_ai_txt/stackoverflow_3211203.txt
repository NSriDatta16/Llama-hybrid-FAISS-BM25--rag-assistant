Automatic HTML preloader

I've an page that will load chunks of HTML using ajax. All those fragments will have images and some of them will be specified in a separate CSS using background-image. I wanted to write a pre-loader, so that the loaded chunk will show up only when all the loading is complete. If all the images would have been in the HTML chunk, I would load it, put it in a hidden element, then look for all the img tags and control if they are loaded (or put some callbacks in the load method). The problem is CSS I can't do that so easily... So the only way that comes to my mind is to have a separate xml file with all the image locations and use it to create IMG elements, load them and when they are loaded display the chunk (so the images have already been pulled from the server). Do you know better approaches? Are there any ready components?
