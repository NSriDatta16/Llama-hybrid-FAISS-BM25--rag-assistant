Summarize regression results on different datasets

I have 20 datasets (extracted from 20 different software systems) and fit a logistic regression model on each of them. On every dataset, the model was the same (same dependent variable and the same set of independent variables). Now I wonder how to summarize the results. What I'm currently doing: Determine for each independent variable whether its p-value is below the significance threshold (e.g., p Report the mean, median, and standard deviation of the odds ratios for each independent variable, but only if the variable had a significant effect in the respective dataset. Is this an acceptable way of summarizing the results of multiple regression models? Or would you suggest another way? I've seen the terms "meta-regression analysis" and "hierarchical regression" being used but am unsure whether they apply to my problem. Any help would be highly appreciated.
