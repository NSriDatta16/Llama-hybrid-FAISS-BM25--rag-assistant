Using a bootstrapper of some sort, you can check if .NET is installed and then download it if necessary. For example, with the MSI Factory bootstrapper (I'm not advocating MSI Factory, it's an ugly program. But the bootstrapper it comes with is alone well worth the license cost if you're developing commercial software like we do) there's scripts you can simply include to perform this function. We're using WiX + the MSI Factory bootstrapper to distribute both a single compressed EXE (30Mb), and a small 1Mb "downloader" EXE that downloads an MSI. Both EXE's check for the presence of .NET 2.0 and then download it if necessary. We also distribute a standalone MSI which also checks for .NET and blocks installation if it's not present. Basically you've got the following: Windows XP - doesn't ship with .NET. Customer needs to install it manually (it appears as an optional Windows Update component) Vista - ships with .NET 2.0 (but not 1.1) Server 2003 - ships with .NET 1.1 Ignore .NET 1.1, just ignore it. Vista users and beyond will only have it installed for legacy application support, or if they're a developer. .NET 2.0 is the most commonly installed version, from our user base we've found that less than 10% of users have .NET 3.5 installed. If your application is targeting a technical, geeky audience then I'd say that ~50% of people will have .NET 3.0. If you're targeting a consumer/retail/non-tech market, you can probably estimate around 30% with .NET 2.0 and 10% with .NET 3.0 or above. The above figures are based on browser traffic to our websites, a mostly non-technical audience. This is probably the best way to get an idea for your market. IE always reports the .NET version in the User-agent string so break out the weblogs and start analyzing :)
