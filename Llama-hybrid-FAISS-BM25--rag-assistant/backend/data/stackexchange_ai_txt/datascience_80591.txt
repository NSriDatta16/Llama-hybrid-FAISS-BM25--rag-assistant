How to preprocess an ordered categorical variable to feed a machine learning algorithm?

I have a categorical variable that measures the income of a family: A: no income B: Up to $500 C: $500-$700 … P: $5000-$6000 Q: More than \\\$6000 It seems odd to me that I have to get dummies for this variable, since it's ordered. I wonder if it's better to map the values: {'A': 0, 'B': 1, …, 'Q': 17} so I can input it into the algorithm this values as integer numbers. What's the proper way of preprocessing this variable to feed an algorithm such as Random Forest or a simple neural network?
