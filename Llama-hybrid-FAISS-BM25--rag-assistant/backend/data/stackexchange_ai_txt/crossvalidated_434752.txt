Misusing Random Forest?

I'm trying to wrap my mind around some analysis someone just showed me that someone said will be published soon. These people have about 60 cases and are interested in a disease that occurs in 5 of these cases. They do a random forest algorithm and then do the variable importance of the random forest using a variable importance command in R. They use the output of the variable importance command to select variables to perform sensitivity analysis on to see what variables "accurately predict" the disease. There's no mention of the accuracy of the random forest at predicting this disease, but I'm guessing it's probably terrible at predicting the disease with so few cases. In that case is this analysis just pointless? To add: these people seem to think random forest is somehow really accurate with small data. Don't know about that, but they've never tested the accuracy
