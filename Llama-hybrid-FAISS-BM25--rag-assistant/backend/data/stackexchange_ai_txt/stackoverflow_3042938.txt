Depending on how many e-mail addresses and phone numbers your members have on average, there might be a problem with your query. Suppose you have the records (most fields omitted for brevity): members addresses phoneNumbers memberId | firstName | lastName memberId | city memberId | phoneNumber --------------------------------- ------------------- ---------------------- 839 | Joe | Hallenbeck 839 | New York 839 | 111-11111 839 | L.A. 839 | 222-22222 Then what your join will do is produce not one record for Joe Hallenbeck, but four: memberId | firstName | lastName | city | phoneNumber ----------------------------------------------------------- 839 | Joe | Hallenbeck | New York | 111-1111 839 | Joe | Hallenbeck | New York | 222-2222 839 | Joe | Hallenbeck | L.A. | 111-1111 839 | Joe | Hallenbeck | L.A. | 222-2222 I don't know if this is what you want, but you should know that this query might produce far more result records than there are members in the database. For more advice you should post some DDL statements ( create table etc.), as Konerak pointed out.
