Tagging in Subversion - how do I make the decision about continuing to work on my trunk vs. the new tag?

I'm running Tortoise SVN to manage a project. Obviously the principles around tagging apply to any implementation of SVN but in this question I'll be referring to some TortoiseSVN-specific dialog boxes and messages. My working directory and the subversion repository structure both have a Source root directory and the Trunk, Tags and Branches directories underneath. (I couldn't figure out how to do a multilevel indented hierarchy in markdown without using bullets, so if someone could edit and fix this I'd appreciate it.) I'm working out of the Trunk directory in my working copy and it's pointing at the Trunk directory in the repo. I want to apply a Tag "Release1" so I click the "Branch/tag..." menu option and set the repo path as my [repo_path/bla/Source/Tags/Release1" tag. This dialog box gives me the option to "Switch my working copy to new branch/tag". I understand that if this option is left unchecked, the new "Release1" branch under /Tags" will be created but my working copy will remain on the previous "Trunk" path. If I do check this option (or use the Switch command) I understand that my working copy will switch to the new "Release1" branch under "/Tags". Where I'm missing a concept is how to make this decision. It doesn't seem like I want to switch my working directory to the recently created tag since by definition (?) I want that tag to be a snapshot of my code as of a point in time. If I don't switch the working directory, I'll continue working off Trunk and when I'm ready to take another snapshot I'll make another tag. And so on... Am I understanding this right or am I stating something incorrectly in the previous paragraph (e.g. the statement about not wanting to switch to the tag since the tag should represent a point in time snapshot) or otherwise missing something regarding how to make this decision?
