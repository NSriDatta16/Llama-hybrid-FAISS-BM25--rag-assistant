As you write, either approach is feasible. I don't think you can give a general recommendation. In some situations, there may be more existing knowledge pertaining to one than to the other approach - for instance, if you are forecasting a time series, there is much more work on forecasting a continuous target variable (approach 1) than a binary one (approach 2). So I would recommend that you try both approaches and see which one works better for your problem at hand. Just be sure to use an appropriate measure of "better" - not accuracy, that is .
