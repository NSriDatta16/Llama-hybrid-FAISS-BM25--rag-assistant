SOAP doesn't support hierarchical namespaces, so I've determined that there are only two solutions: Ensure that the different classes are uniquely named across all methods in the Web Service Break the single web service into multiple services, so that each has its own implicitly distinct namespace . Since the latter option requires more administration (both in the code and within IIS), I decided to give the classes unique names. I may still end up breaking the service into multiples (for organization or load handling), but that's optional if the class names are unique.
