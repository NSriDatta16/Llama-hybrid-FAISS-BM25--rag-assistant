The Wikipedia's proof is not fully rigorous and incomplete. It is not fully rigorous because as we allow $g$ can have discontinuities, the statement " $F = f \circ g$ is itself a bounded continuous functional " is an overstatement. It is incomplete because it failed to explicitly cite the bounded convergence theorem (as Durrett's book did) or any other propositions to close the argument " And so the claim follows from the statement above ". Because it skipped this important step which relies on the Skorohod's theorem (i.e., the "a.s. representation" in your post) to prepare the convergence condition in BCT, it created the illusion that its "proof" is simpler. The application of the Skorohod's theorem in Durrett 's proof to continuous mapping theorem is very elegant, and the same idea is also shared by Billingsley (see Theorem 25.7 in Probability and Measure ). However, if you think such proof used too much machinery, you can directly verify other equivalence conditions of weak convergence ( portmanteau lemma ). For example, to check $$\limsup_{n \to \infty} P(g(X_n) \in F) \leq P(g(X) \in F)$$ for every closed set $F$ . A proof of this kind can be found in Theorem 2.3 of Asymptotic Statistics by A. W. Van der Vaart.
