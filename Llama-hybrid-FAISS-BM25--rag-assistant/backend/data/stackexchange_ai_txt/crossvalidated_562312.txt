Using Machine Learning to Create Periodic Paths

Question : How can I use Machine Learning to predict the right initial conditions $(P_0,V_0)$ , given the angles of the triangular table, that will result in periodic paths in the triangular billiard table (no pockets, no friction, no spin, etc.)? Context : I’m tackling a problem known as the Triangle Billiards Problem — and I was hoping to use AI to give me some insight into the problem. Here’s the setup: a billiard table in the shape of a triangle. The ball bounces off the table just as a beam of light reflects off a mirror (i.e., angle of incidence = angle of reflection). I want to create a neural network that (intelligently?) chooses the initial conditions $(P_0,V_0)$ — initial position and velocity of the billiard ball — that would create a periodic path (i.e., a billiard trajectory that starts repeating on itself). I am hoping this will give me some insight into the triangular billiards problem. Using VPython, I have already created a simulation of a billiard ball bouncing around in a triangular table, creating periodic (and sometimes non-periodic) paths. I’ve attached an image of my simulation. However, I would now like to bring ML/AI to the picture. I would really appreciate any advice as to how to go about doing this. Should I use reinforcement learning and if so, how should I formulate a reward that distinguishes between periodic and non-periodic paths? What library can I use to model the billiards system above using ML? I’m quite lost on this and I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or suggestions. Thank you.
