In pure C/C++ on Windows, start reading about the DragAcceptFiles function and the WM_DROPFILES message. If you're using a more powerful C++ library (Qt, Wx, etc) check their respective documentation. It would help to know what you use, more specifically. Also, this discussion may answer your question. If it's what you meant, please close this question.
