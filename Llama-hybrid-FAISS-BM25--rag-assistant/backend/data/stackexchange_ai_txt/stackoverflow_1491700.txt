The service you have here will return a SOAP message - which will contain the "CompositeType" as its "payload". WCF by default uses SOAP - any of the basicHttpBinding, wsHttpBinding, netTcpBinding etc. all work with SOAP as their basis. If you want to return straight XML, you need to check out the REST capabilities of WCF - this works with the webHttpBinding (and only that binding). Also, how to produce an XML like this (based on data contract): rather than this: 0 This is a limitation of the WCF DataContract serializer. For performance reasons, it does not support attributes, e.g. you cannot create the first fragment of XML that you want. If you absolutely must have the first XML, you'll need to use the XmlSerializer instead (which has its own set of limitations / problems). Marc UPDATE: if you just want to return a given XML, then you're probably better off with the REST approach. Check out the Pluralsight website for an excellent series of screencasts on using REST and in particular, one screencast on how to create a plain-old XML (POX) REST service .
