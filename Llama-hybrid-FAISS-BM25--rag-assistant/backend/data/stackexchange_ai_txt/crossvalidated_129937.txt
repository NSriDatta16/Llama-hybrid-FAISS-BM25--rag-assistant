How to compute R-squared value when doing cross-validation?

I am using multiple linear regression with a data set of 72 variables and using 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the model. I am unsure what values I need to look at to understand the validation of the model. Is it the averaged R squared value of the 5 models compared to the R squared value of the original data set? In my understanding, the average R squared value of the sampled data needs to be within 2% of the R squared value in the original data set. Is that right? Or are there any other results I should be looking at?
