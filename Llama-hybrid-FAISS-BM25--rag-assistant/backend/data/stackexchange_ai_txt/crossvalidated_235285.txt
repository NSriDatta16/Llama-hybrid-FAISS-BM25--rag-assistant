Can I use t-test to test for a observation within a sample to see if it's an outlier

I have a basic question, I am tracking loan defaults month on month and I want to see if due to a fall in the interest rates if my defaults have fallen in August. I was thinking of taking the average of default rates until July from the start of the year and comparing the August value with the mean value of defaults and running a t-test on both these value to see if the new value is significantly different mean for the year so far. Is this a correct way to analyze this problem or I am thinking incorrectly?
