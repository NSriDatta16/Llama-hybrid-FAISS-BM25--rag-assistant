Practically it's the easiest to do it with Monte Carlo. I think that's what most people do anyways. You simulate the error term with and collect quantiles of the forecast. In R this can be done with arima.sim . The quantiles are not so easy to estimate theoretically especially if the series are further combined with other predictions to obtain a composite forecast or when you model a transformed series, but are no brainer in simulation. The quantiles are popularized by BoE in fan charts in inflation report as shown below Another application of Monte Carlo is for the case when you model correlated time series separately. Suppose, that for some reason you don't want to do a vector model, e.g. for complexity or lack of data. In this case you could still - similar to seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) - get the correlation of residuals of models, then generate correlated innovations and supply them into a command such as arima.sim to obtain correlated predictions
