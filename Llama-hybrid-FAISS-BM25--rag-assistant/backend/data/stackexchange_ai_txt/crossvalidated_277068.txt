Here is an example of what I typically do, in code form easy running: # Loading Packages and Data library(dynlm) data("M1Germany") # convert to time series object M1Germany |t|) # (Intercept) 6.53504 0.05111 127.871 Remember however that the standard error (and thus the t test and p value too) are unreliable and need to be estimated using robust errors techniques - refer to the coeftest in the sandwich package. The whole process can be a little tedious. I myself have been writing my own package for these kinds of exploratory time series econometrics methods. If you are interested it can be found on GitHub constantly being edited as I learn more about econometrics. install.packages("remotes") remotes::install_github("efriedland/friedland") library(friedland) data("MacKinnon") buildDOLS(loggnp ~ logprice + interest, data = M1Germany) Any questions feel free to ask!
