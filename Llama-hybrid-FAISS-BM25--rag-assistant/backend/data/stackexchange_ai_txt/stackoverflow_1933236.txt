It looks like the minus signs in some of your lines were Unicode characters that display as minuses and aren't. I copied your code into Xcode and got the same error. I then retyped each line that had the error and it worked. Here's the fixed version (.m file only): @implementation GravityObj @synthesize position, size; @synthesize objTimer; @synthesize velocity; @synthesize pngName; @synthesize bounce; @synthesize gravity, acceleratedGravity; @synthesize lastTouch, currentTouch; @synthesize dragging; - (id)initWithPNG:(NSString*)imageName position:(CGPoint)p size:(CGSize)s { if (self = [super initWithFrame:CGRectMake(p.x, p.y, s.width, s.height)]) { [self setPngName:imageName]; [self setPosition:p]; [self setSize:s]; [self setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]]; // Set default gravity and bounce [self setBounce:-0.9f]; [self setGravity:0.5f]; [self setAcceleratedGravity:CGPointMake(0.0, gravity)]; [self setDragging:NO]; UIImageView *prezzie = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, s.width, s.height)]; prezzie.image = [UIImage imageNamed:imageName]; [self addSubview:prezzie]; [prezzie release]; [[UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate:self]; } return self; } - (void)update { [self setNeedsDisplay]; if(dragging) return; velocity.x += acceleratedGravity.x; velocity.y += acceleratedGravity.y; position.x += velocity.x; position.y += velocity.y; if(position.x + size.width >= 320.0) { position.x = 320.0 - size.width; velocity.x *= bounce; } else if(position.x = 416.0) { position.y = 416.0 - size.height; velocity.y *= bounce; } else if(position.y If you get that error again, I found that viewing the file in FileMerge can help; it doesn't seem to know Unicode as well as Xcode.
