Symfony filter to run before and possibly skip the controller

The idea of the desired filter is to check the memcached for page content with url as a key and if found, return it to client directly from cache and skip the controller altogether. Storing would be done in separate filter, which is the easy part. I'm aware i could write it to action's preExecute() but filters would offer more elegant solution (could turn them off for dev envs). In other words - is there a smart way for a filter to push the response to client and skip going to action?
