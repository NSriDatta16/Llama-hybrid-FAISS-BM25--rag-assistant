How to conjugate English words in Java?

Say I have a base form of a word and a tag from the Penn Treebank Tag Set . How can I get the conjugated form? For example for "do" and "VBN" how can I get "done"? I thinks this task is already implemented in some nlp library, so I'd rather not invent the bicycle. Does something like that exist?
