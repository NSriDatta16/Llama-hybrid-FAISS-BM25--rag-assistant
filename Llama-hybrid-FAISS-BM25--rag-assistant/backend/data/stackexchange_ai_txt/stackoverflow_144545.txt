I believe you could use SingletonBeanFactoryLocator . The beanRefFactory.xml file would hold the actual applicationContext, It would go something like this: ../applicationContext.xml And the code to get a bean from the applicationcontext from whereever would be something like this: BeanFactoryLocator bfl = SingletonBeanFactoryLocator.getInstance(); BeanFactoryReference bf = bfl.useBeanFactory("mainContext"); SomeService someService = (SomeService) bf.getFactory().getBean("someService"); The Spring team discourage the use of this class and yadayada, but it has suited me well where I have used it.
