If you are using READ-UNCOMMITTED transactions or no transactions at all, or the data has been sitting round on someone's screen for a long time, the additional conditions could save you from a buried update, presuming that your // do something does something to the IsActive column. It could also be a final guard against just getting it wrong (seeing if the room isn't active and then forgetting to make use of the fact). Make sure to check the number of rows updated in either case. Your second-last paragraph suggests the room_id may not be unique when it is supposed to be; you will always have trouble if that's the case. Myself, I'd be inclined to check explicitly for buried updates if I suspected they may occur, and I'd think that form of defending against programming errors to be unusual.
