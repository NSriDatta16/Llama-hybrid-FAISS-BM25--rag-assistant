How do I dereference a hash that's been returned from a method of a class?

I have a class with a method that returns a hash. Ordinarily, I would get the result like so: %resp = $myclass->sub($foo); And then access members of the returned hash like this: $resp{key}{subkey}; in the case of a 2d hash. I figure there must be a way to combine this into a single, elegant line, something like this: $myclass->sub($foo)->{key}{subkey} This obviously is not dereferenced properly as Perl returns this when trying to run the code: Can't use string ("1/8") as a HASH ref In trying random dereferencing sequences, from looking "References quick reference" on Perlmonks , I came up with the following, which Perl does not complain about, but also does not return what I'm looking for: $%{$myclass->sub($foo)}->{key}{subkey} Can somebody tell me what the magic dereferencing escape sequence is to do this?
