Statistical Analysis Software

I am a psychology student at UCF. I intend to pursue a master's degree in industrial and organizational psychology. We use SPSS in the psychology department. How prevalent is SPSS used in offices? Would learning other statistical software packages like SAS be more helpful? Which statistical software packages are used most often in offices?
