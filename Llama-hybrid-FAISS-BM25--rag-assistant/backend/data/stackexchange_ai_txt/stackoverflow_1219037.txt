Just some thinking about the opposites here: If you have something on the page that should catch the user's attention, does that not mean that you ALSO have things on the page that should NOT catch the user's attention? Perhaps you should remove things that take away from the most important message? This kind of minimalism is popular in big-fonted and margin-rich "web 2.0" sites. So one could say it is a BLINK replacement.
