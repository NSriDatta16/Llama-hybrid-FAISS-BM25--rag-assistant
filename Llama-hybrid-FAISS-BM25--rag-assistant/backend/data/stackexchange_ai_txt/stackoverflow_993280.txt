How to detect when a UIScrollView has finished scrolling

UIScrollViewDelegate has got two delegate methods scrollViewDidScroll: and scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: but neither of these tell you when scrolling has completed. scrollViewDidScroll only notifies you that the scroll view did scroll not that it has finished scrolling. The other method scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation only seems to fire if you programmatically move the scroll view not if the user scrolls. Does anyone know of scheme to detect when a scroll view has completed scrolling?
