The UNIQUE KEY ordering is a good solution and you should add a partition strategy to your table too. By partitioning the table in fragments, MySQL will query the specific partition with the right data set. I've applied and I had excellent results. CREATE TABLE ti (id INT, amount DECIMAL(7,2), tr_date DATE) ENGINE=INNODB PARTITION BY HASH( MONTH(tr_date) ) PARTITIONS 6; You need MySQL 5.1.
