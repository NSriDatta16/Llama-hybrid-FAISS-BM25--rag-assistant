Bayesian inference: numerically sampling from the posterior predictive

In the Bayesian approach the posterior distribution $P(\theta|x)$ of some hyper-parameter $\theta$ is given by: $$P(\theta|x) = \frac{P(x|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(x)}$$ Where $x$ are samples of a random variable $X$. In many cases the posterior $P(\theta|x)$ can not be analytically computed and is instead calculated numerically using Markov Chain Monte Carlo . A popular approach is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm which draws samples from: $$P(\theta|x) \propto P(x|\theta)P(\theta)$$ The posterior predictive which describes the distribution of a new i.i.d. data point $x_\text{new}$ is given by: $$P(x_\text{new}) = \int_\theta P(x_\text{new}|\theta)P(\theta|x)\, d\theta$$ My question is what are the popular methods to numerically sample from the posterior predictive $P(x_\text{new})$ if the posterior $P(\theta|x)$ is computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo?
