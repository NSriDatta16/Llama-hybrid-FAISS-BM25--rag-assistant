Difference between PCA and regularisation

Currently, I am confusing about PCA and regularisation. I wonder what is the difference between PCA and regularisation: particularly lasso (L1) regression? Seems both of them can do the feature selection. I have to admit, I am not quiet familiar with the difference between dimensional reduction and feature selection.
