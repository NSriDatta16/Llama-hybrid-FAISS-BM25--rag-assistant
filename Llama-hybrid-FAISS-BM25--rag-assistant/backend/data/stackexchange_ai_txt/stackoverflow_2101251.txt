You may be going about this the wrong way. What I did is hook up the Loaded event of [the content of] my DataTemplate: ...and then process the newly-displayed row in the event handler: private void Row_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { Grid grid = (Grid)sender; Carousel c = (Carousel)grid.FindName("carousel"); ProjectPersona project = (ProjectPersona)grid.DataContext; if (project.SelectedTime != null) c.ScrollItemIntoView(project.SelectedTime); } This approach does the initialization/checking of the row when it is first displayed, so it won't do all the rows up-front. If you can live with that, then perhaps this is the more elegant method.
