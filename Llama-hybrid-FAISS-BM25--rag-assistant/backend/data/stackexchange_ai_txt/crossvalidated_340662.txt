Improve XGBoostRegression predictions when high volatility

I am using boosted trees via XGBoostRegressor in SKLearn to predict values of a time serie. I get a quite good predictions when values range is close to the mean, however if I suddenly have high volatility, ie values far from the mean, my accuracy decreases and my predictions are always lower (ie it doesn't manage to predict the peak, always smoothing it). What are my alternatives to improve this? EDIT: here is an example of result I guess. Actual values (blue) and predictions (green)
