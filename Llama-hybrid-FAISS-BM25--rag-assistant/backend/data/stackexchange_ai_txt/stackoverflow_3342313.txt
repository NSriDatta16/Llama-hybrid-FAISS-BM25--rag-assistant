Membership API redirects me to login page after successful authentication

I'm using Membership API with forms authentication. Sometimes, when a user try to go to login.aspx page (for example www.mysite.com/login.aspx ), there is a redirect event happening and the address bar shows something like this www.mysite.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=Login.aspx I'm like to draw attention to that: User enter his login and password and then he will be redirected to a login page again. I have tried to reproduce this bug under my debug session, but I couldn't. Tell me please why it is happening?
