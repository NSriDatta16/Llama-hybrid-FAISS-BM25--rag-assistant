I wouldn't recommend using SharePoint for this at all. Its value comes from the features it provides through its user interface. If you remove this then you are looking at an expensive and over-complicated data store. SharePoint stores all data in a database. Storage for databases is more expensive than storage for files. It's more costly to configure, administer, backup, load balance, scale, etc... Development time is more costly with SharePoint. It's a big and complex product that's not trivial or quick to develop against. There needs to be a solid business case and using SharePoint for its back end only isn't a good one. Please seriously consider this approach before going down it!
