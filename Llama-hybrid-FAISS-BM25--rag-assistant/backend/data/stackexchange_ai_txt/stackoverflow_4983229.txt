Have a look at the XCode Organizer; As of a few versions ago it now manages a 'Team Provisioning Profile' that works off any bundle identifier and any of your devices if they've been added to your developer account. This is not a special provisioning profile, just an automatic one it sets up for you if you tell it your iTunes Connect details. WIth this, anything you build and run should be able to use that provisioning profile to run code on your devices.
