Not a Bayesian expert but I think the term to focus on here is $p(\theta|\mathcal{M}_\text{loaded})$ . This is the probability distribution of how the coin might be loaded. We might suggest that this distribution is flat (all weightings equally likely) except for $\theta=0.5$ (a fair coin). In your first example, the data might closely resemble a fair coin so $\mathcal{M}_\text{fair}$ could be preferable to a loaded coin since there is significant probability that, if the coin is loaded, it will have a value for $\theta$ , which makes the observations unlikely. In the second example, you are modifying the probability distribution by removing values outside $[0.3, 0.7]$ and so the integral is focused towards values, where the observed data is more likely. One more point : You say that $\mathcal{M}_\text{fair}\subset \mathcal{M}_\text{loaded}$ . But this is not correct as $\theta=0.5$ is not a loaded coin. Rather $\mathcal{M}_\text{fair} \cup \mathcal{M}_\text{loaded} $ cover the entire model space.
