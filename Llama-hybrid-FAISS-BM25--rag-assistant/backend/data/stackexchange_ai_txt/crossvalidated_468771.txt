When is it okay to make changes to your model after validating?

Let’s say I’m building a model to predict cancer relapse for a scientific paper. I use my training set to build many models and validate the best one on my test set to get an AUC of 0.65. I then go back and tweak a few hyperparameters and get a validated AUC of 0.80. Have I compromised my results by using my test set to reselect the best model? What is the best way to maintain integrity in my test/train split in this situation? I’m fairly new to data science so I'm really curious how other people approach this problem. Edit: This is a very small dataset so test/train/validate splits aren't possible here
