Is there a way to check for the good amount of replicates for let's say T test or just mere One-Way anova (a priori)?

I have already asked this in Reddit but I really cannot find the answer I know you can check for amount of sample sizes in G power but not really for experiments. I can't be using a minimum of 100 replicates per group if I am testing efficacy of three fertilizers with medium effect size lol. Also if replicates is different to sample size, how come we can use the same tests (let's say t test) to experimental units and sampling units if they don't follow the same concept? I know in essence they are different but statistically speaking? I can use T-test to find difference between general weighted average of school 1 vs. school 2. I can also use t-test to find the difference between dry weight of lettuce after addition of fertilizer 1 and fertilizer 2. The first one is mere data collection while the other is experimentation. Yet I know I need large sample sizes in the first one and not that much replicates ( I reckon 5 is kinda acceptable don't you think? ) for the second one. Why is this so? My understanding when it comes to computation(not concept) is that replicates per group/treatment = sample size per group. Is this wrong? Whenever I Google "replicates for t test" they always puts me to sample size search results. Even Google doesn't know the difference apparently.
