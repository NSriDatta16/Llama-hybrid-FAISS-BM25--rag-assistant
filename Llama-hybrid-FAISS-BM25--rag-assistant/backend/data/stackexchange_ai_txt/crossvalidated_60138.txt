Did you read this article which I pointed you to a discussion about? It talks about using a permutation test comparing means when the variances differ (and other cases) and shows that if the means are equal (on the population level) but the variances differ, there are cases where the type I error will not be what it is claimed to be. This is not that hard of a process to simulate either, you could learn a lot for yourself by simulating the cases you are interested in and exploring the behavior of the tests. This of course begs the question of whether comparing the means is even an interesting or appropriate question if the variances differ strongly. If you needed to lower your cholesterol and your doctor told you that 2 medicines for lowering cholesterol had the same mean amount dropped after 2 months on the medication, would you be happy taking either one? Or would you want to know that while the subjects taking the 1st medicine lowered their scores between 15 and 35 points while the majority of those in the second group actually raised their cholesterol score, but a few in the study had their scores plummet to extremely low levels (from which they later died)? Or when comparing the average family income of 2 countries is it meaningful to say they have the same average family income where one country has a fairly even distribution of wealth and the other is mostly poverty with a couple of millionaire warlords?
