1: When your application is resumed by onResume() your previous Bitmap objects are loaded once again. You need to make sure you don't allocate all Bitmap objects one more time. 2: It's very often it's memory leaks that causing these errors. The Bitmap objects still have references to their initializon state when your application is resumed. You can use a specific pattern to prevent reallocating same Bitmap objects. This pattern is called Memory Pools and it prevents fragmentation of your memory. Think of fragmentation like this: You're trying to park a car. A stupid human parked a little too much to right and another stupid human parked a little too much to left. That slot is fragmented. Originally you should have enough of space to park your car right in that spot but the parking area itself is now fragmented. There's no empty slot for your car - the parking area is running out of memory . To prevent that scenario, you can use the Memory Pools pattern. By using this pattern you can: Set a total maximum of Bitmap objects you will use during the application's lifetime. Ask for an empty slot when your application is resumed and then reinitialize your Bitmap objects instead of reallocate them. By using this pattern you need to make sure: That you have enough space for your Bitmap objects in the specific pool. However , the solution of part two isn't necessary at all (hey, it's a good tool). The short solution : You can't create same amount of Bitmap objects when the application is resumed when you still have old Bitmap references in memory. Check if you already have your Bitmap objects loaded when your application is resumed and if you don't, create them.
