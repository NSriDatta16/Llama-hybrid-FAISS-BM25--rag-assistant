LibSVM hasn't been getting reliable performance for me, of late. Have you tried using SVMLight ever? You might also try looking at which features are showing the most predictive power in your model, and adding some sort of enriched-type feature. For example, if I were classifying documents on whether they contain information related to protein-protein interaction, I wouldn't really care about the specific names of the proteins as predictive features. I would pre-process my documents and normalize all protein mentions with some common term that wouldn't normally occur in my documents, like "THISWORDUSEDTOBEAPROTEIN". Previous research (sorry, I can't think of any citations off the top of my head except my own paper Ambert & Cohen, 2012 ) has shown that this can lead to improved classifier performance by preventing the classifier from getting distracted by common genes (e.g., ADH1A) and ignoring rare ones, instead combining the predictive power of all genes into a single feature you could think of as "GeneMentioned".
