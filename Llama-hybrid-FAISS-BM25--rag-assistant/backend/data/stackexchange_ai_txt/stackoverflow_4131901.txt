You are correct that the onClick event of the OnClickListener only takes a single View as an argument. However, both the Button and EditText classes are descendants of the View class, so you can use this one parameter to check which button triggered the event. The code below provides a simple example: OnClickListener listener = new OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { if (v == bt1Decrement) { // Decrement field 1 } else if (v == bt1Increment) { // Increment field 1 } // else if... continue to check for the rest of the buttons } }; You can then use this single listener for all your buttons. The above code could probably be done in a much more elegant way (e.g. keep references to the buttons in some array structure you could loop over), but it illustrates the point :)
