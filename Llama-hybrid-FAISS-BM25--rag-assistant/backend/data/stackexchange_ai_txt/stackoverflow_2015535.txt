Specification Pattern vs Specific Hibernate Query

My question is when to use a specification pattern, and when to use specific SQL query. I understood that specific pattern need to collect whole collection and post filter using concrete specification. But i dont't understand the advantage in front of specific SQL query. CarColorSpecification cc = new CarColorSpecification(RED); CarAgeSpecification ca = new CarAgeSpecification(OLDER, 5); ISpecification finalSpec = cc.And(ca); List res; List carColl = service.getCars(); foreach(Car c in carColl) { if(finalSpec.isSatisfiedBy(c)) { res.add(c); } } And the same in SQL / Hibernate FROM Car c WHERE c.color = RED AND c.age > 5 I think it depends of the data volume to process.
