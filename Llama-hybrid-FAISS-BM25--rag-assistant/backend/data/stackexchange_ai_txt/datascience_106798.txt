Approaches for multiclass classification with a reference level to extract variables of importance?

I have a dataset with with multiple classes ( My first naive approach would be to subset the dataset and compare individually each non-reference class to the reference using any number of appropriate methods, starting with generalised linear model and / or random forest, determine model performance and extract VIPs for each comparison. Basically a loop. However this feels inelegant, so I am wondering which other approaches should be considered for problem.
