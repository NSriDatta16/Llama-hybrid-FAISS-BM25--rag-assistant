Attention conservation notice: this is a long comment. Sure -- this approach is called instance-based learning and matches current weather patterns to the "best matches" among previously-observed weather conditions; an introduction appears in Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques. Your proposal merges matching and an explicit generalization (regression). Some things to consider: How do you measure similarity to previous instances? I don't know anything about your data, but I suspect there are patterns that have resulted in different patterns at subsequent intervals. A second part of building the model will be considering how to combine/weight the previous instances with the regression forecast to make a prediction. This can be done by simple averaging or more complicated methods like weighting the instances according to how similar they are, according to some metric. I'm not familiar with rapidminer so I'm afraid my answer is not complete with respect to your tool-specific advice.
