If you definitely need database storage, and the comments elsewhere about alternatives are worth considering, then I'd advise against storing 200-odd responses in 200-odd rows: you don't seem to have any obvious need for the flexibility that such a design would give and performance across hundreds of thousands of respondents is going to be dire. Using a RDBMS gives you the ability to store very large amounts of data, access them in a variety of multi-dimensional ways and extend the structure of your data ad hoc over time. But what you gain in flexibility over a flat file (or Marshalled, or other) option you often lose in performance. I have to confess to reaching for third normal form far too early myself. I guess the questions are, how much flexibility in querying do you expect to need, and how much change do you think your data is likely to undergo? If you think you're at the low end of both, consider leaving the SQL on the shelf. If you abstract your data access into a separate layer then changing should be cheap later. Just a thought... I'd expect you can encode an individual's response in such a way that it can easily be used in code and it's unlikely to take more than 200 characters, less if you use some sort of packing or bit-mapping. I rather like the idea of bit-mapping, come to think of it - it makes simple comparison using something like Hamming distance an absolute breeze.
