How to assess performance when it greatly varies from year to year?

We have an annual performance metric for a number of educational institutions. The figure for any one institution varies a lot from year to year, as it depends very greatly on the student cohort, but there is a clear correlation between the metric for any two years (Pearson correlation coefficient varies from .22 to .36). Is there a statistic that we can calculate which combines several years to estimate of how much of the variation between institutions is caused by the institution itself (the remainder being due to the cohort). [note 1: We are fully aware that not all the factors are under the control of the institution, some are dependent on the environment where the institution is situated]. [note 2: There are over 100 institutions, but only 3 years data at present (5 years soon)]. [note 3: The naive approach is to average the three years, but I hope there is something better we can do]. [note 4: I have looked at multiple correlation, but that seems to be answering a different problem (multiple factors influencing the outcome); we have multiple values for the outcome]. Thank you very much! James
