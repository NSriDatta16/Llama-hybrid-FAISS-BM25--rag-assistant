A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) gives a point estimate of a parameter. In that regard, no, you do not get a distribution. What might be reasonable to regard as a frequentist analogue of a Bayesian posterior distribution is the sampling distribution, but you get a sampling distribution from any frequentist estimation technique, not just MLE. Ways of obtaining sampling distributions include calculations based on theory to bootstrapping the data and calculating an estimate for each bootstrap sample. I would not want to interpret a sampling distribution as a posterior distribution, however, as parameters in frequentist statistics have fixed (unknown) values instead of distributions like they do in Bayesian statistics.
