If I understand what you are proposing correctly. I would do the first approach. It leverages what you have already built. I would use the hash tables for caching inside of wrapper classes that can provide stongly typed interfaces for the properties. For example: /// /// The time passwords expire, in days, if ExpirePasswords is on /// public int PasswordExpirationDays { get { return ParseUtils.ParseInt(this["PasswordExpirationDays"], PW_MAX_AGE);} set { this["PasswordExpirationDays"] = value.ToString(); } }
