Entity Framework 4 Include + Table joining does not work together

I want to select the employee with loaded photo and telephone entities. I am using such query: var empl = from user in ObjectContext.Users from employee in ObjectContext.Employees.Include("Photo").Include("HomeTelephone") where user.Id == userId && employee.Id == user.EmployeeId && employee.Deleted == false && employee.OwnerOrganizationId == Singleton.OrganizationId select employee; var result = empl.FirstOrDefault(); the result have nulls for Photo and HomeTelephone properties, but has PhotoId and HomeTelephone set... What I am doing wrong?
