If $x$ is not stochastic, then $y$ is just an affine transformation of the multivariate normal variable $\epsilon$ . When $x$ is stochastic, no distributional assumption is needed. All that is required is that the conditional distribution of $y$ given $x$ is normal and the marginal distribution of $x$ is unrestricted (see Hansen, Econometrics , p. 141). As to $\theta$ , in a frequentist setting parameters are just unknown numbers, and one would rather write $p(y;x,\theta)$ , but in a bayesian setting parameters are random variables. And Murphy is going to introduce Bayesian concept learning ...
