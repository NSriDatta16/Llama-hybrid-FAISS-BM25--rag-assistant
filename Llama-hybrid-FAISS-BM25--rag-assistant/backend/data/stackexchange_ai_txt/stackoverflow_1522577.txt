Flash CS4 Rotating Around Z Axis Without Distorting For Stage Center, Is It Possible?

I've got three boxes rotating around their Z axis respectively. What I'm trying to do is keep them rotating around their respective Z axis without distorting if I move them away from the center of my stage. addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, rotateBoxes); function rotateBoxes(e:Event):void { box1.rotationY-=10; box2.rotationY+=10; box3.rotationY-=10; } example here http://www.hupcapstudios.com/tween1.swf is there a built in parameter like... box1.globalPerspective = false; it's more noticeable rotating around the x axis example http://www.hupcapstudios.com/tweenXswf
