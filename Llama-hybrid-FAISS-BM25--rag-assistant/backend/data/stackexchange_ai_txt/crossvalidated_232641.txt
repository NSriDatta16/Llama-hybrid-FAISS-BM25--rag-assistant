Oh, I've been a frequentist for many's the year, And I've spent all my time playing the data by ear, But now I'm returning with Bayes in great store, And I never will play the frequentist no more. For it's no nay never, no nay never, no more, Will I play the frequentist, no never, no more! I went into a lab where I used to consult. The gave me some data, said 'p that for us', I said 'No way, Jose' with a bit of a smile, P values and evident just don't reconcile! Chorus I said it's your prior that we need to shed light, And the researcher's eyes opened wide with delight, He said, 'My prior views are as good as the rest, And for sure a Bayes factor is what will work best!' Chorus I'll go back to my teachers, confess what I've done, And ask them to pardon their prodigal son, But when they've forgave me, as often before, I never will play the frequentist no more! Chorus And it's no, nay never, no nay never no more, Will I play the frequentist, no never, no more!
