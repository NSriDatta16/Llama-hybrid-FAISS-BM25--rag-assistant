Here are a couple suggestions, given that Gaussian mixture models work well for you in the absence of outliers. To increase robustness to outliers, you could use a trimmed estimator for Gaussian mixture models instead of fitting with the standard EM algorithm. Some relevant papers: Neykov et al. (2007) . Robust fitting of mixtures using the trimmed likelihood estimator. Gallegos and Ritter (2009) . Trimmed ML Estimation of Contaminated Mixtures. Instead of Gaussian mixture models, you could also consider student T mixture models. This will give the same properties you want (e.g. ability to compute cluster centroids and membership probabilities). Student T distributions have heavier tails than Gaussians, which increases robustness to outliers. Some relevant papers: Peel and McLachlan (2000) . Robust mixture modelling using the t distribution. Svensen and Bishop (2005) . Robust Bayesian Mixture Modelling. Archambeau and Verleysen (2007) . Robust Bayesian clustering.
