Why would you want that? A released version is supposed to never change. Updating one of the snapshot dependencies risks breaking the system. I see two approaches: Either you have control over the source code of your dependencies, in which case I recommend you to go through the, albeit tedious, process of releasing those projects. If you don't control the source code you can still rename the binary and manually upload it to your release server. You might still take this approach even for projects under your control, although I strongly encourage you not to.
