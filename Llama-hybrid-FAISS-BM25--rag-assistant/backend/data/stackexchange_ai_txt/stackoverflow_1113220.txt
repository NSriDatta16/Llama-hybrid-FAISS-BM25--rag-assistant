Need advice on selecting a clustered index for a logging table

I use SQL Server 2005. I have a simple logging table that my web application uses to track user activities and urls visited. The table design is very simple ID (identity value), LogDate (datetime), Activity (nvarchar(200)), Url (nvarchar(1000)) We mainly do Inserts into this table. Once in a while, our perform some queries against this table if we want to investigate a particular user's activities over a date period. The table currently has an identity column as its primary key. This is also its clustered index. I'm wondering if it is better for me to change its clustered index into the LogDate column. The LogDate column stores the date/time of the activity and can have duplicates, but since we are always inserting into the table, new records should be always at the end of the table, so there is no reason for SQL Server to have to regorganise or do page splits that would impact Insert performance. Having the LogDate column as the clustered index should also help search performance. Please let me know if my reasoning is correct. Thank you!
