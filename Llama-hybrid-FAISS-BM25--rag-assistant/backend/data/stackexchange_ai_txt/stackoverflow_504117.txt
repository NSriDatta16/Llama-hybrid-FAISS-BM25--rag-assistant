Another service you might want to look at is the Elastic Block Store (EBS), which provides persistent storage for an EC2 instance. The default storage that you get with an instance is not persisted if you shut down the instance, so I'd recommend storing all your critical data on EBS so that you can recover quickly if an instance goes down. SimpleDB might also be useful for your service. Have a look at the Wikipedia entry for AWS to learn more about each service.
