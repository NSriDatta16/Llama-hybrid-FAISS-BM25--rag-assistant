referential integrity in XML files without globally unique IDs

Maybe I'm not seeing the forest for the trees, but here it goes: I'm "designing" an XML document and have so far come up with something like the following: ... ... ... So it's a simple hierarchical structure. What I want to do now is have references from one element to any other element anywhere in the hierarchy. That would be trivial if each element had a unique ID, but they don't. So far I only plan on guaranteeing that each element's key is unique within its level (much like file names in a directory structure). In other words, if I had fully qualified keys such as root.foo , guaranteeing referential integrity would be simple. But then I'd be storing redundant information (I already know that foo is a sub element of root , why store that information twice?). I realize that this is essentially a cosmetic problem. One of the simplest solutions is probably to just auto-assign IDs and be done with it. But this is fairly inelegant (and error-prone unless you have a nice front end for editing the file), so I was hoping for a nicer way to do it. Is there a way to implement this in XML Schema?
