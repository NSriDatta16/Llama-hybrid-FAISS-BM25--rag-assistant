Which is the right method of analysis for data over one time-period?

I am in the process of designing a survey that will collect data from users of services provided by my organization. We will collect data from all those users (other smaller organizations) working with us; therefore, we will have data about the whole population. We will design the survey in such a way that we get only numeric observations: continuous, discrete and categorical variables. At first I thought I would use panel data analysis, but the problem is that I will -at first- have data over just one time-period. The question then is, can I still use panel data analysis? Which other method would it fit best this kind of dataset?
