I think (according to this page ) that the position should be available as $('your element').data('draggable').offset Inside the drag callback you should be able to do $('your element').draggable({ drag: function(event, ui) { //Here you have available ui.position.top and ui.position.left } }); Remember that position uses coordinates relative the parent element and offset relative to the page. Of course you can switch between the two by adding or subtracting the parent coordinates (relative to the page). As for saving and restoring positions in the database, you can use the AJAX methods of jQuery, and is a completely different problem.
