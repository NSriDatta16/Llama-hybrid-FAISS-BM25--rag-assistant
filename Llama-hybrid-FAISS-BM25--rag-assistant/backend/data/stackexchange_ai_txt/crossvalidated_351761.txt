In a linear regression like $Y=wX+\epsilon$, i.e., when $$\mathbb{E}[Y|X]=wX\quad\text{and}\quad\text{var}(Y|X)=\sigma^2$$the model is defined conditional on $X$, whether or not $X$ is considered as a random variable. There is thus no reason for the prior on the coefficient $w$ not to depend on $X$ and there are many arguments for dependence, one being that the scale of $X$ impacts the scale of $w$ (as, e.g., when moving from meters to kilometres in the recording of the components of $X$). The most classical illustration is Arnold Zellner's so-called $g$-prior that sets $$p(w|X,\tau)\propto\exp\{-w^\text{T}(X^\text{T}X)w/2\tau^2\}\qquad p(\tau)\propto\tau^{-1}$$and relies on the OLS projection matrix $(X^\text{T}X)^{-1}$ as the variance of the Normal prior. In our book Bayesian Essentials with R , this approach is the one recommended for Bayesian linear regression.
