Using heuristics to understand table columns

I have a set of semicolon separated values extracted from a table and I need to process this data. Unfortunately, I don't know which column has what information. Here's some sample data: 5036;MORAN;68681J;FBOP;40;872,7;OUT 5037;MORAN;68624J;GFBOP;40;872,7;OUT 5038;ITAKHOOLI;12124J;TGFOP;40;712,7;245 5039;ITAKHOOLI;12183J;GBOP;40;872,7;125 5040;ITAKHOOLI;12294J;GBOP;40;832,7;125 5041;ITAKHOOLI;12421J;GBOP;32;792,7;125 5042;NYA GOGRA;87230K;TGFOP;20;732,7;OUT I know a few things about the data like: The column with the longest strings are the company name The columns with words GBOP, FBOP, etc are the category ( i have a list of them) The column with the sequential numbers is the lot number etc. If I knew which column would contain what, writing the script would be easy but I don't. The other problem is that the order of the data can change â€” the one i gave above was just an example. Is there a tool/gem which would allow me to write some rules to make sense of this data and organise it? Thanks. (Please change the title of the post if you think it could be more appropriate)
