The interpretation of the coefficients is as follows: time = -0.16462 denotes how much the average RNA viral load changes (here decreases) with unit of time for subjects with GENDER = 1 . GENDER2 = -0.32416 denotes the difference in average RNA viral loads between subjects with GENDER = 2 and GENDER = 1 . time:GENDER2 = 0.07643 denotes the difference between subjects with GENDER = 2 and GENDER = 1 in the average change of RNA viral load per unit of time. That is, the average RNA viral load changes with time + time:GENDER2 = - 0.16462 + 0.07643 per unit of time for subjects with GENDER = 2 .
