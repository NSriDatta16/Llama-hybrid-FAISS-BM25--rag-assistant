Installing Perl modules locally is a tad challenging. Here's my process: Setup user-localized CPAN config: mkdir -p ~/.cpan/CPAN touch ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm If CPAN was previously setup for site-wide admin (meaning, you're on your own box and already fired up and configured CPAN), you can change to user-local by: " perl -MCPAN -e mkmyconfig ". Then, edit " ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm ": 'makepl_arg' => q[LIB=/home/your_name/perllib], Otherwise, you can startup CPAN normally: " perl -MCPAN -e shell " or simply " cpan ". You'll be prompted for configuration. At the "Parameters for the 'perl Makefile.PL' command?", Enter: " PREFIX=~ LIB=~/lib/perl5 ". To reference locally installed modules in your Perl scripts, you can do the use lib pragma, but I think it's an annoying dependency when you have numerous perl scripts and modules to update in your app. This is more of a workaround. Instead, I can set the environment var PERL5LIB to the path where the module was installed locally, like " $HOME/lib/perl5 ". To set PERL5LIB for a CGI environment, figure out how to set environment variables in the server configuration. In Apache, I can do that in httpd.conf or in .htaccess using mod_env.
