Generating PDFs in Java using iText. Support for Free flowing text

We have pdf templates of the following nature that need to be generated by a web application: Sample Paragraph: Dear {customer.name}, Your lawyer, {customer.lawyer.name} has contacted us about your account, {customer.account.number} requesting immediate closure of the account. ... The {...} fields mentioned above are to accommodate the various acro fields that would be put in as placeholders, so that they can be populated with data. But the problem is that the {customer.lawyer.name} field can be of varying lengths, 10 characters to 50 characters, Using iText, how can we generate a pdf for the above template such that varying lengths of the variable can be accommodated? Maybe even wrap the text around appropriately?
