Ok, after the study of the component i got the fact that is not an easy question. How can we use another filetypes? /administrator/components/com_media/models/list.php on line 116 exists a switch which works as a filter If we want to add a new functionality (with a button)... Where can we add the button? /administrator/components/com_media/views/images/tmpl/default.php Where can we add the javascript functionality? /media/media/js/popup-imagemanager.js Doing that we have some problems 1) we need to hardcode in every joomla. 2) I'm not sure, but the changes might be delete after a Joomla Updated. Another chance is make a fork of the media component with theses changes ready to install. Byes Thanks to the tumbleweed badget to encourage me to write the response.
