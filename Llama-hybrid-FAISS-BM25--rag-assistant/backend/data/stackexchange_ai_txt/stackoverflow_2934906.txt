Any real downside to using self-issued certs when dealing with known agents?

I'm setting up a web service which will only be used by a limited number ( Because I am not public facing, do I face any real downside to using self-issued certs as opposed to the much more costly route of using a known CA? Edit: I should clarify that the primary purpose we hope to get out of the certificates is to fulfil the 2nd factor in two-factor authentication (password for what-you-know, X.509 cert for what-you-have)
