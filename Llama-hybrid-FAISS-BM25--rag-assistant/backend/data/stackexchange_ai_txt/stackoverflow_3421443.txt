GDB will catch SIGSEGV before the application does. What you described in comment to Logan's answer makes no sense. I suspect what's really happening is that the application creates a new process, and only gets SIGSEGV in that other process, not the one you attached GDB to. The following commands may be useful if my guess is correct: (gdb) catch fork (gdb) catch vfork (gdb) set follow-fork-mode child You might also want to edit and expand your question: how do you know there is a SIGSEGV to begin with? Posting a log of your interaction with GDB may also prove useful.
