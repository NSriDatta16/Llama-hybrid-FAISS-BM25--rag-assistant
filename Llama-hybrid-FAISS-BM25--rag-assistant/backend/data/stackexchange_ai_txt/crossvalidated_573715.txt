RL environment can be modelled using MDP(Markov Decision Process), in case you are dealing with one single agent. If the environment consists of multiple agents, in this case it is called MultiAgent RL (MARL), then Game Theory (GT) may help. GT is used with MARL when there exists any sort of competition between the agents. But, if your agents will be fully cooperative (meaning that the agents cooperate together to achieve a common goal), in this case you may need to find some other approaches for coordination. MARL settings are divided into three categories: Competitive in which the agents have conflicting interests; each wants to maximize its own reward (e.g. , minmax algorithm in game theory). Cooperative in which all the agents coordinate and cooperate to maximize a shared reward. Mixed mode, it is hybridized from both.
