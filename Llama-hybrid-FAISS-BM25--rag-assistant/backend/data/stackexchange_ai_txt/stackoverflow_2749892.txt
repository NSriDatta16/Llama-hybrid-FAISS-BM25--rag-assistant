Not everything in app/models has to be an ActiveRecord model. Since they directly pertain to the business logic of your application, they belong in the app directory, not the lib directory. They are also neither controller, view, or helper (helpers are there to help the views and the views alone). So, they belong in app/models. I would make sure to namespace them, just for organizational purposes into app/models/scrapers or something of that sort.
