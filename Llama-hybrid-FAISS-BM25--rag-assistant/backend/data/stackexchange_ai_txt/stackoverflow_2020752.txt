Smoothly drag a Sprite in cocos2d - iPhone

I have implemented a drag on a sprite object as follows.. -(BOOL)ccTouchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate: [touch locationInView:touch.view]]; [diskSprite setPosition:ccp(location.x , location.y )]; return kEventHandled; } but this dragging is not smooth..... when i drag fast with my thumb the object left from the path. Thanks
