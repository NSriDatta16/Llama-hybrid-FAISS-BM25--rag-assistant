Putting an $a_i$ weight on a feature in your similarity measure is equivalent so scaling your data set by $1/w_i$. In other words, you are asking about data preprocessing and scaling. This is too broad to be answered well in a single question. Look for: feature selection feature weighting normalization dimensionality reduction other projection techniques other distance functions "learning to rank" There is a massive amount of literature and even conference tracks dedicated to this. Some methods to get you started: Fisher's linear discriminant analysis Large Margin Nearest Neighbors
