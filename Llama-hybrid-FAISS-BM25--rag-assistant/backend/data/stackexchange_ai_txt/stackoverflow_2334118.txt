click on search. The browser takes me to another page Actually it doesn't. In the new Google interface, what it has actually done is to remain on the existing page, but replace the search form with a list of search results, fetched via XMLHttpRequest. It then changes the #fragmentIdentifier part of the URL to store the search information so that you can still navigate and bookmark the URL as if the search results were a different page. Here, my script isn't injected No, but your script is still present, from when it was loaded at the search form. If you need your script to detect that the #hash part of the URL has changed, representing an internal navigation, there is the HTML5 onhashchange event. However it is only supported in Firefox 3.6 (and a few other browsers), so for extensions compatibility with older Firefoxen you would need to use a setInterval -style poller checking location.hash to determine when this happens.
