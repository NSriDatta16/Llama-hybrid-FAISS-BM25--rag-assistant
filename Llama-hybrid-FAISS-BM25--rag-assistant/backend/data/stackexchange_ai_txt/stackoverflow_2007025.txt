I have had this discussion a number of times with a number of different people at my organization. I don't think user accounts should ever be deleted. If only for the basic case of being able to easily maintain a record of what the user did. I suggest having a status for users, like active, on_hold, deactivated. Then all you need to to is to deactivate a user account as needed. Of course, when "selecting" a user, you need to verify they are active. This also makes it easier if a user comes back to an organization.
