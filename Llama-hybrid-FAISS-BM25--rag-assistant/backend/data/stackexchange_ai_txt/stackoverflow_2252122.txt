When files are saved the bytes they use is put into allocated blocks, if the file grows and the next consecutive block is not available, the OS starts writing to the next available block, splitting the file into 2 fragments. Defragmentation collects files into consecutive blocks by moving blocks out of the way (into free space) so that the file being defragmented can have consecutive blocks. for non Solid State hard drives this affects performance (as there is no seek time reading consecutive blocks) Some defragmenters move more commonly read files to the outside of the disk (since it spins faster the further away from the spindle it is).
