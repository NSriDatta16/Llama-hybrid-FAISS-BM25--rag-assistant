Those E3 bytes are not "escape characters". If one had no access to documentation, and was forced to make a guess, the most likely suspect for the response encoding would be UTF-8. Expectation (based on a one-week holiday in Japan): something like "konnichiwa". >>> response = "\xE3\x81\x93\xE3\x82\x93\xE3\x81\xAB\xE3\x81\xA1\xE3\x81\xAF" >>> ucode = response.decode('utf8') >>> print repr(ucode) u'\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f' >>> import unicodedata >>> for c in ucode: ... print unicodedata.name(c) ... HIRAGANA LETTER KO HIRAGANA LETTER N HIRAGANA LETTER NI HIRAGANA LETTER TI HIRAGANA LETTER HA >>> Looks close enough to me ...
