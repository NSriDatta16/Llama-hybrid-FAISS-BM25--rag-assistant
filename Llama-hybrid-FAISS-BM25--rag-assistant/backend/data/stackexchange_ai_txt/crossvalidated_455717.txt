In 1993, I called this method prior feedback . In 1998, we used it for hidden Markov models with Mike Titterington . In 2002, we also exploited this idea in a Statistics and Computing paper with Arnaud Doucet et Simon Godsill under the acronym of SAME (state augmentation for marginal estimation). The later was "reinvented" by several authors like Lele's 2007 data cloning , Gaetan & Yao's 2003 multiple imputation Metropolis , and Johannes & Polson's 2007 MCMC maximum likelihood , The approach converges to a point mass at the maximum likelihood estimator, provided it stands within the support of the prior. It is much more "annealing" (since this almost amounts to spiking the likelihood to an ever increasing power) than "bootstrapping", although increasing the bootstrap sample would eventually come to the MLE as well.
