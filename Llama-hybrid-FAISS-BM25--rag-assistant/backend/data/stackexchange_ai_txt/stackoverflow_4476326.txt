A declaration describes an object, whereas a definition requests the creation of an object. All definitions are also declarations , but the reverse is not true. In the case of int a; , what it is depends on where it is placed in the source code: Within a function, int a; is a definition - it requests the creation of an int variable with automatic storage duration (and of course also a declaration); At file scope, the answer is different in C and C++. In C, int a; is a tentative definition (of which there can be more than one, as long as the types and linkage are agreeable); in C++, it is an ordinary definition with external linkage. Within a struct or union specifier, int a; is a declaration of a member.
