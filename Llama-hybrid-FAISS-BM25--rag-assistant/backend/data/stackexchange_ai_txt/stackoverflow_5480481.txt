In a strictly egalitarian solution everyone receives the same value. That is not possible in the example. However, the egalitarian social welfare solution is defined as that which maximizes the minimun value received by any agent (see page.79 of my multiagent systems textbook ) In this case, there is a tie between two solutions: A B A: {p} B: {q} 10 5 A: {q} B: {p} 15 5 You can further refine egalitarian social welfare solution concept as you see fit.
