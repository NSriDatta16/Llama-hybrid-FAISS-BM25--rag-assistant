If you don't want your domain to be tightly coupled to your database, then your choices are pretty much: NHibernate Entity Framework Linq 2 Sql as you've discovered generates code from your database layer, so that's out of the question. Same goes for Subsonic and LLBLGen Pro (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong). Entity Framework used to fall into this boat as well, but version 4 has shipped with "code first" support so it's definitely an option. Both NHibernate and Entity Framework support LINQ queries, although Entity Framework's LINQ support is supposedly superior to that of NHibernate's. I agree that HQL and Criteria queries are not nearly as elegant as LINQ, but I have a feeling NHibernate's LINQ support will be vastly improved come version 3.0.
