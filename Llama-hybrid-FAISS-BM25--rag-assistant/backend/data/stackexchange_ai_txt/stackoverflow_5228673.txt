The first thing to notice is that if you try the URL in your browser, the file does download. What that tells you is that you need to configure the WebClient to send headers mimicking what the website would expect a browser to do. This is what works for me: var wc = new WebClient(); var ua = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)"; wc.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent, ua); wc.Headers["Accept"] = "/"; wc.DownloadFile("http://www.nseindia.com/content/historical/EQUITIES/2011/MAR/cm07MAR2011bhav.csv.zip", @"d:\myfile.txt"); As an aside, saving to the C: root is problematic. Save somewhere else.
