In case its still relevant - have a look at the Mindscape NHibernate Designer if you are interested in a Visual Studio integrated option. Some more screenshots are here Its probably the closest to what you would get with Subsonic, and it covers most of the commercial databases out there for the drag/drop and 2 way round tripping, so its pretty easy to cover off most modelling concerns. Note: I am one of the founders of Mindscape, so have a clear bias towards the product :)
