I dispute your main premise. A prior distribution is your guess (hopefully a good guess, but still a guess). Then you observe data and see what really happens. When you have enough observations that contradict your original guess, it is reasonable to change your mind. What youâ€™re observing strikes me as a feature, not a bug, of Bayesian inference.
