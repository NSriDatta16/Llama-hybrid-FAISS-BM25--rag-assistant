I agree with Welbog, I think you might be asking too much of regex' in this situation. I would recommend a 2 pass approach. According to RegexBuddy , the following will match your target paragraphs of arbitary length (Start)(\r\n)((.*)\2)+?(End) I would use the above regex to pull out the matching paragraphs in your text and then use simple regex or string replace function to exchange the the Cr Lf chars to pipes.
