Which property of stationarity is violated by a time series with regular cycles?

in the answers given to this question Can stationary time series contain regulary cycles and periods with different fluctuations it is said that a stationary time series is not allowed to have regular cycles. According to my search a stationary time series has 3 properties: Expactation value is constant for every t Variance is constant for every t Autocovariance is constant for every t Which of those is violated by a time series with regular cycles? I'd appreciate every comment.
