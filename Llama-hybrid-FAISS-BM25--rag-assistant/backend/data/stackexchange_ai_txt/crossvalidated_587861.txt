Is time series regression closer to forecasting or classification?

I'm working on multivariate time series regression task. The literature for it seems quite light compared to the problems of Time series classification (using algorithm like rocket for example) and Time series forecasting (using algorithm like Temporal fusion Transformers or Arima). I'm not sure how to choose a model inspired by forecasting methods or classification method for a given specific regression problem. My instinct would be that forecasting methods take more into account issues with dynamic processes like trend/periodicity while classification methods seems to be benchmarked on static data with clear start and end of a time series period like a movement with motion capture, or Electrocardiography data (one heart beat). So my question would be what to look for in a use case to choose a time series regression method ? and is there literature about this subject ?
