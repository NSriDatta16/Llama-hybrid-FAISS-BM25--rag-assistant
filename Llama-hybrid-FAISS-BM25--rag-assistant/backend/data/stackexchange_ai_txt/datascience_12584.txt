Can we use Stop Words while using multinomial navies theorem?

I'm collecting Twitter tweets for sentiment analysis. I chose to use Multinomial Navies theorem for finding the sentiment. I found some examples of SVM theorem making use of stop words. My question is: can we apply stop words in Multinomial Cavies theorem or not?
