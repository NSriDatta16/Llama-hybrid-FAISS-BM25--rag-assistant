If you're using a regular classification algorithm like SVM, it's not very surprising that the model fails to find any indication in the features if the features consist only of the word and this boolean feature. This kind of task is usually done with a sequence labelling model like CRF : such models learn indications from the context of the sentences in order to detect entities. For example in the sentence "X said that ..." the model can use the next word "said" to detect "X" as an entity. In case you want to keep using SVM, you could try to add some context features. This would probably help a bit but it wouldn't work as well as a CRF model.
