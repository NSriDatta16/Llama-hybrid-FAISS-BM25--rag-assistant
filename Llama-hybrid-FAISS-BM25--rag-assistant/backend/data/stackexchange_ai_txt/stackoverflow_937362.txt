I feel kind of dumb, but maybe this could be useful to someone else... What I failed to mention in my description (because I didn't think it was relevant) was the fact that I also instantiated a UINavigationBar to have an Edit button in the upper-right corner. In a nutshell, the nav bar was obscuring the first record in the table. The reason why I couldn't see this is because I did this: [self.tableView addSubview:navBar]; and what that did was to "stick" the navBar to the table, so scrolling could not reveal the missing row. When I changed that line to: [self.appDelegate.window addSubview:navBar]; I could drag the first record out from under the navBar because they then become sibling views. I apologize for the misplaced question.
