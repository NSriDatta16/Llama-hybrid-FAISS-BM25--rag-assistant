Activity layout inheritance

I start develop application on Android! I need to show common control on the top of few screens. In Blackberry I just inherit my screens from base screen with needed controls and it inherit UI and behaviour from base type. How can i do similar thing in Android? I mean, how can i organize it? Maybe, i need to create control or layout, which i can use on my screens? Or i need inherit one activity from another and use addContentView()? What opportunities are there and what advantages / disadvantages of each?
