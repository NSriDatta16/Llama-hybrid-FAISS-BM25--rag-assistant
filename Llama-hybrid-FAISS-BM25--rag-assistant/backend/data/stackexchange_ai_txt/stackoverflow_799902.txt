You will probably save a lot of time if you use full text search in the sql server ? That will let you query the files as well as handle some very complex queries. It is able to search inside blobs using iFilters (like microsoft frontpage) This is a good primer to the basics http://aspalliance.com/1512_understanding_full_text_search_in_sql_server_2005 . Doing it this way you can leverage the work MS did in full text search; and gain from their interfaces if your file types are not supported (most comment document formats are supported directly or but their producer doc, docx, xls, pdf etc)
