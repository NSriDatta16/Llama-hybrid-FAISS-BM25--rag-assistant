generate random exponentially distributed X data between zero and a max value

For my work issues, I need to generate random exponential distributed X data between zero and a max value. In my specific case range is (0,750) I know about inverse distribution function (IDF) for exponential distribution. And if I create 10K random x values by using exponential IDF, then select the ones lower from 750; I think this won't be true and suitable for my case. I don't know why but I think this'll create some other distribution. (concluded after reading some posts here) So I ask for the methodology steps required or any post here or any tutorial. Maybe I searched very inefficiently on the web cause I couldn't find any methodology info. Can you please help me? Best regards EDIT for a better understanding of the question I mean: a histogram of my data should resemble the exponential PDF. max value of the generated random numbers can be 750. Assume I know the methodolgy and created n pieces random values with lambda value = 0,0004. If any other engineer would analyze these n failure time data, again he/she should say that "these data are distributed exponentially and the lambda value is 0,0004" I hope these paragraphs tell what I meant better.
