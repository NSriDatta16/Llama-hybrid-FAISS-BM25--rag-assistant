Analytical relationship between prior and posterior distributions by Markov Chain Monte Carlo?

I am trying to conceptualize the analytical relationship between the prior distribution and posterior distribution obtained by MCMC for Bayesian inference. Sorry for the non-rigorous notation but I hope it still communicates the idea. This thesis by Zhou suggests that the posterior $\Pr(X^n) = \Pr(X^n | \textit{data})$ of parameter $X$ can be obtained through $n$ acceptance steps via the prior $\Pr(X^0)$ and product of transition probabilities $\Pr(X^t | X^{t-1}) = \Pr(X^t | X^{t-1}, \textit{data})$: \begin{equation} \Pr(X^n) = \Pr(X^0) \prod_{t=1}^n \Pr(X^t | X^{t-1}) \end{equation} ($\textit{data}$ is omitted to simplify notation.) Asher et al. writes that the limiting distribution that approximates the posterior distribution is obtained by: \begin{equation} \Pr(X^n) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr(X^n | X^0) \end{equation} According to the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation , \begin{align} \Pr(X^n | X^0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Pr(X^n | x) \Pr(x | X^0) dx \end{align} My question is: I am not sure this relationship equivalent? \begin{align} \Pr(X^n | X^0) \stackrel{?}{=} \Pr(X^0) \prod_{t=1}^n \Pr(X^t | X^{t-1}) \end{align} Is there another way to conceptualize the relationship between $\Pr(X^0)$ and $\Pr(X^n)$ through transition probabilities?
