I may be wrong, but aren't data structures and algorithms independent of the programming languages? In the end, data structures are just a way of organizing data; any high level language will support that. Sure, certain languages will have mechanisms implementing basic data structures (such as Collections Framework in Java or C++ STL), but it does not stop you from programming data structure in the programming language of your choice. Moreover, algorithms are written in pseudocode, making them language independent. I realize it's not really answering your question, but I'm having trouble grasping what you are looking for; learning data structures/algorithms or learning a new language.
