Why does the sum of Poisson distributed random variables have a Poisson distribution but the average of the variables do not?

From a biology background and not strong in statistics. From what I have read the sum of Poisson distributed random independent variables have a Poisson distribution but the average of these variables do not have a Poisson distribution. Why is that, can someone show me the maths? I thought the average would still have a Poisson distribution. Some background: this concerns technical replicates in RNA-seq. Marioni et al found that technical replicates follow a Poisson distribution. Tools that accommodate technical replicates sum the values but do not average the values. I can accept this at face value but I would like to understand the maths/stats behind this.
