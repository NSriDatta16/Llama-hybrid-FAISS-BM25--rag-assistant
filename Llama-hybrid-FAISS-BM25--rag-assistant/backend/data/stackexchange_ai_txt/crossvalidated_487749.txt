In a simple linear regression, how does the slope affect the predictions?

This Question 11 from Applied Linear Regression Models chapter 1: The regression function relating production output by an employee after taking a training program (Y) to the production output before the training program (X) is $$E(Y) = 20 + .95X$$ where X ranges from 40 to 100. An observer concludes that the training program does not raise production output on the average because $\beta_1$ is not greater than 1.0. My thinking is just that since this is a line, for $40\leq X \leq 100$ : $X So the observer is wrong, the training program does raise production output. What does $\beta_1$ being less than 1 have to do with anything? EDIT: Since $$\beta_1=\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sum(X_i-\bar{X})^2}$$ In this situation we have: $$\beta_1=\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sum(X_i-\bar{X})^2} So $$\sum(Y_i-\bar{Y}) Does this help at all?
