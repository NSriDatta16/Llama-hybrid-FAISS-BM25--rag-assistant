Exception Driven Programming in Java

I just finished reading Exception Driven Programming and I'm wondering about something like ELMAH for Java. Did you know it? Interesting features: A web page to remotely view the entire log of recoded exceptions A web page to remotely view the full details of any one logged exception An e-mail notification of each error at the time it occurs An RSS feed of the last 15 errors from the log other interface (JSON, RESTful interface, etc) A number of backing storage implementations for the log, including in-memory, JDBC, JMS, etc open source NOTE log4j is for logging, it is not an integrated solution for exception handling
