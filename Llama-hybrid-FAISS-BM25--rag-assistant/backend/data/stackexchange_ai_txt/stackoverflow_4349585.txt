Data fetch from server

I have been developing an application for the Android for an organization but a problem has arisen. While my knowledge of programming is relatively fair, my use of Java has been more recent. Which is the largest part of my current issue, being that I need to know how to set up an application to fetch data from a server. The closest example would be a form of "news" applications that are currently available. Where you open the application, then it updates the currently available articles or audio. I have almost no knowledge of how to create or implement the necessary code to perform such a data fetch. Nor do I have the knowledge of what needs to be done server side to allow the application to fetch the relevant data. (Once again, this would be text articles and audio files) I have come to this forums to ask for help regarding my problem.
