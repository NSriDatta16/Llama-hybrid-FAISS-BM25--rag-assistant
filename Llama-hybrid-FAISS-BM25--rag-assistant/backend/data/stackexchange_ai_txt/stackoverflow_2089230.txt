Flex AS3 Project Convert to CS4

Has anyone got experience in converting AS3 projects (no mxml) in Flex, to Flash CS4? Are there any resources out there as to what works in Flex Builder that doesn't work in Flash, and how to get the project running? I read somewhere that (for instance) certain Metadata tags don't work. If I've got all my code in the src folder, should I just create the .fla file in that folder and basically copy all code from the .as file which launched the Flex project? Or create the .fla file somewhere else and point assign that src folder in the classpath? Also, not being familiar with the CS4 IDE, do I create a new Flash Project? Thanks! So here's the issue I'm having. The code in the Flex AS3 looks like this: [Embed(source='C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/ArialBD.TTF', fontWeight = 'bold', fontName='ArialBold', unicodeRange='U+0020-U+0020,U+0021-...')] //a bunch of other unicode public static var _VerdanaFontBold:Class; [Embed(source='C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/Arial.TTF', fontWeight = 'regular', fontName='Arial', unicodeRange='U+0020-U+0020...')] //a bunch of other unicode public static var _VerdanaFont:Class; And in constructor of the extended textfield in which my text appears I have: Font.registerFont(_VerdanaFontBold); Font.registerFont(_VerdanaFont); CS4 doesn't allow use of the Embed metadata. So I've commented that out. In CS4, I understand that I'm supposed to create a blank textfield in design mode, which I've done. I then can select fonts to embed. I've selected verdana (upper and lower case, punctuation, number, etc). When I run the app in CS4, the textfield is blank. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to give the verdana font an instance name of _VerdanaFont? I wouldn't think so, since I've had to comment out the Font.registerFont as well. The fact that I'm embedding the font in a blank textfield, and not the one that's called by the document class I've set, shouldn't matter, right -- the font should just be embedded in the swf and available for use. But it's blank. Does anyone know what to do here? Edit: Well given that the apparent reason this isn't working now has to do with fonts not showing up correctly, I better create that as a new Question. Also, there's a clearer description than the one in the link provided above regarding the document class, here: http://www.heaveninteractive.com/weblog/2008/03/04/introduction-to-the-document-class-in-actionscript-30-tutorial/
