Just as a suggestion, if you insist on using Neural Networks and in your live demo you may encounter new values, then my suggestion would be having an "unseen" value (e.g. with all 0 entries in one-hot-encoding schema) in the categorical features. It gives a degree of freedom to the system not to raise any error or something when sees a new thing. As you need to vectorize your input through a preprocessing step, the unseen value can be mapped to this dummy value. On the other hand you keep these unseen values and their manually annotated labels aside and, for a live system, retrain your model at certain time points (e.g. every night) using the new batch you already got so you can include them in your feature values this way. Of course in this case the performance of system improves by time as it will see more variations of data.
