Assuming you produce two models, one for predicting Bitcoin (BTC), one for predicting the other while always using both as inputs: For predicting BTC (imputing input only): Fill the last value from the work-week (e.g. Friday) as value for the weekend. For predicting the other (imputing input and output): You can do the same as above (will introduce a slight bias to predict values that appear on Fridays). Or you can consider discarding weekend BTC data and just treat the problem as time series without weekend.
