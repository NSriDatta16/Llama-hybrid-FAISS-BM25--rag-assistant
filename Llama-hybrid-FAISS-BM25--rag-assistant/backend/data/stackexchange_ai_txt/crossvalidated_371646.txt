Value Iteration For Terminal States in MDP

I am a little bit confused regarding the value iteration algorithm. When I loop over states should I visit the terminal states, if any, or not? In Sutton's book on page 83 it says that we do not need to visit the terminal states (loop over each state S, not S+) but every other reference does not make distinction between terminal and not terminal states.
