How can we estimate the combined causal effect of two separate parents in a Bayesian network?

Consider the following partially-defined Bayesian network: We know the probability of C given A is True and B is False We know the probability of C given A is False and B is True We know that C can only be true if at least one of A or B is True We do not know the probability of C given A and B are both True. (To ground this in reality, in the field of medicine it is possible to study a population of people affected by disease A but not disease B to find the prevalence of feature C in this population. However, it may be very difficult to find a large enough sample size of people affected by both A and B to get a sense of the prevalence of C in that group. We therefore need to estimate this. i.e. Asthma Attack might cause Cough in 40% of affected people, Bronchiolitis might cause Cough in 10% of affected people, so what is the probability of Cough in a person with both Asthma Attack and Bronchiolitis?) Is there an established method to estimate $P(C \cap A \cap B)$ in this case? Intuitively, it feels reasonable to imagine that in order for C to be False given both A and B are True, both A and B have to have individually FAILED to cause C. That is: $P(C^\complement|A∩B) = P(C^\complement|A∩B^\complement)\times P(C^\complement|A^\complement∩B)$ Following this, we could estimate $P(C | A \cap B) = 0.46$ (This assumes that A and B do not have some positive or negative synergistic effect (is there a better term for this?) on C when both are True) Are there other ways to make this estimate?
