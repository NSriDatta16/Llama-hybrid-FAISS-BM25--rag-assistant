If you are constrained from using the default process of changing the timeout value you will most likely have to do a lot more work. The following options come to mind Validate with your DBA's and another code review that you have truly optimized the query as best as possible Work on the underlying DB structure to see if there is any gain you can get on the DB side, creating/modifying an idex(es). Divide it into multiple parts, even if this means running procedures with multiple return parameters that simply call another param. (This option is not elegant, and honestly if your code REALLY is going to take this much time I would be going to management and re-discussing the 30 second timeout)
