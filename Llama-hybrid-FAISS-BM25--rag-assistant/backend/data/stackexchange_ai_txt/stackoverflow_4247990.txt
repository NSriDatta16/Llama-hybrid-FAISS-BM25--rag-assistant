I'm not sure what you mean by "an object-c dll for Mono". Your absolute best approach is to learn the platform you're targeting and port only the logic and general architecture. To access cameras, microphones, line-ins, etc. on Mac OS X, use QTKit (Quicktime Kit). It's mind-numbingly simple to set up a web cam view, record to files, grab frames, etc. It's built in and designed to make this sort of thing mostly drag-and-drop for developers.
