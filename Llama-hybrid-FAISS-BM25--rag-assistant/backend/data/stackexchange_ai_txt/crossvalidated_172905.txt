Bayesian estimation of GEE models

I'm facing a problem where I want to model a GEE with a tweedie distribution but it's not implemented in any R package that I found. I know that GEEs and linear mixture models (LMM) are somehow related but I'm not an expert. It's very easy to define an LMM in Bayesian terms and carry out parameter estimation in rStan for example. Is there a way to do this for GEEs as well? I'm interested in an example as well.
