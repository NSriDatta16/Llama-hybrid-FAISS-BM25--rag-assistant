Poisson data is normally distributed when the rate parameter $> 10$ ish. If even one of the count variables included in the factor analysis has an average rate close to 10, it seems straightforward that the resulting mixture of all those count variables could take on this distribution given the right circumstances. Furthermore, even binary random variables, when several are averaged will begin to approximate a normal distribution Still, if the variables input into the factor analysis don't relate linearly to each other, they're not going to load heavily, and you could miss out on predictive power. I.e., at times, $X$ might not load, but $X^2$ or $\text{log}(X)$ could
