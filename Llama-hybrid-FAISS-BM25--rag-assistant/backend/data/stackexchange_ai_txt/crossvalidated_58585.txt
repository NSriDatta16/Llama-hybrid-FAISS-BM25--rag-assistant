How to understand effect of RBF SVM

How can I understand what the RBF Kernel in SVM does? I mean I understand the maths, but is there a way to get a feeling when this kernel will be useful? Would results from kNN be related to SVM/RBF since the RBF contains vector distances? Is there a way to get a feeling for the polynomial kernel? I know the higher the dimension, the wigglier it is. But I'd like to get an intuition what the kernels do rather than try all possible kernels and pick the most successful.
