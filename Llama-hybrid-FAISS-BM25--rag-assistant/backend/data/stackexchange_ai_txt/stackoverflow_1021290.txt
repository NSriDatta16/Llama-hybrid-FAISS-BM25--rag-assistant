Referencing Javascript libraries with Tomcat

I am using Eclipse Ganymede and Tomcat 5.5 . I would like to add some javascript and especially ajax functionality to a dynamic web project and need some help. I would like to use jquery (but I am open to other suggestions, if you tell me why another library would be better in this case, but I have chosen jquery because it is supposed to be simple (which on the first look it seems to be)). I am having two problems: 1- Tomcat can't find the jquery library. I tried several things in my jsp file like: As you can see, I threw the jquery library in /WEB-INF/lib . Executing the jsp file within a browser without tomcat (with the last path version) works, so the path is correct. 2- There is no proper syntax highlighting within the dynamic web project for jquery and no popup suggestions. I also tried the information in this article , but it didn't change much.
