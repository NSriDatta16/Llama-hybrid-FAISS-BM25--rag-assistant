No, you can't hide HTML, and there's no point either. There's nothing of value in the HTML. It would take maybe a couple hours for a skilled developer to replicate the look and feel of a website without even glancing at the HTML. In fact, it would probably be easier for him to do it his way. The ASP/code-behind, however, already isn't visible. It's processed on the server and outputs HTML. Only the HTML (and CSS etc.) makes it to the client. Reading the comments, it appears you want to prevent users from downloading your images. You can't really do that either. You can make it a lot more difficult for users to download them by embedding the images in Flash, or a Java applet, or something like that, but a determined thief could still decompile it and nab your image. Easier yet, he could just take a screenshot and save it out. The best you can do is restrict access to the image to only certain users by making the image source point to a script instead that runs some validation before outputting the image.
