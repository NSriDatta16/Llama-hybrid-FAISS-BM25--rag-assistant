Any code dealing with rendering of your code should exist on the page itself via CSS and javascript. Your controllers should know nothing about how your data will be rendered on screen. The views shouldn't really even know anything about it either - they only expose the data that your CSS will render. The HTML your View spits out describes your data and how it is organized. Only the CSS should know how to make it look appropriate for whatever device is rendering it. This link , chock full of javascript should help determine which mobile browser is running.
