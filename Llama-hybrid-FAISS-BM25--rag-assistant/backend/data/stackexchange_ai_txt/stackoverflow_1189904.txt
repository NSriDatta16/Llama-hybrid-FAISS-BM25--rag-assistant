ODBC 5.1 Nothing appears in the database

I'm working on VS2005 and have tried using MySQL's ODBC to connect to a database. The problem is that when I get to the part of choosing which tables to use, there are no tables and the only selectable thing is a View, which has no name and is null (of course something like this doesn't really exist in the DB). I tried adding a Table adapter using SQL statements, which apparently works perfectly (tried also adding a Datagridview to make sure it's not a mirage and it worked perfectly) if I type the whole thing, but in the query builder it doesn't show me any tables to choose from (again if I type the name of the table, it appears but it still doesn't show it's columns). Also if I select the "Views" Tab, I get the following message: The query builder failed Attempt to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. If it wouldn't work using the hand typed SQL statements, I may have believed it, but apparently that is not the problem. So my question is: What is going on here? Anyone has ever heard of an issue like this? And even more important: Does anyone know how to fix this?
