If, and only if, the method of encryption is a one-to-one mathematical function, then it is possible to do so while the numbers are encrypted. For example, if my very unsecure method of encryption is to multiply every number of 2, then I would do the following: function encrypt($number){ return $number*2; } $a=encrypt(3); // a= 9 $b=encrypt(5); // b= 15 $c=encrypt(6); // c= 18 $average = ($a+$b+$c)/6; // We divide by 6 because first we divide by 3 to get the average, then by 2 to do the decryption. The method will vary based on the mathematical function. The only other possibility is to decrypt the numbers first.
