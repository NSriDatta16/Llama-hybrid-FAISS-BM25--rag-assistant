Grit's clone method is undefined?

I've recently started working on a project that uses git for storage and ruby as a front-end. The first version of my script used ruby-git, which was ok though pretty simple. When I needed to do more specific work with my commits and logs it was recommended that I move to grit. However, I've a road block early on- grit seems incapable of cloning remote repositories. All examples I've found using the Repository class create a local repository and searching through the source I've found Grit's clone method is undefined. What gives? This is my first StackOverflow question, so thanks in advance for any help.
