Yes, but you can't save it to a stream. A stream doesn't contain any data, it's just the means for accessing the actual storage. Get the data as a byte array, then you can put it in a session variable, save it as a file, and send it as a response. Use a BinaryReader to get the data from the input stream to a byte array: byte[] data; using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(uploadedFile.InputStream)) { data = reader.ReadBytes((int) uploadedFile.InputStream.Length); } (Edit: Changed from a StreamReader to a BinaryReader)
