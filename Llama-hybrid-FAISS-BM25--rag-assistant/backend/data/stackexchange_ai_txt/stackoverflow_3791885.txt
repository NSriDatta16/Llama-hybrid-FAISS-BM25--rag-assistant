Prefaced with: I'm not a lawyer nor e-commerce expert. If this is an international deal, there is no universal standard to check against. Furthermore, you shun businesses whose licenses are pending or independent owners not interested in the registration bureaucracy. Automation only works if a universal standard or single datasource pool for whatever it is you're automating is in place. Lacking that, you need an EULA to explain your business policy and to hold the user liable for fraudulent submissions. In lieu of the EULA, you may (depending on the jurisdiction and local laws) have the client complete an affidavit of some sort and require them to fax or scan/email it back to you before account activation. Follow up all submissions with a phone call to their business phone number as given to their local town council, BBB, commerce agency, or other local government, public service, or private organizational registrar just to confirm registration. The contact phone number, name, or email address they submit during registration on your site should only be something you double-check against, but never as a definitive contact resource. Furthermore, additional verification can be done by requiring a credit card purchase of a general service fee of the absolute minimum the card requires (typically $1 it seems). Though never full-proof, this credit card transaction serves only to ID the client. See Craigslist, USPS. I think I just answered your question with a "Ask a lawyer experienced in the field".
