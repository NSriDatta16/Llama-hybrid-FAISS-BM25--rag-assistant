What do you use to create flowcharts?

I'm curious what tools people have found useful for building flowcharts. Obviously MS Visio and OmniGraffle come to mind but they both feel so bloated and also tend to emphasize the document formatting/printing side and less on helping to organize the actual logic. Is there anything else out there that fellow developers would recommend? I'm hoping to find something fairly simple that would let me throw together flowcharts on the fly when I'm working through complex logic. I don't care about formatting or fonts or the like, just something that would help me keep my logic organized as I work through it. Even something that would arrange the chart itself and simply allow me to specify where to branch and what to check, etc. Any OS would be fine, though I personally lean towards OS X apps as this has recently been my primary work environment.
