After converting the table to the jqGrid you can use any methods of jqGrid. The standard way to delete a row in the jqGrid is delRowData method. $('#item_table').jqGrid('delRowData',rowid); To make the height of the grid automatically adjustable you can add the option height:'100%' . One more setting for the column definition title:false for all columns in the colModel , which title attribute should not be created, can be also helpful for you. One more small remark. Look at the formatter:'actions' or custom formatter which is very easy in use but allows you to create and HTML code fragment as the cells content. All the features could be interestring for the 'delete' coulmn.
