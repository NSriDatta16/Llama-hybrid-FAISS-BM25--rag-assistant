This is by no means a complete answer, the question you should be asking is "what kind of distances are preserved when doing dimensionality reduction?". Since clustering algorithms such as K-means operate only on distances, the right distance metric to use (theoretically) is the distance metric which is preserved by the dimensionality reduction. This way, the dimensionality reduction step can be seen as a computational shortcut to cluster the data in a lower dimensional space. (also to avoid local minima, etc) There are many subtleties here which I will not pretend to understand, (local distances vs global distances, how relative distances are distorted, etc) but I think this is the right direction to to think about these things theoretically.
