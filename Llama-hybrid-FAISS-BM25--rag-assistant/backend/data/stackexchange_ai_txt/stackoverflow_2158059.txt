You might want to take a look at MongoDB . From what I can tell you're looking for a database/distrubuted filesystem mix, which might be hard or even impossible to find. You might want to take a look at distributed filesystems like MooseFS or Gluster and keep your data as files. Both systems are fault-tolerant and distributed (you can put in and take out nodes as you like), and both are transparent to clients (built on top of FUSE) - you're using simple filesystem ops. This covers following features: 1), 2), 3), 4), 6), 7), 8). We're using MooseFS for digital movies storage with something aroung 1,5 PB of storage and upload/download is as fast as network setup allows (so the performance is I/O dependent, not protocol or implementation dependent). You won't have queries (feature 5) on your list), but you can couple such filesystem with something like MongoDB or even some search engine like Lucene (it has clustered indexes) to query data stored in filesystem.
