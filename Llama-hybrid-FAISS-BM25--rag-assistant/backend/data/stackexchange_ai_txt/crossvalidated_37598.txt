It's unclear if you want counting processes or not. If I interpret the 'teaching' tag to mean you are teaching the Poisson process then, for teaching about a process in general, the Bernoulli process is an easy random process to explain and visualize and is related to the Poisson process. The Bernoulli process is the discrete analog so it might be a helpful companion concept. Its just that instead of continuous time we have discrete intervals of time. An example might be a door to door sales man where we are counting successes by homes that make a purchase. The number of successes in the first n trials, has a binomial distribution B(n, p) instead of a Poisson The number of trials needed to get r successes, has a negative binomial distribution NB(r, p) instead of a gamma distribution The number of trials needed to get one success, the waiting time, has a geometric distribution NB(1, p), which is the discrete analog of the exponential. That's the approach Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis use in Introduction To Probability , 2nd ed., introducing the Bernoulli process before the Poisson process. In their textbook there are more extensions to Bernoulli process that are applicable to the Poisson process such as merging them or partitioning them, as well as problems sets with solutions. If you are looking for examples of random processes, and you just want to throw the names out there, there are quite a few. The Gaussian process is a significant one in applications. The Weiner process in particular, which is a type of Gaussian process, is also called standard Brownian motion and has applications in finance and physics.
