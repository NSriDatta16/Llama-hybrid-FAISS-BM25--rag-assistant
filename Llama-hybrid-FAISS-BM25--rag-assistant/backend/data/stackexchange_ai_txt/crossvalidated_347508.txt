I'm sure there are many answers. Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd edition) page 146 already gives an example: $$ T(y, \theta) = |y_{(61)} - \theta| - |y_{(6)} - \theta| $$ where $\theta$ is the mean of your normal model. This is from an example with 66 observations, so ordered observations 6 and 61 are chosen to roughly assess the 10% and 90% quantiles. This test quantity evaluates whether the normal model is adequate for the 'main body' of the distribution - the middle excluding the extreme tails. Another example could be mean squared error in a regression model: $$ T(y, \theta) = \frac{||y - X \theta||^2_2}{n} $$ This also depends on both your data and parameters.
