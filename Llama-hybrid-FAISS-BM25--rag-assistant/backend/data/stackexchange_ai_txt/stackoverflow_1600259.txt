Standards compliance for C and C++ has been rather poor for VS. Things began changing with 2005 and is getting better. VS2010 is what I am really looking at with quite a lot of features from C++0x. Most of the time though, I end up Googling with the following keywords: msdn ANSI C conformance msdn ISO C++ conformance etc. when I really really need to figure out why something doesn't work as defined.
