Found it with some guesswork: I was assuming that the error parameter can be nil, doing: [[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:@"somePageView" withError:nil]; But error can not be nil: NSError *error; [[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:@"somePageView" withError:&error]; This fixed it. Still, this doesn't add up because the crash was not at that line, but it fixed it.
