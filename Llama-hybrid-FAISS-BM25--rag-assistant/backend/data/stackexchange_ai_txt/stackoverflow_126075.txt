Make sure you styleSheet declares what it is supposed to do with Anchors. You are obviously using htmlText if your using CSS so soon as it sees Add the following to your CSS and make sure that it has the same settings as the regular style of your text as far as style, wieght, and size. The only thing that should differ is the color. a:link { font-family: sameAsReg; font-size: 12px; //Note flash omits things like px and pt. color:#FF0000; //Red } Be sure that the fonts you are embedding are in the library and being instantiated into your code. Embedding each textfield through the UI is silly when you can merely load the font from the library at runtime and then you can use it anywhere. You can also import multiple fonts at compile time and use them in the same textfield with the use of Some Text Some Other Text Good luck and I hope this helps.
