Can a statistic depend on a parameter?

Can a statistic depend on a parameter? By definition, a statistic $T(\mathbf{X})$ is a function that depends on the r.v. taken from a population. In Berger's 'Statistical Inference', in the paragraph immediately below the definition of statistics, it's stated that a statistic cannot depend on parameters. In wiki, it's unknown parameters. However, does not the t-statistic depend on a parameter?
