WPF touch and slide/drag animation

I'm trying to create a pretty simple WPF interface, and from what I know this should be mostly possible using pure XAML. What I know I have a pretty basic understanding of WPF so far, however I have a decent grasp on XAML. I know or can work out how to put content in these panels. This isn't the topic of this question. What I don't know I don't know how to animate this interface. I'm not very proficient at binding, however again, that's not the topic of this question. The topic of this question is what would be the best way to animate panels 1-4 (images below) so that they may be dragged (via touch) into view. The number of panels here may be static for the purpose of this question. The panels (1-4) can be stack panels, grids or whatever; their content isnt important. What is important is the container that would contain all 4 panels. The complication in this animation is the other two containers here (Item One/TODO), as they're in the way of a smooth animation. If it makes this question simpler, the touch features can be ignored for now, and a simple button push can slide the containers across. One Two
