De Morgan's laws read: ¬(A or B) = ¬A and ¬B ¬(A and B) = ¬A or ¬B note that you have to conjugate the operator too. This example may help to clarify the thought process. If I want something that is not red or a ball, then what I am after is neither red nor a ball. However, if I want something that is not red and a ball then I am seeking an object that is either not red or not a ball. So the reworking of the expression would be !((x>5)&&(y>7)) Which isn't given (e). However, if x=7 and y=5 then (x>5) but !(y>7) so the expression !(x>5)||!(y>7) evaluates to true. E.g. I want something that is not red (x>5) or not a ball (y>7) and I am given a red bucket ( false || true ). [EDIT] I type too slow.
