What you're noticing here is that the entire field of statistics is plagued by serious interpretational issues. Chief among these (and at fault here) is the reference class problem . In a frequentist framework, this corresponds to assigning your statement of "probability" to a well-populated space of outcomes (recall that probability may be axiomatized in terms of event spaces - in a Bayesian framework, the formalization is slightly different, but the practical consequences are the same). For a statement such as the one in this problem, there are multiple ways we could conceivably do this - what's worse, there's no obvious "correct" statistical interpretation purely from the wording of the problem. We need more information. This is one of the main problems with statistics as it is currently taught. Mathematical pedagogy tends to favor short, snappy exercises - they're easy to read and easy to grade. But statistics abhors this; any sufficiently short statistical statement is almost bound to be uninterpretable.
