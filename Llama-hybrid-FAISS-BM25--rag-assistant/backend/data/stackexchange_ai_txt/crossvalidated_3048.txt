How to do dimensionality reduction in R

I have a matrix where a(i,j) tells me how many times individual i viewed page j. There are 27K individuals and 95K pages. I would like to have a handful of "dimensions" or "aspects" in the space of pages which would correspond to sets of pages which are often viewed together. My ultimate goal is to then be able to compute how often individual i has viewed pages that fall in dimension 1, dimension 2, etc. I have read the R documentation on principal component analysis and single value decomposition and have executed these commands, but I am unsure how to proceed. How can I use dimensionality reduction to do this? Or is this really a clustering problem and I should instead look into clustering algorithms? Many thanks for any insight ~l
