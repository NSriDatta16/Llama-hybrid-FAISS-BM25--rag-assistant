The term cycle refers to the recurrent variations in time series that in generally last longer than a year and it can be as many as 15 or 20 years. These variations are regular neither in amplitude nor in length. Most of the time series relating to business exhibit some kind of cyclical or oscillatory variation. These fluctuations are long term movements that represent consistently recurring rises and declines in activity. Seasonal variations are those periodic movements in business activity which occur regularly every year and have their origin in the nature of the year itself. Since these variations repeat during a period of 12 months they can be predicted fairly accurately. Nearly every type of business activity is subject to seasonal influence to a greater or lesser degree and as such these variations are regarded as normal phenomena recurring every year.
