Deep Learning for sequences

I want to use deep learning techniques to perform better inference tasks than Hidden Markov Models (which is a shallow model)? I was wondering what is the state-of-the art deep learning model to replace Hidden Markov Models (HMM)? The set-up is semi-supervised. The training data X(t),Y(t) is a time series, with significant temporal correlations. Also, there is a huge amount of unlabelled data, i.e., simply X(t) and no Y(t). After reading many papers, I narrowed down on the following model -> Conditionally Restricted Boltzmann Machines (Ilya Sustkever MS thesis) and use Deep Belief Networks for unsupervised pretraining (or use variational autoencoders for pretraining). I am very new to the field, and was wondering if these techniques are outdated.
