There are two solutions here: 1.) If systematic differences between the four time-points are not expected or not of interest (simple replications): Just calculate the average SA_VAL for each subject and compare the resulting MEAN_SA_VALs between both groups using an unpaired t.test or wilcox.test (aka Mann-Whitney U). If you suspect/observe that variances differ between groups , use the var.equal = FALSE option of t.test . Simple as that. 2.) If there is the possibility that SA_VALs can change systematically over the course of the four measurements then you should definitely use a model that takes a potential main effects with time and more importantly interaction effects between time and group into account. This is a little complicated because R's aov function usually used for repeated-measures ANOVA is designed for balanced designs. But you should not discard data, since this only means a loss of valuable information and statistical power. What you can do is to create a mixed model with functions lme ( nlme package), or lmer ( lme4 package) and then run an ANOVA. The model should look like this: model1 If the effects of time on SA_VAL are linear in both groups, you may use time as a continuous regressor (0,6,12,18). If you expect other effects of time, define time as a factor ( factor(time) ). Bonus: The mixed model will even be able to handle subjects with missing data-points (missing at random). Malus: Working with mixed models can become quite involved, so you may require some reading. Btw: here you can find a lme/lmer example that matches your design very closely.
