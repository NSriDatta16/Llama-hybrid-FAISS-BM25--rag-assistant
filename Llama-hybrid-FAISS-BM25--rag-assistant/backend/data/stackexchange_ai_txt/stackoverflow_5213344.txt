I don't think you need the children of an item to be wrapped in another . This transformation (quite similar to that of @Alejandro, but simpler, shorter and not requiring any parameters at all): when applied on the referred to source XML document: Tags Meetings Bible studies Missions Brazil Ministry Children's ministry Ministry College and Career ministry The Islands of Vanuatu Fanafo Christian Fellowship Ministry High School ministry Missions Holsbybrunn, Sweden Home Israel Ministry Junior High ministry Missions Kampala, Uganda Missions Lima, Peru Meetings Ministry Men’s ministry Ministry Missions The Islands of Vanuatu Natanara Christian Fellowship Missions Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso Junior High ministry Missions The Islands of Vanuatu Missions Villahermosa, Mexico Ministry Women's ministry Meetings Worship produces the wanted, correct result: Home Israel Meetings Bible studies Worship Ministry Children's ministry College and Career ministry High School ministry Junior High ministry The Islands of Vanuatu Fanafo Christian Fellowship Natanara Christian Fellowship Men’s ministry Women's ministry Missions Brazil Holsbybrunn, Sweden Kampala, Uganda Lima, Peru Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso The Islands of Vanuatu Fanafo Christian Fellowship Natanara Christian Fellowship Villahermosa, Mexico Do note : This solution works correctly when a tag has more than one parent. Explanation : The key: use="string(../parents/item/@handle)"/> produces all the "children" from the string value of the handle attribute of the first (only) item child of their parents sibling. This covers also such tag elements that don't have any parents sibling (in which case the key value is the empty string). .2. A second key with the same name: matches a tag by the value of any handle attribute of the item child of their parents sibling. This makes it possible to have the tag listed for all "parents", not only for the first. As we see here, the ability to have multiple keys with the same name is a very powerful and useful feature.
