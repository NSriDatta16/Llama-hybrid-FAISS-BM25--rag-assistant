Maybe I've misread what you're asking, but this might be what you're looking for(?): If the ServiceBase class is the one that is getting the data onstart and updating it onstop, then just store the id on your ServiceBase class in a local variable. (unless you've got a helper/service class that does this retrieval and updating, in which case maybe thats the best place to put it) for example public class MyService : ServiceBase { private int id; public override OnStart() { id = GetIdFOrProcess("someidentifier"); ..... } public override OnStop() { UpdateServiceStopTime(id); ..... } }
