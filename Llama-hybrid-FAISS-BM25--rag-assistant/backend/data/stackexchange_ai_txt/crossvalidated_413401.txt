You aim at developing a predictive model and you want to identify patients who are at risk of outcome A. Your goal is to assign each patient a probability of outcome A. This kind of problem is especially well suited for machine learning. It is a classification problem (will my patient get outcome A or not) that can be addressed easily with a logistic regression or with more complex models (like neural networks). In a logistic regression, your output would be p = sigmoid(a0 + a1*X1 + ... + an*Xn) where X1, ..., Xn are your variables and a0, ..., an are coefficients found by your algorithm to minimize your evaluation metric (may it be logloss or area under ROC). I don't know how it compares to Multivariate Analysis though.
