Calculating Feature Importance of Time Series Data

I am new to time-series modeling, and I was wondering what the standard way of quantifying feature importances are in a time-series setting? What types of models allow for the greatest interpretation of the feature space? I am looking for something, which does not necessarily function like the Random Forest Regressor's feature importance call, but provides a similar insight.
