Flex 3.0 Drag and Drop

I have encountered a problem in a Flex application. I have implemented drag and drop support from a List to a Canvas, and I DragManagers doDrag() - with.a proxy-image. In my custom DragDrop event handler, i place a new item on the Canvas. I use the event.localX/localY to position the new item. It is working ok, but the problem is that I want the "new" image to appear exactly where the proxy-image is when i release the mouse button (x/y -wise). Can I somehow get the proxys X,Y location. I thought that DragManager would have a reference to it but I canÂ´t find it. Thanks /C
