Urls not working while integrating custom application with django-cms

I'm trying to integrate an django application with django-cms. I'm using the basic "Poll" application as mentioned in basic Django tutorial and following guidelines over here . Now I can integrate the application and can view the "poll" page. But when I press 'submit', the django-cms gives me error "CMS: Page not found for "polls/1/vote" Update: If I add following line to main urls.py, everything works fine. (r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')), But this is usually discouraged in django and django-cms. Is there a way out?
