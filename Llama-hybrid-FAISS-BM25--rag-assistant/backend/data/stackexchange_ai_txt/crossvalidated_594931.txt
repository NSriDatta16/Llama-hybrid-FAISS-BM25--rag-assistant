LSTM from scratch

I already learned the basic model of LSTM, for example, layers, cell state, gates, and so on. However, I am still slightly confused about how the whole thing is done; I want to simulate LSTM step-by-step by hand calculation, like Neural Networks from Scratch by sentex. Is it possible for me to do it? If yes, is there any good resource, paper, or demo(someone has already done one) that can be referenced and learned from?
