You could put the status class in a different file and then leverage php's autoloading mechnism: http://php.net/manual/de/language.oop5.autoload.php to not load that file until you access it. There are rumors that auto loading (or actually just any kind of conditional loading) is troublesome for byte code caches and optimizers though unfortunately I don't know too much about the impact. P.S.: The manual does not say rhis explicity at this point: You can also use spl_autoload_register() instead of just defining the magic __autoload function. This is slightly more powerful.
