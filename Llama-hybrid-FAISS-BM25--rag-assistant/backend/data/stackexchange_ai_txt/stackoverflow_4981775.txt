The reason this isn't working is that the jQuery function modifies data and tries to set it to the html fragment that it thinks that you've passed in. However, you didn't pass valid html into it, so it sets it to undefined. You need to copy data to another variable, rather than just set a refernce. Try doing var myData = data.substr(0);
