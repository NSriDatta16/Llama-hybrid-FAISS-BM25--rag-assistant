Making A Graphic Pie Chart In C#

I'm trying to write a Windows Application that shows a pie chart with seven unequal slices (25%, 20%, 18%, 17%, 10%, 10%, 10%) all of them will be colored differently. So far I have made Pens and Brushes with colors attached and drawn a circle. This is what I have so far private void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { this.BackColor = Color.White; this.Text = "Pie Chart"; this.Width = 350; this.Height = 350; Pen black = new Pen(Color.Black); Pen blue = new Pen(Color.Blue); Pen green = new Pen(Color.Green); Pen red = new Pen(Color.Red); Pen orange = new Pen(Color.Orange); Pen pink = new Pen(Color.Pink); Pen purple = new Pen(Color.Purple); Pen magenta = new Pen(Color.Purple); Brush brBlue = blue.Brush; Brush brGreen = green.Brush; Brush brRed = red.Brush; Brush brOrange = orange.Brush; Brush brPink = pink.Brush; Brush brPurple = purple.Brush; Brush brMagenta = magenta.Brush; Graphics g = e.Graphics; g.DrawEllipse(black, 20, 10, 300, 300); } My question to you is. What would be the easiest way to draw the wedges of the pie?
