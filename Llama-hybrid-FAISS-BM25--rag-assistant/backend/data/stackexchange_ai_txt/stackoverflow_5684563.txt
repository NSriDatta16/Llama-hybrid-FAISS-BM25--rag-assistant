You must try this jquery one: http://www.web-delicious.com/jquery-events-calendar-wdcalendar/ It's free and open source. wdCalendar is a javascript event calendar. Simply said, this jquery plugin is a Google calendar clone, which is similar to desktop calendar applications such as Microsoft Outlook or iCal on Mac OS X. Itâ€™s easy for users to view, add, and drag-and-drop events from one date to another. It supports view modes such as daily, weekly, monthly. It is very powerful yet easy to use & integrate with php, asp.net, jsp and RoR.
