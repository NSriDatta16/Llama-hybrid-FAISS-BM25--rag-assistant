Of course it depends on what you want to do with the data, but I would recommend using the DB's native type for time/date (whatever that may be) for storage in the DB. That is the standard for databases, and most date/time functions in DBs expect data in that form. Special note about MySQL: While you can use TIMESTAMP for date/time values, be aware that TIMESTAMP cannot record dates earlier than 1970-01-01. So while it's ok for dates close to "now" (such as creation/modification dates), it is not appropriat for possibly historical dates such as date of birth. So only use TIMESTAMP if you are completely certain you will never need historical dates.
