Here is a very simple-minded idea that goes one step backwards from where you are (where you split each image into zones etc). It assumes that computation is cheap. Just use each pixel as a feature. Each image then either contains a defect or not. So you have one binary class label for each image and npixel features. There are many ML algorithms to choose from; random forest usually does well.
