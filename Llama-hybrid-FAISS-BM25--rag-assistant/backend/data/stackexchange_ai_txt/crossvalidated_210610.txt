You may be looking for a straightforward regression of Y on X1 , X2 and X3 . Prediction would be straightforward, by feeding the new values into the design matrix. Or, if you have time series, you may want to look at ARIMAX models, or at regressions with ARIMA errors. Once you have built your model, you can assess the predictive power of your covariates by predicting a holdout sample with and without them and comparing errors. You can check whether differences in errors are statistically significant by using Diebold-Mariano type tests.
