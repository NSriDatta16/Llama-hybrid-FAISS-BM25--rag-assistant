You would need to define constraints $g_i(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ fixing e.g. the minimal and maximal amount of workers in each band, the minimal amount of hours required and so on, for each work item. Then, since your regression function is probably non-linear, non-convex, and so on, you have a non-linear programming problem with constraints, which is typically hard to solve. There is a vast literature on nonlinear optimization with constraints. But you could try to impose some structure on $f$ , e.g. by forcing a simple regression model so that $f$ is easily optimizable. As to the feature engineering, maybe you could add experience of the workers in band $i$ with work item $j$ ?
