Web custom control and checking for existing javascript references?

I am creating a custom control and had a thought before I began. My control relies on the jQuery library to work. What if the user already has a version of the library already on their page. Will this effect anything? If my version is newer / older and my control will only work with that version of the libaray, what should I do? Thanks
