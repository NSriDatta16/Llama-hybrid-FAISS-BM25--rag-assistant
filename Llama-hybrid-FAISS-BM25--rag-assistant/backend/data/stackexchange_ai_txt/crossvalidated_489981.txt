Hint: there is a lot of courses branded as "statistics" or "data science", while not many as "econometrics", so try the two former keywords. The topics covered by such courses would overlap to great extent with econometrics. Moreover, such courses would cover a general set of skills for working with data, data analytics, and modelling, so they would surely be useful for econometrics as well.
