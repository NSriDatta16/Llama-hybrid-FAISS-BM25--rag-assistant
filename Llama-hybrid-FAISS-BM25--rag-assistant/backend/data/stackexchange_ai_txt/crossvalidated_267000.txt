Demean and scale an entire sample or groups seperatly?

If I have some data of 40 samples, 20 belong to a patient group and 20 to a control group. Before running the data through my logistic regression classifier to try and classify who is a patient and who isn't I want to demean and scale the data. My question is do I demean and scale the entire data set together or do I first break the data set up into the two groups(patients and controls) , demean and scale and then combine the data again and feed it into the classifier ? What are the reasons for picking one over the other ?
