Indeed linear probability model (LPM) could also be used, but I would advise you to stick to logistic regression ("logit" model) as generally more acceptable than LPM (If you want to use LPM, you will have to prove that it is an acceptable approximation of Logit). You might also consider a "Probit" model. Re your question about predictors - Logit model can handle every type of predictors (continuous, categorical, interaction between continuous and categorical variables). As already pointed out by Giridhar, with a Logit model you won't be able to compute people WTP - On their probability of being willing to pay for the service (e.g., are women more likely to pay for the service?).
