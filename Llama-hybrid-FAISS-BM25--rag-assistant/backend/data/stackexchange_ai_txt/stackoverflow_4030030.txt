When the browser has focus, press the alt key. This should bring up the file menu. Or you can drag and drop the swf onto the browser. On windows, you can right click the SWF file and click "open with" from the menu. You can then select your browser. If your browser does not show up in the menu click "choose program.." and selected it from there. Not sure if this is what you wanted from your question.
