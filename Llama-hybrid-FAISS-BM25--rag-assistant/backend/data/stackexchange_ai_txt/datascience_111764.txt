Implementation/Optimization of Genetic Algorithm

I have a few queries regarding my implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). I have a lot of parameters in which I have to find the best combination of these parameters to maximize the value of the function. Hence, I am using GA. The maximizing or fitness function mentioned above are some complex equations that run over a couple of data points, and the configuration from the population is applied to these equations. Now, the GA tries to maximize the output of this function which is the average of each data point (each data point gives us a value). Now assuming that I have fewer data points and the data points are diverse - Is GA the right approach (considering there is no lack of data)? If lack of Data is considered, is the GA the best approach? Are there ways to determine the ideal amount of data required for GA to work correctly in my scenario mentioned above? I have around 100 data points in my case. So we have prototyped it and run it, but it seems to be giving random results; any ways to improve it?
