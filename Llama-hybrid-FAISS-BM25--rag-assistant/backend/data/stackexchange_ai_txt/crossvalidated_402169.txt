stratified binary predictor in logistic regression

As part of an assignment, I was working with a dataset containing a breastcancer-related dependent variable ( HG ) against three independent variables representing different risk factors. head(data) NV PI EH HG 1 0 13 1.64 0 2 0 16 2.26 0 3 0 8 3.14 0 4 0 34 2.68 0 5 0 20 1.28 0 6 0 5 2.31 0 The predictor variable NV is the only categorial predictor variable and is highly statistically associated with HG using a fisher.test, but has a p-value close to 1 in a logistic regression (both in a model with all three predictors and in a model with only one predictor. I'm showing only the one with a single predictor here). model_3 |z|) (Intercept) -1.0586 0.2815 -3.761 0.000169 *** NV 19.6247 1809.0545 0.011 0.991345 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) The curious thing about NV is that it is 'stratified': It is always 0 whenever HG (the dependent variable) is 0: table(data[, c(1, 4)]) HG NV 0 1 0 49 17 1 0 13 Artificially adding a 1 to a random case where HG is 0 yields a statistically significant p-value in the logistic regression. data_CH $NV[sample(which(data_CH$ HG==0), 1)] Could someone give me a hint of what's going on here?
