Geometric Interpretation of Whether SVMs are performing well or not

I came across this research paper which contained this figure which talks about the center of mass (presumably, of the training dataset's datapoints?) and represents the solution of an SVM as polygon (or is it a point?). I'm having trouble understanding this figure, and since it seems to provide a geometric interpretation of when an SVM performs poorly or not, I'm interested in it. Any thoughts?
