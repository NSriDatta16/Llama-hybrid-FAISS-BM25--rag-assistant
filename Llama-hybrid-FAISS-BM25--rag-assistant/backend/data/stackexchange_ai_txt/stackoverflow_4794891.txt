Here's how I implement a clickable banner for a header. If the background image is larger than the h1 link, the following paragraphs will show up overlaying the banner. I think this is what you're trying to accomplish. Banner Example #header { background-image: url('header_banner.jpg'); } h1 a { display: block; height: 120px; width: 500px; text-indent: -9999; /* to hide the text that would show */ /* over the banner */ } This is a header link. Here is some text. Here is some more text. This validates as html5 and gives you a lot more flexibility. You can have a header banner that still links and have any number of other elements in the header region - even other links.
