Confusion about "weight" hyperparameter for SVM using Â´mlr` in R

I am building on top of a publication that employs a binary SVM classifier. They report they use the mlr R package. Some research says that this basically uses the implementation of the e1071 package ( docs can be found here ). Now, in the paper, they mention a "weight" hyperparameter and I am at a loss what that is supposed to be. I have never heard about it in the context of SVMs and cannot find it in any documentation. The only thing that comes to mind are class weights for handling unbalanced class sizes -- indeed, the dataset under consideration is imbalanced. However, that should not be a single number, or at least they should have mentioned which class receives that single number as a weight. Would appreciate any input.
