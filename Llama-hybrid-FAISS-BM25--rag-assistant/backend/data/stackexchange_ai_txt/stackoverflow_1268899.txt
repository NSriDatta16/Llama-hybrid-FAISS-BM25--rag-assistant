Really long query

How do u do long query? Is there way to optimize it? I would do complicated and long query: all_accepted_parts = acceptedFragment.objects.filter(fragmentID = fragment.objects.filter(categories = fragmentCategory.objects.filter(id=1))) but it doesn't work, i get: Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type. I will be thankful for any hint how i could optimize it or solve of course too - more thankful :)
