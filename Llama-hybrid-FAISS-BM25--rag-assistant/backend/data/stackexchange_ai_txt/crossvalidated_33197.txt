Advanced statistics books recommendation

There are several threads on this site for book recommendations on introductory statistics and machine learning but I am looking for a text on advanced statistics including, in order of priority: maximum likelihood, generalized linear models, principal component analysis, non-linear models . I've tried Statistical Models by A.C. Davison but frankly I had to put it down after 2 chapters. The text is encyclopedic in its coverage and mathematical treats but, as a practitioner, I like to approach subjects by understanding the intuition first, and then delve into the mathematical background. These are some texts that I consider outstanding for their pedagogical value. I would like to find an equivalent for the more advanced subjects I mentioned. Statistics , D. Freedman, R. Pisani, R. Purves. Forecasting: Methods and Applications , R. Hyndman et al. Multiple Regression and Beyond , T. Z. Keith Applying Contemporary Statistical Techniques , Rand R. Wilcox An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R - (PDF Released Version) , Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani The Elements of Statistical Learning:Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. - (PDF Released Version) , Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2009)
