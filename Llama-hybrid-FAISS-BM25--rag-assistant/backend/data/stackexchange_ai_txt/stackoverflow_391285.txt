The warning seems to be a bug with the current MinGW version of gcc. Contrary to what Adam said, it is valid C99 - section 6.7.5.3, paragraph 12 explicitly allows this: If the function declarator is not part of a definition of that function, parameters may have incomplete type and may use the [*] notation in their sequences of declarator specifiers to specify variable length array types. There seems to be no way to instruct (this version of) gcc to not print this warning - at least I could not find a switch which worked - so I'm just ignoring it for now.
