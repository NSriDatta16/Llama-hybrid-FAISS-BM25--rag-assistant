If you're tweaking XAML manually - You're doing it wrong. Don't fight the Zen of XAML, flow with it. Embrace Expression Blend into your development workflow for all GUI design, or be prepared for the untold horrors of manual XAML editing. Specifically for VisualStateManagerm manually editing XAML makes absolutely no sense as it was designed by the Silverlight Team so it could be optimally used from Expression Blend. I strongly suggest you spend 30 minutes watching these 4 "How Do I?" VSM videos by Steve White @ http://expression.microsoft.com/en-us/cc643423.aspx These 4 videos helped me a lot in the early days of working on VSM to understand how to use VSM and how to best articulate my UI logic into Visual States. In Expression Blend getting the background colour to change on Click is as simple as: Drag & drop a new button in Expression Blend. Right click and "Edit Template --> Edit Copy". Choose the "Pressed" VSM state from the "States" pane. Change the background colour of "ButtonBackground".
