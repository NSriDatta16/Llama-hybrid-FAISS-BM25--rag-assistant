Some Googling for specifically neural networks and seasonality leads to this paper, Neural network forecasting for seasonal and trend time series , Zhang and Qi, European Journal of Operational Research, V.160, 2, 16 January 2005, 501â€“514. In this paper the authors sought to compare the Box-Jenkins approach with a neural network approach. From the abstract: We find that neural networks are not able to capture seasonal or trend variations effectively with the unpreprocessed raw data and either detrending or deseasonalization can dramatically reduce forecasting errors. Moreover, a combined detrending and deseasonalization is found to be the most effective data preprocessing approach. They conclude that accounting for trend and seasonality in your preprocessing steps is a good idea.
