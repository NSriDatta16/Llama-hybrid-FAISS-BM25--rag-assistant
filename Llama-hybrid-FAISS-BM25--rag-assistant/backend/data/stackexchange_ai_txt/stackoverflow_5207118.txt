First, you construct an HMACSHA256 object using the default constructor -- this causes a random key to be generated and used for signing. What you want is the overload which accepts a string - and pass the azure account key. Still, signing the request 'manually' can be tricky, as there are a lot of things to do and it's easy to mess up or forget something. Instead, I recommend you use the SignRequest method of StorageCredentialsAccountAndKey class ( msdn doc ) For instance; // ...there exists a request object, and strings for the account name and key var creds = new StorageCredentialsAccountAndKey(accountName, accountKey); creds.SignRequest(request); This will do everything needed to sign the request properly, including creating a canonicalized headers string, creating a date with the correct format, etc.
