To stop returning through SSH using Pexpect

I am trying to use pexpect to ssh into a computer but I do not want to return back to the original computer. The code I have is: #!/usr/bin/python2.6 import pexpect, os def ssh(): # Logs into computer through SSH ssh_newkey = 'Are you sure you want to continue connecting' # my ssh command line p=pexpect.spawn('ssh build@10.51.11.10') i=p.expect([ssh_newkey,'password:',pexpect.EOF]) p.sendline("password") i=p.expect('-bash-3.2') print os.getcwd() ssh() This allows me to ssh into the computer but when I run the os.getcwd() the pexpect has returned me to the original computer. You see I want to ssh into another computer and use their environment not drag my environment using pexpect. Can anyone suggest how to get this working or an alternative way. Thanks
