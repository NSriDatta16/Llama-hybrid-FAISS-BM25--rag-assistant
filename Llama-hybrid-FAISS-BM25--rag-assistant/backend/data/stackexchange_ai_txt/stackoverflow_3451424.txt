Concatenating strings to "sets" in Java

Not sure how to word this algorithm question, actually. I have toggle buttons in an android app, each corresponding to a numbered channel. Channels are (1,n) but the toggle button ids are some unknown, unsequential (to the buttons) integer. I need to collect the channel numbers and build a command string. My 1995-based Java skills have given me this: String ch; int i = 1; for (ToggleButton toggle : toggles) { if (toggle.isChecked()) { ch = String.format("+%d", i+1); channels = channels.concat(ch); } } If toggle buttons 1,2,4,5,6,7,11,13,21,22,23,24,25 are checked, this code snippet successfully gives me the string "+1+2+4+5+6+7+11+13+21+22+23+24+25" However, what I would more like to do is have the string "+1/2, +4/7, +11, +13, +21/25" I wonder if there's an easier way to do this than multiple if statements: String ch; int it = 0; int last = 1; for (ToggleButton toggle : toggles ) { if (toggle.isChecked()) { if (it == last + 1) { // somehow continue or note that we're only adding the "/" } else { // If we're not the next one, then build the last string // of "n/last" and then add ", +" to start building next string } } last++; } That seems like a bit of brute force type of algorithm, so I don't know if there's a more elegant solution that Java might have in it's bag of tricks (Or, more likely, that I should have) Thanks.
