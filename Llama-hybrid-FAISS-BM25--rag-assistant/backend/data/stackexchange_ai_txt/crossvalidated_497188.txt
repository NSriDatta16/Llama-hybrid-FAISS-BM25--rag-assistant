Let us use the figure on the wikipedia pare of SVM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#/media/File:SVM_margin.png as a guide. I understand that the $f(\phi(x))$ formula is for the separating hyperplane which is the red line in the figure. The formula is really $f(\phi(x))=0$ . Then $w = [4,9*4,4,0]$ and the $x$ in the formula in the figure is really $\phi(x)$ and $b = 0$ . (in one point you have $9*4 \phi(x)_2$ and on your written notes you have $9*\phi(x)_2$ - I will assume that $9*4 \phi(x)_2$ is the correct one) Thus the hyper-plane equation is $[4,9*4,4,0]*\phi(x) - 0 = 0$ According to the figure, the margins are $[4,4*9,4,0]*\phi(x) - 0 = \pm 1$ Expanding the +1 version: $$ [4,4*9,4,0]*\phi(x) - 0 = 1 \\ [4,4*9,4,0]*[x_1^2,x_1^2, x_1 x_2, -x_1] = 1 \\ 10*4 x_1^2 + 4 x_1 x_2 = 1\\ 10 x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 = 1/4 $$ and similarly for the other margin $$10 x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 = - 1/4 $$ none of the points $a = [1,1]$ and $b=[1,-1]$ satisfy either equations so they are not in the margins. So they cannot be support vectors. Notice that you cannot calculate/compute what are the support vectors. The support vectors are the points on the training set that lie on the two margins - the two blue and one green points in the figure that have the black borders. You know that the support vectors lie on the margins but you need the training set to select/verify the ones that are the support vectors. UPDATE: given that the correct formula for the hyperplane is the one without $9*4\phi(x)_2$ the margins equations are $[4,9,4,0]*\phi(x) - 0 = \pm 1$ For the +1 margin $$ [4,9,4,0]*\phi(x) - 0 = 1 \\ [4,9,4,0]*[x_1^2,x_1^2, x_1 x_2, -x_1] = 1 \\ 11 x_1^2 + 4 x_1 x_2 = 1\\ 11 x_1^2 + 4 x_1 x_2 - 1 = 0\\ $$ for the -1 margin $$11 x_1^2 + 4 x_1 x_2 + 1 = 0$$ again, neither a=[1,1] or b=[1,-1] are in the margins and therefore cannot be support vectors. There seems to be a problem with your derivation. There is no need to divide $Y_i$ by $||w||$ . $ 2/||w||$ is the size of the margin. But the equation of the hyperplane $f(x)$ is computer such that: $f(x) = 0 $ for X in the separating hyperplane $f(x) = 1 $ for one of the margins $f(x) = -1$ for the other margin (please see again the figure in wikipedia).
