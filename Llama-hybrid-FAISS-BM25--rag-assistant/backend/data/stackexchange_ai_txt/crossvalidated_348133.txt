The original Isomap paper defined "residual variance" as follows (reference 42): $$\text{residual variance} = 1 - R^2(\hat D_M, D_y)$$ where $R$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient over all entries of $\hat D_M$ and $D_Y$ . $\hat D_M$ is the euclidean distance matrix for PCA and the geodesic distance matrix for Isomap. $D_Y$ is the euclidean distance matrix of the low dimensional embedding, this matrix changes with the number of dimensions you use for the embedding. EDIT: This is numerically different than the explained variance of PCA derived from the eigenvalues and I don't know if there is a direct connection between the two of them. EDIT: I asked here for the connection between residual and explained variance.
