Consider that different representations of the same data (depending on the user) could have surprising consequences if you have a cache somewhere in the middle. If the fully authenticated user makes the request first, then followed by the 'lesser' user, they might see surprising result: The same view as the fully authenticated user before. That's because there is no difference in the two requests as far as the cache is concerned (unless you make it aware of these issues). So, tread carefully. I would also suggest separate namespaces, as proposed by Robert.
