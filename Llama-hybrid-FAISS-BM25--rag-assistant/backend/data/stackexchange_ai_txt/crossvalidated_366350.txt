Variables reduction required for Random Forest, Boosting, L1, L2 regularization

I have close to 10,000 variables. I know how random forest/XGB picks number of variables randomly for building the tree. Also regularization takes care of significance of variable by its coefficient. But do I still need to do EDA/uniariate/bivariate and everything to reduce the variables as the first step. If yes, why? As I understand that above algorithm will pick the important variable by itself and are called ML algorithm because it doesn't require manual intervention to that extent. I have seen that of I give limited variables as input to my Random Forest, it may work better. Please explain.
