17 Week Coin Flip Contest - Calculate Probability/Odds For Each Individual To Have The Winning Count Of "Heads"

I'm new to statistics, like WAY new. So green, in fact, I'm scarcely pushing (0,1,0) in the RGB color model. I'm presently the recordkeeper for our office's 17-week "Coin flip pool". As of right now, 7 weeks have passed and we are in our 8th week, and, therefore, there are 9 weeks remaining. Each contestant has amassed a certain number of points gained by essentially flipping 3 coins a week and for each "head" result, they get 1 point - if they get 3 "heads" in a week, that's 3 points. Current accumulated scores across all 23 contestants ranges from 7 to 15, so each has their own weekly average of success. One contestant recently asked what his odds of winning were. This obviously necessitates knowing his current score, his current performance, the current score of the other contestants, the average weekly performance of other contestants, and, possibly, the average potential score of 3-coin-flips-resulting-in-heads-a-week. I've searched and searched and found only betting odds calculators and basic explanations of what the probability of the result of any single series might be, but I don't know enough about this subject nor what keywords to use to possibly narrow down my results to find the right answer. I can provide a whole spreadsheet's worth of data (if I don't readily know how to share it within Stack Exchange). As I know next to nothing about this subject, would someone kindly nudge me in the right direction? Especially if this ends up being far to complicated a topic for a Stack Exchange question. Thank you for your time! Edit (20181027T08:45-05:00) : Additional clarification that might make this simpler (or not, statistics is not my forte after all): Knowing the absolute chance of winning at the end of Week 17 is not necessary, only a projection based on current performance (maybe that's the same thing?).

One coin-flip is performed Thursday, Sunday, and Monday so probability will change as each day's flip occurs. American sports fanatics might start to see where this is headed. Edit (20181027T14:37-05:00) : As Martijn Weterings and I have discussed in the talk section, this is indeed not exactly a coin-flipping contest. Under my prospective simplification is it the NFL Regular season: 17 games for which there are two outcomes (and their inverse): Team A wins or loses (for which Team B loses or wins). We are using a variant that adjusts the underdog team's score by a positive amount (a handicap, if you will). Based on last year's pool statistics with the inclusion of a handicap the odds of either team winning after score adjustment is 1:1 (50%, yes?) - more accurately 45.824% by averaging the averages on last season's sheet. This is why I described this problem as a coin-flipping contest. While true betting odds compute all manner of variables, that work has been done for us and for simplification, just went with "the handicap makes it so each team has an equal shot at winning the game". This handicap variant helps immensely because a good majority of our players don't follow the sport at all and would get squarely defeated week after week by those that do. The handicap is an equalizer of sorts. More accurately each contestant selects three "coins" from a pool of 16 and if any of those "coins" lands as "heads" they get a point - from 0 to 3 points per week. We are presently in Week 8 and as of this writing, only 2 coins have been flipped (the Thursday night game and the Saturday morning game). Which is why the probability can change with time as not all 16 results occur simultaneously. However, for the sake of simplicity (and again I know next to nothing about statistics to say "simplicity" repeatedly) probability of every participant will update as more of these contests are completed. I apologize for not realizing the true reality was less simple than "contestant flips 3 coins" and more "there is a pool of coins from which each contestant 'bets' will be heads".
