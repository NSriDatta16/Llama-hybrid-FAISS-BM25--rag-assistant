There was a read paper last week at the Royal Statistical Society on MCMC techniques over Riemann manifolds, primarily using the Fisher information metric: http://www.rss.org.uk/main.asp?page=1836#Oct_13_2010_Meeting The results seem promising, though as the authors point out, in many models of interest (such as mixture models) the Fisher information has no analytic form.
