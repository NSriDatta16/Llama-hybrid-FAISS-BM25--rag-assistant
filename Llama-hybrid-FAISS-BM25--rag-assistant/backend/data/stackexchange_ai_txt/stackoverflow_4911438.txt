Whats the best syntax for using html named anchor texts on tabs for better seo searchability?

Question about anchors in html , with maximum seo-friendlyness as well as user-friendlyness. Currently, the tabs on our website use javascript-auto-created numeric anchors e.g. when mouse hovering on them user sees: page#1 , page#2 and page#3 Though this works fine, its not very sexy for a search engine, I guesse. Now, tabs shows up in html as follows: Tab Title Contents Tab Title Contents My plan is thus, to make non-auto, manually prescribed anchors on those javascript tab-buttons e.g. page#overview , page#services and page#prices . Q1. Would the new tab anchors make my site better searchable? Q2. OR, should the anchor texts be more specific? if so, Why doesn't dreamweaver allow me to make bit more specific anchors e.g. page#architectural services overview or page#ornamental garden fountains ? When in Dreamweaver I navigate to menu > Insert > Named Anchor and fill in the single field something like "fountains". Then, Dreamweaver inserts the following: Q3. Are both neccessary or is just one of part essential, or should that a tag be even broadened by adding a title="fountain" in other words, whats the best way to write elegant anchors these days? Q4. What are differences , if any, between anchor, anchor-tag, named-anchor, html-anchor
