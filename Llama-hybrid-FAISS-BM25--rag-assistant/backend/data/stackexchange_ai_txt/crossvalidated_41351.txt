A Tutorial on $\nu$-Support Vector Machines [PDF] (Section 6, proposition 1) It's not exactly a probability. In the context of soft-margin SVM, we introduce slack variables in the margin and minimize its sum, and: "(i) $\nu$ is an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors (and hence also on the fraction of training errors). (ii) $\nu$ is a lower bound on the fraction of Support Vectors."
