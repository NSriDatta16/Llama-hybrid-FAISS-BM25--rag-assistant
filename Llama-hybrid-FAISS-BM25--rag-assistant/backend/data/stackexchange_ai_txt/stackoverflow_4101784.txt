Calling a generic method with a dynamic type

Lets say I have the following classes public class Animal { .... } public class Duck : Animal { ... } public class Cow : Animal { ... } public class Creator { public List CreateAnimals (int numAnimals) { Type type = typeof(T); List returnList = new List (); //Use reflection to populate list and return } } Now in some code later I want to read in what animal to create. Creator creator = new Creator(); string animalType = //read from a file what animal (duck, cow) to create Type type = Type.GetType(animalType); List animals = creator.CreateAnimals (5); Now the problem is the last line isn't valid. Is there some elegant way to do this then?
