According to your descriptions, here are some good ones: Theory of Statistics by Mark Schervish (an ideal book to prepare qualifying exams) Mathematical Statistics by Jun Shao (somewhat hard to read, very math intensive) Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics by Peter Bickel, et al. Theoretical Statistics by Robert Keener Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman, et al. (more applied) Hope it helps.
