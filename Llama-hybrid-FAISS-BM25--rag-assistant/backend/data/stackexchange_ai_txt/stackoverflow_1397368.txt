Even in the U.S., most of the address is not required. A large fraction of U.S. zip codes are allocated to various businesses and organizations - any mail to one of those zips will be delivered the same regardless of the rest of the address. For instance: General Electric Schenectady, NY 12345 Internal Revenue Service Ogden, UT 84201-0027 The city and state are nice, but the mail will probably get delivered without.
