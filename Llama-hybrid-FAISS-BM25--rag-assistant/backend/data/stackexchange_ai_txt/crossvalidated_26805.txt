Average of a tail of a normal distribution

I have a sample that is pretty normally distributed with a mean greater 0. Is there any way to get a closed form estimate for the mean of all values that are less than 0? In other words, given a mean, variance and a variable x , can I estimate the average of all values that are smaller than x ?
