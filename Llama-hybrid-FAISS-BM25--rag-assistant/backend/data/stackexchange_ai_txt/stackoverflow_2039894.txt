I think the most relevant difference is that unsetting a variable communicates that the variable will not be used by subsequent code (it also "enforces" this by reporting an E_NOTICE if you try to use it, as jspcal said that's because it's not in the symbol table anymore). Therefore, if the empty string is a legal (or sentinel) value for whatever you are doing with your variable, go ahead and set it to ''. Otherwise, if the variable is no longer useful, unsetting it makes for clearer code intent.
