How does multicollinearity affect neural networks?

Multicollinearity is a problem for linear regression because the results become unstable / depend too much on single elements ( source ). (Also, the inverse of $X^TX$ doesn't exist so the standard OLS estimator does not exist ... I have no idea how, but sklearn deals with it just fine ) Is (perfect) multicollinearity also a problem for neural networks?
