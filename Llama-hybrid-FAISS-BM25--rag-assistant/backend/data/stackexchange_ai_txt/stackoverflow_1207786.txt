Nothing official from Embarcadero, but I think around 2010-2011 based on: Embarcadero's CEO Wayne Williams said in interview with The Register: Williams says cross-platform is now a higher priority than a 64-bit compiler, though both are planned, and that we will see the first cross-platform release next year . Beside Robert Love commented at his blog which was about next Delphi versions: Nothing was set in stone. These are current plans and they may change. Time frames where avoided, but one comment was made in Q & A... They did not see anything on this list taking longer than 201 1. So 2-3 years may be practical since time frames were really avoided, I would not plan on anything right now.
