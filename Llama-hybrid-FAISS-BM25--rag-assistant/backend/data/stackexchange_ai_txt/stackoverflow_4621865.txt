How to handle correctly converting images to thumbnails

I'm building out an admin area for an ecommerce site where the user can create a new product and upload multiple images to be used for the product. I have a table that lists all of the products, each row shows the first image returned from the database. I can scale down a large image to 100px x 100px but the user is still downloading a big image, not a true thumbnail. I see two ways of doing this: 1. I can make the user choose which img will be the thumbnail so that the regular img is upload and also a smaller version of the file. 2.I can create thumbnails for every img that is uploaded and append to the filename of the thumbnail img so that I can return the first image that ends with a certain string. Is there a more elegant way to do this or am I on the right track?
