Model fit after inverse regression and forward stagewise on residuals

I work with prediction of height based on genetic information. The data is several hundred thousand data points from every organism, but a simplified version could be: df = data.frame(ID = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), height = c(2, 4, 6, 10, 12), gene1 = c(0.2, -0.3, -0.6, -0.7, -0.8), gene2 = c(0.4, -0.2, -0.4, -0.2, -0.6), gene3 = c(-0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7)) I became interested in doing inverse regression on gene 1, since the residual values I obtain from that gives different results than using height as response. So the regression is: model1 I then take the residual values from this and do forward stagewise (LARS package) after removing gene1 from the dataframe: resid $residuals resid resid, type="forward.stagewise", max.steps=2, use.Gram=FALSE) After doing this, Iâ€™m interested in fitting the model so I can get a value for height (and run the test set). Since I am using the residual values for the stagewise procedure, I am not sure how to obtain this. Assistance greatly appreciated!
