For regression, the first half of Gelman and Hill is great. For time series, my recommendation would be Hyndman and Athana­sopou­los . Both use R for the examples. For econometrics intuition , I really like A Guide to Econometrics by Peter Kennedy . Each topic starts with a simple explanation, usually with diagrams, followed by technical notes with some math and references. More applied texts on microeconometrics are Cameron and Trivedi's Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications and Microeconometrics Using Stata . The first is geared at the applied researcher with some Stata examples, the second is aimed at the student and has more examples than you can shake a stick at.
