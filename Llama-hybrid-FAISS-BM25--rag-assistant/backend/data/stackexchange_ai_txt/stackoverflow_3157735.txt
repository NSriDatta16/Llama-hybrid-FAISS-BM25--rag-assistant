Magento: Newsletters not going out

The problem i have is that i have created newsletter template, added few subscribers and i can add the template with subscribers into queue - all that works fine. I can also run the cron.php from the browser - it runs without errors, but the damn e-mails are not going out anyway. For that reason i have not done the crontab -e and added the stuff into that file yet. As far as i see - it does not matter where you execute the file from - be it crontab, shell or browser - it should work in any case. And i can see that it is not working. Any ideas? Alan
