Using Logistic Regression to simulate data

I want to simulate data of the form: $$ Z=e^{X_1+X_2}+X_3 + \epsilon $$ for i.i.d. $X_1,X_2,X_3\sim\mathcal{U}(-1,1)$ and $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ I have (using R) generated 10,000 realisations of $Z$ and now want to associate them to a (binary) categorical variable $Y$ which takes values $0$ and $1$ . I've done this by using Logistic Regression - with the $i^{\text{th}}$ realisation denoted as $Z_i$ - I used the realisations of $Z$ as the log-odds by calculating the probability of $Y=1$ as $$ \frac{e^{Z_i}}{1+e^{Z_i}} $$ which in turn gives values in $[0,1]$ . My question is: I've only seen Logistic Regression used when the log-odds is a linear function - am I allowed to do what I have done to attain a probability, despite my log-odds is not a linear function? If not, what other methods are there so that I can simulate such data? (I am using R so I would be grateful if you could provide insight on what R can do) Also, I have used this method for a data generating process with an interaction i.e. $Y=X_1+X_2+X_1X_2+\epsilon$ .
