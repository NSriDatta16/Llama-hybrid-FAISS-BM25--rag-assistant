I'll dare to say that mod_wsgi is probably closer to the de-facto choice (vs. mod_python) if you're stuck with Apache as your web server these days. One benefit is that you'll find a wide range of active frameworks and libraries that are WSGI compatible. Please don't read too deeply into "framework" - some things I'd lump in there are quite minimal, providing a few nice conveniences on top of raw WSGI to help you organize your code. Imagining that you're not looking to invest into a web framework itself just to get a REST interface up, you might check out restish as an option.
