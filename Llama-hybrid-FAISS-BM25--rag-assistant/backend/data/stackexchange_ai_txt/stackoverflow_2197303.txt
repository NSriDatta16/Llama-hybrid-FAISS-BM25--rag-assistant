On my server with your configuration my base performance is as follows: InnoDB: 5.71s MyISAM: 2.50s This is not bad in my book, but it can use some tweaking. Your InnoDB performance can be improved on several fronts: Increase innodb_buffer_pool_size This is the single most important InnoDB configuration variable. Ideally it should be 70-80% of your available RAM on a server dedicated to MySQL and InnoDB. Increasing innodb_buffer_pool_size on my server to 2G (more than enough for this test) decreased the InnoDB time to 4.60s Make id the PRIMARY KEY InnoDB clusters it's data based on PRIMARY KEY. When you don't declare one, InnoDB generates a random one implicitly. Having a sequential primary key (id) is faster than a random one. Making id the PRIMARY KEY on my server decreased the InnoDB time to 3.80s Upgrade your MySQL/InnoDB With MySQL 5.1+ MySQL supports pluggable storage engines. Specifically the new InnoDB Plugin . The new InnoDB engine provides many numerous performance enhancements that may have significant affects on this particular type of query. Of note: As of MySQL 5.1.38, the InnoDB Plugin is included in MySQL As of MySQL 5.1.43, the InnoDB Plugin is not only included, but is the default engine for MySQL
