String and date manipulation as well as calculations are a pain in SharePoint Designer workflows. The links Colin mentioned are good, but you may also want to consider embedding C# or vb.net code directly into your SharePoint Designer Workflow (Without the need for Visual Studio). I wrote a component that allows you to do this and blogged about it at the following URL: http://www.muhimbi.com/blog/2009/12/embed-c-or-vb-code-directly-in.html
