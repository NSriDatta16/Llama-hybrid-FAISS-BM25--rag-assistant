Safely Storing Biometric Information for Comparison

I'm using a biometric fingerprint scanner with an SDK that allows me to compare two images of a fingerprint. My question is if I wanted to locally store one of the images for later comparison what is the safest way to do this? My line of thinking is that when doing the same thing with passwords, an easy safe way would be to hash the original password for storage, and later compare hashes instead of plaintext passwords. Obviously this is impossible with the fingerprint images as they would produce slightly different results each time. So what is the safest way to store the original image? Thanks in advance
