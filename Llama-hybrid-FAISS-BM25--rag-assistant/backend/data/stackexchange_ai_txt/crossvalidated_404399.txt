The reason is the "concentration" part of the "concentration time series": log transformations are often useful in analysis of chemical concentration data. As the concentrations of the pollutants at issue in the linked paper are necessarily positive, may have inherent measurement errors that are proportional to the measured values rather than independent of measured values, and the covariates being considered might be better related to percentage changes in those concentrations rather than to linear changes, a log transformation of the concentration values could let the model fit better while meeting the underlying assumption (stated in the end of the sentence you copy here) that the error terms $\varepsilon_i$ are normally distributed with variance constant over the range of values. More discussion about use of log transforms specifically in time-series analysis is on this page .
