how to substitute a for loop in R with an optimized function (lapply?)

I've a data frame with time events on each row. In one row I've have the events types of sender (typeid=1) and on the other the events of the receiver (typeid=2). I want to calculate the delay between sender and receiver (time difference). My data is organized in a data.frame, as the following snapshot shows: dd[1:10,] timeid valid typeid 1 18,00035 1,00000 1 2 18,00528 0,00493 2 3 18,02035 2,00000 1 4 18,02116 0,00081 2 5 18,04035 3,00000 1 6 18,04116 0,00081 2 7 18,06035 4,00000 1 8 18,06116 0,00081 2 9 18,08035 5,00000 1 10 18,08116 0,00081 2 calc_DelayVIDEO To perform the calculations for delay I use calc_DelayVideo function, neverthless for data frames with a high number of records (~60000) it takes a lot of time. How can I substitute the for loop with more optimized R functions? Can I use lapply to do such computation? If so, can you provide me an example? Thanks in advance,
