What to do if the learning curve of a loss does not show down trend?

I trained a neural network for 2000 steps, each corresponding to an upgrade in the params, and it takes 9000 steps to get through the whole training set. However, the loss curve didn't show down trend but juggle around a small range, except a drop at the beginning of the first epoch. Should I stop and make some changes, or should I keep training and when should I stop if the curve does not show down trend? I use google colab and pay with my own money, I have to take into account the cost, and cannot risk my money to keep training without certainty. I am looking for a general advice, and appreciate any help.
