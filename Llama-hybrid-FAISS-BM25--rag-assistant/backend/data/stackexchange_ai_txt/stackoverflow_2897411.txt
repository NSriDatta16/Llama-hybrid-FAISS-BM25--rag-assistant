Get Ajax4JSF (a4j component) running on Glassfish

I'm trying to build an Java EE 6-application on GlassFish V3, using JSF 2.0, Weld, JPA2 and Maven. Now i'm having trouble getting a simple running. This is the fragment of my little example. When typing something into the inputtext, the outputtext should automatically be updated. But nothing happens (not in Firefox, not in IE8). Beside that my example doesn't work, my problem is also that i don't really understand if i need a JSF implementation (MyFaces, Richfaces, Primefaces etc.) or not to use a4j elements. Is it "built-in" in glassfish? Until now, i only have the following dependencies i think i need in for JSF: com.sun.faces jsf-api 2.0.2 com.sun.faces jsf-impl 2.0.2 javax javaee-api 6.0 provided So... what do i have to do to get Ajax4JSF running on a simple Java EE-App on GlassFish?
