Erm, I am not sure if I understand your question. Are you asking HOW to store a string in a file using C or are you asking the best way to encode binary data for file storage? If the former, I suggest the following resources: C File I/O WriteFile function (MSDN) If the latter, then there are numerous encoding methods and standards, but frankly I don't see why you don't just store your binary string as-is. EDIT: Think about it again, the obvious solution would be to convert your binary number into an integer or hex and store that.
