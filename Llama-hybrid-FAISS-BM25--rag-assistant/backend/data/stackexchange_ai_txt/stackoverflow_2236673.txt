Tested on XP, Delphi 2010 - I get the artifacts, so it's XP related and not fixed in D2010 Edit: Upon further investigation - if you drag an icon so that the mouse only just enters the box (but the icon doesn't) then the box is drawn correctly, it's only when the icon enters the paintbox that the artifacts occur. I added code so that if state was dsDragMove then it would force a repaint and this worked, but suffered from flicker
