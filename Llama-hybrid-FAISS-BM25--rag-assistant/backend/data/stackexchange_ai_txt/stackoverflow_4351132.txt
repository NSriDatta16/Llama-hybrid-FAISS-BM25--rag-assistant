Neither of undefined, implementation defined, unspecifed behavior

C++03 $5.3.3/2 - "The size of a most derived class shall be greater than zero (1.8)." $1.8/4 - "Unless it is a bit-field (9.6), a most derived object shall have a non-zero size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage." My question then is: Is the size of an empty class unspecified, implemention defined? Is it supposed to be documented by the compiler documentation? Those two quotes leave it so open ended as far as my understanding is correct.
