Using a PCA to reduce response variables or multivariate multiple regression?

Does it make sense to use a PCA (principal component analysis) on a set of response Y variables and then conduct a multiple regression, or carry out a multivariate multiple regression all response variables as they are? I have 4 response variables and 2 predictor variables, which are all continuous.
