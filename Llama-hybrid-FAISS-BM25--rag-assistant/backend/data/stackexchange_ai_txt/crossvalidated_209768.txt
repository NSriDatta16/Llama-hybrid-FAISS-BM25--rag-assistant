PCA uses all original variables by design: each individual PC is a linear combination of all original dimensions. Therefore, even when discarding some PC dimensions obtained from PCA, the remaining PC dimensions still contain information from all original variables . PCA requires numerical data from the mathematical point of view. Categorial variables don't have the required properties, e.g. relations between categories are not defined as they are for numeric information (e.g. variable 1 with possible levels A , B , and C : it is not defined if value A is e.g. twice as big as B ). Creating dummy variables from categories solves this problem: each dummy variable can be treated as numeric (e.g. -1,1 or 0,1), which therefore allows PCA computation.
