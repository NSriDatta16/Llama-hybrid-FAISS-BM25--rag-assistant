Is there anything inherently wrong with long object invocation chains?

I've organized my code hierarchically and I find myself crawling up the tree using code like the following. File clientFolder = task.getActionPlan().getClientFile().getClient().getDocumentsFolder(); I'm not drilling down into the task object; I'm drilling up to its parents, so I don't think I'm losing anything in terms of encapsulation; but a flag is going off in the back of my mind telling me there's something dirty about doing it this way. Is this wrong?
