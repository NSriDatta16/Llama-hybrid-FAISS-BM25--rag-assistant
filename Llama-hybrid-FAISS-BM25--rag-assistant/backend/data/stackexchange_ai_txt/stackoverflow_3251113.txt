Timer in Java for noise generation

I am actually working on Android Call block App. however my part of code requires Java to generate obstacle/noise in the phone call. I want to generate mute and unmute signals in a loop with varying intervals between them. Let me show with Pseudo Code in order to quickly explain logic. array Tmute=[1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1]; //time in seconds to mute microphone array TunMute=[3,1,2,4,1,2,1,2,4]; //time in seconds to unmute microphone int i=0; runThisLoop for (UserDefinedTime t) { MuteTheMicroPhone(); thread.sleep(Tmute[i]); UnMuteTheMicroPhone(); thread.sleep(TunMute[i]); i++; } DropCall(); I will take care of array out of bounds. My Question : Is there a better way to generate the specific Tmute and TunMute which matches my pattern of noise generation, my pattern is shown in Array. Since I am using Android Device memory, I was concerned about efficient programming. Please comment and let me know if this question is not clear.
