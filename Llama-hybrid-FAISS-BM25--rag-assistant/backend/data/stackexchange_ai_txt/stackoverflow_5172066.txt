So you can do the following: You can write the prices in column A (starting with row 2 1,99, 1,59...) and all the numbers in row 1 (starting with column B 6,8,12....) if you have this you can just put: B$1*$A2 Into coulm b2. Now you can paste this formula by dragging the spot at the cell corner to other cells. The Row number will automaticly change.
