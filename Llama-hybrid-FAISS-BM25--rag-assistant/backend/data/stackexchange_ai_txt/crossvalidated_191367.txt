The tensorflow example is what a convolutional neural network generally refers to. Though I found Coates's paper very interesting and profound, I think the term "Convolutional extraction" used might seem somewhat misleading. If I understood correctly, the way it extracts patches is the same as CNNs, but it uses a set of fixed features learned unsupervisedly instead of performing 2D convolutions with adjustable weights, which makes it different from the common definition of CNNs.
