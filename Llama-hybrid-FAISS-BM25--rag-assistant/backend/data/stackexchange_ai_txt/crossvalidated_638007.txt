What does it mean for spectral graph representation methods to be limited to a single graph structure?

I'm trying to get deeper into the topic of graph neural networks. While reading this paper recently, I came across a statement that confused me. The authors state that spectral methods are limited to a "single graph structure", while spatial methods are not. One limitation of the above [referring to 2 ] spectral formulations is that they rely on the fixed spectrum of the graph Laplacian, and thus are suitable only for graphs with a single structure (and varying signals on vertices). Spatial formulations, on the contrary, are not restricted to a fixed graph structure. Could somebody explain to me what that means? What exactly is this limitation about? And are GCNs (as an instance of spectral graph convolutions (?)) affected by this?
