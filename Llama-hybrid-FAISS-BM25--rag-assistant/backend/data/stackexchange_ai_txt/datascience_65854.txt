How to train Ner Model having 1 entity?

I am Creating a Custom NER (named entity recognition ) Model using bi directional LSTM and CRF. During Study on Ner i see all example includes Multiple entities per sentence. For eample this sentence includes 2 entities (jhon lives in Us) jhon = S-Per , US=S-Country Question 1: Can we Create a model using (bi lstm crf) where we only want to predict 1 entity.? Question 2: In CRF States of the neighbors affect the current prediction so predicting 1 entity per sentence seems difficult specially with CRF? Question 3 : if i Cannot achieve this with CRF can I use Bert to train a model having 1 entity per model? Thanks In advance.
