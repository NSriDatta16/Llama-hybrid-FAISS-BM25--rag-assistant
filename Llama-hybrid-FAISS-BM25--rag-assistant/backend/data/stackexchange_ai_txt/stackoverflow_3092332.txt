What transport technology is a viable alternative to MSMQ on Unix based system?

I am planning on experimenting with NServiceBus on Mono to be deployed on Unix based systems. NServiceBus leverage's MSMQ by default. This can be easilly swapped out for an alterntive transport technology. What I need to know is what are the alternatives to MSMQ on Unix based systems, and how to do they differ and what are the pros & cons? Related Questions: " How to swap out MSMQ in NServiceBus 2.0 for a different transport technolog y" " NServiceBus 2.0 considerations when running on Mono and deployed to Unix "
