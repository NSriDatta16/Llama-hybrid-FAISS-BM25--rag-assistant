I myself is coding web crawlers for different purposes. And I use a web browser UserAgent. As far as I know, you cannot distinguish bots from humans if a bot is using a legit UserAgent. Like: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/9.0.570.1 Safari/534.11 The only thing I can think of is JavaScript. Most custom web bots (like those that I code) can't execute javascript codes because it's a browser job. But if the bot is linked or using a web browser (Like firefox) then it will be undetected.
