So it a little hard to know how to answer the question. Why do you need to cut the number of records down? If you want to rank them, rank them to what purpose? Ranking implies there are positives and negatives, or at least less positives. One way you could approach this is to perform PCA. That said, I think you should consider disqualifying some fields, like the address fields.
