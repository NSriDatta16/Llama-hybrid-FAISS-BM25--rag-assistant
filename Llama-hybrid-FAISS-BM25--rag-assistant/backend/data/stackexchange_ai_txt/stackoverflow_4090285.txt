I would do all your views as usual (except they would only be HTML fragments that would be inserted into the page) and then have an extra "special" controller and view that loads your views via Ajax. When a link is clicked or something like that the JavaScript makes an Ajax request to the special controller with the view you want to load. The special controller then renders the view and sends it back to be inserted into the page.
