Yes, you seem to be on the right track. One quibble: to check if an email address exists in the db, you should ideally use a GET rather than a POST, as no information is being updated - you are simply asking if something exists. One alternative to returning JSON is to return pre-rendered HTML which you can inject directly into the DOM at the appropriate point. The advantage of doing it this way is that you can use Django's template mechanism to render your existing template fragments - the only difference is that you render a fragment in isolation, rather than including/extending it within an entire HTML page.
