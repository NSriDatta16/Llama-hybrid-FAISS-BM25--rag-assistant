MCMC is just an algorithm to sample from a distribution. On its own it is neither frequentist nor Bayesian. However, this algorithm has proven to be extremely useful for Bayesians. It has made it feasible to sample from the posterior distribution, and with those samples in hand, describe the posterior distribution. Before its use, real use of Bayesian statistics was mostly limited to models with conjugate priors. Meaning that before MCMC Bayesian statistics was more a theoretical, but unpractical, area of statistics. So most statistician would associate MCMC with Bayesian rather than frequentist statistics. Is see both approaches as necessarily flawed approximations to answer to an unanswerable question: How do I give an answer when I don't have all the information? In the way I use statistics, the difference between the outcomes of these two methods is negligible. So I use pragmatic reasons to choose my method: unless Bayesian statistics has a clear added value, I will use frequentist because it is easier to "sell" my articles to journals. The potential added value of a Bayesian analysis would for example be if I have a prior that I really want to include in my analysis, and that prior is strong enough to influence my results. Especially, the latter is a fairly hard condition to meet in the type of analyses I do and the type of data I usually work with. So in the end I almost never use Bayesian statistics. Some claim that the added value of the Bayesian is that the inference is more intuitive, and I kinda get their argument. However, it ignores the fact that most of my audience is not trained in Bayesian statistics. So until the majority is trained in Bayesian statistics, its potential cannot be realized. This is a catch 22: people are trained in frequentist statistics because that is what everybody uses, and everybody uses frequentists statistics because that is what everybody is trained in. However, we have to work with the world we live in, and not with the world we would want to live in.
