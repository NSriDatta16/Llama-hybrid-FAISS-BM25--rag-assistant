PHP Sessions - Locking and Sharing questions

I would like to know if it is possible to read $_SESSION attributes without locking it. Currently, session_start() locks SESSION, that means other PHP processes will wait until it is unlocked. But, some processes just want to get some $_SESSION variables, not to write on them. Is that possible to implement some function like session_get(string $id) which doesn't lock SESSION? Also, it is possible to share SESSIONs between browsers, once the user is logged in the same account, for example, using session_id('shared_vars_of_'.$userid) . But, is that secure? Is this discouraged? Thanks, Nuno
