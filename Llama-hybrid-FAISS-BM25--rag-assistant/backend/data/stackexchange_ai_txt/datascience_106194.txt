If you want to make some kind of comparison of cost across the categories and the manufacturer, then you can compare the prices on mean/median. library(tidyverse) test_data %>% group_by(Toys, Manufacturer) %>% summarise(Price=mean(Price)) %>% ggplot()+ geom_bar(aes(x=Manufacturer, y=Price, fill=Toys), stat = 'identity',position = 'dodge')+ scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1')+ theme_bw()+ theme(legend.position = 'top') Side note: Significance of the graph? Hungry Hippo and Tin soldier are made by only 1 Manufacturer while Slinky is produced by all three. Even though it is produced by all the three manufacturers, the average price varies and it is the highest for Manufacturer C.
