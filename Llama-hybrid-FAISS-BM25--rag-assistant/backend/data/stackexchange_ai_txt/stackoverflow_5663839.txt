How do you know the file exists at the path you're interested in? Can you view it with DDMS or ADB after your application saved it there? What code are you using to save/read the file? I may be able to provide more specific assistance with that information. The method used to obtain the internal storage directory on any given device is Context.getFilesDir() . To create a reference to a file named "myfile.dat", for instance: File myFile = new File(getFilesDir(),"myfile.dat"); Assuming you call the code from inside an Activity or other Context. In order to attach this file to an email, you would be passing a Uri to that location as an extra, so let's add the creation of that to the example: File myFile = new File(getFilesDir(),"myfile.dat"); Uri fileUri = Uri.fromFile(myFile); This is all assuming the file was properly saved into Internal Storage in the first place. Hope that Helps!
