Java clob retrieval using getString - character encoding issue

So I have a database with a table, where one of it's entries is ' é€áí ', and I know this is correct in the db. It is stored as a clob . In Java, I retrieve the entry like so: String text = resultSet.getString(DBConstants.COL_NOTE_TEXT); When debugging, text is equal to ' é\u0080áí ' and when displayed on the screen the euro symbol is a square block. Anyone seen this before? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
