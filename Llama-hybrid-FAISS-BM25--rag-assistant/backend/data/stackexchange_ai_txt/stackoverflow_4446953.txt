There are quite a few text/video casts covering this, since its a popular use case. I would encourage you to look at: http://railscasts.com/episodes/73-complex-forms-part-1 or its equivalent asciicast (which is a text based cast of the video). Further I would recommend you use formtastic. Associations are managed automatically so it makes form building trivial and keeps your code tidy. And yes there are casts for that too. http://railscasts.com/episodes/184-formtastic-part-1
