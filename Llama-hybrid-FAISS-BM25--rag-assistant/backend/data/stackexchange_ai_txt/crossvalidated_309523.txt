Can I run a two-factor ANCOVA analysis with two continuous independent variables?

I have a dataset that includes in situ measurements of: Dependent variable- growth rates (continuous) Independent variable - temperature (continuous) Independent variable - food concentration (continuous) and I want to test the effect of food concentration on growth rates, while accounting for the different temperatures (study organism is known to grow faster at higher temperatures). Can I do an ANCOVA analysis with two continuous (i.e. not categorical) independent variables? If not, what is an alternative analysis/method to statistically account for temperature? Note: It's been suggested that I run an ANOVA with an interaction term between temperature and food concentration, but I'm not convinced that this sufficiently standardizes growth rates to temperature rather than testing any relationships between temperature and food concentration. Is ANOVA actually the right choice? Thanks!
