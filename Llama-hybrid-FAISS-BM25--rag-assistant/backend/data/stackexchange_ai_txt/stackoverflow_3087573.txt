A bit of poking around in Firebug reveals that removing the border-collapse:collapse style from the ctl00_wpm_Basket_ctl04_BasketGrid table removes the borders. I'm not even going to try to explain this - the style should be completely unnecessary, as like many of the other applicable styles it's set and reset multiple times at multiple levels... I suspect you're encountering some subtle difference between how styles are applied in Gecko and other browsers; it's probably a bug, but I would encourage you to slim down the test case if you decide to report it... this isn't something that is currently scoped to fix It probably should be... Otherwise, you'd better get comfortable using Firebug.
