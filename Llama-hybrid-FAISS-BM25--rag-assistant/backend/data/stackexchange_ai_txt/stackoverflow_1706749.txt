swing, show a JList over a editable jTable to select entries to autocomplete the text

I have a JTable with editable cells. Each Cell contains a CarretListener for quick validation of the entered text. But in one special cell you should be able to select entrys out of a list. The List is generated when you enter a text. The Programm serach in a list for entrys equal so the entered text, like google suggest. So far its all good. But i dont get it how to show the list at the right position. I tried the GlassPane but this doesn't work so well. I have problems to get the Cordinates of the cell and to show the JList. Set the row height so show the whole list also dosn't work because i don't want to change the whole row. Maybe there is a trick in the TableCellRenderer or so...? I don't want a complete sourcecode or so, but a I need a push in the right direction. Here is a pic of the programm and hwo it should look like: http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3227/sosollsseinh.jpg Thanks for your attention Marc
