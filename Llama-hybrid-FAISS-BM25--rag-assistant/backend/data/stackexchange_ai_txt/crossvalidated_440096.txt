Is CNN capable of extracting the descriptive statistics features

I was trying to build a CNN model. I used time series data of daily temperature to predict if there is risk of an event, say bacteria growth. I calculated the descriptive statistics of the time series, ie. mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis etc for each observation and added them to input data. My question: Is CNN capable of extracting the effect of the descriptive statistics the label, meaning that adding these descriptive statistics features manually does not make a difference? (I will still try this later, but like to hear what you think about it). Thanks
