You've interpreted the test wrong. If the p value is greater than 0.05 then the residuals are independent which we want for the model to be correct. If you simulate a white noise time series using the code below and use the same test for it then the p value will be greater than 0.05. m = c(ar, ma) w = arima.sim(m, 120) w = ts(w) plot(w) Box.test(w, type="Ljung-Box")
