What is the end result of running a machine learning algorithm on a data-set look like?

So I'm reading some research papers on machine learning applied to classification algorithms and one of the steps in the algorithm psuedo-code says: "Obtain classification prediction P from machine learning classification algorithm" . My questions is what does this multiclass classification prediction P look like?
