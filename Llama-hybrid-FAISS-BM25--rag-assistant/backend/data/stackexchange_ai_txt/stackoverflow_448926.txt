Is there a way to write asp.net web service so they are easier to convert to WCF?

For example, I know that the WCF style web services don't rely so much on Session/Application/Request/Response as web services did. Are there any other gotchas I should keep in mind when writing web services today with the intention of making them WCF services as soon as my organization lets me use WCF? I don't think I'm interested writing 2.0 webservices then using WCF's compatiblity mode, because that would be all the complexity without so much of the benefits of the new model.
