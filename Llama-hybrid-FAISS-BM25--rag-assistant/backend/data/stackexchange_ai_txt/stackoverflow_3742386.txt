It sounds like you have a bunch of reviews and you want to average them on the fly when someone searches, is this correct? If so, I think it would probably work better to save the averaged ratings as fields in the Book model. The reason I say this is that it is likely your app will be doing more searching than saving reviews, and it's probably more important to have searches returned quickly than reviews saved quickly. However, if you want to calculate these averages on the fly, you can use MySQL's AVG() function. Check this SO post for an example that I think is pretty close to your situation: MySQL - Can I combine these 2 SQL statements? Combine JOIN and AVG? Also, this is a situation where I'd probably just write the SQL and stick it into a query() , rather than trying to wrestle with Cake's ORM syntax: http://book.cakephp.org/view/456/query
