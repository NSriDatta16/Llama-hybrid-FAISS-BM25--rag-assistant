Oracle (0x80004005)ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve the connect identifier

I'm trying to connect to an oracle db from an ASP classic application, however I keep running into the ORA-12154 error. TNSNAMES.ORA is configured properly DBSOURCE.A.B.com = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = C.D.B.com)(PORT = 1231)) ) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = DBSOURCE) ) ) I can TNSPING C:\Documents and Settings\USERID.A>tnsping DBSOURCE TNS Ping Utility for 32-bit Windows: Version 10.2.0.4.0 - Production on 09-MAR-2 011 09:12:31 Copyright (c) 1997, 2007, Oracle.

I can connect to the oracle db through toad. I've checked my sqlnet.ora file NAMES.DEFAULT_DOMAIN = A.B.com SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES= (NONE) NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH= (TNSNAMES, EZCONNECT) I've also checked that the TNSNAMES.ORA as one of my system paths. I can connect to the DB with SQLPLUS Here is the code that throws the error dim CnnStr Set Cnn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") CnnStr="Provider=MSDAORA.1;Password=pass;User ID=user;Data Source=DBSOURCE" Cnn.Open CnnStr I am running windows XP Pro 32bit SP3 I've tested this on a co-workers machine and the asp app has no issues, am I missing a configuration somewhere or did I mess up my config? Thanks for the help everyone!
