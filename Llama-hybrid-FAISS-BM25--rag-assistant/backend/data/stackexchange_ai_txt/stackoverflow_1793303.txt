Ratings Query Structure and Process Economy

I am trying to display overall ratings on the front of my site and although my site and DB are small now, I think this query and process might bog things down when this table gets large. Right now, I have ratings employed that are easy because my query is saying: find all records for this ID, pull all ratings and average them. What I now want to do is a query that says: Find ALL records regardless of ID, sort by ID, average any existing "RATINGS" for each record, hold the rating somewhere with associated ID then have a cutoff at the top 10 records. This middle area in the real world would be like "scratch paper" and I don't know how to address this middle ground. Well, I do, but all those remaining results that fall outside of the ten that I want seem like a wasted process?? I don't know.. I recall a guy talking about memcache or something once. Is that the "scratch pad" i am looking for?? Thanks, Rob
