Competitive mediation is familiar for me because we studied the Baron and Kenny (1987) paper. We learned the concept in master level research methods in M.S organizational and industrial psychology in Iran / Isfahan. Competitive mediation is a type of partial mediation that occurs when is removed the mediating variable relationship between X and Y is existed too and significant. Competitive mediation and complementary mediation are two types of partial mediation. When we cross these signs of a, b, and c together, if result is negative, we deduce this is competitive mediation. But if, when we cross these signs 0f a, b, and c toghether, the result is positive, we deduce this is a complementary mediation.
