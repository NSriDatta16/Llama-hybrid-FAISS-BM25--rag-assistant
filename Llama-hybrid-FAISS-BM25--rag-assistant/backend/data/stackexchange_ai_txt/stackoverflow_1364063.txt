correct FK PK relationship

I have a new layout to figure it has 3 tables UnfiledFiles SortedFiles FileVersion The process will start with an UnfiledFile Record and a FileVersion and several versions may be added all joined to the same UnfiledFile From there I am going to need to tie all the Versions for a particular UnfiledFile record with a SortedFile Record. What organization would you see this working best with?
