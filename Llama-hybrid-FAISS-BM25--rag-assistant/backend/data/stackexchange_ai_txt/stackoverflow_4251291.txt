Concepts that work well for structuring data in Relational databases are just as valid for document storage databases. The only thing that really changes is that queries that would normally be done with a join on a relational database are usually cumbersome in a NoSQL database. This means that one to many relationships usually resolved with a join on a RDBMs will usually involve much more denormalization on a NoSQL db. In a typical example of a one to many relationship, like Blog Posts and Comments on that post, instead of having a foreign key in the comment to the post, you would actually duplicate some data from the post into the comment to avoid having an extra query, and you would also keep a list of comment ID's (and maybe the 10 most recent comment bodies as well) in the post.
