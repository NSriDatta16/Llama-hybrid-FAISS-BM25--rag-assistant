I'm now toying with the idea of encoding the length of the number into the number itself. I still have not perfected this algorithm but will post it once done. But roughly this is what I am currently trying to achieve: Boundaries: Loss of precision is allowed (+- 3) Max number will be 3200 Min is 0 (so no negatives) No decimal - floats So now given my max allowed number I know that the length of the encoded digit in base 62 will have a max length of 2. So any encoded number is either 1 or 2 characters in length. Awesome. So now I'm going to make the number odd or even depending if its 1 or 2 characters (remember I can handle loss of precission). This removes the need for separators. Now I'm seeing about 70%-80% compression with this, its very buggy at the moment but I'm excited about it, so the post to encourage discussion around this methodology.
