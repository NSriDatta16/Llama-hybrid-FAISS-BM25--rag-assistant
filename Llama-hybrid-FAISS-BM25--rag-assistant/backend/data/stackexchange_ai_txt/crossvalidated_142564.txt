The p-value, or more generally, null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), is slowly holding less and less value. So much so that is has started to get banned in journals. Most people don't understand what the p-value really tells us and why it tells us this, even though it is used everywhere. The problem is that the p-value tells us $P(\text{Data}\,\vert\, H_0)$ and not $P(H_0\,\vert\,\text{Data})$, which is the more informative one. The latter involves the use the Bayesian inference, and provides a stronger basis for conclusions of model checking. The probability of the $H_0$ model being true/significant, given the data we have observed, has stronger implications than the probability of our data fitting the $H_0$ model.
