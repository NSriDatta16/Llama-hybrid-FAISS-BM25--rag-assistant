Alternatives to the "byvar" function in the metamean model "Meta-analysis of single means"

I have collected data from 300+ studies on microplastic densities in rivers, I would like to investigate how they vary with numeric variables (population density, Average GDP, plastic production) and character variables (vegetated/non-vegetated, continent, ecoregion, climatic zone). However, when running "metamean", and using the "byvar" function I can only analyze one variable at a time. Can anyone recommend a mutivariate method so I can look at what factors are driving the microplastic variation? Thanks
