How long should it take to build an index using ALTER TABLE in MySQL?

This might be a bit like asking how long a length of string is, but the stats are: Intel dual core 4GB RAM Table with 8million rows, ~ 20 columns, mostly varchars with an auto_increment primary id Query is: ALTER TABLE my_table ADD INDEX my_index (my_column); my_column is varchar(200) Storage is MyISAM Order of magnitude, should it be 1 minute, 10 minutes, 100 minutes? Thanks Edit: OK it took 2 hours 37 minutes, compared to 0 hours 33 mins on a lesser spec machine, with essentially identical set ups. I've no idea why it took so much longer. The only possibility is that the prod machine HD is 85% full, with 100GB free. Should be enough, but i guess it depends on how that free space is distributed.
