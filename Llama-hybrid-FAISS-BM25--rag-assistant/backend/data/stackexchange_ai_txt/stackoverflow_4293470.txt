There really isn't an easy way to do this, but the best thing you can do is tinker around with Artificial Neural Networks . They allow you to feed in data and get an output over many different data inputs. If you build the network right, it'll self-adjust its weights over many iterations. Sorry, but I doubt you're going to get the exact solution spelled out for you in code. Although I haven't used any of these libraries or resources, a quick glance over them makes them look pretty decent: http://franck.fleurey.free.fr/NeuralNetwork/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/neurondotnet/
