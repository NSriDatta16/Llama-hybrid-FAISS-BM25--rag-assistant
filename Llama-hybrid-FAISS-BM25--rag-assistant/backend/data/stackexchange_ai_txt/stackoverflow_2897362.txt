This page includes a Java method for stripping out invalid XML characters by testing whether each character is within spec, though it doesn't check for highly discouraged characters Incidentally, escaping the characters is not a solution since the XML 1.0 and 1.1 specs do not allow the invalid characters in escaped form either.
