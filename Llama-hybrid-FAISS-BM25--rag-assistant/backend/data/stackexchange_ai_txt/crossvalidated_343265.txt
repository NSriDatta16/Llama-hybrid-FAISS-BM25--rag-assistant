How to know if GBM or XGBOOST are overfitting?

Unlike in random forest, I can check the oob_score_ to verify how much my model is overfitting. How can I verify this for boosted trees algorithms? Currently, Using GBM I'm getting a accuracy of 95% on training set and 87% on test set. These numbers are after tuning on my validation set. How do I judge if this model is good enough or not? Also, I ran 10 K-fold cv and my variance is around 1% for test set. UPDATE: I'm using SMOTE to balance my classes
