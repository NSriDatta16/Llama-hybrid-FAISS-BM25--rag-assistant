Calculating overall Precision and Recall, one versus all

I've got several confusion matrices, all of binary classification (negative, positive). I would like to get general scores of all the matrices combine. Problem is, that the data is not balanced at all. For example, lets look on the following 2 sets of values: 1. Number of positive examples: 2, number of negative examples: 298 ----------+--------- | TN:290 | FP:8 | -------------------- | FN:1 | TP:1 | ----------+--------- 2. Number of positive examples: 46, number of negative example: 254 ----------+---------- | TN:233 | FP:21 | --------------------- | FN:20 | TP:26 | ----------+---------- So, taking an average of the metrics such as Precision, Recall etc. will not be a good representation. You can think of it as a one vs. all problem, changing the one each time and aggregating the result to get an overall performance, with consideration of the sample distribution.
