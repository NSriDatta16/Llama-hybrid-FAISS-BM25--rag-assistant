Use binary logistic because your outcome is binary. You can use the R function glm with argument family=binomial to do this. Use age, sex, and blood sugar as the predictors. Exponentiate the coefficient for blood sugar to get the adjusted odds ratio. Do +/- 1.96 * SE (before exponentiating) to get a 95% CI for the adjusted OR. Logistic regression is also implemented in any other statistical software package if you don't use R. Best, Hammond
