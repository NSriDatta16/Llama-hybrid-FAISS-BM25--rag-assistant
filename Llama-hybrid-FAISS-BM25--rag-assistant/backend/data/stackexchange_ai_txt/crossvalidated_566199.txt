Function vegan::betadisper is designed so so that you do not need to use principal coordinate analysis, but you can use original dissimilarities (or distances). Actually the math is the same, but in vegan::betadisper latter axes are not thrown out, but all are used â€“ including axes associated with negative eigenvalues. I can see some theoretical value of bypassing this work in vegan::betadisper and using just some first axes of PCoA, but if you do so, be prepared to give your arguments to the reviewers of your work. The argument would be that only the first axes have real information and the latter are noise. That is actually what you asked with "how many axes to use". Unfortunately, there won't be a firm answer to this (although various approximations can be suggested), and there is an added problem of handling (or ignoring) negative eigenvalues in PCoA with semimetric dissimilarities. I think it is easier to use vegan::betadisper like it was written.
