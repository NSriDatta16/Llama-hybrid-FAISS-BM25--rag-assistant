I am familiar with ILM. It's not an authentication service. ILM means Identity Lifecule Manager and it's a pretty good description of what it can do. It can provision new users, deprovision old users and allows you to copy identity data between identity stores. It also provides a password synchronisation service. You still use Active Directory or AD LDS (ex-ADAM) or some other directory for AuthN and AuthZ. Whilst ILM stores a whole load of data about your users, you are strongly discouraged from accessing that data directly. [EDIT] ILM does not provide LDAP services. Think of it as a manager: it doesn't do any work itself, it just rearranages things periodically. As your manager moves round data in the form of emails, it moves round data in the form of account details. ILM is a tool for managing identities across directories and databases. It doesn't make sense to consider ILM in the context of a single store, SQL, AD or any other - its job is to marshall data between stores. It wouldn't have anything to do if there was only a single store. Here's a typical scenario: you create a SQL table called People containing columns for firstName, lastName, jobTitle, department, a uniqueID, startDate and endDate. ILM is hooked into this table. It does a daily import and there is a new row. ILM uses the data in this row to create a userID in AD, another in Domino and another in a different SQL Database. It uses the jobTitle and department fields to assign group membership in AD, mailing lists in Domino and permissions in SQL. The user starts and works for a few weeks and then resigns. You set the endDate in the table and ILM notices this change on its next import. It updates the AD account to expire on that date and stores a delayed action to delete it after 90 days. 90 days later, it deletes the account. Likewise with the other accounts. You can use your personnel system instead of the SQL table but (a) it's not usually in the right format or maintained timely enough and (b) they're often itchy about letting you have access to their data.
