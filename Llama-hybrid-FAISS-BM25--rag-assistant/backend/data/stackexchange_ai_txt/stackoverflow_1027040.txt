A possible, but not quite elegant solution would be something like : private void dateTimePicker1_MouseWheel(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Delta > 0) { System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send("{UP}"); } else { System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.Send("{DOWN}"); } } this should definitely work in general case, but some corner cases might have unexpected results (like having KeyUp/KeyDown events overriden)
