Dashboard design: few CRUD functionalities in /admin

I want to make admin panel in my app /admin that will be used to CRUD few thinks, for example Users, Companies and Wastes. I want to do this all from one page, from /admin page. Sketched example: http://cl.ly/3v2L3Q260g2B2M2H0J0G Where is some simple way for making this? I can list, it's not a problem, but when I want to add new, or edit, I get stucked with routes and I don't know what more :D I have controllers and models for Users, Companies and Wastes, but I don't know how to properly organize them.
