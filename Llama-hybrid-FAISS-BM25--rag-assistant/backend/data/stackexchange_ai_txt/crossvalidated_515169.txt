What is the "effective sample size" of the prior in Bayesian statistics?

In Bayesian statistic, what is the mathematical definition of "effective sample size" of the prior? Could you provide what the "effective sample size" is for the well known classes of conjugate priors? Does this concept generalize to non-conjugate models? Why is the idea of "effective sample size" of the prior it important? Edit for the bounty: this question is very important and deserves a complete, canonical answer with more examples and proper explanations (trying to address the questions listed above).
