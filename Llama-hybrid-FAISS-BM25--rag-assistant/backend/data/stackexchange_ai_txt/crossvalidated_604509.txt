Is it still true that sklearn cannot be trusted for statistics Sklearn has insisted it is a machine learning library and not a statistics library. There have been a few cases where devs have plainly said so (and even pondered why users would want an unpenalized version of logistic regression). To measure sklearn against R for statistics is to judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree. s sklearn is community built as opposed to R which is often built by academic statisticians who will cite articles describing how to implement the code properly LOL if anything, this is an argument against R. Many (not all) academics are very poor software engineers with poor practices. While the example of the bootstrap in sklearn is notable, they have good software engineering practices from where I stand. I'd trust a project with 100 developers and good unit tests more than I trust one person with no software engineering best practices to speak of.
