The answer to your specific question about why z-score normalisation handles outliers better is largely to do with how standard deviations are calculated in the first place. If there are outliers, then the effect that the deviation from the mean related to those outliers will have on the final statistic (i.e, the standard deviation; the same value that will be used to normalise the feature) will be mitigated by the rest of the deviations within that same feature. In short, standard deviation is an aggregated calculation so individual values will carry less weight with the more observations there are. Conversely with min-max scaling where the values used to normalise the data will literally be the outliers themselves (assuming there are outliers of course). No aggregating, no averaging, just take the minimum value, take the maximum value and normalise all the observations in the feature relative to those values. If those minimum and maximum values happen to be outliers then you can see how they will impact the resulting normalisation. As far as I can see, how important this difference is will probably depend on the model that the data is being preprocessed for, and the question of "why those outliers would be kept in the data in the first place" is also valid, but maybe that's another discussion entirely. Anyway, Hope this helps.
