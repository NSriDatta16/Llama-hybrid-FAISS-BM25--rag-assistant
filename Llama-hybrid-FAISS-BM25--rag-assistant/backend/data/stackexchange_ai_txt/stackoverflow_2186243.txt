This guy was having the same problem: http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/15963-problem-initwithcontentsofurl.html . Looks like the API at Weather Underground is expecting a user-agent and returning a 500 HTTP response when it doesn't see one. You can use -initWithData:options:error: on CXMLDocument to pass the data you get using NSMutableURLRequest.
