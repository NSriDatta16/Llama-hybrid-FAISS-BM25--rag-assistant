getline does not save the new line character in the string. For example, if your file has the line "Hello World\n" getline will read this string "Hello World\0" So your code misses the "World". Igonoring that sentence is not defined, you could alter your code to work like this: #include #include using namespace std; int main(int argv, char *argc) { ifstream fin(argc[1]); char delimiter[]="|,.\n "; while (getline(fin,sentence)) { sentence += "\n"; int pos; pos = find_first_of(sentence,delimiter); while (pos != string:: npos) { if (pos > 0) { cout Note, I borrowed Bill the Lizards more elegant solution of appending the last delimiter. My previous version had a loop exit condition.
