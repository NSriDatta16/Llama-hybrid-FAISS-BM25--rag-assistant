Scan XAP for Files

i'm working on an Silverlight-Project, where i have some files in my XAP (in this case xml's) but the number of files can change and i don't even know the name of the files, but i want to read this files at runtime.. I know that due to Silverlight-Limitations it's not possible to scan a directory automatically, but maybe someone knows a workaround, any suggestion is appreciated. (EDIT) Ok, i see my Question is not really clear so here some Background: I'm working on an project that should support Modularity. A Module consists of a XAP and an XML-File, with some Meta-Information (like a Manifest in OSGI). Different developers should be able to build there Module and "deploy" it by putting there XML-Description in the XAP of the Main-Assembly (so Isolated Storage doesn't work). I could use an XML-File to "link" all the other XML-Files, but that seems like an redundant step to me. thanks in advance olli
