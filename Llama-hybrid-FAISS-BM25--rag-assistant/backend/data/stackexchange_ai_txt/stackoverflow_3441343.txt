pragmatically scroll UIScrollView upon shake gesture

HI, I have a view that has three UIScrollViews on the screen. I want to randomly scroll the UIScrollViews to different positions whenever a user shakes the iPhone, but I am unable to get it done. I have implemented the following in my ViewController class to detect and handle the shake gesture, the 3 UIScrollViews also belong to the same class. The shake gesture is detected, but the UIScrollViews do not change. What am I doing Wrong?? i have tried both motionBegan and motionEnded. -(BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder { return YES; } -(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated { [super viewDidAppear:animated]; [self becomeFirstResponder]; } - (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated { [self resignFirstResponder]; [super viewWillDisappear:animated]; } - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { int randomTag = arc4random() % [dirContents count]; CGRect nextImageView = [[scrollView1 viewWithTag:2] frame]; [scrollView1 scrollRectToVisible:nextImageView animated:YES]; randomTag = arc4random() % [dirContents count]; nextImageView = [[scrollView2 viewWithTag:4] frame]; [scrollView2 scrollRectToVisible:nextImageView animated:YES]; randomTag = arc4random() % [dirContents count]; nextImageView = [[scrollView3 viewWithTag:4] frame]; [scrollView3 scrollRectToVisible:nextImageView animated:YES]; NSLog(@"Shake Detected End"); } } Thank You
