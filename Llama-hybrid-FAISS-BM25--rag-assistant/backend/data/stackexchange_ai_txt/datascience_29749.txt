Yes. You can use a CapsuleNet as the discriminator in a GAN. See the following recent paper, which claims this improves over using CNNs as the discriminator: CapsuleGAN: Generative Adversarial Capsule Network . Ayush Jaiswal, Wael AbdAlmageed, Yue Wu, Premkumar Natarajan. arXiv:1802.06167 The improvement appears to be modest on the tasks they tested. It's not clear how to use a CapsuleNet as the generator, so the paper uses a CNN-based generator network.
