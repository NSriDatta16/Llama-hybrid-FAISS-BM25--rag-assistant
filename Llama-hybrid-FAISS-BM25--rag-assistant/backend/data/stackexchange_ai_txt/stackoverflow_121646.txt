PHP's predefined superglobal array $_SERVER contains a key "HTTP_USER_AGENT", which contains the value of the User-Agent header as sent in the HTTP request. Remember that this is user-provided data and is not to be trusted. Few users alter their user-agent string, but it does happen from time to time.
