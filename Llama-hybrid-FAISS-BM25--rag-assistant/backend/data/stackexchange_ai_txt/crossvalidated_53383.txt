Just in case, there's datastat https://sourceforge.net/p/datastat/code/ a simple program for Linux computing simple statistics from the command-line. For example, cat file.dat | datastat will output the average value across all rows for each column of file.dat. If you need to know the standard deviation, min, max, you can add the --dev, --min and --max options, respectively. datastat has the possibility to aggregate rows based on the value of one or more "key" columns. It's written in C++, runs fast and with small memory occupation, and can be piped nicely with other tools such as cut, grep, sed, sort, awk, etc.
