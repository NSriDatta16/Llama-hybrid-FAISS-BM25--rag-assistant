Optimal cut-off point with minimum sensitivity

I have a logistic regression model. I'm looking for a non-graphical way to find the optimal cut-off where sensitivity is above a threshold(say 0.95) and maximizes sensitivity+specificity. I don't have a fitted model. Only two vectors of observations and predicted probabilities.
