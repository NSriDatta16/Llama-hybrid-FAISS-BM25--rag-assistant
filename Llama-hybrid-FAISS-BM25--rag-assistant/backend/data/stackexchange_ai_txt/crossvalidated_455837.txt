For me the biggest advantage of Gaussian Processes is the inherent ability to model the uncertainty of the model. This is incredibly useful because, given the expected value of a function and the corresponding variance I can define a metric (i.e. an Aquisition function ) that can tell me e.g. what's the point $x$ that, I should evaluate my underlying function $f$ at, that will result in the highest (in expectation) value of $f(x)$ . This forms the basis of Bayesian Optimization . You probably know the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off . We want to find a $max$ of some function $f$ (which is often expensive to evaluate) and so we need to be frugal about which $x$ we select to evaluate $f$ . We will probably want to look at places near the points where we know that the function has a high value (exploitation) or at the points where we have no idea about the function's value (exploration). Gaussian Processes give us the necessary information to make a decision concerning the next evaluation: mean value $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ (uncertainty), allowing for e.g. optimizing expensive black-box functions.
