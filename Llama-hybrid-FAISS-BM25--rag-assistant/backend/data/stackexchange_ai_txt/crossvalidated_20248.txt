Sampling machine learning output to calculate confidence intervals

I need to classify large numbers of short answer, free response data from a study with a between-group design. In order to reduce the amount of manual labor costs, I was thinking of manually coding a small sample set, running the rest of the responses through an SVM classifier, and then coding a random sample of the SVM classifier to obtain a classical statistical measures of the automatically coded data-set. The original, and overly verbose, title to this question was, "Is applying random sampling to output from a machine learning classifier a statistically valid way to calculate confidence intervals?" I have already done a conceptual sanity check with a friend of mine who worked with machine-learning algorithms and atmospheric modeling, but I wanted to run it past some real statisticians before I start basing my workflow around this. Thanks!
