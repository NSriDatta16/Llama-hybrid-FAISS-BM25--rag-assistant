Quantile generalized additive models (QGAMS) are essentially a blend of two common regression models: Generalized additive models (GAMs), which estimate nonlinear regressions using splines. Quantile regressions (QR), which estimate conditional quantiles of a response variable rather than the conditional mean. As such, QGAMs allow users to estimate nonlinear relationships that go beyond average effects models, and can sometimes more accurately explain relationships between predictors and outcomes if one is interested in more extreme values (such as the 90th percentile), or those in established ranges (such as the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles). For more information about QGAMs, more information about the theory and estimation of them can be found at this article.
