I tested three methods of loading the same 9,000,000 point dataset into Firefox 3.64. 1: Stephen's GetJSON Method 2) My function based push method 3) My pre-processed array appending method: I ran my tests two ways: The first iteration of testing I imported 100 files containing 10,000 rows of data, each row containing 9 data elements [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] The second interation I tried combining files, so that I was importing 1 file with 9 million data points. This was a lot larger than the dataset I'll be using, but it helps demonstrate the speed of the various import methods. Separate files: Combined file: JSON: 34 seconds 34 FUNC-BASED: 17.5 24 ARRAY-BASED: 23 46 Interesting results, to say the least. I closed out the browser after loading each webpage, and ran the tests 4 times each to minimize the effect of network traffic/variation. (ran across a network, using a file server). The number you see is the average, although the individual runs differed by only a second or two at most.
