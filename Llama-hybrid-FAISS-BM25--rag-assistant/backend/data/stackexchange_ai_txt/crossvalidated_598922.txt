A number of confidence intervals are in use for the probability of success, which vary in the complexity of their computation and in their coverage probability $P_{cov}$ (which depends on the unknown true probability $p$ ). The interval with $P_{cov}$ guaranteed to be greater than the nominal level $1-\alpha$ for all possible values of the true probability $p$ is known as the "Clopper-Pearson interval" or the "exact interval". In many cases, its coverage probability is considerably greater then $1-\alpha$ , though. Therefore other intervals are in use that have $P_{cov} for some values of $p$ , but deviate not too much. Brown et al. (2001) found the "Wilson interval" to be a good compromise, which has the nice property of being computable through a closed formula. In my own experiments (second reference given below), I found the "Bayesian Highest Posterior Density interval" to have better coverage probability than the Wilson interval for true values $p$ close to one or zero (typical for estimating error/recognition rates), and this despite its smaller width. Its downside is that it is much more difficult to compute (no closed formula, but a computer algorithm). The R package binom implements many confidence intervals (albeit not the Bayesian HPD interval) in the function binom.confint : > library(binom) > k n binom.confint(k,n, conf.level=0.95, methods=c("wilson","exact")) method x n mean lower upper 1 exact 1 10 0.1 0.002528579 0.4450161 2 wilson 1 10 0.1 0.017876213 0.4041500 The HPD interval can be computed with the R package HDInterval as follows: > library(HDInterval) > k n hdi(qbeta, 0.95, shape1=(k+1), shape2=(n-k+1)) lower upper 0.006301509 0.367513183 Brown, Cai, DasGupta: "Interval estimation for a binomial proportion."
