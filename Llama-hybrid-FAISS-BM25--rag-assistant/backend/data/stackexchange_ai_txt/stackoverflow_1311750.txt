Well, this is a vague question and a half, but I'll do my best to answer: MySQL is a solid database, and so is PostgreSQL . Both are free and open sourced. MySQL is more widely supported and a little easier to use, but Postgres has some very cool features and functionality that's worth taking a gander at. WikiVS has a good comparison of the two. Smartphones are having better and better browsers. Use PHP or ASP.NET (whatever you're comfortable with), and then build out a mobile site which looks better on the smaller resolutions. There are a lot. First and foremost, how good is your recommendation algorithm? Secondly, storing audio files can eat up storage space quickly. What's your plan for scaling? Thirdly, how well do you know database design? Can you design a large, hefty database and index it properly? If not, you need to start reading everything you can on indices and database design. Fourthly, it's a software project, and those always have pitfalls. The best you can do is post here when problems arise and we can always see what the fine people of StackOverflow can do to help.
