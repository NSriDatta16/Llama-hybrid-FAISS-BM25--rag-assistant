The problem you describe is often called geographic query parsing or more generally geographic information retrieval. There was a recent task on doing this at CLEF 2007 ( http://www.uni-hildesheim.de/geoclef/2007/Query-Parsing.htm ). The winning team used a rule based grammar, which is similar to what you probably don't want. Another paper at www2009 talks about GeoParser: http://www2009.eprints.org/239/ . There are also some papers on Geographic Information Retrieval at CIKM 2007: http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~rsp/gir07/accepted.html I don't know of any open source software that does this, but it may be bundled into a search engine like Lemur.
