It's not correct to randomly sample both lists a large number of times and average the p-values; the result would understate the evidence against the null hypothesis if it's false, as you then expect the p-value to get smaller as the sample size gets larger, but with this procedure it would stay the same on average. Instead I'd suggest using Fisher's combined probability test to combine the p-values. This assumes the p-values come from independent tests, so you want to sample without replacement so that each list value only occurs in one sample. Equivalently, randomly order both lists then divide them up into suitable-sized chunks to feed into your black box.
