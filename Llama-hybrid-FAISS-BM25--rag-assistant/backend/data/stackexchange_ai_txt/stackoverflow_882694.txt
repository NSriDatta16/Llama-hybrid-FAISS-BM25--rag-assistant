Try normal assignment. Like this: void main() { vec4 myOutputColor = gl_Color; gl_FragColor = myOutputColor; } Edit: The second answer is just as correct really, but there isn't any need to use the vec4() constructor, since both are of the same type. If you had lets say a (r,g,b,w) tuple you could write: vec4 myOutputColor = vec4(r, g, b, w); or // assuming myRgbColor is a vec3 vec4 myOutputColor = vec4(myRgbColor, w); etc
