Correct, you wouldn't find much on models with multiple dependent variables based on "count data." However, let's slice and dice what you are doing to break it down to a simpler idea, and then see if your goal can be accomplished. I commonly only use the term count data when I have categorical data, such as what is used in a chi-squared test. For an IQ example, this would be like a 2-by-2 table with 2 columns (low IQ, high IQ), and 2 rows (treated, control) with the counts representing the number of subjects (mice, patients) with the given characteristics in the four categories. This type of analysis would be done if you said, "there is only count data for the 4 categories, and there are no averages and standard deviations of anything." While you do have count data, couldn't you still consider more counts as a better (worse) outcome, and treat it like a Poisson or normally-distributed outcome? What do the histograms of each of the dependent variables look like for all records combined (independent of each experimental unit -- patient, mouse)? Also, you are not saying you have 12 and 14 levels (groups) for your categories? If so, you won't have a lot of data ($n=26$), since some counts will be sparse -- leading to an "ill-conditioned," or "over-parametrized" problem. This is also called the "curse of dimensionality," i.e., to many dimensions or degrees of freedom for your model. Let's keep forging ahead however. A trick we sometimes use is to assign ranks to measurement values when they are highly skewed, that is, we sometimes (rarely) replace values with the rank of the observation across the research subjects (within a variable). Then, we input those ranks into a lot of different methods that usually require continuously-scaled data, like ANOVA and regression. We have done this on smaller sample size mouse data, and when submitting to journals the stat reviewers know we ran into trouble with skewness and outliers in the original data, and transformed to ranks -- so no problem. We describe that it's not perfect, since ranks are rectangularly-distributed, but there's no problem and the papers get published. Now if you look at your counts, don't they look a little like ranks? If that's true, then probably run a panel-data (longitudinal) model such as GEE (generalized estimating equations) in Stata using a Poisson link for the count data, while clustering on subject ID. Setting up panel-data regression models requires specification of the ID variable for each subject (mouse, patient, student), so the model can see the repeated measures for each object. All the large packages (SAS, SPSS, Stata) have panel-data regression models for repeated measurements that allow specification of a link function, and they allow time to be used as a predictor as well. For Stata, there's not a categorical (count) link function but there is one for SAS. You could use the Poisson link in Stata however. In R, I am sure panel-data regression models with link functions are available. If a categorical link is not used, then maybe the Poisson link would be appropriate. Every package has a Binomial link, but that's used if your outcomes were binomial (y/n, 0/1) during each repeated measurement. But Poisson can take on count values of $0,1,2,3,4,5,\ldots,\infty$
