What tool/library can help me to generate and test model of neural network that would work with X*Y int arrays as input and N*4 int arrays as output?

I want to make simple neural network that from given gray-scale 2d arrays like [[1 1 1] [0 0 0] [1 1 1]] would give me line coordinates [[1 2] [3 2]] I have a C++ program that has a real algorithm in it to compute lines from gray-scale images and a large set of images. I need some NN tool wit scripting language so that I could generate a program to teach and generate NN. so I could create some programm with structure like: generateNN(NN); NN.provideData(WxHGSImageArray); NN.provideDesiredResult(2PointsLineArray); So... Is there any such C++/C lib for generation of NNs or any programmable tool with scripting language? Main problem here is - what tool/lib supports creation of systems that can take X*Y arrays and output N*4 arrays (N - number of lines found on image)? (btw X and Y are different for different images)
