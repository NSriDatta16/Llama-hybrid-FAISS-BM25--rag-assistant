Feature importance: t-value vs coefficients

I am estimating a logistic regression and I would like to know the feature importance of each variable. As far as I know, there are two possible ways to get it: Estimate a logistic regression with normalized variables and compare the coefficients of each one, especially in terms of relative weight: beta_1 / sum(beta_1, ..., beta_n). Get the t-value of each variable and, as in step above, calculate the relative weight of each t-value. Obviously, the results are not the same comparing both methodologies, and I wonder why it is. In a conceptual sense, I guess the coefficients indicate how would the output change given a variation on a specific variable. But, how should I interpret the result gotten by calculating the relative weight of each t-value? And, beyond that, if I want to know how each variable contribute to the final score (like SHAP values), what methodology should I use?
