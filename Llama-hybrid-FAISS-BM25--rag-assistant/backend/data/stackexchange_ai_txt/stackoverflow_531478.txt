Transformers are function objects (also referred abusively as "software" functors , even though functor are a mathematical notion from the Category Theory). They represent a function encapsulated in an object. In most cases, the functionâ€™s parameters can be set and the result retrieved using the common accessors pattern, such as setParameter1(Object value) or getResult() . The fact that these functions are encapsulated by real objects is also the reason for its greatest benefit: the use of many design patterns including structural ones such as the Decorator pattern and behavioral ones such as the Visitor pattern. So you use Transformers to apply a pattern on Collections, but also on other objects . Here is an example of a creational pattern used through a Transformer .
