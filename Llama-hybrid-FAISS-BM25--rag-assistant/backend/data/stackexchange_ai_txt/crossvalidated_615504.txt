Why would odds ratio be more useful than difference of probabilities?

I'm curious on why the odds ratio would be useful? For example, suppose I designed an experiment and fit a logistic regression model for success rate data. $p(success|treatment) = sigmoid(treatment*B_1 + B_0)$ where treatment is binary. So if I want to know the lift attributable to treatment, I can query it as $sigmoid(B_1 + B_0) - sigmoid(B_0)$ . However, I've read that the odds ratio, $exp(B_1)$ , is actually more useful. Could someone explain why this might be the case?
