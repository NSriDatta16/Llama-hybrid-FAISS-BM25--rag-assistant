Question about SVM Scikit

I'm writing a paper about document level text classification. I have a question about the SVC classifier: Unigrams Bigrams MultinomialNB 70.50% 60.50% BernoulliNB 68.00% 67.33% SVC 68.33% 68.33% NuSVC 69.83% 68.33% This is the vector space: (110, 107619) so I have 110 documents with 107619 features. The table has the accuracy based on the unigram and bigram features. I tried everything: preprocessing: stemming lemmatization removing punctuation normalization different feature weighting schemes: binary count TF TFIDF different featurization: unigrams bigrams trigrams combinations of these and the SVC accuracy doesn't change - it is always 68.33%. All the other algorithms witness some kind of change. I'm wondering why is this happening? Does it have to do with the fact that my vector space is too big and sparse?
