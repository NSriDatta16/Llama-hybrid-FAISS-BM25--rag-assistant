I've found the problem: because this is a native query, java classes for this 2 tables must have some special attributes: in Bookmarks.java class @OneToMany(mappedBy = "bookmarkId") private Collection votesCollection; and in Votes.java class @JoinColumn(name = "bookmark_id", referencedColumnName = "bookmark_id") @ManyToOne [private Bookmarks bookmarkId; and i have also changed the query to work tring queryString = "SELECT b, sum(v.votedPoints) " + "FROM Bookmarks b " + "LEFT OUTER JOIN b.votesCollection v " + "WHERE b.userId = 101 " + "GROUP BY b.organizationId " + "ORDER BY sum(v.votedPoints) asc "; thanks for the help
