You’re probably doing something wrong. Let’s say you want to pass this HTML to a JavaScript function call inside an HTML attribute: Then doing this is enough: $html = ' '; echo ' Click for full description '; The var_export function converts the value into an (PHP) equivalent expression and the htmlspecialchars function finally converts the HTML meta characters into character references. This might not be the most elegant way, but it works.
