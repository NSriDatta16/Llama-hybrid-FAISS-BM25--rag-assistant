While I do like the elegance of the Linq solutions, I think my recommendation would be to extract the inner loop into a method; Your code would end up looking something like: foreach(dataObject in listOfObjects) DoSomethingCleverWithProperties(dataObject, listOfProperties); That just feels more maintainable to me.
