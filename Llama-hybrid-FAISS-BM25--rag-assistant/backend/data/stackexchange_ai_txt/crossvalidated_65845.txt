Why there is little improvement after including the predictors in logistic regression?

I'm working on a project on prediction of at-risk students using logistic regression. I'm new to this analysis, so I need some help to clarify some issues: Should I code "return" student as 1 or "drop-out" student as 1 in the analysis (My purpose is to spot at-risk student)? After I ran the analysis, I found almost no improvement concerning percentage of correct rate in the classification table between baseline model and model with predictors. (There is a significant difference, though.) Does this mean the predictors did not contribute much to discriminate the two groups? If my purpose is to find a parsimonious model, what standard(s) should I take?
