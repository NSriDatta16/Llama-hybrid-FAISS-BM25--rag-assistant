Deep data structure 101: Use Storable 's dclone to make a deep copy of a structure, and freeze and thaw to serialize/deserialize them for storage (say in a database, or an http cookie (but you should encrypt anything you send to the user to make it harder to tamper with). Use Data::Compare (or Test::Deep or Test::Differences inside a unit test) to compare two deep data structures. Use Data::Dumper or Data::Dump in debugging to see what your objects look like. But don't use that as a licence to tamper with another object's internals; use the API. :)
