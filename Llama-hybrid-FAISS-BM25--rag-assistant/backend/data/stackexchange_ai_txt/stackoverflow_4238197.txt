I'm not familiar with Nintex Workflow however if your active directory information is up to date, in terms of the organisation structure and user details & groups, the organisation structure is probably supported out of the box by SharePoint. Thus all that might remain is the workflow component which again could probably be created using standard SharePoint functionality, with minor customization with SharePoint Designer. Having said that, configuring and installing SharePoint is not simple, and needs some thought.
