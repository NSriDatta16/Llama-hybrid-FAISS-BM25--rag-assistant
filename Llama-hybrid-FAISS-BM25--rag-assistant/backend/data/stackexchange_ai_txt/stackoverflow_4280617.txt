Getting the form to show immediately, should be fairly simple and you don't need a background thread to do it. My guess is that you are retrieving all that data prior to loading the form or you are retrieving the data on the same thread that loads the form. You should be able to call the form with the data it needs to retrieve the rest of the data (such as ID's). Then you just need to find a way for the data processing to happen on a thread other than the thread that creates the form. This may not be the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done. It uses a System.Windows.Forms.Timer private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { timer1.Start(); } private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { timer1.Stop(); //fill controls with data } If you have several sets of data that you are retrieving, you may want to consider setting up a queue of tasks to retrieve each set. Any way that you do it. Make sure to disable any buttons(or other ui) that could cause errors if the data is not loaded. Edit: It should be noted that winform controls don't always play nice with threads. The nice thing about the System.Windows.Forms.Timer (as opposed to System.Timers.Timer )is that it designed to play nice with controls.
