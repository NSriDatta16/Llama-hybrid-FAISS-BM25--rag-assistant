maximum size of attributes on AWS SimpleDB

I am in the process of building an mobile application (iPhone/Android) and want to store the application data onto Amazon's SimpleDB, because we do not want to host our own server to provide these services. I've been going through all of the documentation and the maximum storage size of element values is 1024 bytes. In my case we need to store 1024 up to 10K of text data. I was hoping to find out how other projects are using SimpleDB when they have larger storage needs like our project. I read that one could store pointers to files that are then stored in S3 (file system). Not sure if that is a good solution. In my mind I am not sure if SimpleDB is the correct solution. Could anyone comment on what that have done or provide a different way to think about this problem?
