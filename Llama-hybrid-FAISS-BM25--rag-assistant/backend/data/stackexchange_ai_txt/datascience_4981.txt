If I understand your question correctly. Yes, SVM can take multiple inputs. My suggestion for handling a vector as a feature would be to expand it out. For example, x0 = (1,2) x0 = 1 x1 = .4 -----> x1 = 2 x2 = 0 x2 = .4 x3 = 0 If this does not capture all of the characteristics of the vector that are important, then you may want to add other features (like magnitude of the vector) as well.
