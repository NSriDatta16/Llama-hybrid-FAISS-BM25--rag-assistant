Machine Learning is useful for problems which can't be solved (or not efficiently) with a deterministic method. The problem you propose is extremely simple since it doesn't even require any calculation, so there is no point using ML for it. Could you please give a toy example. We just have y and don't have x and z Suppose $y=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\ 3 & 4\\ 5 & 6\\ 7 & 8\\ \end{bmatrix}$ An easy solution is to define $x$ and $z$ as follows: $x=y=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\ 3 & 4\\ 5 & 6\\ 7 & 8\\ \end{bmatrix}$ and $z=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \end{bmatrix}$
