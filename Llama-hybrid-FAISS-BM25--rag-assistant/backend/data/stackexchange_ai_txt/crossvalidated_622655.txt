How to choose the output vector size for metric learning?

In metric learning of e.g., MNIST images, a CNN projects a 28 x 28 image into a $d$ -dimensional vector which gets passed to a metric learning loss function: minimize the Euclidean or cosine distance between these vectors if they're from the same digit, and maximize the distance if they're from different digits. Now I'm doing machine learning (metric learning) and I'm faced with the problem: How best to choose the size of the output vector, $d$ ? Because, if i chose big size: i have to have more epoch of learning before enough result And i think: if I choose a small size, then there is a chance that I will not be able to create a final vector for a clear separation of objects from different groups. What should i do? How do I understand that the output vector size is not enough? Such characteristics (dimensions) can only be selected, or maybe there is some kind of estimation formula or at least an upper bound on the number of parameters depending on the size of the image?
