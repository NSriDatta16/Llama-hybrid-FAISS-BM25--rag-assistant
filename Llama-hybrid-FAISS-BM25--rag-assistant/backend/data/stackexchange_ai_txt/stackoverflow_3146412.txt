C# yield (no extra storage needed) Using C# yield allows you to return your array and more without ever allocating extra storage. After yielding each element of the original array you can slip in any extra elements easily like so: IEnumerable GetEverything() { // first return the entire original array foreach(int num in arrNumbers) yield return num; // then slip in extra element at the end yield return 5; // yield even more elements if you want... } and then you can use it like so: foreach (int n in GetEverything()) Console.WriteLine(n); There's no real need to pull out LINQ in this situation because the yield statement is simple and EXACTLY suited to your need.
