First a to the point answer. Consider that $p_0$ is the (single test) $p$ value associated with value $z_0$ of the test statistic. The Benjamini-Hochberg FDR is computed in two steps ($N_0$ = # pvalues $\le$ $p_0$, $N$ = # pvalues): $\text{FDR }(p_0) = \frac{\quad p_0 \quad }{\frac{N_0}{N}}$ $\text{FDR }(p_i) = \min (\text{FDR}(p_i), \text{FDR}(p_{i+1}))$ Now let's understand this. The (Bayesian) underlying idea is that observations come from a mixture of two distributions: $\pi_0 \: N$ observations from the null density $f_0(z)$ $(1-\pi_0) \: N$ observations from alternative density $f_1(z)$. What is observed is the mixture of those two: $f(z) = \pi_0 \cdot f_0(z) + (1-\pi_0) \cdot f_1(z)$ The (Bayesian) definitions are: $\text{Fdr} = \frac{\pi_0 \: (1-F_0(z_0))}{(1-F(z))}$ (a fraction of the tail areas) $\text{fdr} = \frac{\pi_0 \: f_0(z_0)}{f(z)}$ (a fraction of the tail densities) As shown below, Fdr is equivalent to the Benjamini hocherg FDR when $\pi_0 \approx 1$ (which is the case in most bioinformatics studies) (Based on Efron & Tibshirani's Computer Age Statistical Inference )
