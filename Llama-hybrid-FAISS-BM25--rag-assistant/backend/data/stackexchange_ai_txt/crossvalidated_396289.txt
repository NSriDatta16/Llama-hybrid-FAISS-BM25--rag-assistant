The interpretation is not as easy as with the log-linear semi-elasticity case, but there is a nice working paper by Marc Bellemare and Casey Wichman on Elasticities and the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Transformation that covers some of this in Section 2.2. In a model like $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\asinh}{asinh} \asinh ( y)= \alpha + \beta \cdot x+ \varepsilon,$$ you can recover $y$ as $$\DeclareMathOperator{\sinh}{sinh} y= \sinh ( \alpha +\beta \cdot x+ \varepsilon).$$ Then taking the derivative with respect to $x$ , $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \beta\cdot \cosh(\alpha +\beta \cdot x+ \varepsilon) = \beta\cdot \cosh(\asinh(y))= \beta \cdot \sqrt{y^2+1}.$$ Multiplying that by $\frac{x}{y}$ , we get the standard elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ $$\epsilon=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\cdot\frac{x}{y}=\beta \cdot x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{y^2+1}}{y}=\beta \cdot x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{{y^2+1}}{y^2}}=\beta \cdot x \cdot \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{y^2}}.$$ This looks messy, but when $y$ gets large in absolute value, $\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{y^2}} \rightarrow 1,$ so you can ignore the last term and just focus on $$\epsilon \approx \beta \cdot x.$$ You can plug the average $x$ into that or evaluate it as function of $x$ for some interesting values of $x$ . Since this is just a linear transformation of $\beta$ , calculating the SEs is pretty easy. You can also calculate the average elasticity: $$\epsilon=\sum_i^N \hat \beta \cdot x_i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\hat y_i^2+1}}{\hat y_i},$$ or evaluate it at interesting values of $x$ and other covariates. This has the interpretation of a percent change in expected $y$ for a 1% change in $x$ . Since this is a non-linear function, SEs are more challenging. If you want to retain the semi-elasticity interpretation, the $$\epsilon^*=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\cdot\frac{1}{y}=\beta \cdot \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{y^2}}.$$ You may want to multiply that by 100 to get the expected % change in $y$ for a 1 unit increase in $x$ .
