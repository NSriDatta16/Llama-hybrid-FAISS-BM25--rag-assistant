How to make custom callback in keras to generate sample image in VAE training?

I'm training a simple VAE model on 64*64 images and I would like to see the images generated after every epoch or every couple batches to see the progress. when I train the model I wait until the training is done and then I look at the results. I tried to make a custom callback function in Keras that generates an image and saves it but couldn't do it. is it even possible? I couldn't find anything like it. it would be awesome if you refer me to a source that explains how to do so or show me an example
