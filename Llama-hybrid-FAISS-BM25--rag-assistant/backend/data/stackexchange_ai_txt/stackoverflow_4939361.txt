I know I am a little late to this post, but you can try and leverage a cookie to get this done: if (document.cookie.indexOf('xref=true', 0) I tested this on the Thick and Thin clients in 10.0 and it worked fine. The postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent my company's positions, strategies or opinions.
