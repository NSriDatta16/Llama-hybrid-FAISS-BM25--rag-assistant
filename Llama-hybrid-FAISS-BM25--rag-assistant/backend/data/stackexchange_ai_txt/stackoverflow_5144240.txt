As far as I know, Safari does not allow us to create a "popup" the way Chrome does. For my Safari extension I am using jQueryUI to create my popup. You can also use YUI or Mootools. In taking apart the eBay and Twitter extensions I see they're using an iframe. Just how they're implementing it I don't know since jquery doesn't allow you to modify the contents of an iframe (correct me if I'm wrong here). But to answer your question, your button will send an event to an injected script. That script can have code similar to this: $('body').append(' '); var myPopup = $('#mypopup').dialog({ 'autoOpen' : false , 'draggable' : false, 'modal' : false, 'resizable' : false, 'title' : 'My Popup' }); function messageHandler(msgEvent) { var messageName = msgEvent.name; var messageData = msgEvent.message; if (messageName === 'buttonPushed') { if (myPopup.dialog('isOpen')) { myPopup.dialog('close'); return; } $('#mypopup').children().empty(); // Clear out any crap should it exist $('#mypopup').append(someHTML); myPopup.dialog('open'); return; } } } This is a very basic example. In mine there is a toolbar, and a host of other things. Plus you have to have REALLY specific CSS rules to protect your popup's CSS from being clobbered by every site in the world. I have also thought about using global.html to open the "popup" window but as far as I can tell, all it can do is open a window. I don't see any facilities for setting attributes like size, etc. If there are, I'd go that route since your popup would then be protected from CSS as it's in its own window.
