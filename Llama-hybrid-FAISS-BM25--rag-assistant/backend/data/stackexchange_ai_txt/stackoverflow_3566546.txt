Python Pythonpath Modules install

I am kind of annoyed by the installation of modules in python and had a lot of trouble with it, so it would be fantastic to find a good solution for it. Here are my issues: PYTHONPATH: How can I tell easy_install/Python where to install my packages? Even though I put: /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages in my .bash_profile With: PYTHONPATH="/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages" export PYTHONPATH It wont import packages I have there. On the other site everything I put into: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages Works. I dont know why and would love to know. I just install "south" with the command easy_install south and it installed it, guess, right into: /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages Now copied "south" Which was installed there (it was in a Folder called: South-0.7.2-py2.6.egg , i just copied south) and pasted it to /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages And now I can import it when going to directory of my django project (in which settings.py-Installed Apps I have 'south') and python manage.py shell Which according to south is a good indicator that it works. Can/Do I have to do that for every module? Is there a better elegant way to solve this. Please say there is. Thanks
