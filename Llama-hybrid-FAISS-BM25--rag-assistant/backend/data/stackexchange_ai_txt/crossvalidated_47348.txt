Logistic Regression with holdout sample

I am trying to run a logistic regression in R on my data where my independent variables are 13 continuous variables and my dependent variable is binary. I want to segment my data so that I train on the first 80% and test on the last 20%. I have a total of 3750 rows of data so I utilize the first 3000 for training. I have written the following: mydata However I get the following warning message: Warning message: 'newdata' had 751 rows but variable(s) found have 3000 rows Then when I look at predictions there are 3000 predictions not the 751 that I wanted. What can I do to fix this?
