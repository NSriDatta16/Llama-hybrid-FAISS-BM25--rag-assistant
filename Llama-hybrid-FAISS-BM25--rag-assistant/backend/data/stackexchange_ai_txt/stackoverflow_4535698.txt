Getting the identifier name of an instance in python

I haven't found anything. I want to do this without passing the name inside the constructor. class foo: pass something = foo() I want each instance of foo to be aware of its initial identifier name. In this case the instance of foo() I created should be aware that its identifier is the string "something" I am working on a small api and this would be a very elegant approach, unfortunately I haven't seen anything like this done. Thanks,
