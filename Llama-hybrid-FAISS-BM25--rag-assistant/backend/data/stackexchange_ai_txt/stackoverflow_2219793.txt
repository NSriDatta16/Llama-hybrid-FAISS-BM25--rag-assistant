Maybe if you can tell the original problem that leads you into this dead end someone can give a twist on the situation. I've made myself a routing algoritm and I just use and explode on '/' and it works very nicely, something like Magento or Zend Framework does it, registering path controllers or routers and linking them. Maybe your original problem can be solved without need to write a regular expression engine with PHP.
