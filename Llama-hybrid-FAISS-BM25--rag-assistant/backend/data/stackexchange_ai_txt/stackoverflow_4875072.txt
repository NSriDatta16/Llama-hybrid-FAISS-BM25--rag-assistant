Tried Hans' suggestion of looking what was different about a header file with a missing class, and noticed the following myheader.h #ifndef MYHEADER_INCLUDED #define MYHEADER_INCLUDED class MyClass { ' ' }; #endif Now everything after the #ifdef was greyed out in the editor, which suggested the IDE throught the macro was already defined. The source also contains a fair amount of conditional inclusion in the header files, e.g. #ifndef MYHEADER_INCLUDED #include "myheader.h" #endif Changing the header to myheader.h #pragma once class MyClass { ' ' }; seems to resolve the class view problem, though I don't know how it will effect compilation times. Edit Just finished and did a rebuild, no significant change to compilation time.
