If I understood you correctly you want something similar to innerHTML in JavaScript. There is a solution to that: $xmlString = 'some mixed content'; $dom = new DOMDocument; $fragment = $dom->createDocumentFragment(); $fragment->appendXML($xmlString); $dom->appendChild($fragment); // done To sumarize. What you need is: DOMDocument::createDocumentFragment() DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML() Although you didn't asked about it I'll tell you how to get the string representation of a DOM node as opposed to the whole DOM document: // for a DOMDocument you have $dom->save($file); $string = $dom->saveXML(); $dom->saveHTML(); $string = $dom->saveHTMLFile($file); // For a DOMElement you have $node = $dom->getElementById('some-id'); $string = $node->C14N(); $node->C14NFile($file); Those two methods are currently not documented.
