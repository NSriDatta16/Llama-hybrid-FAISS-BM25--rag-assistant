This error means that you are attempting to loop over a None object. This is like trying to loop over a Null array in C/C++. As Abgan, orsogufo, Dan mentioned, this is probably because the query did not return anything. I suggest that you check your query/databse connection. A simple code fragment to reproduce this error is: x = None for each i in x: #Do Something pass
