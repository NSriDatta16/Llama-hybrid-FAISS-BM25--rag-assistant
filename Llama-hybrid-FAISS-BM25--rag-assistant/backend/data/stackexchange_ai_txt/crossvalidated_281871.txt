How to apply Laplacian Eigenmap on high-dimensional time series?

Suppose I have a time series of T observations for M features My question in application of Laplacian Eigenmap is when forming an adjacency matrix $A_{i,j}$, should I create an T by T matrix for $A_{i,j}$ = exp(-||(observation at t = i) - (observation at t = j)||$^2$/$w$) for some value of w if i'th observation is within k nearest neighbor of j'th observation? Or should the adjacency matrix be M by M and instead replace (observation at t = i) with (i'th feature) ?
