Ad 1. No, R generates the dummy coding as part of the GLM-call (through a call to model.matrix). Ad 2. Yes/no. So you can hand over the data to GLM with values missing, but when you fit the full model, they will simply be dropped. So I would impute missing values (e.g. using mice). You currently lose 1/3 of your data points (i.e. a lot). Ad 3. The warning comes up to indicate that with your model, you yield perfect separation for some of the data points ( How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? ). It is a case where the model may be fine, or not. One diagnostic is to check whether the estimates (and their standard errors) look plausible (i.e. -0.3 and 0.02, say): if so I would not worry (vulgo: I ignore the warning). If estimates and errors are sky-high (5000 and 250000, say), your model has attempted to construct a vertical line for separating 0s and 1s. In this case the above link towards regularisation can offer a solution. Before going down that route, I would check for correlation between your categorical predictors ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychoric_correlation ): maybe you can remove a few of them, reducing the dimensionality of the predictor space, and reducing the chance of perfect separation.
