Is there a preferred method of database management/object persistence on the iPhone?

I've seen several approaches, and each seem to have significant plusses and minuses. I'm learning iPhone development, I'm building a relatively simple app, which, at it's core, is really not much more than CRUD operations on 3 or four related entities. I'm used to ActiveRecord-type object persistence. The implementations for Cocoa Touch that I read about online are commonly referred to as extremely slow. Most of the examples I see online (specifically the Pragmatic Programmers screencasts) have SQL hardcoded into the controller class, which doesn't seem... right to me. Seems very old school (but maybe old school is best in this case). I know we can't discuss SDK 3.0 here, but it's common knowledge that CoreData is coming for the iPhone, that would of course limit my audience (I'm not sure I really care about that this much. It will be an app for sale, but I'm not planning on it replacing my career) I have not tried Gus Mueller's FMDB yet, but I have read good things. What are some of your experiences, what works, and what doesn't. Where would you recommend that a (still pretty novice) iPhone programmer invest their time?
