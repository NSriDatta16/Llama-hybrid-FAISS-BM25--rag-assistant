iPhone SDK - UIWebView embedding a YouTube Video

I am using this to prevent the app from opening the youtube app and instead plays the video whilst staying inside my app. It works fine and all but it's a bit slow with loading it's date (they're inside a tableview, each cell for about 15 atm~). The moment when it suddenly loads everything correctly is when this error has been passed into the debugging console: warning: Unable to read symbols for "/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/3.1.2 (7D11) /Symbols/System/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/YouTubePlugin.webplugin/YouTubePlugin" (file not found). Is it possible that this slows down the loading of the uiwebview? (as soon as this error's been passed it suddenly quickly loads all the content). If it doesn't slow anything down is it something my app could get rejected on? Thanks in advance
