OpenCV2.2 cvCaptureFromCAM problems...only returning a green screen. (Logitech C260 camera)

I'm writing a program that needs to capture from a webcam using opencv. I am using a Logitech C260 Camera and OpenCV2.2, Windows XP, QT Creator. Here is an example piece of my code: int i = 0; int arg = 0; CvCapture *pCapturedImage = cvCaptureFromCAM(arg); cvNamedWindow( "Example1", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ); IplImage* img1= cvQueryFrame(pCapturedImage); IplImage* img2; IplImage* merged; int MAX_FRAMES = 10; for (int i = 0; i } It's not working though. I'm getting only a for around the first 10 captures, then after that, the capture becomes null (I'd post a picture but I'm not allowed to). I'm stumped. I've tried cvCaptureFromCAM and cvCreateCameraCapture. I've tried changing the args to that function. I've tried all my USB ports. Does anybody know what the problem might be? I greatly appreciate all help.
