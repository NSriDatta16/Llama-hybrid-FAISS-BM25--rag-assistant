Moments (mean and skewness) of an AR(1) process with Chi2 or Gamma innovation distribution

A bit of context I am looking for a lag-1 autoregressive process with non-Gaussian innovation/residual error, which is capable of producing both skewed and non-skewed marginal distributions. I am aware of non-Gaussian conditional AR(1) processes (references cited in this CV answer , especially Grunwald, Hyndman, & Tedesco, 1995 ). Among them, the GAR(1) model of Gaver and Lewis (1980) and Lawrance (1982) is a great choice as it can produce marginal Gamma distributions. Though, the interpretation of the model is so peculiar for my target readership. So, as an alternative, I am considering simply replacing the Gaussian i.i.d. innovations of a normal AR(1) with $\chi^2$ distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom, or more generally, Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\lambda$ : $$X_t = c + \phi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, \ \ \cases{\mathbb{A}: \epsilon_t \sim \chi^2(k) \\ \mathbb{B}: \epsilon_t \sim \Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)}$$ What I am looking for I am looking for analytical expressions for the (approximate) marginal mean and skewness of an AR(1) process with either of these distributions. (Variance is not super important to me.) (I know the $\chi^2$ distribution is a special case of the Gamma distribution. Though in case the results are hard to attain with Gamma innovations, I can live with results for the $\chi^2$ innovations.) What I already know I know one can write the AR(1) as an infinite-order moving average model, and deriving the marginal distribution via the weighted sum of the innovations: $$X_t = \mu + \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \phi^l \epsilon_{t-l}$$ I know one can derive the moment generating function of weighted sums of Gamma-distributed random variables of different shapes ( $\alpha_i$ ) but the same scale ( $\lambda$ ), which is expressed in Di Salvo (2008) , which is a quite complicated, and I do not know how to simplify it for the case of the infinite sum of exponentially decaying random variables (given the $MA(\infty$ ) formulation above. Mathai (1982, pp. 591-592) has mentioned that a similar summation has been studied by others and only cites Prabhu (1965), which I could not find it online: Any ideas on how to derive the mean and skewness of the marginal distribution in either case?
