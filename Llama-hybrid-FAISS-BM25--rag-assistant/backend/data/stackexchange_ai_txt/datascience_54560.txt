Short answer - No Let me put it this way - let's say you have some image dataset. You need to perform any deep learning task on it(classification, object detection, segmentation etc). For this purpose these are the steps you'll be performing in general : Define labels for each input Define how will you extract feature Define how will you use the features and labels to perform supervised learning Define loss function and optimiser Define training and testing pipeline VGG16, ResNet16 etc are architectures. They perform the 2nd step - feature extraction. Faster-RCNN means all of 1-5 steps defined specifically for object detection task.
