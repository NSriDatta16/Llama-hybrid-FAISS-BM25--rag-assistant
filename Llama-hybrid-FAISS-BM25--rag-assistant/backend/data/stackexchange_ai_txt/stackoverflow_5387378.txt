Sqlite field size limits

I am starting out in using the sqlite3. I tried creating a record with field size limits. However those limits are not obeyed and I am able to put in data much above that limit. E.g. CREATE TABLE PERSON ( PERSON_ID NUMBER (4), LAST_NAME VARCHAR2 (40), FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2 (100), SEX NUMBER (2) ); In this case I would like to restrict integer length to just dddd, something like 2006 Also For 'SEX' field I am able to put something like MR which is not integer at all. I am using the Firefox addon to work with the database. Is this kind of limits supported in sqlite3. Do I need to set some PRAGMA or anything. Thanks.
