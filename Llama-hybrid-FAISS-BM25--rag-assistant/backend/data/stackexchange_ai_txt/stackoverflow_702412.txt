Here's a guide on how to do it: http://seb.box.re/2006/7/29/foreign-key-and-rails-migration There is also a plugin for this here: http://github.com/harukizaemon/foreign_key_migrations/tree/master However, Rails does not easily support foreign keys in migrations for a reason. Basically they're not really necessary when using ActiveRecord. Here's a good explanation of why they are not necessary and their usage is discouraged in rails: http://www.motionstandingstill.com/i-dont-use-foreign-key-constraints-with-rails/2008-10-17/ Opinions differ on this subject. There's a good discussion here: http://forum.softiesonrails.com/forums/3/topics/138
