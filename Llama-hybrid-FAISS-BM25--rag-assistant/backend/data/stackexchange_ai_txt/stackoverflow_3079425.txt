JsTree conflicts with jquery.validate

I have a Jstree populating a list of items. When I click a node a partial is loaded with ajax. Everything works fine until I include the jquery.validate script to validate my forms. As soon as I include this file the tree nodes cannot be selected. Also drag and drop capability doesn't work. There are no javascript errors reported in firebug. Anyone know how to resolve such conflicts? Thanks
