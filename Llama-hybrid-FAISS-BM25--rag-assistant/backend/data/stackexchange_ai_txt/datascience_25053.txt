Best practical algorithm for sentence similarity

I have two sentences, S1 and S2, both which have a word count (usually) below 15. What are the most practically useful and successful (machine learning) algorithms, which are possibly easy to implement (neural network is ok, unless the architecture is as complicated as Google Inception etc.). I am looking for an algorithm that will work fine without putting too much time into it. Are there any algorithms you've found successful and easy to use? This can, but does not have to fall into the category of clustering. My background is from machine learning, so any suggestions are welcome :)
