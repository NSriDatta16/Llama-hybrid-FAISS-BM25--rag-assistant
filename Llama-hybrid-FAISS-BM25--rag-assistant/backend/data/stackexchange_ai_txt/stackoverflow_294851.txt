You seem to be inquisitive and interested in learning. That's qualification #1; things change fast in this field, and only the life-long learners survive. Next step would be to scour job boards in your area ( Monster , Craigslist , Joel On Software Jobs Board , etc.) and keep track of the skills you see coming up a lot. That's probably a fairly good representation of what's "hot", at least near you. Then, you can check here on stack overflow by tags (e.g. PHP and javascript ) and see if the kinds of questions that people are asking make basic sense to you (not that you need to know every answer, but if it sounds like Greek, you're probably not ready to get a job in that subject). To more directly answer your question: there are web jobs out there for PHP and javascript, though a heavy dose of CSS and Ajax probably wouldn't hurt if you're going that direction. A design background will help if you want a general "webmaster" type job, but note that those are often NOT programming-oriented jobs, because most stuff you can do on an average website is typically better done with an off the shelf CMS (you don't usually need to reinvent the wheel unless the web site you're doing is highly functional in some way). As other posters have said, C# / .NET is probably good if you want something more corporate. The real question is: what kind of work do you like doing? What makes you happy? Find that and do it well, and you'll get a job. :)
