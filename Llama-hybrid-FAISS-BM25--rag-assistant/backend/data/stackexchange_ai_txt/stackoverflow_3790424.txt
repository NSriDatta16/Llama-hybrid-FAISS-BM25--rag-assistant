Usage of Oracle binding variables with LIKE in C#

As part of an effort to stop using dynamic SQL generation and encourage use of bind variables, I am running into some problems. I am querying an Oracle 9i database from an ASP.NET page using Oracle Data Providers for .NET The query is sql = "SELECT somedata FROM sometable WHERE machine = :machineName "; I define the Oracle Parameter as follows OracleParameter parameter = new OracleParameter(); parameter.ParameterName = "machineName"; parameter.OracleDbType = OracleDbType.Varchar2; parameter.Value = machine; //machine is a variable of type string parameterList.Add(parameter); This works fine for "=" operator. But I just can't seem to get it to work with "LIKE". I don't know how to format the query so that it accepts usage of the "%" wildcard. I have tried: sql = "SELECT somedata FROM sometable WHERE machine LIKE :machineName% "; sql = "SELECT somedata FROM sometable WHERE machine LIKE ':machineName%' "; sql = "SELECT somedata FROM sometable WHERE machine LIKE :machineName||% "; and also: parameter.Value = machine+'%'; but all I get are ORA-00911 (illegal character) and ORA-01036 (illegal name/value) exceptions. What am I doing wrong?
