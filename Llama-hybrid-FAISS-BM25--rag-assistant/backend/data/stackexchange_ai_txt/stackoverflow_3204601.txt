Step by step upgrade of Indy 10 in Delphi 2009

Can someone help in telling the details on how to uninstall Indy 10 and install the latest build? I found it http://indy.fulgan.com/ZIP/IndyTiburon.zip There is a similar question , but not a satisfying answer, just some comments from the user who asked, but that is not a step by step guide. Why there is not a tool for this?
