If I can get Hibernate to put them into some kind of non-entity value object, that'd be great. You can tell Hibernate to return non-managed value objects from a native SQL query by applying a "result transformer" . From the reference documentation: 16.1.5. Returning non-managed entities It is possible to apply a ResultTransformer to native SQL queries, allowing it to return non-managed entities. sess.createSQLQuery("SELECT NAME, BIRTHDATE FROM CATS") .setResultTransformer(Transformers.aliasToBean(CatDTO.class)) This query specified: the SQL query string a result transformer The above query will return a list of CatDTO which has been instantiated and injected the values of NAME and BIRTHNAME into its corresponding properties or fields.
