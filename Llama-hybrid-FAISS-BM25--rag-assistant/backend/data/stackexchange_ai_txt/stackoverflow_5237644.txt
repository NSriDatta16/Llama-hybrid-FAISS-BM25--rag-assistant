Rails ActiveRecord Session

I'm using ActiveRecord Session Store and I have a few questions regarding using this store. I can easily create a model for accessing any session directly (from the console, not as a controller or anything): class Session I can then access and decode the contents of sessions, for example Marshal.load(ActiveSupport::Base64.decode64(Session.first) But I'm curious why I can't seem to find many other people doing this sort of thing? At the very least, I would at least want to have a job to delete expired sessions, so the sessions table doesn't grow and grow. I also store several fields in sessions which are important to the application logic. It is conceivable that I might at some point want to perform some maintenance task with logic based on decoded session data. Is this sort of storage a design taboo? I'm hoping that someone who has more experience managing a production rails application could take a stab at some or these questions, or at least share how they are using sessions. Thanks. edit: I just realized that the session data store is Base64 encoded, and not encrypted in any way.
