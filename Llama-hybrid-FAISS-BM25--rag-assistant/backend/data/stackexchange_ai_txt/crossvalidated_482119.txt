Is there a good summary statistic that indicates that a vector has a high average _and_ a high sum?

Suppose I have a large number of positive vectors of different lengths that are drawn from a heavy tailed distribution. I'd like to summarize them in a way that ranks the ones with a large sum and a large average over ones that have only a large sum or only a large average. For instance, say I have A = [10, .1] B = [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, ..., 0.6] (length 20) C = [.1, .1, .1, ..., .1] (length 1000) If I rank each by their average, I have A > B > C. If I rank each by its sum, I have C > B > A. But really, B is the most interesting to me, because it has the most big numbers. I know that in this example, taking the median would give me what I want, but I don't think that's exactly what I'm looking for in generalâ€”I can easily construct examples where the median wouldn't give me what I want. Is this a standard problem? Are there standard statistics that would help me here?
