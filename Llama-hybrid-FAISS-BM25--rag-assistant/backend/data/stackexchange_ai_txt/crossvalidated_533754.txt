How does minimizing MSE maximize variance?

I was reading about PCA and they had this interesting line that "A line or plane that is the least squares approximation of a set of data points makes the variance of the coordinates on the line or plane as large as possible." Which I think makes sense visually if you looked at a scatter plot in 2D space of points and trying to project a line through them, but I can't think of a proof or more logical explanation for why this would be true.
