You seem to be confusing the population variance $\sigma^2$ with a version of the sample variance $S^2$. Recall that $$ S^2 = {1 \over n-1} \sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2. $$ This is a statistic and thus can completely be calculated from the data. This is not the population variance. For a continuous random variable the population variance is defined as $$ \sigma^2 = E\left[(X - E[X])^2\right] = \int \limits_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mu)^2 f_X(x)dx $$ for $E(X) = \mu$. Note how we integrate over all $X$ in order to get $\sigma^2$ (we "integrate $X$ out"). That's why it is not a function of $X$. Update: No matter what the population looks like we have defined $\sigma^2 = E\left[(X - E[X])^2\right]$. The outermost expectation is over all $X$ so it doesn't matter whether a sum or an integral is used, we are averaging over the entire population and so $\sigma^2$ is not a function of $X$. Suppose we had a population where $X \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $P(X=1) = .5$, $P(X = 2) = .3$, and $P(X = 3) = .2$. Then we'll have that $$ \mu = E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^3 x P(X = x) = 1*.5 + 2*.3 + 3*.2 = 1.7 $$ and therefore $$ \sigma^2 = E\left[(X - E[X])^2\right] = \sum \limits_{x = 1}^3 (x - \mu)^2 P(X = x) $$ $$ = (1 - 1.7)^2 * .5 + (2 - 1.7)^2 * .3 + (3 - 1.7)^2 * .2 = 0.61. $$ So even though we computed $\sigma^2$ using a formula like what you have, it is not defined to be this. That formula is purely a result of taking an expectation of a discrete random variable. We are summing out $X$ just as if we instead integrated it out.
