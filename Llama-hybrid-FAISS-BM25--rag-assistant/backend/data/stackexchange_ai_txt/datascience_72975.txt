WEKA Random Forest and numerical attributes

I am working with Random Forests in Weka. I thought the ID3 algorithm is used to find the best split attribute at each level. But after reading a bit I noticed that ID3 can not handle numerical attributes (one needs for instance C4.5 for that). Random Forests in Weka do have no problems with numerical features as input... How are they handeled? (Small additional question: Is Weka still something you can work with today or do I need to switch the tool for current research? Weka seems a bit "old-fashioned" sometimes...)
