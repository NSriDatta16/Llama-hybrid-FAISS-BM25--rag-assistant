interpreting coefficients with binary dependent and independent variables

Say the logistic regression is where I have $Y_{i}$ as dependent and $D_{i}$ as independent with coefficient beta. Then how do I interpret beta when both my $Y_{i}$ and $D_{i}$ are binary? I say this because usually while interpreting, the authors of papers, multiply beta by 100. So say beta is 0.045 , then is it correct to say that when D goes from 0 to 1 then Y increases by 0.045 units in layman language? What is the rationale for giving it a percent interpretation here? Because Y is going from say 0 to 0.045?
