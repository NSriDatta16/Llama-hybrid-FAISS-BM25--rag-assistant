Take a look at the CCR from the robotics guys at Microsoft. I enables you to do Erlang type programming (message passing, queues, etc), but just using c# and not a totally new functional language. Furthermore it is able to make use of the asynchronous programming model where you don't need dozens of threads in threadpools to do your stuff. It's much faster and gives really elegant code. I'm using it myself for an SMS server which needs to spit out SMS's at ridiculous speeds, and it does so without stressing the CPU at all
