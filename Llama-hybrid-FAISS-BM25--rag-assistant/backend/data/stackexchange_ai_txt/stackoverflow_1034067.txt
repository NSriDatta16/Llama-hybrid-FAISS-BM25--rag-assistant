Actionscript [Error #2036: Load Never Completed] with dynamic generated images

I'm working with an image caching system that generates different images based on a url route. The source images live outside the document root and cached versions are added to /cache in the webroot. Long story short, in Flash, if I point a Loader to the route, I get a "Load Never Completed" error the first time (if the cached image has yet to be generated). Error opening URL 'http://characters.dev/cache/Pledges/16107/48_48c/jen001.jpg' Error #2036: Load Never Completed. URL: http://characters.dev/cache/Pledges/16107/48_48c/jen001.jpg The cached image is still generated and the next time I run the application the actual file loads without error. I've got the proper headers being sent when generating the initial image and writing it, so I'm wondering why flash isn't getting the response (seems to works fine in a browser window). header("Content-type:image/jpeg"); echo $this->getResponse()->setBody(file_get_contents($cachedFile)); Any ideas on how to fix this? The errors seems to "bog down" the flash application. If it helps, here's the response headers: Request to generate image: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 23 Jun 2009 17:52:49 GMT Server: Apache X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=6b746d4ed010c288a824522597698ea2; expires=Fri, 24-Jul-2009 17:52:50 GMT; path=/; domain=.characters.dev Content-Length: 3575 Content-Type: image/jpeg Request when image is cached: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 23 Jun 2009 17:53:27 GMT Server: Apache Last-Modified: Tue, 23 Jun 2009 17:52:50 GMT ETag: "24e6c62-df7-a8bd0080" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 3575 Content-Type: image/jpeg
