I think the concept of "supporting" IE6 is the wrong idea, if we say no to that are we just not going to allow IE6 users access to our site and content? Of course not. So the question really is, how much time do you want to spend making the experience of your site the same for IE6 as other browsers. My own standpoint is that I "support" IE6, in that a user of IE6 will be able to access all a site's content and all it's features, but they might not get the same visual or interaction experience as a Firefox 3 user. So to answer your question, yes we can use CSS 2.1 and 3.0 selectors to achieve certain affects, as long as the content is still there for IE6 and with an acceptable visual appearance. What's acceptable will depend on the project (and likely the client!). Your example was a good showcase of this: p { margin-top: 10px; } h1 + p { margin-top: 5px;} /* the first paragraph after the h1 tag should have a smaller margin Here IE6 will still get the paragraph content, and there will still be all important white-space between them, they just won't get the reduced spacing on the first one. That's a fair compromise IMO for the reduced clutter in your HTML. Another good example would be rounded corners. You can use -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius to get rounded corners in Firefox and Safari, enhancing the visual experience of your site, but IE users still get the content albeit with plain old square corners (and then there are plenty of JavaScript solutions out there to achieve this for people with JavaScript enabled). This would all come under the heading Progressive Enhancement
