My son is having a rough go at this teething thing, hense my being awake. AND, I'm not really sure how I happened upon this random question/answer since I'm so rarely on stackoverflow.... but... You SHOULD NOT have to increase your framerate by 4x because of a textArea! We're talking about system resources, not to mention a very elegant flex framework that you could instead leverage: Here's a very quick, and flex-sdk compliant and happy fix: create a component that extends TextArea and add the following property and override (if this in fact what you're trying to do): private var _tackOnText : String = ""; private var _tackOnTextChanged : Boolean = false; public function set tackOnText(value:String):void { _tackOnText = value; _tackOnTextChanged = true; invalidateProperties(); } public function get tackOnText():String { return _tackOnText; } override protected function commitProperties():void { super.commitProperties(); if(_tackOnTextChanged) { this.textField.text += _tackOnText; _tackOnText = ""; _tackOnTextChanged = false; } } Then change your playSentence to do this: if (testCounter == testSentence.length) { testCounter = 0; textArea.tackOnText += "\n"; } else { textArea.tackOnText += testSentence.charAt(testCounter++); } This is one fix to a semi-common problem that should allow you to not increase your frameRate by 4x to get your app to function correctly AND you'll be better working with the flex sdk. My 2p. Have a good one, Jeremy
