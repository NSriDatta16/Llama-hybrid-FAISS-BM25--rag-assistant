s9api versus trax with saxon-b

I was handed a shell script containing both: java -cp $(CLASSPATH) net.sf.saxon.Transform -xsl:$(CMS_ROOT)/$(TRANSFORMS_DIR)/$(LOCALE_STYLESHEET) \ -it:root and other cases that an output. It wasn't obvious to me how to specify the initial transform through trax, so I went with the s9api. Come to discover that passing a Serializer based on an output file to an XmlTransformer does not result in setting the base output URI to that file. I had to add: transformer.getUnderlyingController().setBaseOutputURI(outputFile.toURI().toString()); All this suggests to me that I might be better off just talking to trax and figuring out how to specify an initial transform and anything else I need. Can anyone shed light one way or the other?
