Fast way of getting the dominant color of an image

I have a question about how to get the dominant color of an image (a photo). I thought of this algorithm: loop through all pixels and get their color, either red, green, yellow, orange, blue, magenta, cyan, white, grey or black (with some margin of course) and it's darkness (light, dark or normal) and afterwards check which colors occurred the most. I think this is slow and not very precise. Is there a better way? If it matters, it's a UIImage taken from an iPhone or iPod touch camera which is at most 5 Mpx. The reason it has to be fast is that simply showing a progress indicator doesn't make very much sense as this is for an app for people with bad sight, or no sight at all. Because it's for a mobile device, it may not take very much memory (at most 50 MB).
