To give a more narrow response than the excellent ones that have already been posted, and focus on the advantage in interpretation - the Bayesian interpretation of a, e.g., "95% credible interval" is that the probability that the true parameter value lies within the interval equals 95%. One of the two common frequentist interpretations of a, e.g., "95% confidence interval", even if numerically the two are identical, is that in the long run, if we were to perform the procedure many many times, the frequency with which the interval would cover the real value would converge to 95%. The former is intuitive, the latter is not. Try explaining to a manager some time that you can't say "The probability that our solar panels will degrade by less than 20% over 25 years is 95%", but must instead say "If the true degradation rate was 20% over 25 years, and we could somehow repeat our sampling but with different results blah blah parallel identical universes blah, the long run frequency of times that the one-sided confidence interval I would calculate would lie entirely below 20%/25 years would be 5%", or whatever the equivalent frequentist statement would be. An alternative frequentist interpretation would be "Before the data was generated, there was a 5% chance the interval I would calculate using the procedure I settled on would fall entirely below the true parameter value. However, now that we've collected the data, we can't make any such statement, because we're not subjectivists and the probability is either 0 or 1, depending upon whether it does or does not lie entirely below the true parameter value." That'll help with the auditors and when calculating a warranty reserve. (I actually find this definition reasonable, albeit not usually useful; it's also not easy to understand intuitively, and especially not if you're not a statistician.) Neither frequentist interpretation is intuitive. The Bayesian version is. Hence the "big advantage in interpretation" held by the Bayesian approach.
