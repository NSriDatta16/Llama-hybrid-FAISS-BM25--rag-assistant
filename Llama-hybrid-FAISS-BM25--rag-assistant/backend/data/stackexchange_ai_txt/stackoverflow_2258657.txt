Is flexible layouts hard to make and maintain, time consuming than fixed width layout?

Is flexible layouts hard to make and maintain, time consuming than fixed width layout? Is flexible layout means only to give width height and font in em or % ? What is main benefit of flexible layout to the desktop and mobile users? And if we make flexible layout then should be give images width and height in em or `% also to images scale along with layout div and font size. Should we make everything flexible Header, footer, sidebar, content area? Is there any cons of flexible layout? I heard one about longer paragraph is not good for readability. If client is happy with fixed width layout even should we make layout flexible (to show our skills to others) if client don't mind if we don't ask for extra money? or we should make layout flexible only on demand.
