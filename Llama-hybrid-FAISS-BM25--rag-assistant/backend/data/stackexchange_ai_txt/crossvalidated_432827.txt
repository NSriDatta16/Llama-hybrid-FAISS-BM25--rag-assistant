If you are looking for ways to incorporate existing label information in the analysis of time series, you can try to use various supervised approaches. Since you mention neural networks twice, this article may be of interest. It's about detecting specific deviations in heart monitoring time series data. This is a task that can be done unsupervised, but in this case the authors wanted to incorporate (patient specific) information into the analysis. You can also look at semi-supervised anomaly detection and rare category detection. Although SECODA can be useful in some time-dependent use cases, it's primarily intended as an unsupervised algorithm for mixed independent data. It is non-parametric and scalable in terms of rows (not so much attributes). See this link to download a zip file with code and data examples in R.
