I remember reading a book on negotiation. The author paints a scenario where a group rents a hall annually for their meeting. The coordinator sends invitations and the owners of the hall decide to raise the rent exorbitantly. The author suggests that you explain to the owner of the hall that they can A: raise the rent as they ask and lose future business OR B: bring the rent back down to a reasonable rate and keep their business. The programmer thinks they have some leash on your company and to some degree he/she has reason to. Your company has been paying him/her. Explain that the programmer can fix the problem with a parameterized query 'for free' or eternally lose your company's business. Your company has some leverage, use it.
