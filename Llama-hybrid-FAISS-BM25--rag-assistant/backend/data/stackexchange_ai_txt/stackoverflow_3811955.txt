Why doesn't the OpenMP atomic directive support assignment?

The atomic directive in openmp supports stuff like x += expr x *= expr where expr is an expression of scalar type that does not reference x. I get that, but I don't get why you can't do: #pragma omp atomic x = y; Is this somehow more taxing cpu instruction-wise? Seems to me that both the legal and illegal statement loads the value of x and some other scalar value, changes the register value of x and writes it back. If anyone could explain to me how these instructions are (I assume) fundamentally different I would be very grateful.
