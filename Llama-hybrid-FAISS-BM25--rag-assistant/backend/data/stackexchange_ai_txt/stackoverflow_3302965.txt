Detecting a sequence of files

I need to import file sequences into a Qt program. Import itself is not hard, but I'm pondering what might be the most easiest way to detect if the files form a sequence, e.g.: filename_00001.png filename_00002.png filename_00003.png etc. Now, I have a drag'n'drop import working, and I'm sorting the list of imported files alphabetically. But while iterating through QUrl/QString I'm struggling to find an 'easy' solution to detect image numbering. I could go through iterating the file names, find the first number in a string, form a base string, counter + possible padding and end strings and try to match these. This, however, sounds a little too messy and makes me think there must be a better way. But is there?
