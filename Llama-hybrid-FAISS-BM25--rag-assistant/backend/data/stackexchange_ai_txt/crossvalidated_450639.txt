How to compare subpopulations? stdev?

I want to see if the average of Group A is significantly more than Groups B and C. I'd like a continuous measure of this significance. Then I'd like to compare B to CA, and C to BA. Population { Subpopulation A { avg: 4.90, count: 23 } Subpopulation B { avg: 4.10, count: 67 } Subpopulation C { avg: 0.00, count: 12 } } Should I compare: A's mean to the 'stdev of the weighted avg of B and C'? A's mean to the 'weighted average of the entire population.'? Or should I really be comparing A to B and C separately? EDIT: this ANOVA looks promising
