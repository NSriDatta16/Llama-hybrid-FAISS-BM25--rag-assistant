jQuery context menu get clicked item

I am using jQuery context menu plugin by Chris Domigan to appy a context menu. This is how I do it: $('#contacts tbody tr').contextMenu('myMenu1', { bindings: { 'copy': function(t) { alert('Trigger was '+t.id+'\nAction was Copy'); }, 'delete': function(t) { alert('Trigger was '+t.id+'\nAction was Delete'); } }, }); My question is, how do I get the content of the clicked tr item? I tried with $(t.target).html() but it returns null . Any idea? EDIT: here is the example http://jsfiddle.net/gqhRV/
