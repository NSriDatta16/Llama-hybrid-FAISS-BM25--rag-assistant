I would analyze the covariance matrix of your data to see whether it is different from the random matrix, e.g. you could apply Marchenko-Pastur theorem to the eigen values spectrum. If you determine that all eigenvalues are withim the bounds of the random matrix, then not much can be done with PCA to reduce dimensionality.
