Vim: How to reformat a set of lines into a single line (if the line is a single sentence)?

Not a dup of In Vim, what is the simplest way to join all lines in a file into a single line? , as I specifically mean to use the gq reformatting functionality. I used to write latex in vim using 80 character textwidth . However, I've now switched to an infinite textwidth , so my lines go on forever. Vim's reformatting (gqap for example), combines a few lines into a paragraph, wrapping them at 80 characters. I'd like it to instead combine them into a single line. ie Without a \clang{goto} statement in the HIR, we must instead use conditional statements to check the iteration number. should reformat into Without a \clang{goto} statement in the HIR, we must instead use conditional statements to check the iteration number. when it is highlighted and gq is pressed.
