I answered another question on the site, Software for drawing bayesian networks (graphical models) suggesting the Tikz library in $\LaTeX$. One of the nice properties of the Tikz code for drawing these models is that the RAM path notation is functionally similar to how you define nodes and edges in Tikz. It is not as nice if you want to automatically draw models you have already estimated in MPLUS or whatever (as would be the case for some of the R programs), but with my (admittedly) brief attempt at making some of the graphs in R or graphviz, I had a much easier time creating what I wanted in Tikz. For another potential solution in R though the qgraph library in R has some nice examples.
