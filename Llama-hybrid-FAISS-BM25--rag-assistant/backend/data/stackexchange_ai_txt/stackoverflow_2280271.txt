Which directories are writable by web server on shared web-hosting?

Currently I'm using shared webhost (Linux) to host my site. I know that anything inside '~/home/my_user_name/www' directory is writable by server. What are the other locations? Basically I want to change default session storage location and probably I shouldn't put it inside www directory. Edit Does session saving location has to be web server writable, since session is saved by PHP process? EDIT 2 How could I give read+write privilege to Apache on /home/my_user_name/tmp directory (tmp dir is outside www directory)?
