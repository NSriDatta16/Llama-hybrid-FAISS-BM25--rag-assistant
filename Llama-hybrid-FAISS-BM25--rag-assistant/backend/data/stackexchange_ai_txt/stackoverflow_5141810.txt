Any Java IDE which can quickly establish a local project based on a remote JNLP file for instant debugging?

Given a remote JNLP which works (all jars are available etc) but you need to run a debug session on the code. Is there any facility that easily allows you to create a local project in ANY reasonably modern IDE which consists of a local copy of the resources stated in the JNLP and can run said code in debug mode? Assume that a decompiler is available so it is just a matter of getting the debug session running. Are there any IDE's (Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, JDeveloper, etc. etc. - even a commercial offering) which can do this just given the JNLP URL?
