The problem is that you have a very large number of features as compared to that of the observations. There might be many redundant features, you should first check for that, and remove the features based on the rankings obtained. You can compare the correlation among the features ( this should be minimised ) as well as between the feature and label ( this should be maximised ), this will provide a clear idea of which are relevant features and which can be got rid of. (Refer to minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm for this - Ranking of features using MRMR algorithm ) After reducing the number of features, apply sequential feature selection ( sequentialfs() function in MATLAB, here you can avoid SVM and choose LDA to reduce the computational time further).
