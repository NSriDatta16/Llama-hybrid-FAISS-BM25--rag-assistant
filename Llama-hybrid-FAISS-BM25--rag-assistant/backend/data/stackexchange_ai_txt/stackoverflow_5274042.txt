How can I submit an HTML form to Google docs as well as to a PHP file

I have the following form : This works well, and submits the data to Google Docs. My question is, how can I submit this form to google docs AND submit it to a PHP file at the same time? I have tried using php include, but it does not work as the google docs link is not a php file. Also tries using cURL but not sure what Im doing wrong : //set options $curl_connection = curl_init('https://spreadsheets.google.com/'); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)"); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); //set data to be posted $post_string = "formResponse?hl=en&amp;formkey=dHXVVeEUybk9UNEVYdEdrNlVOSTZMbFE6MA&amp; theme=0AX42CRXMsmRFxMDNhN2Y&amp;ifq"; curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_string); $result = curl_exec($curl_connection); //show information regarding the request print_r(curl_getinfo($curl_connection)); echo curl_errno($curl_connection) . '-' . curl_error($curl_connection); //close the connection curl_close($curl_connection);
