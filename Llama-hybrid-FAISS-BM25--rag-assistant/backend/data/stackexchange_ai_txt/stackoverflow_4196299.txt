Proj.4 grew out of the USGS Cartographic Projection Procedures for the UNIX Environment . It is currently an open source project managed by the OSGeo. Proj.4 supports a huge number of different map projections and comes with thousands of pre-defined coordinate systems. As such, it is the most complete map projection / coordinate transform library that is readily available; and is an extremely popular component that is used in most open source geospatial projects, and many commercial ones. Many users will find the GDAL/OGR library and utilities (another OSGeo open source project) a useful way of leveraging Proj.4's capabilities on common data formats (eg. ESRI shapefiles) and coordinate system definitions (eg. .prj files). Source code, tutorials, and further information (including USGS reports) for Proj.4 can be found on the OSGeo website, here .
