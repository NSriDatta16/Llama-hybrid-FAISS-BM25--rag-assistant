I see what you mean. But personally I just wouldn't bother. Ask yourself why you're using the tag in the first place. If you want to delineate a change between the paragraph and the links, then in terms of pure mark-up I don't reckon it's required. If it's about the look and feel of your page (i.e. you want a rule demarcating the two areas), then again I'd question its usefulness, given that you can apply a border to either the paragraph or unordered list tags. Of course, given that this is html5, you could go the whole hog and use the tagâ€¦
