Can two separate regression coefficients be added to estimate their mutual effect?

Let's say I perform a Cox regression including 3 predictors that relate to the survival: Hazard ratios (HR) for predictors Sex : Hazard ratio for males = HR 1.5 Treatment : Hazard ratio for being treated, as compared with controls = HR 1.5 Race : Being black, as compared with being white = HR 1.5. If I wonder what the hazard will be for a black male with treatment, can I simply add upp the HRs; 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 4.5 ? I understand how interactions work and how they should apply. An interaction term between these predictors can definitely be recommended, but I was wondering whether the simple addition of coefficients will convey their additive risk? Textbooks of Cox regression often mention the terms additivity and multiplicatively , but they seldom elaborate on them. I guess any answer to this would also extend to linear and logistic regression.
