Your scaled variable, denote it $Z_1$, is an affine function of the original variable, $$Z_1 = c_0 + c_1X_1$$ where $c_0,c_1$ are constants and determined by the equation you describe in your question. In logistic regression, we are estimating a conditional probability for which we have assumed a specific functional form $$P(Y\mid X_1,..X_k) = \frac 1{1+e^{-g(\mathbf X)}}, \;\;g(\mathbf X) = b_0+b_1X_1+...+b_kX_k $$ You inserted $Z_1$ instead of $X_1$. So in this case you essentially specified $$g(\mathbf X_{-1}, Z_1) = b_0+b_1(c_0 + c_1X_1)+...+b_kX_k $$ $$= (b_0+b_1c_0) + b_1c_1X_1+...+b_kX_k = d_0 + d_1X_1+...+b_kX_k$$ In other words you are back to the original regressor matrix, but with a different intercept, and a different coefficient for the scaled variable. I hope this helps.
