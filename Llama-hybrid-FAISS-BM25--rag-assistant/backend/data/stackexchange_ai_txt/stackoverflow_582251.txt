How Do I Avoid SSL Certificates during Development for a WCF endpoint that will be secured during Production

We are developing a number of WCF services. requests will cross a domain boundry; that is, the clients are running in one domain and the servers handling the requests are in a different (production) domain. I know how to secure this link with SSL and certificates. We will aks the users for their usernames and passwords on the production domain and pass those in the SOAP headers. My problem is what to do during development and "beta" testing. I know that I can get a temporary certificate and use that during development. I am wondering what my alternatives to this approach are. What have others done in this situation? Update: I am not sure that I have gotten a "good" answer to my question. I am part of a large team (50+) of developers. The organization is fairly agile. Any one of the developers could end up working on the project that is using WCF. In fact several of the other projects are doing something similar but for different web sites and services. What I was looking for was a way that I could have anyone come in and work on this particular project for a few days without having to jump through a number of hoops. Installing the development certificate is one of those hoops. I fully understand that "dogfooding" the WCF structure during development is the best practice. Most the answers gave that as the answer. I wanted to know what, if anything, made sense that was other than "get a test certificate (or two) and install it on all of the developer boxes." Jon
