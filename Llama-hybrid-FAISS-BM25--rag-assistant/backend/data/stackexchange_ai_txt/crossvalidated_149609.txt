Representative transaction KPIs - what method to chose (average, median...) / how?

In my dataset i have about 30k of transactional data. For analysis, I want to show the end user some important KPIs: Average of transactions with loyalty cards Average turnover of these transactions The problem is, with a simple average i get "1,43..." as the result. The median of the dataset is 4. The highest number is 230, "normal" values are 10-20 transactions, most of them are 1-5. Now i look for a solution for this problem. What would be the best to show the user a "representative" value for the average loyalty card transactions?
