Why are my elastic net and lasso r-squared measures negative?

I'm using sklearn.linear_model.Lasso and sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet on a model that includes a constant. I don't expect a model with a constant to perform worse than the average of the data, ie an r-squared of 0 . I have p > n, but I have regressed on a few subset models and it's trivial to find an OLS subset with r-squared > .5. Below are some of the model metrics. I'm baffled that the r-squared is negative at all, and further baffled that r-squared is below -1. Lasso(alpha=0.1) r^2 on test data : -1.609104 ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.7) r^2 on test data : -1.745874 Related code is open-source here . I tried a variety of other alphas but did not achieve a non-negative r-squared. I did achieve an r-squared close to -0.003 with an alpha of 10. Could anyone provide insight into how such metrics are observed? Update, 10/20/21 - comparative sample scatter below plt.scatter(y_train, y_train_pred_lasso, color='red') plt.scatter(y_test, y_test_pred_lasso, color='blue') plt.show()
