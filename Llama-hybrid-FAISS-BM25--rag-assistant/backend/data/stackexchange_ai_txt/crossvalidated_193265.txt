Interpretation of diagonal detail for a 2D (Haar) Wavelet Transform

I am a statistics grad student, and I have just began exploring the topic of wavelet regression (specifically, Haar wavelets for discrete functions). I understand the generalization from a one dimensional wavelet transform (WT) to a two-dimensional WT with respect to horizontal and vertical detail, but I have a little trouble wrapping my mind around what is meant by a diagonal detail wavelet. What information does a diagonal detail wavelet capture? How do I interpret the diagonal wavelet coefficients? How is direction ( lower-left to upper-right vs lower-right to upper-left ) captured and/or distinguished in this concept? I greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide that might illuminate the concept. Cheers!
