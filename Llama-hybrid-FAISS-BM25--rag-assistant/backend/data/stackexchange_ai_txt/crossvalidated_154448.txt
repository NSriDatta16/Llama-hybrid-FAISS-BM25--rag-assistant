How to deal with the "sure probability" (p=1) in logistic regression

The logistic regression model is: $$\log\bigg(\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg) = \ldots$$ The most interesting case (for me) is the case that we have $p=1$ and $p=0$. But in this case, the ratio $p/(1-p)$ doesn't exist For example: In my model, $p$ is the probability that the customer will come back after the first purchase. We observed that 100% of the clients with the income $> 5000$ euros comes back after the first purchase ($p=1$), and 100% of the clients with the income $ When I treat the income as a continuous explanatory variable, there is no problem (income is a significant variable). But it isn't significant when I segment income into intervals $(0,1000)$, $(1000,3000)$, $(3000,5000)$, $(>5000)$. All the categories become non-significant. I think it's because of the $p=1$ that makes $1-p=0$, then the ratio $p/(1-p)$ is degenerate. What should I do in this case?
