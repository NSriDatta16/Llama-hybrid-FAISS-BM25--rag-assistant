Firstly, neither PCA or EFA will give you an estimate of the dimension of the scale. They are both essentially data reduction techniques. That being said, EFA is probably better for this purpose as it tells you how much of the variance in each question is accounted for in the model (the communality). To estimate dimension, you need to use some other technique. The best ones tend to be parallel analysis, the minimum average partial criterion, and examination of the scree plot. The eigenvalues greater than one does not tend to perform well in this situation. If you have a large amount of data, I would suggest that you take 2/3rds of it and build models. Then, fit the models you have developed to the last third of your data. This will reduce the chances of you over-fitting your data (i.e. modeling noise). This is a form of cross-validation, and is extremely important when using techniques such as factor analysis and principal components analysis, as there are many subjective decisions (factors, rotations etc) which need to be made as part of the process.
