You can't store a const pointer into a vector of non-const pointers since you could then use the non-const pointer to modify the object pointed to by the const pointer. You can make it a vector of const pointers: vector m_vehiclesVector; or pass in a non-const pointer. You could also cast away const-ness: m_vehiclesVector.push_back(const_cast (vehicleToAdd)); but I would strongly discourage that approach.
