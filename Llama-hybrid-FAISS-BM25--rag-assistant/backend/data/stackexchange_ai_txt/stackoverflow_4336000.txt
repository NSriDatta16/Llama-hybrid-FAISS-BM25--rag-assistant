How can I create a client-side database that persist between sessions?

I'm working with HTML5 to create a client-side database using the Lawnchair Javascript library, but when y create a new Lawnchair object what i get is a new local storage, not a new database var people = new Lawnchair('people'); the problem is that in local storage I have just one table, and i need to be able to create more than just one table.
