Sampling Variability

I want to study the effects of an organization-wide training program on a specific policy, in a company of 670 employees, designed to increase compliance with that policy. Not all employees have been through this training, but all will eventually attend. I would like to compare 50 employees who have not attended the training and 50 who have (sample of my population) I want to distinguish whether the program is effective or whether the improvement is reasonably explained by sampling variation. I would retrospectively analyze prospectively collected data, through internal policy compliance review mechanisms already in place. I will collect pre- and post-test results on employees, who have attended the training. So my null hypothesis: (Ho) As a result of the XYZ company employee training program, either there will be no significant difference in policy compliance or there will be a significant increase. And alternative: (Ha) As a result of the XYZ company employee training program, there will be a significant increase in policy compliance. Should I use nonprobability vs. probability sampling? I guess there is no real way I can randomly select employees...Can I just compare those who have attended the training and their compliance to the policy with the rest of the population? Where do I go from here?
