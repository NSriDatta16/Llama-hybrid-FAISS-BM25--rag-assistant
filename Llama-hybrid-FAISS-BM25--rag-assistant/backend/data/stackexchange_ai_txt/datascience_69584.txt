How to Visualise a CNN model using Python

I am new to Deep Learning and have been trying to show a plot of the CNN architecture using Python in Google Colab. Besides importing the necessary libraries, I have noticed from other resource that normally, we would declare a model {model = sequential()}, and then model.add (Conv2d or MaxPool or Activation etc.) and for visualising, print(model.summary()). However, I have developed the CNN architecture using the below code and struggling with generating a model print. Could anybody tell what I am missing here. Thanks input = Input(shape=X.shape[1:]) # 154x154x3 x = Conv2D(12, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input) # 154x154x12 x = Conv2D(12, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu')(x) # 77x77x12 x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x) # 77x77x16 x = Conv2D(16, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu')(x) # 38x38x16 x = Conv2D(24, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x) # 38x38x24 x = Conv2D(24, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu')(x) # 19x19x24 x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x) # 19x19x32 x = Conv2D(32, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu')(x) # 9x9x32 x = Conv2D(48, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x) # 9x9x48 x = Conv2D(48, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu')(x) # 4x4x48 x = Dropout(0.5)(x) # 4x4x48 x = Conv2D(n_classes, (1, 1))(x) # 4x4x62 x = GlobalAvgPool2D()(x) # 62 output = Activation('softmax')(x) # 62
