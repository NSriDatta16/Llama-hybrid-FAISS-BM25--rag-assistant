Is it possible to read the 'current project version' in the settings of an iPhone app

In my app I am using the agvtool to update the build number. I would now like to have the version of my app that appears in the settings to display this number and have it update automatically. I have seen a few apps work around this by writing a script to ready the value and populate the value then in the root.plist . I was wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing this.
