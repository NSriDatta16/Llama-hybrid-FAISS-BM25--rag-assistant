This is really a general OO design question rather than a language question. Personally, I follow the school of thought "if you have many getters and mutators, your class design has a flaw". Public interface of a class is behavior, not its internal structure or some model of such structure. But of course it's just one point of view, and it is completely language-agnostic. One thing that C++ discourages are "setters". Since well-written C++ classes are fully functional after the constructor runs (see "Scope-Bound Resource Management") any sort of post-construction "setting" goes against this language's best practices.
