Given that Dr. Bob and Dr. Robert and Bob, PhD are all the same person, they would link to the same row in the authors table. However, I think what you need is a person table that authors links to. You could also link your interesting person table to it. That way Author Bob and Author Robert as well as Interesting Bob link to Person Bob. Hope that makes sense.
