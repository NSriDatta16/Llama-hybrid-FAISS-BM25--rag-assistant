An app written in A2003 is not old. Just well seasoned. One of my current apps that have been added to over the years many times started off in Access 2.0 in 1994 or so. Others in Access 97. While Albert, as always, has a good suggestion I couldn't be bothered to add any eye candy. Database apps are business related apps. They are not Twitter, MSN Messenger, iPhone or Facebook. They are meant to be boring and functional. Now if a client really wanted to pay me by the hour I'd figure it all out and give them the choices and set things up for them. I'd probably even add the functionality so each user could change as many of the possible options to suit their own tastes. But I'd let them do the eye candy selections.
