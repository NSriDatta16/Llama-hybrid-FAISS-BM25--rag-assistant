I think I nice way to get the intuition is to simulate 3 series for $t=0,...,500$ and plot them: Autoregressive Stationary Series: $A_{t}=0.05+0.95A_{t-1}+u_{t}$ Random Walk with Drift: $R_{t}=0.05+1R_{t-1}+u_{t}$ Explosive Series: $E_{t}=0.05+1.05E_{t-1}+u_{t}$ where $u_{t}$ is just some white noise, like iid $N(0,1)$. Look at $A$ and $R$: The theoretical mean of $A$ is $1$ (red horizontal line) and its standard deviation is $3.2$. The graph will deviate from that mean over time, but not too far. $R$ will look qualitatively similar to $A$ early on, but begins to drift apart in the middle, but converges towards the end. In theory, the unconditional mean and variance of $R$ do not exist, and you can see that in the graph. Now plot all 3 series on a graph with the same scale. Can you see how $E$ just makes the other two look like a straight line? The slope parameter in $E$ exceeds $1$ by 0.05, the same amount that it falls short for $A$, but what a difference it makes! Here, the average makes no sense at all. The other point is that $A$ and $R$ look like the sorts of things we see every day, but we are bad at guessing which ones are stationary, especially with fewer data. This is shamelessly plagiarized from Econometric Methods by Jack Johnston and John DiNardo , which is sadly out of print.
