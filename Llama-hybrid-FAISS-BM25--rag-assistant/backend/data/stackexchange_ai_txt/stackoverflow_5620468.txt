What causes this weird display ? I suspect it might be CSS or a bug in Chrome OS X?

This is what the weird view looks like, in Chrome on OS X on first load: That blue bar running right across the screen is actually the navigation bar that should be at the top of the screen. See below. This is what the original view looks like, and this is what it reverts to - once I scroll down (so that portion of the screen disappears) and scroll back up: Edit1: I don't even know what code to post, if any because it is kinda random. If you ask some questions though, maybe something might jump out and I will know what code to either post or look at. Thanks. Edit2: Here is the code for the div#navigation : Plan: Chameleon # of Projects: 2 / 20 # of Clients: 2 / 15 Storage: 10.8 MB / 10.0GB Hi Test Name: Test User Email: test@abc.com Last Logged In: about 2 hours ago Dashboard Settings Logout Here is the CSS: #navigation { font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background: #2d343f; background-image: url('../images/nav-textured-bg.png'); background-repeat: repeat; padding: 5px 5px; margin: 0px auto; position: relative; height: 75px; } #navigation a { text-decoration: none; padding: 10px 15px; display: inline; height: 35px; line-height: 35px; color: #c6c8cb; } #navigation ul { width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; } #navigation li { width: 100%; display: inline; list-style-type: none; } #navigation li img { position: relative; top: 15px; } Edit 3: Here is another screenshot of how it looks when I scroll up. The top navigational bar is still there. This blue thing is not even the menu, it's like a screenshot of it. When I hover over the menu links, they don't work.
