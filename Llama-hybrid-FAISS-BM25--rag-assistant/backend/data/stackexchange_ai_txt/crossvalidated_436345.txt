Homoscedasticity in regression model building example

In a linear model building example for a class, we are given a data set and told to use methods like forward, backward, and stepwise selection to choose predictors to include. I get to a combination of terms that I feel comfortable using in the model and provide decent adjusted $R_a^2$ value: 0.8459. The residuals show constant variance at this point. The following are the residuals: The exercise then prompts to add any interaction terms that I feel may be necessary. I added an interaction term that is the squared value of one of the predictors after centering the predictor. I come to the conclusion to the term based on plots against the response variable and a general linear test. I have strong evidence to include the interaction term; however when I add the term the residual variance loses its constancy. It now resembles: The $R_a^2$ value is now 0.9096. I clearly see a change and run the Breusch-Pagan (p-value = 0.219) test which I knew would confirm this visual of loss of homoscedasticity. I feel that this is only a small departure though. I am looking for advice on determining how bad the departure from constant error variance needs to be before I decide on another model. What are the implications of keeping a model that only moderately violates this? Note: I know the $R_a^2$ isn't the sole basis of why I think this model is better; I was given evidence through other tests that the interaction term should have been in the model. Note: The normality assumption of residuals was not violated throughout. A log transformation was already performed on the response variable for both models in question.
