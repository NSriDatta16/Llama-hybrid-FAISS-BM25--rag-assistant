Preparing data for a live prediction engine

I need to build a live prediction engine (either using Ensemble methods/ RNN/ Keras Classifier) that could learn from historical data what kinds of users are likely to transact and, in real-time, generate transaction probabilities for current users on a DAILY basis. I do have their demographics, transactional and app activities data. There is an amount limit that can be transacted by the users in a month. How do I prepare the historical data to predict the next day if he is going to transact or not? Thanks. Demographics: CustomerID | CustomerAge | Gender | Nationality | Joining Date | Loyalty Program Opt-in | Address 1222 | 25 | M | British | 21-Apr-2016 | Yes | Old kent Transactions: Beneficiary | CustomerID| TransactionDateTime | TransactionAmount 4534534 | 545544 | 19/02/2016 16:02:56 | 1888.85 4353222 | 545544 | 23/02/2016 08:49:49 | 3242.43 2453453 | 535455 | 26/02/2016 10:10:56 | 4776.57 5353532 | 435353 | 11/02/2016 12:43:38 | 4862.16 4532522 | 345353 | 23/02/2016 17:42:22 | 4923.54
