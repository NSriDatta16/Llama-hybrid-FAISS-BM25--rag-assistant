What characters can I use to quote this ruby string?

I'm embedding JRuby in Java, because I need to call some Ruby methods with Java strings as arguments. The thing is, I'm calling the methods like this: String text = ""; // this can span over multiple lines, and will contain ruby code Ruby ruby = Ruby.newInstance(); RubyRuntimeAdapter adapter = JavaEmbedUtils.newRuntimeAdapter(); String rubyCode = "require \"myscript\"\n" + "str = build_string(%q~"+text+"~)\n"+ "str"; IRubyObject object = adapter.eval(ruby, codeFormat); The thing is, I don't know what strings I can use as delimiters, because if the ruby code I'm sending to build_string will contain ruby code. Right know I'm using ~,but I think this could break my code. What characters can I use as delimiters to make sure my code will work no matter what the ruby code is?
