How can I compare the lengths between these two confidence intervals?

Let $X\sim Beta(\theta,1)$ . I was asked to find two confidence intervals and compare their lengths. The first confidence interval is for $Y=-(logX)^{-1}$ over the set $[y/2,y]$ . The second confidence interval is using any pivotal quantity over a confidence interval with the same confidence coefficient as the first confidence interval. my work: I found the first confidence interval. Through a transformation, I obtain $f_Y(y)=\frac{\theta}{y^2}e^{-\theta/y}, 0 . Since the coverage probability of $[y/2,y]$ is a constant 0.239, this is the confidence coefficient. I found an appropriate transformation for the second confidence interval: $U=X^\theta$ , where $f_U(u)=1, 0 . Then, I compute its coverage probability as $P(a $P(log_x(a) . However, I do not know how to solve for $a$ or $b$ , which are needed to determine the length of this confidence interval.
