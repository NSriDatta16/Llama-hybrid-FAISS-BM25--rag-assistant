The software you test is a system. When you are testing it as a whole you are black box testing since you primarily deal with inputs and outputs. Black box testing is great when you have no means of getting inside of the system. But since you usually do, you create a lot of unit tests that actually test your system as a white box. You can slice system open in many ways and organize your tests depending on system internal structure. White box testing provides you with many more ways of testing and analyzing systems. It's clearly complimentary to Black box testing and should not be considered as an alternative or competing methodology.
