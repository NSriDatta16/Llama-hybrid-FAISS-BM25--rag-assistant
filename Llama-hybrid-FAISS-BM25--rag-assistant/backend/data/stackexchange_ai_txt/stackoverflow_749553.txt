How can I read data from a textbox with no web server, then save it in an XML file?

I am studying computer science and we have to do a programming project which must be strongly related to XML and using XSD and XSLT or XQuery/XPath at least. Because I like C# I'd like to do it in this language, but I could use another if anyone has another idea. My Idea is now to code some kind of appointment book. I imagine that all appointments for the week are shown as HTML and you can enter for each day appointment notes in the textarea for this day. Now my question: How can I take over the data entered in the textboxes? The application is an offline one so I have no web server receiving the GET request containing the entered data. Is it possible to read the current HTML DOM from memory with all its entered values and then transform it to an XML format for persistent storage from which it could be read in later? Or is this idea totally stupid? How else can I put all those XML technologies in one app?
