How do item loadings in PCA / FA relate to the true factors in an instrument?

My question relates to a real research problem I am having. I am going to do EFA (well actually PCA) on a 111 item questionnaire designed to screen for 20 different disorders found in childhood and adolescence. Incidentally, I am going to use Velicer's MAP test to decide number of factors to extract. My search of the relevant literature tells me that my PCA will likely reveal fewer factors than the instrument claims to have. My problem is I don't fully understand item loading. I know that the items may not load as they should but I don't understand why. Is it because the items may measure multiple factors? Also, can some items just load nowhere? Can a completely new factor(s) emerge that might be comprised of all (or most of) all of the items of say, two factors?
