Dynamic Controls, Update Panels and Events - Best Way To Achieve My Result

Been pulling my hair out and doing a bit of looking on the web to try and figure out an elegant solution to my issue. I have a ProductImages.aspx page. It shows all of the images associated with that product in a dynamically created list. Events are wired up to each picture to allow you to update it. This works fine. However, I have an option at the end which lets me add a new image. This is a button which fires off a call to the AddImage method. Now what is happening is that the original controls are being create and added to the page with events. Then the button event if fired which recreates all of the existing image controls and a new one. Add this point the new image control create after the OnInit does not have events attached due to the events being added AFTER the OnInit. I can do a Response.Redirect to reload the page and fire the OnInit to wire up the events again but this seems very inelegant and destroys the point of using update Panels. Any ideas?
