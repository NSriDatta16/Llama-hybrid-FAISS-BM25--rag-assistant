SVM why do we maximize 2/||w||

If you open any SVM guide you will see that 1/||w|| is proportional to margin size (which is meant to be maximized by SVM). But how did you get this result? On the picture below you may see 2 plots. One is $x_{1} = -5x_{2} + 5$ and second is $x_{1} = -5x_{2} - 5$ according to my understanding of comments margin should have size equal to 10 in this case. But if you look at plots you will see its is slightly less than 2.
