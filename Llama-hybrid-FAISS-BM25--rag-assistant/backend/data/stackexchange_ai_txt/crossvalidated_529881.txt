Is the white noise a MA or a AR? Or both?

I am starting to familiarize with time series concepts, but I find some difficulties when I try to bring the algebraic expressions into a "mental" representation. In this case, my doubt is simpler: consider that my class did not study ARMA processes yet (I spoiled myself a little, but I preferred to stop then). Thank you all
