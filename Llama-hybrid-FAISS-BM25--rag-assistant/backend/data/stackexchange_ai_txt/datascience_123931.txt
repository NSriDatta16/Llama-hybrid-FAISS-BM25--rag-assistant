What is the state-of-the-art in prediction\classification missing labels in partially labeled data?

Overview Let's say I have the following data: # Label\Target VM #2000-01-01 00:00:00 App3 VM9 #2000-01-01 01:00:00 App3 VM3 #2000-01-01 02:00:00 App1 VM1 #2000-01-01 03:00:00 App1 VM8 #2000-01-01 04:00:00 -> None VM1 #... ... ... #2000-12-31 19:00:00 -> None VM5 #2000-12-31 20:00:00 App3 VM1 #2000-12-31 21:00:00 App3 VM7 #2000-12-31 22:00:00 App1 VM3 #2000-12-31 23:00:00 App2 VM8 I have 3 classes (App1, App2, App3) + None . None represents missing values in Label\Target column. Problem definition Problem: is to classify\predict missing values represented by None in Label\Target column given a time series. None ==?==> (App1, App2, App3)? I'm unsure which approach to take with partially labeled data. Approach1: consider 3 classes (App1, App2, App3) Approach2: consider 4 classes (App1, App2, App3) + None Which method should I use? The thing that crossed my mind is Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) What about Self-Supervised Learning ? I did some research to see the best practice to approach this problem and what is State-of-the-art. I found this article : How about Semi-Supervised Learning ? "Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when there is a large amount of unlabeled data available, but itâ€™s too expensive or difficult to label all of it." Ref But still, I'm confused and even unsure if this problem is classify\predict or forecast missing label. Reproducible data generation Following is sampled data if you had a Pythonic solution: import numpy as np import pandas as pd import random np.random.seed(2023) # Generate TS ts = pd.date_range('2000-01-01', '2000-12-31 23:00', freq='H') # number of samples N = len(ts) # Create a random dataset data = { #"TS": ts, 'Appx': [random.choice(['App1', 'App2', 'App3', None]) for _ in range(N)], 'VM': [random.choice(['VM1' , 'VM2' , 'VM3', 'VM4', 'VM5', 'VM6']) for _ in range(N)] } df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=ts) df Question I need best practice to frame the problem correctly for this scenario to predict missing labels in partially labeled data over time and possible approaches (Approach1 or 2) based on state-of-the-art and recent methods (Semi\Self-supervised learning). I have generated sample data if someone wants to offer the minimal solution(s). Any help will be highly appreciated.
