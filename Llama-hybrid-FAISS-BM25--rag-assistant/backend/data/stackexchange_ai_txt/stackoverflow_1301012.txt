Nope, you won't be logged in anymore. See my answer here: How do I Keep a user logged in for 2 weeks? (See http://www.drupal.org/node/31506 for more information about sheduled tasks, if you want people to be signed out after an amount of time). It might help you.

For people who switch a browser one time, they can just sign in again once after copying cookies. However, this would be a disaster for people who change or update browser nonstop).
