I would say that the option to resize the the image to 100x100 with out regard for the aspect of the original image is and unacceptable solution. In my personal opinion the best option is to give the user a square selection tool, that allows them to drag and move a crop area over their uploaded image. Once they select the crop area you crop the image and resize it to 100x100 pixels. That will give you the cleanest presentation of thumbnail images. Since the image will link to a full size image at it's original aspect I would not worry that some of the image will be lost.
