Check out "Object Oriented Software Construction" by Bertrand Mayer. The concept is called "Contract Driven Development" It's an in-line type of testing at a function level, it's changed the way I program. If you use CDD in Eiffel, the language also written by Bertrand, they're automatically checked by the runtime during the test and debug phase. http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Prentice-Hall-International/dp/0136291554 http://dev.eiffel.com
