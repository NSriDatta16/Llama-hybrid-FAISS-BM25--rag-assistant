So you're trying to move onto the next record if you failed to commit this one. Robert Muller had it right. To explain... If the WriteRecord fails, then the business component will still be positioned on the dirty record. Attempting to move to the next record will make the buscomp try to write it again--because of a feature called "implicit saving". Solution: You'll have to undo the record (UndoRecord) to abandon your failing field changes before moving onto the next one.
