Given this distribution of the dependent variable, the assumptions of OLS (normal residuals) are likely to be violated (although it's worth checking). More likely, you need ordinal logistic regression, but that can be problematic with such small samples in some categories: if there are 20 in 8, 9 and 10 combined, then there must be one (at least) with 6 or fewer. This can lead to overfitting. Although I am usually very against dichotomizing data, here you may have to do so, and then run a regular logistic regression on disease (present vs. absent). Then you have groups of 80 and 20, and having 2 variables plus an interaction is pushing it a little but you should be ok
