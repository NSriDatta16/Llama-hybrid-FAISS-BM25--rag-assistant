How to simulate a USB drive

Is it possible to simulate a USB drive with software only? I mean, for example, to expose a local memory space to the OS so the device manager will recognize it as a USB device. I'm not familiar with hardware implementation, but I'm sure that it is possible somehow to emulate the USB protocol. I began with this book - USB Design By Example . Can anyone please give me additional references to begin with? Thank in advance!
