Text summarization techniques are what you're probably after. But as a rough heuristic, you can do this with some relatively simple steps as long as you aren't counting on 100% perfect results all of the time. As long as you don't need to support writing systems that don't have spaces between words (Chinese, Japanese), you can get pretty good results by looking for the first couple of runs of a consecutive word sequences with an arbitrary threshold that you'll spend a few days tuning. (Chinese and Japanese would require a reasonable word break identification algorithm in addition to this heuristic). I would start with an HTML Parser (HTML Agility Pack in Dotnet, or something like Ruby's Nokogiri or Python's BeautifulSoup if you'd like to experiment with the algorithms in a more interactive environment before committing to your C# solution). To reduce the search space, sequences of links with little or no surrounding text using the features of your HTML parser. That should eliminate most navigation panels and certain types of ads. You could further extend this to look for links that have words after them but no punctuation; this would eliminate descriptive links. If you start to see runs of text followed by "." or "," with say, 5 or more words (which you can try tuning later), you'd start scoring that as a potential sentence or sentence fragment. When you find several runs in a row, that has pretty good odds of being the most important part of the page. You could score text with tags around it a bit higher. Once you have a fair amount of these types of sequences, The odds are pretty good that you've got "content" rather than layout chrome. This won't be perfect, and you may need to add a mechanism to tweak the heuristic based on problematic page structures that you regularly scan. But if you build something based on this approach, it should provide pretty reasonable results for 80% or so of your content. If you find this kind of method inadequate, you may want to look at Bayesian probability or Hidden Markov Models as a way of improving the results.
