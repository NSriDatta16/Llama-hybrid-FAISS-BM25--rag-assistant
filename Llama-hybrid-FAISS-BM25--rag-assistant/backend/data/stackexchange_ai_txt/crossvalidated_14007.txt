What is the best way to learn the fundamentals of probability required for machine learning algorithms?

I took a probability course in university a few years ago, but I'm going through some machine learning algorithms now and some of the math is just befuddling. Specifically right now, I'm learning the EM algorithm (expectation maximization) and it seems that there is a large disconnect between what is required and what I have. I'm not asking for a book or a website, but what is the way to learn enough of these topics to be able to get a thorough understanding of the algorithms that use them? Is it required to go through a book and do hundreds of exercises? Or is that overkill in this sense? edit: If this is the wrong location for this question, please vote to migrate :)
