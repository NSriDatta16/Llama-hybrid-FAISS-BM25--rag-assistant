The formulas on that page are clearly for a least-squares estimate, not a maximum likelihood estimate (as explained three pages earlier at (6.13)). Because glm uses ML, it appears you are not actually reproducing that model. If you really want to reproduce it, you either need to understand how the formulas connect with R 's lm functionality and apply lm or else you need to implement the formulas as they are given. Until you do one of those things, it's not valid to compare your output (digit by digit) with the results in that chapter. It is perhaps of interest that glm 's $LD_{50}$ of $5.15$ is well within the $95\%$ confidence interval of $(4.37, 5.37)$ for the Finney estimate, indicating the two methods do not significantly disagree. It is more striking that glm reports such tiny SEs (relatively) for its estimates. That high precision does not seem justified by the dataset. If your concern is with the data and the estimates, rather than the methodology, you would do well to pay attention to the deviance test and work to understand the nature of the lack of fit it indicates.
