What is the Q² value for each component of a PCA

I have a PCA addin for MSExcel. One of the results it gives for each component is the R², cummulative R², Q², and cummulative Q². It looks like the cummulative R² is the sum of all previous R² values, while the cummulative Q² is: $$ cummulativeQ^2_n = cummulativeQ^2_{n-1} +\left(1-cummulativeQ^2_{n-1}\right)*Q^2_n $$ Can anyone tell me what this Q statistic is, how it is calculated, and what it means?
