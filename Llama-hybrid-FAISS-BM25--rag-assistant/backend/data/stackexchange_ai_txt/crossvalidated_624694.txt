Which standardization for lasso and dependent variable

What kind of standardization of the predictor matrix is needed for lasso? let y be the response variable is it (x-mean(x)/sd(x)) OR (x-mean(x)/sd(y))? Also does lasso require you to standardize the y response variable? This link says you need to standardize both y and x: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/ridge/# "Both the independent and dependent variables require standardization through subtraction of their averages and a division of the result with the standard deviations."
