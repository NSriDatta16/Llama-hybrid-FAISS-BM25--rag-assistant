Have a look at the README file , paying particular attention to "Ensure that the temporary and math directories exist and can be written to by the user account the web server runs under; if you don't control the server, you may have to make them world-writable." If that does not help, edit render.ml, comment out the block that says "Commenting this block out will aid in debugging", and re-run make. This will leave all temporary files (including the TeX log) so that you can hopefully see what went wrong.
