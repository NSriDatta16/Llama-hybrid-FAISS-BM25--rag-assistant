Bind dynamic properties using JSF

I have a edit screen which displays a series of editable properties(fields) of an entity. And this list of fields are dynamic,in the sense that any field can be added/removed from the list without any code change. I have a model something like this. public class Property{ private String displayName; private String value; private int displayOrder; //other props,getters,setters etc.. } My backingBean has a map of these properties (for some other reasons,we chose map as the datastructure). public class BackingBean{ private Map editableProps; //other props,getters,setters etc.. } The problem is with iterating over this map and produce a textbox for each of the entry. Since a4j:repeat(richfaces) doesn't iterate over a map,I have decided to use JSTL and the code fragment looks something like this, This will work fine except for the fact that the binding of a ui field to bean's property will not happen automatically. If I try using h:inputText inside c:forEach , the component doesn't get rendered.(Guess the jstl var is not available for the jsf). Is there a JSF way of doing all this(Using hashmap ) ?So that a textbox is produced for each entry in the map and any change to it gets bound the underlying java bean property.?
