No - there isn't anything directly comparable. I'd look at the user settings as just another kind of data to store in the database. Use the same methods to store the user settings as you do the rest of the application's data. I recommend NHibernate for your data layer. Just set up a mapping file and the database table and let NHibernate handle persisting your data to the database. Use that for all your database storage throughout the app and see how little database code you need to write.
