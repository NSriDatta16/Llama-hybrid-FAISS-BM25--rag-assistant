Building a time series that includes multiple observations for each date

I'm trying to apply a time series to quarterly sampled data (animal biomass) over a 10 year period with 3 reps per quarter. So 40 dates but 120 total observations. I have read up to SARIMA'a in Shumway and Stoffer's Time Series Analysis and it's Applications as well as skimmed Woodward, et. al.'s Applied Time Series Analysis, and my understanding is each model is based on a single observation at each point in the time series. QUESTION: How can I include the variation in each observation in my model? I could build a series on the mean, but I would loose the variation at each observation and I think that is critical to my understanding of what is happening.
