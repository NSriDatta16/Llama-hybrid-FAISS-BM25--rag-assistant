Deep neural networks, more concretely convolutional neural networks (CNN), are basically a stack of layers which are defined by the action of a number of filters on the input. Those filters are usually called kernels. For example, the kernels in the convolutional layer, are the convolutional filters. Actually no convolution is performed, but a cross-correlation. The kernel size here refers to the widthxheight of the filter mask. The max pooling layer, for example, returns the pixel with maximum value from a set of pixels within a mask (kernel). That kernel is swept across the input, subsampling it. So nothing to do with the concept of kernels in support vector machines or regularization networks. You can think of them as feature extractors.
