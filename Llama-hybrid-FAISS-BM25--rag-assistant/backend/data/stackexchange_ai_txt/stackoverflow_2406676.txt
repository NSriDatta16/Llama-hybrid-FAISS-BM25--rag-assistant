Before starting out, there are many operators out there! Here is a list of all C++ operators: list . With this being said, operator overloading in C++ is a way to make a certain operator behave in a particular way for an object. For example, if you use the increment/decrement operators (++ and --) on an object, the compiler will not understand what needs to be incremented/decremented in the object because it is not a primitive type (int, char, float...). You must define the appropriate behavior for the compiler to understand what you mean. Operator overloading basically tells the compiler what must be accomplished when the increment/decrement operators are used with the object. Also, you must pay attention to the fact that there is postfix incrementing/decrementing and prefix incrementing/decrementing which becomes very important with the notion of iterators and you should note that the syntax for overloading these two type of operators is different from each other. Here is how you can overload these operators: Overloading the increment and decrement operators
