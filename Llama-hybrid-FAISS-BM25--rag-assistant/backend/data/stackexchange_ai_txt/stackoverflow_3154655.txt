Drag and Drop .sql scripts into SQL Management Studio 2008 does NOT work?

In SQL 2000 / Query Analyser, i used to be able to drag-n-drop T-SQL script files from Windows Explorer onto Query Analyser. Cannot do the same in SQL 2008 / Management Studio ? I can obviously do: File / Open / File... Navigate to the file Then Open it. But someone please tell me there is an easier way just like in 2000 ! EDIT 16/7/10: Finally got to try on home PC, works as expected. Workplace has some restrictions (NT user policies) on a/c login. With Query Analyser, i 'Run As' another a/c and drag-drop works under logged-in user; With Management Studio, i 'Run As' another a/c and drag-drop does not work under logged-in user.
