Continuous output in Neural Networks

How can I set Neural Networks so they accept and output a continuous range of values instead of a discrete ones? From what I recall from doing a Neural Network class a couple of years ago, the activation function would be a sigmoid, which yields a value between 0 and 1. If I want my neural network to yield a real valued scalar, what should I do? I thought maybe if I wanted a value between 0 and 10 I could just multiply the value by 10? What if I have negative values? Is this what people usually do or is there any other way? What about the input? Thanks
