correlation of features and target in predicting red wine quality in machine learning

In red wine dataset, there are 11 features such as acid, pH and one target(quality). Using those features to predict the quality score of the red wine. I want to choose the most important features to compose my design matrix. So I calculate the correlation between every feature and target, choosing 6 features which has a strong relationship with the target. Is it ok to ignore the relationship between every feature? for example, maybe acid an pH has a strong correlation, but I didn't consider the correlation between every feature, just consider the correlation between features and the target. if it is not ok, how do I do this? by using PCA?
