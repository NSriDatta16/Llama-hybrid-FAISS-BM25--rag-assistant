The traditional way to flag a method so that it will appear in Interface Builder, and you can drag a connection to it, has been to make the method return type IBAction. However, if you make your method void, instead (IBAction is #define'd to be void), and provide an (id) argument, the method is still visible. This provides extra flexibility, al All 3 of these are visible from Interface Builder: -(void) someMethod1:(id) sender; -(IBAction) someMethod2; -(IBAction) someMethod3:(id) sender; See Apple's Interface Builder User Guide for details, particularly the section entitled Xcode Integration.
