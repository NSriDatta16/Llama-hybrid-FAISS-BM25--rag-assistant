understanding semcor corpus structure h

I'm learning NLP. I currently playing with Word Sense Disambiguation. I'm planning to use the semcor corpus as training data but I have trouble understanding the xml structure. I tried googling but did not get any resource describing the content structure of semcor. The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . I'm assuming wnsn is 'word sense'. Is it correct? What does the attribute lexsn mean? How does it map to wordnet? What does the attribute pn refer to? (third line) How is the rdf attribute assigned? (again third line) In general, what are the possible attributes?
