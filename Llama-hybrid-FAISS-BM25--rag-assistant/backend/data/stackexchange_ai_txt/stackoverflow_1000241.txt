Optimal xml storage engine

I'm considering optimal open source solution for storing xml documents with further querying on them effectively. Amount of data will be small. As far as I understand native xml databases might form a proper solution for my case. They obviously store xml documents in highly efficient way. It would be great to learn your experience. Any suggestions on proper solution? Have you got any experience employing xml storage engines in your apps?
