Disqus offers a VIP service aimed at organisations with a reasonable budget. I spoke with them last week and they told me they are planning on rolling out a self-serve integration option later this year. It will be cheaper than their VIP offering. As a (very limited) stop gap, you could pre-fill the username and email address on the default 'Guest' tab with the data gathered from authlogic using Javascript. To my knowledge this is as far as you can integrate Disqus right now. @bkno
