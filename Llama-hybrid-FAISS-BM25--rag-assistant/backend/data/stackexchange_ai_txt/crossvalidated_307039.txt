The idea of deep neural network is it can do the feature engineering automatically for us. (See the first chapter of the deep learning book .) I would strongly recommend you to read the first chapter. Doing basis expansion is not really necessary and uncommonly used. Keep in mind that, the deep net usually takes raw features as inputs, for images that have (at least) thousands of pixels, it is also not possible to do the basis expansion (say higher order polynomial expansion) effectively before feeding to the neural network. In fact, there are some operations in deep neural network can be viewed as basis expansion. Convolution layer can be viewed as doing feature engineering in Fourier basis expansion. See my question: What is the intuition behind convolutional neural network? The ReLU can be viewed as doing piecewise linear fit (spline basis).
