Even with non-normal residuals, the coefficient estimates are consistent. Non-normal residuals are not the biggest evil in model construction. Your main objective is capturing the dependence between the dependent variable and independent variables most accurately. It is not clear if the original model was better or if the transformation has improved the fit. To check that, you should use a model selection criterion, like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In my experience, if the residuals are not normal, fighting that fully is difficult. In most cases a transformation just mitigates the problem. Therefore, you should use bootstrap-based tests to assess statistical significance of the parameter estimates.
