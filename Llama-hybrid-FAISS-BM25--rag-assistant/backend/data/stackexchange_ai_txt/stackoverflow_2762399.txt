Three possible solutions: Move this "joystick" icon 100 pixels off of the corner. Give it opacity until it is hovered. Have the click-and-drag movements "sustain" so that click-drag-and-holding the cursor 40 pixels away from the joystick center causes continuous screen panning. Use arrows, similar to Google Maps . (You can also combine this with the first solution by changing the hand grabber part to the "joystick" part.) Do something completely different. For example, have the screen pan when the cursor gets close to any of the four edges.
