How do I use an ArrayFixture in FitNesse?

I'm having a hard time getting an array fixture to work. Origanlly the test was written as a rowfixture, Requirements later changed and now the order of the results matters. It seems you have to pass the data into the base arrayfixture constructor but I don't see how that is possible or how you pass arguments into the arrayfixture. If someone has a working example of the fitnesse and fixture code I would really appreciate your posting it.
