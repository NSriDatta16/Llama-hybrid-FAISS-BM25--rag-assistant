One of the most fundamental assumptions in machine learning is that the training data is 'similar' to the test data. Training makes no sense otherwise. So the question is: How similar are reviews of, say, movies and stocks? Maybe somewhat, but not too much. Your movie-trained algorithm would certainly be able to deal with statements like 'This company is awesome' or 'Warning, do not buy this stock'. But what about 'The stock price will explode/implode' or 'Concerning this stock, I am bearish/bullish'? The words explode, implode, bearish and bullish have probably never been expressions of sentiment in movie reviews.
