Caret's preProcess command: How is it working?

I have a questions about how preProcess in the train function is working. I am trying to fit a neural network in the caret package using timeSlices. Here is my code: timeSlices I obviously need to scale/center/normalize the data that is fed into the neural network before training. It says in the caret documentation that, "The function preProcess doesnâ€™t actually pre-process the data. predict.preProcess is used to pre-process this and other data sets", see http://topepo.github.io/caret/pre-processing.html#centering-and-scaling section 3.6. My question is, in the code I have written, does the train function scale it somehow or does it need to be scaled/normalized before it's fed into the train function?
