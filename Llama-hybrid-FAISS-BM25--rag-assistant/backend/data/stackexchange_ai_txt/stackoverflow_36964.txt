@dragonmantank In Xinc's case, I hope you used PEAR to install it. pear list-files xinc/Xinc This should do it, and show you where your Xinc install put its files. So even though Xinc is "just" one big PHP script, it's still spread out into rc scripts and all those other things which are necessary to make an application run. I'm sure you don't need to add all paths listed there, but probably some in order to make it run. Aside from Xinc itself, I think it also needs phpUnit and a bunch of other PEAR libs to run, so what I'd propose is this: pear config-get php_dir And then you need to add that path (like Henrik suggested) to the chroot environment.
