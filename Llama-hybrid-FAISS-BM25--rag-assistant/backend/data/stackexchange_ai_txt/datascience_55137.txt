Blindly Dummy Coding errors in Pandas will introduce irrational numerical relationships between different types of errors and this will not help you in finding true similarity. First and foremost you would like to convert your data into time series data of each router with sampling at equal time steps for each error. 1s for the time steps when the error occurs, 0s for the time step when it doesn't. By this, you convert each router's data into a binary vector for each specific error . Next thing, calculating a Pearson or Spearman correlation between binary vectors is not a good idea. As explained brilliantly here , Correlations arise naturally for some problems involving 0s and 1s, e.g. in the study of binary processes in time or space. On the whole, however, there will be better ways of thinking about such data, depending largely on the main motive for such a study. For example, the fact that correlations make much sense does not mean that linear regression is a good way to model a binary response. You would like to use a similarity metric designed specifically for binary vectors. For example, Jaccard Similarity which computes intersection over union (number of times when both of the vectors were one divided by number of times when either one was) is a good choice. A great summary of such similarity vectors can be found in this article . Calculations involving these similarity calculations won't be computationally intensive. Depending on the sparsity of data, it might be better to do Frequent Itemset Mining so that you know when an error occurs , which routers go down together.
