KFold splitting of time series

I have a fundamental question about train/test split for time series. Let me give a simple example to illustrate my question, which is actually related to a more complex problem. Example Suppose I have the following dataset and I want to learn to predict how fast a worker can perform a task, as given in the column task_duration_minutes : date worker_id task_id task_duration_minutes 2010-01-01 1 1 75 2010-01-01 2 2 75 2010-01-01 3 2 60 2010-01-02 1 1 50 2010-01-03 3 2 45 etc... etc... etc... etc... (I also have a table with features related to the worker_id , and a table with features related to the task_id which I can join on this table, but the worker features and task features are not relevant for the problem.) Note that new workers can have their first task late in this time series, and the duration between tasks is not equal. Hence, it is presumably not the date column that is important but rather the number of times a certain worker has previously done a certain task. Let's feature-engineer the column worker_task_experience to extract that information: date worker_id task_id task_duration_minutes worker_task_experience 2010-01-01 1 1 75 0 2010-01-01 2 2 75 0 2010-01-01 3 2 60 0 2010-01-02 1 1 50 1 2010-01-03 3 2 45 1 etc... etc... etc... etc... etc... Question: How to properly split this dataset for cross validation I see two options: One could view this dataset as a time series for each worker_id and the common practice for time series is to train/test-split as TimeSeriesSplit . However, the target task_duration_minutes is not considered to be dependent on the date , but rather on the worker_task_experience , and hence I can disregard the date column and view this problem as a regular regression problem, for which I can do a regular cross validation using e.g. KFold . As long as I am certain that my features do not contain information about the future, I can't see 2) is not acceptable. What do you think? I am looking forward to your input.
