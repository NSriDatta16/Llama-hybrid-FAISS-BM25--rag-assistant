How to form a SQL query for a one to many relation?

I have two MySQL tables: house and features . This is for a real estate website. house has this structure: id | address | ... some other fields features has this structure: id | house_id | feature | value as you can guess, a house can have multiple features, so a 1:n relationship exists. Now, I'm implementing a search form for houses. I need to filter the results based on the features selected by the user. Sample scenario: get all houses which have the features garage and garden , and a list of features in those houses. What would be the best query to suit my needs? I'm not familiar with JOIN operations, so I need your help! (OPTIONAL) If you can provide a Yii Framework-specific solution, it would be awesome :)
