Is stationarity of data necessary in order to do any statistics?

If we assume we have a stochastic process $X_t$ for which we have, $$\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \mu(t) $$ $$\operatorname{Cov}(X_t,X_s) = \gamma(s,t) $$ where the dependence of the functions on $s,t$ are non-trivial. Is it now impossible to perform any statistical inference, or machine learning on this process, because some of its defining features vary over time? Do these processes with these kind of properties occur often in reality?
