linux command line, password protect file using script

really new to linux scripting so i figured i would ask rather than waste time pulling my hair out. i have a simple script that backs up the contents of a folder on my linux box and moves it to S3 storage, i would like this script to create a zip file and password protect it without any intervention from me. i got it down to zip myarchive.zip /var/www/* -e but cannot work out where i should put the password to stop it prompting me. thanks kris
