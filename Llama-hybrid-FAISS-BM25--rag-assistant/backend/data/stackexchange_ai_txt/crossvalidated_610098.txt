Continous variable vs. Categorical Variable in Random Forest

I have a model where I can either code a predictor variable as a continous variable with the raw values, or as a categorical variable by assigning the values to quartiles. When I run a random forest model with the continous variable, the continous variable comes out as the most important variable in the model. When I run the model with the same variable as a categorical predictor, it becomes much less important to the model. This has implications for interpretation, so I am curious if there is a mechanical reason (i.e., something in the way that random forests fit data) for why this happens. I know the categorcial variable contains less information, but model fit is not significantly improved by the continous version of the variable. I have reason to be catious about using the continous variable because of the quality of the information in the variable.
