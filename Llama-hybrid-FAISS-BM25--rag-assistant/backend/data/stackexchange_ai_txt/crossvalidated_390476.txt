how to leverage confidence intervals of regression to develop predictive model that generates a distribution of outcomes for a single individual

I'm trying to generate a predictive logistic regression model that in some form accounts for the uncertainty in the model's coefficients such that for the same input of predictor variables the outcome variable varies. For example, if I have a model as follows: Train As background: remission_6mo_bool is a two-level factor (0,1) as is Randomized Treatment Group , ANCA , AAV and pred_dose is a continous variable, while baseline_BVAS is a discrete numerical score ranges from 0-63 with a very strong skew toward 0 (e.g., highly non-normal distribution) The model outputs: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.3899 0.3283 0.5760 0.6516 1.0756 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.5419175 1.2751260 1.209 0.2266 `\\`Randomized Treatment Group\\`RTX` 1.1282269 0.5285303 2.135 0.0328 * ANCAPR3 -1.3798677 0.9104766 -1.516 0.1296 AAVMPA -0.3882255 0.9320723 -0.417 0.6770 pred_dose 0.0001030 0.0005594 0.184 0.8539 baseline_BVAS 0.0462253 0.0835449 0.553 0.5801 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 114.19 on 112 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 106.16 on 107 degrees of freedom AIC: 118.16 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 I'm looking for: 1) A statistically correct way on how to leverage the uncertainty of this model (or really any model) such that when used to predict outcomes it doesn't just do so formulaically such that for the same inputs the output is always the same. 2) I'm still quite new to R and statistics, so any short examples or pointers on how to implement (1) would be incredibly helpful. Many thanks!
