Recognising curse words in long recordings with speech recognition in alien language

What would be the right approach to train a convnet to recognise if a given alien curse word was said in a long recording or not ? For example, let's say that there are 1000 audio clips in an alien language, each 20 minute long and somewhere in those 20 minutes an alien curse word can occur ( KCUF ), but it is not known where exactly. It is only known if it occurred or not in a given 20 minute recording. Could deep learning speech recognition systems cope with such a task ? Or is it futile task ? If they could cope, what structure should the deep network have ? A simple convnet ? Or a convet + recurrent net on top ? The reason for asking this : I am wondering if speech recognition could be applied to this Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/melbourne-university-seizure-prediction In particular, I am wondering if this approach would be useful : https://github.com/anlthms/sp-2016 Is there any research done on this topic ? If yes, how can I search for it ? What are the keywords ?
