Instance Weight File XGBoost supports providing each instance an weight to differentiate the importance of instances. For example, if we provide an instance weight file for the "train.txt" file in the example as below: train.txt.weight 1 0.5 0.5 1 0.5 It means that XGBoost will emphasize more on the first and fourth instanceï¼Œ that is to say positive instances while training. The configuration is similar to configuring the group information. If the instance file name is "xxx", XGBoost will check whether there is a file named "xxx.weight" in the same directory and if there is, will use the weights while training models. Important does not always equate with balanced. Dont even set weights, just make sure the problem is balanced, there are a ton of recources on this.
