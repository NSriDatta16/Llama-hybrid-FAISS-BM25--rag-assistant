The Cauchy distribution is best thought of as the uniform distribution on a unit circle, so it would be surprising if averaging made sense. Suppose $f$ were some kind of "averaging function". That is, suppose that, for each finite subset $X$ of the unit circle, $f(X)$ was a point of the unit circle. Clearly, $f$ has to be "unnatural". More precisely $f$ cannot be equivariant with respect to rotations. To obtain the Cauchy distribution in its more usual, but less revealing, form, project the unit circle onto the x-axis from (0,1), and use this projection to transfer the uniform distribution on the circle to the x-axis. To understand why the mean doesn't exist, think of x as a function on the unit circle. It's quite easy to find an infinite number of disjoint arcs on the unit circle, such that, if one of the arcs has length d, then x > 1/4d on that arc. So each of these disjoint arcs contributes more than 1/4 to the mean, and the total contribution from these arcs is infinite. We can do the same thing again, but with x
