Probabilistic approach to the inference on imbalanced data

Let's say we have a classifier, which we trained on some balanced data, and during the inference our data is imbalanced. Is there a way to leverage the information about the distribution of the imbalanced data during the prediction? To be more precise we have the following components: $P(C|X,B)$ - model; $P(C|B)=\frac{1}{|C|}$ ; $P(C)$ - dist. of classes, where $C$ - classes; $X$ - features; $B$ - data is balnaced What we are looking for is the distribution $P(C|X)$ . I was trying to juggle the chain rule and the Bayes theorem to obtain $P(C|X)$ from the three components above somehow, but I failed. So the question is: Is it possible to express $P(C|X)$ in terms of $P(C|X,B)$ , $P(C|B)$ and $P(C)$ ? If it is not straightforward, what additionally we would need to have to be able to calculate $P(C|X)$ ?
