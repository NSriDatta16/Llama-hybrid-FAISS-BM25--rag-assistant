I've done something similar for a [R]-Smalltalk-interface last year and went about it more generic to be able to pass all data back-and-forth by using byte-arrays: In C i have: DLLIMPORT void getLengthOfNextMessage(byte* a); DLLIMPORT void getNextMessage(byte* a); In R: getLengthOfNextMessage I have commented-out the use of the functions getNumberOfMessages() and confirmReceived() which are specific to the problem i had to solve (multiple back-and-forth communication). Essentially, the code uses the argument byte-array to transfer the information, first the 4-byte-long length-info, then the actual data. This seems less elegant (even to me) than to use structs, but i found it to be more generic and i can hook into any dll, transfering any datatype.
