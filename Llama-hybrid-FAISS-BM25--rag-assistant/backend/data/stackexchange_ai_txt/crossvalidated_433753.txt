Does max-pooling increase the receptive field?

I'm new in deep learning. when applying convolution on the image , the receptive field is increased but when applying max pooling on the image, I don't know the receptive field is increasing or keep for example there's an image that has a shape (11,11) when applying convolution that has filters shape (3,3), stride=1 on the image, the output receptive field has 3 but when apply max pooling on the image, I don't know whether the receptive field is 1 or 3. please Somebody tell me the answer. thank you!
