Don't try to create your own, call locknow(); DevicePolicyManager mDPM; mDPM = (DevicePolicyManager)getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE); mDPM.lockNow(); There's a bunch of checking you need to do to gain this sort of access, and to make sure the device can be locked. You'll also need to request the correct permission. DevicePolicyManager DeviceAdminSample.java
