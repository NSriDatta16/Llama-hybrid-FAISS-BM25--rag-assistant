Hadley, you say it's necessary to remove all references to your own work. Is that really the case? At a certain career stage, the absence of a set of citations could very well give away the identity of the author! I will betray my old-fart status by advising you to ignore those who advise using the active voice. Changing "Hadley (2009) showed that the sky is blue" to "The sky is blue (Hadley 2009)" is a simple solution to the problem of "I" (and "we" and "some of us" and "some of us, plus others") in technical writing. And it has an additional bonus: it focusses attention on the matter at hand, not on the people involved. You want the reader's internal eye to see that broad sweep of azure, not your avatar ;-)
