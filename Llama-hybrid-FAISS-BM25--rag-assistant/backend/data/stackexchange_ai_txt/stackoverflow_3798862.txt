Using Jquery, How do I submit a form that was created with AJAX?

I have a 2 part form. The 1st form is submitted via $.post and (if all goes right), is replaced by a dynamically generated form from php. The idea behind this being that the 1st form creates an entry and the number of related images for said item. A new form is generated to upload said images. My problem is that my newly generated form is not getting processed. If submit the form via the old onClick="" function, the dynamically generated file fields are ignored. I'm pretty new to Jquery/AJAX, so I may not be doing this correctly, but how can I get Jquery to pay attention to my 2nd (dynamically generated) form? 1st Form: Add Inventory Add Inventory Form Layout Table Price Manufacturer Model Serial Number Year Size (Dimensions) Bedrooms Bathrooms Range Type Siding Type Roof Type Furnace Type Features &amp; Benefits Number of Pictures Jquery handler: $(document).ready( function(){ $("#addinventorybutton").click( function(){ $("#actiontotake").val("Add Home"); var dta = $("#addinv").serialize(); $.post("admin_process.php",dta,function(data){ $("div#form").html(data); }); return false; }); $("#addnewpicturesbutton").click( function(){ $("#actiontotake").val("Add Picture"); AddPic(); return false; }); }); 2nd Form (via PHP & AJAX call): Add Associated Images \n"); } ?> ">
