You want your UI to be consistent, whatever the particular state. A lot of users rely on visual memory to remember the location of commands. Having to search for particular action every time is too much effort and is drawing the users attention from their main work in the app. Thus, it's best to show the action to keep it in the visual context. However, visibly indicate that the state of this action is modified. This will give the user feedback that the action exist while still suggesting some condition needs to be met to allow the user to undertake the command. Changing the color saturation is the most common approach to representing the disabled state. It makes the UI element to fade out in the background.
