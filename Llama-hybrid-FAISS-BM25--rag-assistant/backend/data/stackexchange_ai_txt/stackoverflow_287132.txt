Take a look at C.R.A.P. -- it combines coverage with complexity analysis. There is a Crap4J implementation if you are Java. We have been putting together a Crap4Net that we blogged about here: http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/insertqualityhere/archive/2008/03/28/crap4j-port-to-net.aspx The idea is that you get good numbers if you have small simple methods or if the more complex ones have good coverage.
