What would be the alternative to the Dirichlet distribution but parametrized by mean and variance?

Let's assume that I have some measurements about the total mass of certain compound. These measurements are very accurate so let's assume that the mass is just 1 (unit) in each case. Then I know that the compound consists of some $s$ fractions $x_i, i=1,...,s$ that have been measured with some error. Naturally $\sum_{i=1}^s x_i = 1$ and $x_i \geq 0$. I'm just given what are the (estimated) mean and variance of each $x_i$. No information about the correlation is provided. Also, sometimes the mean and variance may be more like "educated guesses". Anyway, I would like to model the predictive uncertainty in these fractions so that it is taken into account in a Bayesian predictive posterior of a certain model with parameters estimated using MCMC. In addition to parameter uncertainty I want to take into account the uncertainty in these fractions (as input for the model). This Bayesian stuff is very familiar to me but I was wondering how could the uncertainty in the fractions be modeled. The first idea was Dirichlet distribution as it is defined in the simplex given by the constraints above but if I fix the means then there is essentially just one parameter left for setting the variances so that they would match well with the given values. Also I can't really control the correlations (though such information is not available to me). Then there are also Generalized Dirichlet distribution and multivariate logistic normal distribution but they don't seem to have analytical solutions for the first two moments or it's not easy to generate random samples from them. The current "quick and dirty" solution is based on Gaussian distribution but the fractions can sometimes become negative that causes problems. So my question is that is there some other more or less common distribution that could be used to model this uncertainty (at least at some rough scale so that the given means and variances approximately match and some sensible correlation structure exists)?
