Install custom Outlook 2003 form in user's Personal Form Library

We've developed a custom Outlook 2003 form based on ipmNote. I need a way to push this to all the other users in the organization. At the same time we'll also be installing a custom Add-in built with VSTO so we could do the form install as part of that. Currently I can't use the Organizational Forms Library, because the exchange admins don't want to turn on public folders.
