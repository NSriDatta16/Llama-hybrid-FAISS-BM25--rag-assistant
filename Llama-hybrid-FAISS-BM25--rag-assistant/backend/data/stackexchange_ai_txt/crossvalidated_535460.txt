Note the Usage section of the help page to ?glm : glm(formula, family = gaussian, ... That is, the default value of the family parameter is gaussian . By default, glm() fits a "normal" regression with a conditional normal distribution. And of course, fits from such a model can be negative. To run a logistic regression, replace your command with model $outcome ~ data$ f1 + data $f2 + data$ f3, family=binomial)
