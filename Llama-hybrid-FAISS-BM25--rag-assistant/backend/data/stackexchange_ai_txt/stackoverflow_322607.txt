scripts embedded in images

I run a small browser MMO, and I have a problem where a couple users are embedding scripts into their profile images, and using them to make attacks against said users, and my game in general. Is there a way to protect against this, or do I need to start blocking people from being able to use their own custom images? If it helps any, it's done in PHP/MySQL.
