I do it like this, inside my class which is used for paged criteria access: // In order to be able to determine the NumberOfItems in a efficient manner, // we'll clone the Criteria that has been given, and use a Projection so that // NHibernate will issue a SELECT COUNT(*) against the ICriteria. ICriteria countQuery = CriteriaTransformer.TransformToRowCount (_criteria); NumberOfItems = countQuery.UniqueResult (); Where NumberOfItems is a property (with a private setter) inside my ' PagedCriteriaResults ' class. The PagedCriteriaResults class takes an ICriteria instance in its constructor.
