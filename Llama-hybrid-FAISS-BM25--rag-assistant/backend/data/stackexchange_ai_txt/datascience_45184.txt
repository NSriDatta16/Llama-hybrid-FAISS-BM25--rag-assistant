Data weight averaging

say I have 2 datasets and need to get an average but with a weight based on the number of students. school 1 = 98.1 . (50 students) School 2 = 95.4 . (169 students) How would i get the average of both with a weighted average reflected the average of the student totals i think it would be around = 96.ish thanks for any insight!
