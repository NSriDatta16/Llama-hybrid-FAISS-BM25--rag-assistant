Following a Dynamic Score

I have little to no formal discrete math training, and have run into a wee bit of an issue. I am trying to write an agent which reads in a human player's (arbitrary) score and scores a point every so often. The agent needs to "lag behind" and "catch up" every so often, so that the human player believes there is some competition going on. Then, the agent must either win or lose (depending on the condition) against the human. I have tried a few different techniques, including a wonky probabilistic loop (which failed horribly). I was thinking that this problem calls for something like an emission Hidden Markov Model (HMM), but I'm not sure how to implement it (or even whether this is the best approach). I have a gist up, but again, it sucks. I hope the __main__ function provides some insight as to the goal of this agent. It is going to be called in pygame.
