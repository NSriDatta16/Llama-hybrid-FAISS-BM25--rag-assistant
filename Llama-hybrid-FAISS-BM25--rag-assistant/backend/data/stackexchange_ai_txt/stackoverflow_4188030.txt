Technically any of these can be used, but you are more likely to see jpeg in use in the wild. Because the steganography is a basically introducing imperfections in the image to hide a message, the imperfections will be less noticeable in an already lossy format, whereas if you had some off pixels in a bitmapped image, one is more likely to notice the discrepancy. Your question about being lossy only applies if someone tries to resave the image. For example if I opened your image with a secret message hidden in it in photoshop and then saved it back out as a jpeg, the image would likely change and destroy your message. This is not the case when sending a file via e-mail or the web (except in the case of some ISPs that implement jpeg compression to speed up browsing speeds for slower connections like dialup).
