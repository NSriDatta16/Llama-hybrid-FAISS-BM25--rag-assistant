Linear regression: R-squared and predicted response

On a business task, I perform simple linear regression with an independent variable $X$ and a dependent variable $Y$. The result is a linear function with slope $β_1$. If $R^2$ (coefficient of determination) = 1, I conclude that an increase of 1 in $X$ will result in an increase of $β_1$ in $Y$. If $R^2$ = 0, I conclude that an increase of 1 in $X$ will on average result in an increase of 0 in $Y$. Are my conclusions correct? If $R^2 = 0.5$, can I conclude that an increase of 1 in $X$ will on average result in an increase of $0.5β_1$ in $Y$? If 2. is incorrect, is there a way to infer such a relationship from a linear regression model («an increase of 1 in $X$ will on average result in an increase of ... in $Y$»)?
