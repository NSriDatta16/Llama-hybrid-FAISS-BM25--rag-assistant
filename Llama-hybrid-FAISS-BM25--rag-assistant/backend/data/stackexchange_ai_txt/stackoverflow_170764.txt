Will a PHP session only be created if a browser is requesting the page? Short answer : Yes. Sessions were created specifically to solve the HTTP stateless problem by leveraging browser features. APC, memcached, DB, etc. don't matter. Those are just storage methods for the session, and will suffer from the same problem. Longer answer : The concept of sessions were created to account for the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol, and it turns out that state's pretty important for a wide variety of software applications. The most common way of implementing sessions is with cookies. PHP sends the session ID in a cookie, and the browser sends the cookie with the session ID back. This ID is used on the server to find whatever information you've stored in the session. PHP has the capacity to include and read a session ID at the end of a URLs, but this assumes that users will navigate to pages on your site/application by clicking links that include a generated session ID. In your specific case, it is possible to use cookies with curl (and possibly wget). Curl is a web browser, just one without a GUI. If it's the command line curl program you're using (as opposed to the C library, PHP extension,etc.) read up on the following options -b/--cookie -c/--cookie-jar -j/--junk-session-cookies
