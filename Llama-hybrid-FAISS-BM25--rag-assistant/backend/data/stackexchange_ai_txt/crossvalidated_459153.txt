From your work with z-scores, it seems clear than you want to find $P(45 where $\bar X$ is the mean of a sample of size $n = 60$ from an exponential distribution with mean $\mu = 50,$ rate $\lambda = 1/50 = 0.02.$ Normal approximation. You can get a useful rough approximation by assuming that $\bar X$ is approximately normally distributed. It is true that $E(\bar X) = 50,\,$ $Var(\bar X) = \sigma^2/n = 50^2/60 = 41.67,\,$ and $SD(\bar X) =6.455.$ If it were exactly true that $\bar X \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu=50, \sigma =6.455),$ then $P(45 according to the following computation in R. (Your method of standardizing and using printed tables of the standard normal CDF will get very nearly the same answer, if you use the results of the table properly.) diff(pnorm(c(45,60), 50, 6.455)) [1] 0.7200416 The Central Limit Theorem provides accurate results for sufficiently large $n.$ However, the mean of $n=60$ exponential observations is still noticeably skewed to the right. A normal approximation would work better for the mean of a sample twice as large. Exact computation using a gamma distribution. An exact solution is available, as follows. One can show that $\bar X/\mu \sim \mathsf{Gamma}(n, n),$ so $P(0.9 = 45/50 according to the following computation in R. diff(pgamma(c(.9, 1.2), 60, 60) [1] 0.7090068 Simulating the sum of exponential observations. Also, the following simulation of a million averages of 60 such exponential random variables gives the same answer, within the margin of simulation error. (The simulation should be accurate to two or three decimal places.) set.seed(2020) # for reproducibility a = replicate(10^6, mean(rexp(60,1/50))) mean(45 Below is a histogram of simulated values of $\bar X/50$ along with the density function (black) of its exact gamma distribution and the density function (broken red) of its approximate normal distribution $\mathsf{Norm}(50/50, 6.455/50).$ (The gamma distribution is slightly right-skewed and the normal distribution is symmetrical.)
