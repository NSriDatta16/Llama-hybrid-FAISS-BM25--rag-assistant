approach for comparing two groups of frequency distributions

I need to test if there is a difference in frequency distribution of a variable between two groups of subjects. Each subject is characterized by a list of values, from which a frequency distribution can be constructed. To be more clear, each subject is an animal, and I measure several hundred cells per animal; there is a value associated with each cell. I then create a frequency distribution for each subject/animal (all possible values of the variable are divided into bins, and fraction of cells within each bin is calculated). I need to determine if there are any differences in the shape of the frequency distribution between two groups of animals. If I had to compare two animals with each other (simply two frequency distributions), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test seems to be appropriate. But the problem is that I need to compare two groups of animals . In other words, there is some variability among individual subjects within one group, and there is uncertainty regarding true average frequency distribution of this population of subjects, which I feel I need to capture. What would be the proper statistical test/approach to do this? To illustrate the data, here are some sample graphs, individual frequency distributions for 4 subjects from each group, and mean frequency distributions with error bars (s.e.m.) Once again, the research question is - are there any statistically significant differences in the distributions of values between groups? Less formally, does the red group have more cells with higher values, is there a shift to the right in the values? (because these are percentages of values, the total area under each curve is 100%).
