How about making an IE specific stylesheet and in it declare something like * { font-weight: regular; } It's usually not advised to use the * selector, so try to narrow it down to wherever the font is used. For example, perhaps it's just paragraph text: p { font-weight: regular; } , or just links: a {...;} etc. etc. Good luck!
