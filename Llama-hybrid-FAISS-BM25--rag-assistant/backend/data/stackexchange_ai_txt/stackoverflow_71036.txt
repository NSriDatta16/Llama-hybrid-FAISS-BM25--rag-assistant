SCRUM - non cooperative team members

What do you do if members of your team are not cooperative during scrum meetings? They either provide a very high level definition of what they are currently working on, ("working on feature x"), or go into extremely irrelevant details, in spite of being well educated in SCRUM methodology . This causes the scrum meeting to be ineffective and boring. As a scrum master, what are your techniques to getting the best out of people during the meeting? Edited to add: What technique do you use to stop someone who is talking too much, without being offensive? What technique do you use to encourage someone to provide a more detailed answer? How do you react when you find yourself being the only one who listens, while other team members just sit there and maybe even fall asleep?
