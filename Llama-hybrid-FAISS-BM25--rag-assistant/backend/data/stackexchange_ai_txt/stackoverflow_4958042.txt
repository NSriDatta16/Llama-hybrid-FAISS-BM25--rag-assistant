It seems as if the JSTL is either not reading or outputting UTF-8 data correctly. I found several reports of issues with UTF-8 data and JSTL transforms, but not a lot of solutions. I did find this page describing a similar problem with JSTL and UTF-8 support . The solution was to switch transformers and use Saxon.
