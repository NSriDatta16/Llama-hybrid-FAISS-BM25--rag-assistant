It shouldn't matter what lxml.etree outputs as long as it's valid XML. If you really want to, you can glue strings together: ' \n' + etree.tostring(root, pretty_print = True, encoding = 'ASCII') It's unclear why you want to remove it, since ultimately XML needs to know what charset it's in to make sense of anything. The XML 1.0 spec includes a method of guessing charsets, and seems to encourage the use of encoding declarations: In the absence of [external information], it is a fatal error ... for an entity which begins with neither a Byte Order Mark nor an encoding declaration to use an encoding other than UTF-8. ... Unless an encoding is determined by a higher-level protocol, it is also a fatal error if an XML entity contains no encoding declaration and its content is not legal UTF-8 or UTF-16.
