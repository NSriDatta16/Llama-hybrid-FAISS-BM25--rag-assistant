I would say it is bad practice. You should be coming up with more meaningful class names and ids that apply directly to your markup and then have those "use" things such as span-2 and last . This can be done using blueprint's compress.rb . Details on using that can be found here: http://jdclayton.com/blueprints_compress_a_walkthrough.html In particular to what you are talking about, you should be paying attention to the "semantic_classes" part.
