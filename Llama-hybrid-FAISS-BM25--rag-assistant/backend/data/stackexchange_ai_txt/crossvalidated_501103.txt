XGBoost best tree path

I observed something that I could not make sense. Best tree inside the model uses same feature twice in a row. But the the thing I did not get is that: The first condition implies second condition. I attaching the screenshot. Just observe the "yes,missing" path of "f40" you will see what I mean. Thanks a lot
