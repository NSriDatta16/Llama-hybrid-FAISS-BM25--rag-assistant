Since it’s been five years, I will post some speculation, even though I lack a proof. I would think the answer is in the negative. In GLMs other than linear regression, the idea of a "linear" estimator does not make sense to me. If we drop the linearity condition from the Gauss-Markov theorem, depending on what error distribution there is, the usual OLS solution might not be the BUE (best, possibly nonlinear, unbiased estimator). Further, the typical maximum likelihood estimation methods in GLMs (I’m thinking of logistic regression) can give biased estimates. If we relax our assumption just to require consistency, then we know maximum likelihood estimation to have nice properties about efficiency among consistent estimators, and then this is almost a tautology. “Is my GLM maximum likelihood estimator the most efficient consistent estimator?” YES! That’s part of the deal with maximum likelihood estimation and why it is a popular approach.
