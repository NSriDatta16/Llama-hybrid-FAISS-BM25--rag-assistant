It might not be relevant for @MrJames anymore but my answer might help others. Have a look at "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting" by Brockwell and Davis (third edition). Here they say that a stationary solution of $\Phi(L)y_t=z_t$ exists and is unique if and only if $\Phi$ has no roots on the unit circle. It is causual if all roots of $\Phi$ are outside the unit circle. Hence, causality implies stationarity but not the other way around.
