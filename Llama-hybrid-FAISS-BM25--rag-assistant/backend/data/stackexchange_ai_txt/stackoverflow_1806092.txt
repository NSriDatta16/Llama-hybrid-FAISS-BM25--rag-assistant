How to truncate text until "more" link is clicked?

I have a long series of paragraphs and I'd like to trim each down to 2 lines (50 characters) and when you click a link "more" it will show the full paragraph. I am using the prototype library and rails. I'd ideally like to do this with out breaking the paragraph into 2 divs and showing the other when you click on more. Or is that the only way?
