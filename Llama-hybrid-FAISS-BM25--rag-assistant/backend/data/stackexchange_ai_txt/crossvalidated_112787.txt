I would suggest princpal component analysis (or the closely related principal coordinates analysis, PCO). PCA decovnvolves a high dimensional dataset (where here each gene can be thought of as a dimension) into a smaller number of dimensions, while still retaining as much of the variance as possible from the origianl data set. The first principal component of a dataset will explain the largest fraction of the variance. You can then look at the "loadings" of that component to look at what genes are contributing to it. The genes with the highest absolute loadings will be those with the pattern that distinguish best between samples. You would do the PCA in R with: pca Remember to put your genes along the columns and your samples down the rows. weightings will now contain the weightings for the first princple component, and selecting the entries in weightings with the largest absolute values will tell you which genes are contributing most. An alternative would be to do a bi-clustering of the data, and selecting those genes that look like the drive the clustering of the samples.
