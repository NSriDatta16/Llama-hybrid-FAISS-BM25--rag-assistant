Example of a 2D dataset and a classifier stuck at local minimum

We always hear about neural networks getting stuck at local minima, but I cannot visualize one. Can you please give me some examples? I am not looking for something like below picture and a neural network with only one neuron. Obviously, in this case the (linear) decision boundary will end up being in one of the two locations. I would classify this problem as underfitting rather than getting stuck at local minimum.
