Enum or Dict? Which would help me here?

I have a winform data entry and retrieval program called CaseNotes. This has a form that that fill in. On the form there are multiple dropdown,checkbox controls that I are data-bound to a tblCNMaintItem. The structure of that table is --> ItemID | CategoryID | ItemDescription | OrderID | IsActive There is a seperate Category table that provides that categoryID's. A CategoryID maps to a Single Control on the Case Notes Form. My question is two-fold: How should I go about getting the value for each item? As in, I grab the itemDescription by CategoryID to populate the controls but on SaveNewCaseNote() I need to get the corresponding ItemID instead. How can I accomplish this? Should I create a dictonary for each category(Control)? Should I Enumerate the ItemID/ItemDescription combo? EDIT Forget #2 as I have found my answer. Thanks! EDIT Okay, for some reason I have failed to state this clearly and it is generating confusion. My DB consists of 3 tables. tblCaseNotes , tblCNMaintCategory , tblCNMaintItem . CaseNotes contains a complete "Case Note" per row. The Maint tables are for the multiple choice answers when filling out a CaseNote. Example: They must select a "Contact Location". The options "Office" or "Member's Home". In tblCNMaintCategory there is a enntry like so--> CategoryID = 3, CatgoryName = Contact Location, IsActive = True In tblCNMaintItem there are 2 entries like so --> ItemID=51, CategoryID=2, ItemDescription=Office, OrderID=0, IsActive=True ItemID=52, CategoryID=2, ItemDescription=Member's Home, OrderID=0, IsActive=True In tblCaseNote there would be an entry like so --> CaseNoteID=3243, PersonID=454676, AssocContactLocations= 51, and then many more columns following same pattern Question 1 is pertaining to wanting to store the ItemID in AssocContactLocation versus the ItemDescription. I am thinking a Dictionary cLocateItems(itemDescription,itemID) maybe... Does this help? Thanks everyone for the time and effort!
