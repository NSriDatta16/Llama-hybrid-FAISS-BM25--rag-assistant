What about Linq to Object? String mainString="///BUY/SELL///ORDERTIME///RT///QTY///BROKERAGE///NETRATE///AMOUNTRS///RATE///SCNM///"; String searchTerm = "RT"; String[] src = mainString.split('///'); var match = from word in src where word.ToLowerInvariant() == searchTerm.ToLowerInvariant() select word; I don't have VS near me so I can't test it, but it should be something similar to this.
