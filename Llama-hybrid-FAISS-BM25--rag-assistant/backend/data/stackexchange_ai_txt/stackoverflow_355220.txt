Defining const values in C

I have a C project where all code is organized in *.c / *.h file pairs, and I need to define a constant value in one file, which will be however also be used in other files. How should I declare and define this value? Should it be as static const ... in the *.h file? As extern const ... in the *.h file and defined in the *.c file? In what way does it matter if the value is not a primitive datatype ( int , double , etc), but a char * or a struct ? (Though in my case it is a double .) Defining stuff inside *.h files doesn't seem like a good idea generally; one should declare things in the *.h file, but define them in the *.c file. However, the extern const ... approach seems inefficient, as the compiler wouldn't be able to inline the value, it instead having to be accessed via its address all the time. I guess the essence of this question is: Should one define static const ... values in *.h files in C, in order to use them in more that one place?
