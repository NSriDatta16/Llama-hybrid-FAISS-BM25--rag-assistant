Interpretation of a difference-in-difference model

I am running a basic difference-in difference (DiD) model. I would like to explain the effect of increasing the price of fares for students only. I use DiD with adults as a control group. I have monthly data of tickets sold for each category. To avoid seasonality I have data before treatment, that is from April 2021 - December 2021 and after treatment. It started the 1st of April, so the post-periods are from April 2022 - December 2022. Can I do DiD like this? When I did a calculation by hand (not modelled), I realized that the ratio of students/adults was 0,518 before treatment and 0,35 after the treatment. I calculated that the decrease that the treatment meant for students was around 31%. I calculated that with an assumption that the ratio before would stay the same because with DiD I presumed that the only thing that changed is the TREATMENT. Also, I calculated how much demand for adults went up, it was around 81%, while the students went up only 21,4 %. So, I used the same logic, what is the difference between the counterfactual when the students would rise 81% too and the real state of world. Then, I ran a DiD model using the standard lm() model using no other predictors, all the averages of the groups stayed the same as expected. But, when I calculated the counterfactual to know how many students would be there if there was no intervention, it gives me a way higher number. In the DiD analysis, the demand went lower by 50% and not 31%. How is this possible? The DiD counterfactual somehow presumes that the students should increase the demand even more! Why? This is how the data look: And here my dif in dif results: Thanks for your help! Ratio of students to adults:
