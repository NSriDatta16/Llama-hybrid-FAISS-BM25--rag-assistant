For an agile project it is important to have a 'Definition of done'. This is a small check list of things that need to be done in order to class something as complete. It is not unusual to have different levels of done: User Story - This could include things such as all tasks associated with the US must be complete, All code is checked in and building successfully with passing unit tests, Acceptance testing has been completed. Sprint - This could include things such as all stories for the sprint are 'done' (see above, a retrospective has be held, the product owner has seen a demonstration of the functionality etc. etc. Release sprint - the development of the previous series of sprints has been successfully integrated and regression tested, the functionality has been released into the live environment. In terms of the 4 options it is less clear cut. A lot is said and has been written about what should and should not be done around failing the sprint, extending the sprint and excluding some feature or other. I find the that with agile projects a lot of pragmatism is required, especially in the first few sprints. The important thing is not to get hung up it. Just learn from it, adapt and move on.
