How to organize output table of grouped summary statics of multiple statistics across multiple variables?

Currently my output stems from the follow code: echo_sum % group_by(sercs_studyg) %>% summarise(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = list(median = ~ median(.x,na.rm = TRUE), iqr= ~IQR(.x,na.rm = TRUE), n = ~length(.x)), groups = 'keep')) This gives the following output: As you can see I have a variable for the group, and each variable now has 3 statistics: Median, IQR, and N. (sercs_ejct = sercs_ejct_median, sercs_ejct_iqr, and sercs_ejct_n). I'm curious if I can create a gt table where the study group (column 1) is a spanner column label, and the median, IQR, and N are column labels, and the variable name (sercs_ejct,...) is the row name. I'm not sure if I need to approach generating the output in a different way to achieve the desired outcome, or first manipulate the output using a pivot_longer or something along those lines.
