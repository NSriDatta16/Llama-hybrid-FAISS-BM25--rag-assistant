How to calculate volatility using ARCH and GARCH model

I'm conducting a thesis about the impact of COVID-19 to stock market.. I use the ARCH and GARCh model to compare the volatility of the stock market during the pandemic. I also use the dummy variable of daily cases and death cases of COVID-19 to check the effect on the stock market. But I'm not sure, how to conduct it because i actually don't really understand this topic time series analysis :( and did the data should be the daily price or the stock return?
