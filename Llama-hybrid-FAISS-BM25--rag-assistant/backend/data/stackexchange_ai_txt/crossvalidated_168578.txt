This question and excellent exchange was the impetus for creating the predictInterval function in the merTools package. predictInterval is designed to use the arm::sim functions to generate distributions of parameters in the model and then to use those distributions to generate simulated values of the response given the newdata provided by the user. It's simple to use -- all you would need to do is: library(merTools) preds You can specify a whole host of other values to predictInterval including setting the interval for the prediction intervals, choosing whether to report the mean or median of the distribution, and choosing whether or not to include the residual variance from the model. It's not a full prediction interval because the variability of the theta parameters in the lmer object are not included, but all of the other variation is captured through this method, giving a pretty decent approximation. merTools also allows you to easily construct simulated scenarios for analysis. For example, if you wanted to compute the effect of changing a level of a factor variable for the average observation you could do this: subExample Check out the package vignettes here and here to learn more.
