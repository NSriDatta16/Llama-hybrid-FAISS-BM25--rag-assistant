You are close, but off the mark. While "long-term" and "short-term" are new to me (indeed, they seem to be specific to this site and might as well come with a trademark!) I can tell you that you seem to be calculating the whole-sample variance degrees of freedom (LT) and the anova denominator degrees of freedom (ST), which could also be described as the mean squared error (MSE) degrees of freedom. To be clear, the values of $n_i$ are the number of measurements in group $i$ , not the actual measurements . The total number of measurements $n$ of data acquired from $J$ groups is $$n=\sum_{i=1}^J n_i.$$ The LT degrees of freedom seems to be $n-1$ , which would be the number used in the unbiased estimate of the whole-sample variance $$s^2=\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^n(x_k-\bar{x})^2.$$ Here the $x_k$ does correspond to the actual data, and $\bar{x}$ is the whole-sample mean, sometimes called the grand mean. The short-term degrees of freedom correspond to $n-J$ , which is the total number of points acquired minus the number of groups (or treatments) $J$ . This would be the degrees of freedom used in calculating the variance within treatments for the group-wise model. $$ MSE = \frac{1}{n-J} \sum_{i=1}^J \sum_{k=1}^{n_i} \left( x_k^{(i)}-\bar{x}^{(i)} \right)^2, $$ where $i$ is the index for $J$ treatments or groups, $x_k^{(i)}$ is the $k$ -th data point in group $i$ , and $\bar{x}^{(i)}$ is the sample mean of the $i$ -th group. This would be the denominator of the F test of equal means of $J% groups, and $ n-J$ would be the denominator degrees of freedom. I see that the Minitab page uses $\mu$ to describe a sample average. Argh! This is highly non-standard notation. Greek letters are (nearly-universally) reserved for population parameters, not sample statistics. The (nearly-universally) recognized notation for a sample statistic is the Roman letter. In this case, the sample average is $\bar{x}.$ Hopefully you are not confused by this nonstandard notation. Population parameters are only ever estimated by sample statistics. They themselves are not statistics, at all.
