Crystal reports 2008 report writing

Hi I'm trying to write my first report!!! and have number of question I cant seem to find the answer to can anyone help me please! Q1. i drag a DB field on the the report which is a string format and need to divide the value by 1024 and display the result. I know i need to use tonumber({fieldname}] but don't know where or how to add this and then do the division. how do I do it? Q2. on the report I have a group in its header I have the items that display across the report. in the detail I have the fields of a table that relate to above line. all good so far! How do add another Group or section that would allow another collection of data relating to the same first line! as I see it I need to add another group with another detail section but I can't do this! Hope this make some sort of sense! thanks
