Disable webOS Phone Links

I once had a problem where Safari for iPhone would add phone links to my HTML. This would break my code because it depended on the text value of . Before: 8211812 After: 8211812 So i added the magical meta fix for IE iPhone Safari. Safari Dev Center: Phone LInks And that solved the problem. But then came along the Palm Pre webOS with Safari. Now I'm having the some problem and the above fix does not work. I assumed that being based off Safari/AppleWebKit it would follow the same rules. I guess not. I've looked for a developer reference for Palm Pre webOS phone links but cannot find a solution.
