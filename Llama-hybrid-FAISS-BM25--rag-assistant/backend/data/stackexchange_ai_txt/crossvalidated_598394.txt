Visualize LSTM for time series sequential data

I am trying to visualize LSTM that is applied to sequential data available here: https://its-ml.de/index.php/plattscaling/ There are 25 features with 50 sequence length. LSTM layer 1 has 100 cells, LSTM layer 2 has 50 cells with droput as 0.2. The output/dense layer has 1 cell which contains a single value. This can be visualized as shown in figure below: I am trying to connect the features with respective LSTM layers by referring Fig. 2 as as shown here: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-reshape-data-and-do-regression-for-time-series-using-lstm-133dad96cd00 However, from cell-51 in LSTM layer-1, there is no input coming from the feature because the sequence length itself is 50. What is the input for cell-51 in LSTM layer-1? Also, how is LSTM1, LSTM2 and output layers connected? How do we represent the dropout as 0.2 in this figure? What will be the dimensions of hidden and cell state in Layer1 (H,C) and layer2 (h,c) ? Can somebody please help me out in visualizing this network?
