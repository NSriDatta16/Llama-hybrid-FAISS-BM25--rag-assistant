LINQ to SQL Stored Procedure. Exception says it times out but it is not timing out

Website using .NET Framework v3.5, SQL Server 2008, written in C# I have a stored procedure which I have added to my DBML by dragging it across from the server explorer. In it's properties it returns Auto-generated type. The procedure takes System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Timeout expired. This didn't always happen for this one input! It used to also work fine when called from the code. The last time it didn't work I deleted and re-added the same stored procedure to the DBML. This "fixed" it, and that input ran fine and in the same time as all the others. However this is not an adequate fix! It has happened again and I can't keep deleting and re-adding as required. I made no changes to the data that's being returned during the point at which it was "fixed", so I can't think what the problem could be. Any help on this would be much appreciated!
