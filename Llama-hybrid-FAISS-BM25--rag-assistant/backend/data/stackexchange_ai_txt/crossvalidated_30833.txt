I understand from the context of your question that some measurements are biased (since you can get erroneous data), so the summary will be biased. As far as I am aware, the theoretical framework of linear regression, PCA and factorial analysis assumes unbiased records, so their properties might be different in your case. For that reason, I would use robust methods, that are not overly influenced by outliers. Robust linear regression has been worked out some time ago, and is readily available in R. The easiest is the function rlm in the package MASS , which is used like the non robust function lm . After a quick Google search, it seemed to me that robust methods for PCA and factorial analysis are still in development and much more difficult to use. If you are an R user, you can have a look at the document of rrcov and robCompositions . I am a great fan of PCA, but here I would recommend the easiest, at least for a start, which is your method (1) with robust regression.
