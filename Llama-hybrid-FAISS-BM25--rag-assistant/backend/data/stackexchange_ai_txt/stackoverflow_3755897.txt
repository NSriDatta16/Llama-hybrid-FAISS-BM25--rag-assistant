Most of your requirements are handled by most modern database engines (althout concurrency management is not exactly the same among all databases). But to choose the database(s) that would suit you best you should give more precise informations: "Multiple users". How many concurrent connections? 10? 100? 1000? 10000? 100000? More? "More than one user should be able add new records at one time". How many inserts per hour? Is this an OLTP database, or a DW one? "Capable of storing huge amount of data". How many tables? How many rows? How many fields? What's the average row size? Do you need LOB support? How many indexes? "Users can be able to edit their own records". How often? How many? How long? Some databases have better locking mechanism than others. "Unicode enabled". Which flavour? UTF-8? UTF-16? "All records will be string". Which is the maximum string length you need? Hope they are "natural" string fields - storing non-natural string data in string fields usually lower performance.
