Updating to an answer so that the question can be marked answered. Most likely it is refering to a test reliability score like Cronbach's alpha. If you average several scores then you have to make sure that the scores correlate, otherwise one would sum random scores resulting in an average of 0. The reliability score reflects this correlation.
