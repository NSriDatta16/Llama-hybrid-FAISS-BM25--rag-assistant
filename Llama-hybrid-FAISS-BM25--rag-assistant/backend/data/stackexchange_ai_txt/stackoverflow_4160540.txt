The average number of posts per second is just 1/interval from last posting, so make a vector of diff(times) and then take mean(1/as.numeric(diff(times))). > posts mean( 1/as.numeric(diff(posts$time)) ) [1] 0.03545346 Edit: I thought that by using cumsum I would get the time series ordered, but that was not the case, so it's amended to take abs(rnorm(100) ).
