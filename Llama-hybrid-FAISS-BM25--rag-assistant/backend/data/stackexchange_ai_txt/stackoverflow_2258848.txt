I think what you want is a macro and not an environment. Here's what I use all the time. Macro definition: \def\remark#1{\marginpar{\raggedright\hbadness=10000 \def\baselinestretch{0.8}\tiny \it #1\par}} Sample use: \remark{Interesting comparisons with the internal language of \citet{harper:type-theoretic}} I've done variations for some coauthors, e.g., the \remark leaves a tiny fixed-width diamond in the text that it marks.
