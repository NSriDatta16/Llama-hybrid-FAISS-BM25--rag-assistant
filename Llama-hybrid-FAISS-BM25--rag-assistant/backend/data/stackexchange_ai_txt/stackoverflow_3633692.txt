CodeIgniter configure different IP for READ and WRITE MySQL data

My company has been setting up a different server for read and write access of mysql DB. Previously, we use custom php script. However, I was recently given task to create tools by leveraging CI. I've done it on test server. Now, I'm confused, how to implement it on live server.
