If your images(the images that you vectorized so that each image is now a single row with M columns where M is the number of total pixels x 32 x 32 x 3) contains little to no correlation, then the number of principle components required to explain most of the variances(>95% for example) in your data increases. In order to determine how "feasible" PCA is, checking explained variance is a good idea. In your case, since your data matrix has a size of NxM where M > N, maximum number of components is N. If the number of PCs required is close to 50000, then using PCA makes no sense. You can calculate the explained variance by: explained variance = sum of the eigenvalues that correspond to the PCs you use / sum of ALL eigenvalues I would choose the number of principle components which explains at least more than 90% variance. Another method for choosing the correct number of PCs is drawing the number of PCs vs. explained cumulative variance plot. In the plot you may choose the number where the explained variance doesn't increase significanly anymore. Thus, I think your problem might be choosing a good number of PCs. Another problem might be related to projection of the test samples. When you divided your samples for constructing the NN and for testing the NN, you need to project the test data set using the eigenvectors obtained from the training data set.
