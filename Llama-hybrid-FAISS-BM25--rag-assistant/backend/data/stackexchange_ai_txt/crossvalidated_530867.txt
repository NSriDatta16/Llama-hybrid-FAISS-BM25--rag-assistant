Correlation coefficient is a measure of uncertainty in predicting value Y from value X measured for an individual sampled object, such as a patient. In focusing on this prediction you do not 'bin' individual readouts: your blood sample is your blood sample not other's. If however the nature of your data permits binning / averaging it normally means that you do not care about individual readouts (happy to mix them together) but want to see if there is a TREND in your sample. Here, you look for a (linear) regression and its significance instead because the correlation coeffcient would depend directly on the way you bin your data. Somehow, most biological papers ignore this.
