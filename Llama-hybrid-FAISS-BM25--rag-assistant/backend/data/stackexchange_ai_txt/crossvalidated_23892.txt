You would want to try Box-Cox transformation . It is a version of a power transformation: $$ y \mapsto \left\{ \begin{eqnarray} \frac{y^\lambda-1}{\lambda (\dot y)^{\lambda-1}}, & \lambda \neq 0 \\ \dot y \ln y, & \lambda = 0 \end{eqnarray} \right. $$ where $\dot y$ is the geometric mean of the data. When used as a transformation of the response variable, its nominal role is to make the data closer to the normal distribution, and skewness is the leading reason why the data may look non-normal. My gut feeling with your scatterplot is that it needs to be applied to (some of) the explanatory and the response variables. Some earlier discussions include What other normalizing transformations are commonly used beyond the common ones like square root, log, etc.? and How should I transform non-negative data including zeros? . You can find R code following How to search for a statistical procedure in R? Econometricians stopped bothering about heteroskedasticity after seminal work of Halbert White (1980) on setting up inferential procedures robust to heteroskedasticity (which in fact just retold the earlier story by a statistician F. Eicker (1967)). See Wikipedia page that I just rewrote.
