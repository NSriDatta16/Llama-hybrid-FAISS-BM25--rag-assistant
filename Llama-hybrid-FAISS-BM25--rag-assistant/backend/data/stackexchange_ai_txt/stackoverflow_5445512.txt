Indicies of zero ranges in a zero-one matrix

I am using Matlab for one of my projects. I am actually stuck at a point since some time now. Tried searching on google, but, not much success. I have an array of 0s and 1s. Something like: A = [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]; I want to extract an array of indicies: [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, ..] Such that x_1 is the index of start of first range of zeros. x_2 is the index of end of first range of zeros. x_3 is the index of start of second range of zeros. x_4 is the index of end of second range of zeros. For the above example: x_1 = 1, x_2 = 3 x_3 = 9, x_4 = 10 and so on. Of course, I can do it by writing a simple loop. I am wondering if there is a more elegant (vectorized) way to solve this problem. I was thinking about something like prefix some, but, no luck as of now. Thanks, Anil.
