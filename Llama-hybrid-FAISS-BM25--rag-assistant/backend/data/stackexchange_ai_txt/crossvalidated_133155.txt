How to use Pearson correlation correctly with time series

I have 2 time-series (both smooth) that I would like to cross-correlate to see how correlated they are. I intend to use the Pearson correlation coefficient. Is this appropriate? My second question is that I can choose to sample the 2 time-series as well as I like. i.e. I can choose how many data points I will us. Will this affect the correlation coefficient that is output? Do I need to account for this? For illustration purposes option(i) [1, 4, 7, 10] & [6, 9, 6, 9, 6] option(ii) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] & [6,7,8,9,8,7,6,7,8,9,8,7,6]
