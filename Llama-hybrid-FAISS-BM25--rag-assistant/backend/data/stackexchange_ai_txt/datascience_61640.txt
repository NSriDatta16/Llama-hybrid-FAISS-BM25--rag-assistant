PCA will change your data and you will not be able to interpret it in sane sense, you can just slice and dice the data and do many things by hand, PCA would be usefull if you would want to find "neighbouring" players in terms of raw statistics but it can be deceptive because PCA don't know which stats are important, if you want to decrease dimensionality of data use neural network that predicts something and take N-1 th layer and this vector will be your transformed vector reducing dimensionality is great (even with PCA) for clustering etc. but very sparse features will be dropped in process and you can lose information
