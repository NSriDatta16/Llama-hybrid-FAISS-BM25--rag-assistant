I have done a lot of Win32 serial port programming, but just a little with .NET, so take my advice with a grain of salt. My reads are being split across multiple messages or received as a fragmented response over the COM port and I don't know what settings I might need, or how I should write the code differently to fix this. As others have said, this is perfectly normal. Depending on what type of equipment is on the DCE side, you may have to do repacking yourself. I'm not sure what type of equipment you're hooked up to so I cannot really say much more. If you want to get more data, you can try the following: adjusting the System.Int32 ReceivedBytesThreshold property using synchronous I/O and specifying a fixed number of bytes to read rather than event-based reception I am receiving a "|" symbol through my read nearly every cycle, is this due to a command I have set wrongly somehow, an artifact of Serial communication, or something the device is sending me? (I don't think so though, as Hyperterminal connectivity reveals this character is not being sent continuously.) If you're curious about what is going over the line, check out PortMon from SysInternals , a free app that will snoop your com port while you're transferring data over the line. It seems technical, but really you just have to look at the IRP_MJ_WRITE and IRP_MJ_READ commands, and on the line you'll see the length in bytes and the data sent over the wire. With this you should be able to tell if the problem is the .NET SerialPort object or if the device is actually sending "|" over the line. Can you confirm I am reading and writing data correctly in the respective methods. It looks proper for the event-based method of receiving data.
