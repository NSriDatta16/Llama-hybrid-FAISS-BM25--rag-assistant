ASP.NET is object-oriented out of the box, whereas PHP is not. As such, there's no native "placeholder" to PHP. If you want this type of functionality, you ought to use a MVC framework like Kohana . That, or you could create your own simple template. For instance, here is simple page: About Us This is our About Us page. In this example, you'd have parts of your page that are relatively constant (header, navigation, footer, etc) all stored as pieces that are included within your primary files, such as index.php, aboutus.php, and gallery.php. In the above example, we see what a simple "about us" page could look like. This model is relatively popular amongst young programmers, but if you're somewhat familiar with object-oriented frameworks, I'd encourage you to look at Kohana instead and work toward getting familiar with the Model-View-Controller method of development.
