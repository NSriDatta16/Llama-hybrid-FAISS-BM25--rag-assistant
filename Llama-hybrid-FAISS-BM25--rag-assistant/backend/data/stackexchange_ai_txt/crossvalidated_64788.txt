Interpreting a logistic regression model with multiple predictors

I performed multivariate logistic regression with the dependent variable Y being death at a nursing home within a certain period of entry and got the following results (note if the variables starts in A it is a continuous value while those starting in B are categorical): Call: glm(Y ~ A1 + B2 + B3 + B4 + B5 + A6 + A7 + A8 + A9, data=mydata, family=binomial) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0728 -0.2167 -0.1588 -0.1193 3.7788 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

However looking at the coefficients, I'm not quite sure what to make of these results. It seems that although these variables contribute to the model, looking at the odds ratios, they don't seem to really seem to have much predictive power. Of note, when I calculated the AUC, I got approximately 0.8. Can I say that this model is better at predicting against mortality (e.g. predicting that seniors will live past the prescribed period) compared to predicting for mortality?
