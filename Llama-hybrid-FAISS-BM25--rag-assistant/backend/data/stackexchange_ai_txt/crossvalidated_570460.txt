Yes, it is possible, but you need a single model that does that. the first model takes the input data and outputs feature vectors, which are then fed into a second model as input This sounds like a description of a standard two-layer neural network. A neural network is an example of such a model where the latter layers learn from the outputs created by the previous layers and propagate the errors downstream.
