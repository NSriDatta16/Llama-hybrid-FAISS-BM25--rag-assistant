Paired t-test for different observed parameters - Should I use multiple compairaison's tetsing and how?

I have a group of rats that each go through two treatments: Control (No stimulation) and Laser stimulation. For each treatment I obtain several number of parameters such as Attention score, number of correct responses, accuracy etc... the system records over 20 variables or so per session. I am interested in about 8 or 10 of these. Since the same rat undergoes the two procedures I performed paired t-tests for each of the parameters I am interested in. Comparing the differences between control and laser treatments for each rat. I have been now asked by a reviewer to perform multiple comparison testing. My question is, is this necessary ? I am not comparing between parameters, I am singly interested in whether each relevant behavioral parameter is affected by laser stimulation on the rat. Furthermore, if it is necessary, would I have to correct for all the variables I collected (20 or so) or only the variables which i care about and I am reporting in the paper. The former seems like the appropriate manner but it appears to punish me for recording and presenting as many things as i could. Thanks.
