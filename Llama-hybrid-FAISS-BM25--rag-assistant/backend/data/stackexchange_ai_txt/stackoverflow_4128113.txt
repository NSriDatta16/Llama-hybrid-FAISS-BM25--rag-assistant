What's the point of IsA() in C++?

I'm trying to figure out why some code bases use IsA() to determine object polymorphism if in C++ you can already safely upcast and down cast (using dynamic_cast) ? So far the only case I see useful is when you are integrating a a scripting environment that is linked to the c++ codebase? Thanks!
