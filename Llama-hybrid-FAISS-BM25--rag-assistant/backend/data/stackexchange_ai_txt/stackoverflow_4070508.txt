You can write a procedure or just straight sql and add the logic for calculating the balance(should be an update with recalculating the balance) something like this - Update Account Set balance=balance*interest and then use sql server agent to create jobs(your sql) to be executed nightly( Note : SQL Server agent won't work on Express editions...in that case you might need to use scheduled tasks on your server and run a batch(.bat) files.)
