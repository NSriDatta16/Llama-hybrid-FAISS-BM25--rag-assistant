handling many missing values within a regression

I am struggling with answering a question on how i should handle the vast number of NAs in my data. It is a behavioural study of the impact of traffic on certain mammals and i have approximately 500 rows (one for each type of vehicle) across 3 years. However, there is variable stating if there was a 'behavioural response' or not (Y/N). This I had planned to use in a 'binary logistic regression' as the response variable. However, many of the rows indicate no response and therefore the continuous variables in the dataset (distance to vehicle etc..) have not been filled in, leaving many blanks! Should I be performing the regression based on a small subset of the data e.g. fewer rows? and if so does this have to only be the complete rows. Any help on how to proceed with this problem would be appreciated
