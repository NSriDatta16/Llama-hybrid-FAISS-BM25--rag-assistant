TIdDecoderMIME works just fine. Tried and tested. Just look at the code samples provided by Indy. Also OmniXML has OmniXMLUtils.pas unit with various utilities functions for XML. Inside you can find standalone Base64 encode/decode function. You can copy paste them or use them as they are. Otherwise post the code using TIdDecoderMIME. It must be an error in you code. EDIT: You must watch out that you write the string to stream as single byte order. Base64 works on bytes (ASCII chars) and will not work correctly if you supply it with the 2 byte unicode string. If you take an Base64 encoded sequence as string and write it to stream as it is you will have an error, because the lenghth of such stream will be twice as long as the original was. You can take TStringStream or use AnsiStrings for the task. As long as you stick to that the encode / decode will work correctly. You can also use my SimpleStorage which does all the work for you. Reading an image from XML comes to such simple task as: Jpeg := TJPEGImage.Create; try Jpeg.LoadFromStream(SrcStorage.Get('Image').Filter('gzip').AsBinary.Stream); finally Jpeg.Free; end; Easy isn't it (and it is also decompressed in the process). :)
