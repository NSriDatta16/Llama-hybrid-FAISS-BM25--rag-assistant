When averaging the measurements you make your dataset smaller. Initially, it was pretty small (24 samples) but here you half its size. This is why confidence intervals get larger. You are correct that with a single measurement there is less noise in the data, so this would decrease the variability of the estimates, but at the same time you make the dataset smaller, hence you observe the reverse effect. As a side note, averaging the measurements is not the best idea. First, you are discarding valid data. Second, you are cheating by making its variability smaller than in reality (so the parameter estimates would be overly optimistic). Better to use all data, or at least something like an error-in-variables model.
