It is hard to say what your problem is, I don't know what you mean by overriding it? Make sure you are connecting the touchesBegan event with an IBAction in Interface Builder? You must create a IBAction function to handle the event, and explicitly connect the even to the IBAction. It is not as simple as simply overriding a method. Although you have the View tied to an IBOutlet, you need to connect the event using an IBAction, or else you won't get any of those events.
