The author of the locfit package, Catherine Loader, kindly answered my email. She says that instead of the alpha argument of scb, separate h and nn arguments need to go inside lp if I specify it within the formula for scb. I could not get the code work that way though. And I am still unsure about why there should a difference from the case without specifying lp() and simply giving the alpha and deg arguments to the scb function. And she also noted an important error my code as posted: with the 'parm' kernel, there is no local smoothing, but a parametric (in my case, logic) estimate. Finally, note that the literature seems to suggest specifying type=4 as an argument for scb for logistic regressions.
