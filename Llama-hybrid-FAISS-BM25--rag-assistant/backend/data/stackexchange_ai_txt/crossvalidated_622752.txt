I think this isn't bad, but I agree with @mkt 's comments. You want something discrete. I think an even better analogy is one that I saw Andrew Gelman use in a class. Get a bunch of individually wrapped candies of different sizes. Put them in a bag (population). Now, take out a handful (sample). Get the average weight of the candies in your hand (statistic, or parameter estimate). That's a sample for estimating the average weight of the candies in the whole bag. But, be careful! When he did this in class, everyone got a biased estimate because, when you mix candies, the bigger ones go to the bottom (bias). IIRC, this was a class on 'teaching statistics'. Gelman also has a book Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks and I'm pretty sure this one is in there. I think this has a couple advantages over your method. First, the candies are discrete, like observations are. Second, the weight of the candies is measurable and precise, whereas the taste of the soup is vague. Third, it also teaches that you have to be careful with your sampling and randomizing! Sometimes, mixing isn't what it seems to be.
