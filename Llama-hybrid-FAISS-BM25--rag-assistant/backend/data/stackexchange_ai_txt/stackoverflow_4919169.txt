Orientation of captured image using built-in Camera application

I have invoked the built-in Camera application in android 2.1 using intent. I've used the following code: Intent cameraintent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "MyTestFile.jpg"); cameraintent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(file)); outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile(file); startActivityForResult(cameraintent, CAMERA_PIC_REQUEST); To get the orientation of the captured image I've used the following code: Uri capturedImage = outputFileUri; Bitmap theBmp = MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(getContentResolver(), capturedImage); int img_orient=0; String[] projection = { MediaStore.Images.Media.ORIENTATION }; Cursor mImageCursor = managedQuery(capturedImage, projection, null, null, null); I am not able to get the orientation of captured photo as the cursor mImageCursor is always null. What is problem in my code?
