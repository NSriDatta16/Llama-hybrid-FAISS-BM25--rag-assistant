Comparing time series: Pearson correlation, Kendall's tau b or Spearman's rho?

Which correlation coefficient is the most appropriate to compare 2 time series? I want to compare the variation of one variable for 2 regions, have regional data for the last 30 years. Is Pearson correlation ok or should I rely on Kendall's tau b or Spearman's rho and why? I tried to google it and analyse what I found, but I'm still not sure.
