Using your source code you can try this Dim totalNumber as Double = 0 Dim count as Integer = 0 For x = 0 To xyz123.Tables(0).Columns.Count - 1 Dim current as Double = 0 If Double.TryParse(xyz123.Tables(0).Rows(0)(x).ToString(), current) AndAlso current <> 0 AndAlso x <> 13 AndAlso x <> 1 Then count += 1 totalNumber += current End If Next Dim averageRating as Double = totalNumber / count In the above example this will ignore columns 14 and 2 in your average Hope this helps
