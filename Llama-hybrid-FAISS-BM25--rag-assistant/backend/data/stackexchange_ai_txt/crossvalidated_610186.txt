A slightly modified version of your question can be answered using the tools in the following paper: Aue, Alexander, et al. "Break detection in the covariance structure of multivariate time series models." (2009): 4046-4087. This paper can be found here: https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-37/issue-6B/Break-detection-in-the-covariance-structure-of-multivariate-time-series/10.1214/09-AOS707.full . Essentially this paper allows you to test for a changepoint in the covariance matrix of the two series.
