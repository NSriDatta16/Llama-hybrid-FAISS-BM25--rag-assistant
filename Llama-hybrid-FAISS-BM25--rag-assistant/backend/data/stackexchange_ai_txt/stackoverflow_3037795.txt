Extend Javascript Date Object

I'm curious what would be the best practice to extend the Date constructor. The problem I'm facing is, that the Internet Explorer ( can't parse a date like new Date('2010-05-11'); I have to admit that this is not a standard method to parse, anyways FireFox and Chrome perform well on that kind of date string. Now I'm wondering, should I just split/parse/rebuild the string before calling new Date() or is there a more elegant solution ? update I would highly prefer a native js method to accomplish that. If there isn't a way to somehow add a custom parsing I'll just transform the datestring.
