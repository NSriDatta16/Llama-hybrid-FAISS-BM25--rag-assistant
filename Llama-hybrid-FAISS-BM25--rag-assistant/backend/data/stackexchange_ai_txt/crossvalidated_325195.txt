Seizure grade appears to be an ordinal variable. There are a few options for these. One is to use a test such as Jonckheere-Terpstra. In R, one way to do this is jonckheere.test . Another method is to treat this as a regression problem with ordinal logistic regression. Then "grade" would be the dependent variable and "group" would be the independent variable. One nice thing about ordinal regression (vs. JT) is that you can include covariates. However, ordinal logistic regression makes more assumptions that JT.
