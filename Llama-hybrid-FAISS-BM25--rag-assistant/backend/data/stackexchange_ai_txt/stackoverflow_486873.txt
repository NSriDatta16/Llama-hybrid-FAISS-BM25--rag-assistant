I think the "RESTful" way to do it would be to use the same URI (so same controller/action), and to detect (either from session, or by looking at the User Agent header) whether you want to render the full version or the mobile version. So you'd only have one controller/action which looked like this: class BlogController { function ShowPost() { if (IsMobile) { View("PostWithComments_Mobile"); } else { View("PostWithComments"); } } } Depending on how much control you have over the framework (I don't know PHP nor Zend) you might be able to automatically have it switch to a different view depending on whether a mobile version exists and the user agent. A quick Google search results in many samples for detecting mobile browsers.
