You are essentially using globals, which is strongly not recommended in C++, but is sometimes necessary in C. You could get it working with extern, but the "better" answer would be to wrap your globals in a state object of some sort. struct State { GFDCON gfd; const char X; const char O; string MPhostname, mySID; board TTTboard; bool PlayerIsX, isMyTurn; char Player, Player2; }; Create your state object in Main and pass it to each function that needs to know the state of the game system. This will lead to much better code organization in the long run.
