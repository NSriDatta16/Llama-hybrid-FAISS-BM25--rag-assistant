By default, GridSearchCV uses the score method of its estimator; see the last paragraph of the scoring parameter on the docs : If None, the estimatorâ€™s score method is used. And DecisionTreeRegressor.score (indeed, all/most regressors) uses R^2. In response to your edit: you can specify scoring='neg_mean_squared_error' . But note too that there's a linear relationship between MSE and R^2, so optimizing either of these are equivalent.
