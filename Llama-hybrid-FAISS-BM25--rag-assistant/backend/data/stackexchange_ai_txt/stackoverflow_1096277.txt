database archiving vs timeperiod based tables/fields

I am working on an employee objectives web application. Lead/Manager sets objectives for team members after discussing with them. This is an yearly/half-yearly/quarterly depending on appraisal cycle the organization follows. Now question is is better approach to add time period based fields or archive previous quarter's/year's data. When a user want to see previous objectives (not so frequent activity), the archive that belongs to that date may be restored in some temp table and shown to employee. Points to start with archiving: reduces db size, results in simpler db queries, adds an overhead when someone tried to see old data. time-period based field/tables: one or more extra joins in queries, previous data is treated similar to current data so no overhead in retrieving old data. PS: it is not space cost, my point is if we can achieve some optimization in terms of performance, as this is a web app and at peak times all the employees in an organization will be looking/updating it. so removing time period makes my queries a lot simpler. Thanks
