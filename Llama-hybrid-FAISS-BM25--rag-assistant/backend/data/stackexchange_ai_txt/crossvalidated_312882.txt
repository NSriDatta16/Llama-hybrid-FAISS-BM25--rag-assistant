Well, you didn't say how many observations you have as @David pointed out. Also it seems to me, you are a bit confused about supervised and unsupervised learning. The MLP you are using to build your classifier is indeed a supervised method. But feature selection does not have a "correct" answer. You can try to reduce the dimensionality with minimizing the loss of information hidden in the data, but that is still a problem for unsupervised method. How will the features look like? How many of them should there be? There isn't a single answer. PCA is indeed an unsupervised method, that is widely used for this and you can definitely try to apply it to your data. Also there are many ways to determine how many components should you retain. Check out the elbow diagram and proportion of variance explained for example. Also it should be pointed out that PCA is not a feature selection method, but rather a dimensionality reduction method. It doesn't select some features from the original dataset, but transforms it into new features that are "ranked" on how much they contribute to the information.
