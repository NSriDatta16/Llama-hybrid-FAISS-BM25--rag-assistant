R mxnet random initialization

Is there a way to create an mxnet neural network with randomly initialized weights without training the network? Most user manuals that I surely read include only two parts: symbolic network creation, and training (which includes weight initialization). How can one create and initialize a network for the purpose of generating randomized predictions?
