All identical strings have only one reference, no matter how many times it is referenced in the code. From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern.aspx The common language runtime conserves string storage by maintaining a table, called the intern pool, that contains a single reference to each unique literal string declared or created programmatically in your program. Consequently, an instance of a literal string with a particular value only exists once in the system. For example, if you assign the same literal string to several variables, the runtime retrieves the same reference to the literal string from the intern pool and assigns it to each variable.
