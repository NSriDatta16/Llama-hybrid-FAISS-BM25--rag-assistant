Let's take a look at what you need to overcome to get this to work. 1) oomph Smart phones are designed to give you the ability to stay in touch, and have a rich experience on the move, but within the confines of a device that can be put in your pocket. Storage isn't really an issue these days, but processing power on small devices are. Sure we can run calendar, 3D games (though nowhere near the complexity of what you'll see on a fully-fledged operating system), fart-applications and plug-ins for you-tube so we can watch idiots break their ballsacks on railings, but there's a reason you don't see a fully-fledged rich-desktop application, or Grand Theft Auto IV on these devices. Oomph. Now bring in the Visual Studio development environment (and database server, if that is what you're application is doing), with potentially 100s of source files in your language of choice. Assuming we put a severly cut-down version of your IDE on to your pda, I hope you brought some spare batteries or the power-cord because you're going to need it. 2) input It's probably not difficult to change your predictive text input to cover all the keywords of your chosen language so that you don't end up typing pubic instead of public . Once we've solved that we then need to go through the agonizing process of the fact that computer code contains a lot of symbols and identifiers, meaning we'd have to switch our input mode every other word or two to facilitate it: for(int i(0); i Takes a few seconds on a keyboard. Probably about one train journey on your PDA. To solve this, we must assume the PDA has the facility for an external keyboard to prevent suicide. 3) display Ok, we've solved our oomph problems with a power-chord and/or 50 batteries and we've plugged in our external keyboard. We're ready to code!! We'll have to adjust the font-size on the display so that we can get more than 20 lines of code (vertically) or 10 (horizontally). I enjoy my comfort when I code, so I don't want to be squinting at a small screen as I type on my plug-in keyboard. I'd have to prop it up against some books or something (so I don't have to hold the PDA and the keyboard). Now I can't see what i am doing. So, I need a bigger display. 4) Target code What platform are you targeting? Remember the PDA is designed to run software for the PDA in question. You won't be able to write fully-fledged win32 applications on Windows Mobile 7. There are differences in the API. What if it's a web app you're developing? We're going to have to add a web server to the phone too, unless that is deployed elsewhere and we can rely on an internet connection to upload the changed files to. Have we solved the problem? Did we get more oomph? A keyboard? A bigger display? Yes we did. It's a laptop .
