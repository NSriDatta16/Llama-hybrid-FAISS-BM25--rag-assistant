Getting an average from subquery values or another aggregate function in SQL Server

I have the SQL statement (SQL Server ) SELECT COUNT(ActionName) AS pageCount FROM tbl_22_Benchmark WHERE DATEPART(dw,CreationDate)>1 AND DATEPART(dw,CreationDate) which produces the output pageCount 27 19 59 Now I would like to get the average of all those figures using SQL. Apparently nested aggregate functions like (AVG(COUNT(pageCount))) are not allowed , and using a subquery like SELECT AVG(pageCount) FROM ( SELECT COUNT(ActionName) AS pageCount FROM tbl_22_Benchmark WHERE DATEPART(dw,CreationDate)>1 AND DATEPART(dw,CreationDate) gets me just an error message Incorrect syntax near ')'. How can I get the average of the pageCount rows?
