What is considered a long execution time?

I am trying to figure out the efficiency of my server side code. Using microtime(true) to measure speed, I am able to calculate the time it took my script to run. I am getting average speeds of .3 to .5 seconds. These scripts do a number of database queries to return different values to the user. What is considered an efficient execution time for PHP scripts that will be run online for a website? I know it depends on exactly what is being done, but just consider this a standard script that reads from a database and returns values to the user. I look at Google and see them search the internet in .15 seconds and I feel like my script is crap.
