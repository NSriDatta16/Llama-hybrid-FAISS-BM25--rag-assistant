Interpretation of $\mathcal{D}$ and difference between the accuracy parameter and training error

I am studying the book " Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms ". They introduce the following things, which I'm not sure i'm interpreting correctly: The training error(p35) $$L_S(h):=\frac{|\{i\in[m]:h(x_i)\neq y_i\}|}{m}$$ Where $S=((x_1,y_1),...,(x_m,y_m))$ is the training data. Then they define the error of a classifier (p34): Formally, given a domain subset, $A\subset \mathcal{X}$ , the probability distribution $\mathcal{D}$ , assigns a number, $\mathcal{D}(A)$ , which determines how likely it is to observe a point $x\in A$ . We define the error of a prediction rule, $h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{Y}$ , to be $$L_{\mathcal{D},f}(h):=P_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[h(x)\neq f(x)]:=\mathcal{D}(\{x:h(x)\neq f(x)\})$$ . Where they define $\mathcal{D}$ as the probability distribution over $\mathcal{X}$ Question 1: How exactly is $\mathcal{D}$ supposed to be interpreted? I will give a trivial example and please tell me if this is the correct way I have interpreted it: For example, let $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$ and $\mathcal{Y}=\{0,1\}$ . Let $f(x_i)=1$ if $x\geq 0$ and $0$ otherwise. Then let $\mathcal{D}$ be such that $P(x_1\geq 0)=1/2, P(x_2\geq 0)=1/3, P(x_3 \geq 0)=1/4$ . Is this a reasonable example of how to interpret $\mathcal{D}$ ?Then on p38 last sentence, they introduce the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$ . Question 2:What is essentially the difference between the accuracy parameter and the training error?
