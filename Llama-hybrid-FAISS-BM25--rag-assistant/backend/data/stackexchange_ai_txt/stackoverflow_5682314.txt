I would use a static class in your example. The differentiator I would use is if there is any state of the properties of an instance you are trying to preserve across access. This is what a singleton is designed for. The static class gives organized access to methods in a namespace which is helpful for clarity in your code but it does not have any properties about itself. So yes you can use a singleton but it would be bad form because there are no instance properties that you want to make available across page accesses. Hope this helps.
