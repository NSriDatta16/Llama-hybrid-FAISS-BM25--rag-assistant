Facebook's HipHop - What's it for?

The news in the PHP world today is Facebook's HipHop , which: HipHop for PHP isn't technically a compiler itself. Rather it is a source code transformer. HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it. HipHop executes the source code in a semantically equivalent manner and sacrifices some rarely used features — such as eval() — in exchange for improved performance. HipHop includes a code transformer, a reimplementation of PHP's runtime system, and a rewrite of many common PHP Extensions to take advantage of these performance optimizations. My question is, what type of web applications is this actually useful for? Seems like typical database-bound web apps may not be greatly served by this, but rarer CPU-bound apps would.
