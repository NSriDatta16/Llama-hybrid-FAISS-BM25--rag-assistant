test if a markov chain is equal to a theoretical one

I have got an empirical transitions count matrix Q. I have a theoretical first order Markov chain P. Say N is the number of transitions. I would like to test if Q is compatible with P. Is it correct to find the theoretical count transition matrix (N*P) calculating the chi-square statistics, $\sum_{i,j}^{K} \frac{(Q_{ij}-(N*P_{ij}))^2}{N*P_{ij}}$, and then calculating the p-value of a $\chi^2$ distribution with $K*(K-1)$ degrees of freedom?
