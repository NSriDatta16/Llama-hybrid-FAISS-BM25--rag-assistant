Problem with File I/O in Opera widget using opera widget emulator

I am making a widget for mobile and I want to save some xml files and image files for my widget but when I tested this code in opera widget Mobile emulator for windows, I didn't get any response. function storage () { var mountpoint=opera.io.filesystem.mountSystemDirectory('storage','myCoolSaves'); alert('he he he '); //// It was just to check if it executes first line on not but it doesn't var file = myCoolSaves.createDirectory('/myImages'); var stream = file.open('newfile.txt', opera.io.filemode.WRITE); stream.writeLine('hello'); stream.close(); stream = file.open('newfile.txt'); var data = stream.readLine(); stream.close(); opera.postError(data); } But if i put alert in start of the function it shows which means that the function's being called but the code is not working. Do I need to import some libraries?? include opera sdk?? can any one help me please
