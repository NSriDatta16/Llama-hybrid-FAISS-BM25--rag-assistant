yes it can but be careful what types you pass across the bridge if you are loading with loadForCompatability=true. Have a look at this document LoaderInfo paying particular attention to sharedEvents. It basically allows you to raise events from the subApplication to the parent and vice versa. For more complex scenarios, using AIR have a look at the child/parent Sandbox bridges.
