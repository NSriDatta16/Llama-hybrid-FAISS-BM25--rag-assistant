JavaScript/jQuery - offsetLeft and offsetTop

When hovering over a span I would like to get the offsetLeft and offsetTop values so I can make something hover near it. When I do this I get 0 for both values. What is a better way to tackle this? I am using jQuery. Assume I am starting with (looped by server-side scripting): some username FINAL THOUGHTS: I'm giving the the answer rep out based on "code leverage"/DRY. The longer function you could use over and over in your own js library. The second short answer however is 100% correct too.
