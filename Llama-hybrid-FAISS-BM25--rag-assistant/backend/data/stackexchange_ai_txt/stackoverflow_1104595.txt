Modern RDBMSs do not really give you better performance on a 255 character column over a 50 character column due to column width. On SQL Server, I take care to put my name, address, etc as NVarChar so I can internationalize when required. I have phone number storage capable of storing more than 10 digits as standard in the USA.
