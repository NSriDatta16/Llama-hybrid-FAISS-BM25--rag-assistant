Java: How to draw images on the smallest possible surface?

Let's say I have 256 images with an average size of 70x150 (So, size if variable). And I have a Graphic -instance (Created from a BufferedImage with a given size) on which I want to draw the images. But I want to draw them at the lowest possible surface. So, not simply in a grid, but really puzzled in each other. But!: they may not overlap each other. Maybe this something only a human brain can manage. It is worth asking it, I think.... Thanks in advance, Martijn For example: +------++------+ | || | | img1 || img2 | | |+------+ | |+-----------------+ +------+| | +---+ | | | 3 | | | | | | img 4 | +---+ | | | | +-----------------+
