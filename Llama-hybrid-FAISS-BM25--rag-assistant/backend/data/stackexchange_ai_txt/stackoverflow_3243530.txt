Is this 'layering' of my web-service correct? Can it be improved?

I am writing a Web Service to retrieve Invoice information from a database table. The specifics are as follows: I intend to give InvoiceAgentId as input and retrieve PayerId , PayerName , EffDate and InvoiceAgentId . Now, 1. In the InvoiceInfoSearch.asmx.cs file I have the WebMethod ... GetInvoiceInfo 2. I have the DTO objects InvoiceInfoRequest and InvoiceInfoResponse 3. I have the BusinessLayer manager class InvoiceSearchmanager 4. I have the DAL InvoiceInfoDAL The web method in point #1 instantiates the InvoiceSearchManager class and calls the GetInvoiceInfo method in the manager by passing the InvoiceInfoRequest . Then the manager method instantiates InvoiceInfoDAL and calls the GetInvoiceInfo method in the DAL by passing the InvoiceInfoRequest . In the DAL method the InvoiceInfoResponse is instantiated and populated with retrieved record set and then propagated back to web method. My questions: 1. Can both the InvoiceInfoRequest and InvoiceInfoResponse DTO classes have the exact same members? In my case PayerId , PayerName , EffDate and InvoiceAgentId . 2. Is this layering correct? Can it be bettered?
