Using jQuery sortable or droppable to put items into categories?

I am trying to place products in to cateogories, like Product1 Product2 I want to drop the available products in to a category and when its dropped to post the update back via ajax. It doesn't really matter what is posted back, whether it's the updated category or all the categories. $(document).ready(function() { $("tr:even").css("background", "#f7f7f7"); $("ul.drop").sortable({ connectWith: 'ul', tolerance: 'pointer', stop: function(ev, ui) { ????? } }); }); Can i make this work or should I be using drag and drop?
