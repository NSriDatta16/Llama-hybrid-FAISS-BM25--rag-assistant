Exact Predictions for Regression problems in Machine Learning

I am working on shipment days delivery problem , where i want to predict shipment days (continuous variable target) I have tries both Neural Network and Random Forest regressors ,i got very low error rate if i consider MAE or MSE but if i compare actual ship days and predicted ship days i get lot of differences in most of the values. What i am trying to do is that (actual ship days - predicted ship days) should have 5 days as difference in most of the records , but i am getting huge differences in most of the samples training samples : 1.1 million records test samples : 0.9 million records algo1 : random forest regressor (with default parameters) algo2 : neural network loss: 46.2513 - mae: 5.2729 - val_loss: 46.5231 - val_mae: 5.2836 my code: network = models.Sequential() network.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(23,))) network.add(layers.Dropout(0.5)) network.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) network.add(layers.Dropout(0.5)) network.add(layers.Dense(1,activation='linear')) network.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['mae']) history = network.fit(X_train_scaled, train_ship_days, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, test_ship_days), epochs=50, batch_size=128) final goal : actual ship days and predict_ship_Days should have minimum difference for at least 80 % of records suggest me some algorithm or techniques which i can implement
