What are some useful strategies for converting a Classic ASP application to ASP.NET

We have a ten-year-old ASP application that we are considering planning an update for. We want to take advantage of the new technologies that ASP.NET has to offer, as well as the opportunity to fix some issues with the existing framework (the existing code-base is highly fragmented, nearly impossible to test, let alone debug, and the entire application appears to have been constructed according to the "Farmhouse Pattern".) To that end, it seems that the time has come to rebuild this application. But, we are a small business, and we simply don't have the resources to either hire out the rebuild, nor to dedicate our small team of developers solely to the task of rebuilding (we've got other tasks on our plate, and can't concentrate on this one particular task for the length of time it would take to fully reconstruct the application). What, then, are some useful strategies we can employ to help us convert this app, without having it consume all of our limited resources for the duration of the re-write?
