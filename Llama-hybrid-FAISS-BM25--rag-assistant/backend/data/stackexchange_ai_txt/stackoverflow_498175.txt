Custom NSControl target/action howto!

I have a custom NSControl that acts as sort of a two dimensional slider where you can drag a handle around the view. I added a few class specific methods and the only ones I overrode were the mouse actions and drawRect. My question is, how do I get it to implement target action? How can I make it behave like a slider and continuously send action messages to a bound target? As of now I can wire it up in interface builder but no action is sent. I've read alot about methods like sendActionOn: and sendAction:to: but I don't know exactly how to use them. If someone would explain it I'm sure I'd get it.
