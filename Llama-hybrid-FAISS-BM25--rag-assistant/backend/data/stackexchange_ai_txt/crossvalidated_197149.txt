Accident data? I'd start by assuming there's hourly seasonality and daily seasonality. Without knowing the type of accident, it may be that you could look at hourly pooling Monday through Friday, and handle hourly for Saturday and Sunday separately, so you have 3 pools of hours, 24 (Mon-Fri), 24 (Sat) and 24 (Sun). Further data reduction might be possible, but assuming not, just take the averages. For example, the average for Sunday 3pm might be .3 (30% chance of an accident). The average for 4pm might be .2, and so on. The probability of no accident occurring in 3pm or 4pm would be (1-.3)(1-.2) = .56, so the probability of having an accident in these two hours would be .44, and so on. This seems to be a good, simple place to start.
