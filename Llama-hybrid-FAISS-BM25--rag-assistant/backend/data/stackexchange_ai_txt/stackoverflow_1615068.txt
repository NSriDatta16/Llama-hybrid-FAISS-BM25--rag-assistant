You haven't shown where you are displaying these. All we have is a database cell and an object in memory, both of which are merely storage. For storage purposes, .00 and .0000 are the same thing.

Also, as a personal preference I'd write that code like this: private static ToProduct(this IDataRecord record) { var product = new Product(); product.Id = record.GetInt32(record.GetOrdinal("Id")); product.ManufacturerId = record.GetInt32(record.GetOrdinal("ManufacturerId")); product.CategoryId = record.GetInt32(record.GetOrdinal("CategoryId")); product.Name = record.GetString(record.GetOrdinal("Name")); product.Description = record.GetString(record.GetOrdinal("Description")); product.Price = record.GetDecimal(record.GetOrdinal("Price")); product.ItemsInStokc = record.GetInt32(record.GetOrdinal("ItemsInStock")); return product; } public static IEnumerable GetAllProducts() { string sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM Products"; using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sqlQuery, connection)) { connection.Open(); using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection)) { while (reader.Read()) { yield return reader.ToProduct(); } } } } Update: You commented that this will be in a GridView. Okay. In that case, all you need to do is have a DataFormatString in the column definition, like this: ...
