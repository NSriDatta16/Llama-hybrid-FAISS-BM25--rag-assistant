Unknown pseudo-element or pseudo-class :hover

I've never really paid this close attention but I'm getting the following error: Unknown pseudo-element or pseudo-class :hover on the following code A:hover { COLOR: #F56655; text-decoration: underline; } Since when has :hover not been valid css and what is the alternative? I have seen this used everywhere...
