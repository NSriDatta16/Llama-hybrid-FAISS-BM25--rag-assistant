I do 99% 1 to 1 class to file. The only exception is if you have a large number or very simple little classes that all implement the same interface and shouldn't change much. You might want to just go ahead and put these in one file. Custom exceptions can be a good example. Most of the time (in my experience), there is no code other than creating custom messages or things of that nature. Namespaces should be organized first by separation of concerns. The Data objects should be in a different namespace than the domain objects, for example. Then, you might have a smaller subdomain for each group of objects at the "aggregate root" level. Usually, each of these smallest namespaces corresponds to its own project and DLL.
