Activate the mod_status module, you'll get a report on /server-status page, there is a more parseable version on /server-status?q=auto . If you enable ExtendedStatus On you will have a lot of information on processes and threads. This is the page used by monitoring tools to track a lot of stats parameters, so you will certainly find the one you need ( edit: if it is not memory ...) . Be careful with security/access settings of this file, it's a nice tool to check how your server respond to DOS :-) About memory you must note that Apache loves memory, how much memory per process depends on a lot of things (number of modules loaded - check that you need all the ones you have, number of virtualHosts, etc). But on a stable configuration it does not move a lot (except if you use PHP scripts with high memory limit usage...). If you find memory leaks try to limit the number of requests per process MaxRequests (apache will kill him and put a new one). edit : in fact not a lot of memory info in the server-status. About monitoring tools, any tool using SNMP MIB-II can track memory usage per process, with average/top/low values for the different childs (Cacti, Nagios, Munin, etc) if you had a snmpd daemon. Check this excellent Munin example . It's not a tracking of each apache child but it will give you an idea of what you can track with these tools. If you do not need a complete monitoring system such as Nagios or Centreon, with alerts, user managmenent, big networks (and if you do not have a lot of days for books reading) Munin is, IMHO, a pretty tool to get monitoring reports quite fast.
