As stated above, i had the exact same problem. But would now recommend to bypass the useless NSXMLParser (if using it WITH core data!!!) and using GDataXML instead. GDataXML is modelled on the NSXMLDocument class (which is a more elegant and workable solution to use with core data, only that you can't use NSXMLDocument with iOS). See here for an excellent tutorial: http://www.raywenderlich.com/725/how-to-read-and-write-xml-documents-with-gdataxml :)
