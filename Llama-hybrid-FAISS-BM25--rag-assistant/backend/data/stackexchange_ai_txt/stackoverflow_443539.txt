Unfortunately, this feature appears to be completely worthless at this time. It is easy to add a timestamp when signing a jar file, just add this parameter to the jarsigner command: -tsa https://timestamp.geotrust.com/tsa This is the URL to Thawte's timestamping server. Unfortunately, the Thawte timestamping CA cert is not included in the Java runtime's list of trusted CA certs, so it is effectively meaningless. That is, if you load the applet after the code signing certificate has expired, you get the "untrusted" warning dialog instead of the "trusted" one. There is a "workaround", of sorts, posted here , but it works by embedding the Thawte timestamping CA cert in the applet itself, and running keytool on the client to import the cert. I can't see how this would work though, since the user will already have seen the signed code dialog before this code can run. I'll keep looking for a solution, but I'm not hopeful. I can't imagine why a usable timestamping CA cert has not been included with the Java runtime after all this time.
