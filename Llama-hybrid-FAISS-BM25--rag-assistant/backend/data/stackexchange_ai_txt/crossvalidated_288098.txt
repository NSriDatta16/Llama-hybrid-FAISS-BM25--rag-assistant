A simple explanation of Vector Space Model

I've been going through a data science course, and just came across Vector Space Modeling for representing text documents, and don't fully understand it. I've looked at a few articles, but they are pretty high level, and I am just a lowly python developer looking to gain knowledge of the data science world. In one of my course assignments, I was tasked with dealing with VPM, and Naive Bayes together, and I read this stack overflow article about Naive Bayes, and it really helped me understand that algorithm. Could someone similarly explain to me how vector space modeling works, or supply some solid articles that explain it pretty well.
