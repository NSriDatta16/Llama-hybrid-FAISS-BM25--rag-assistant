To avoid the ANR you need to do the search outside the UI thread. As SD cards can be big, you probably want to do it in a service rather than in your foreground activity so that the user can use their device for other things while the search is ongoing. But android already finds and indexes supported media files, so you should see if you can leverage the built-in MediaScanner stuff.
