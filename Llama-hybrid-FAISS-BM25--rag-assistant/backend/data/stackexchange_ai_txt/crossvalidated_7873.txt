Discussing binomial regression and modeling strategies

Today I have got a question about binomial/ logistic regression, its based on an analysis that a group in my department have done and were seeking comments upon. I made up the example below to protect their anonymity, but they were keen to see the responses. Firstly, the analysis began with a simple 1 or 0 binomial response (e.g. survival from one breeding season to the next) and the goal was to model this response as a function of some co-variates. However, multiple measurements of some co-variates were available for some individuals, but not for others. For example, imagine variable x is a measure of metabolic rate during labour and individuals vary in the number of offspring that they have (e.g. variable x was measured 3 times for individual A, but only once for individual B). This imbalance is not due to the sampling strategy of the researchers per se, but reflects the characteristics of the population they were sampling from; some individuals have more offspring than others. I should also point out that measuring the binomial 0\1 response between labour events was not possible because the interval between these events was quite short. Again, imagine the species in questions has a short breeding season, but can give birth to more than one offspring during the season. The researchers chose to run a model in which they used the mean of variable x as one covariate and the number of offspring an individual gave birth to as another covariate. Now, I was not keen on this approach for a number of reasons 1)Taking the average of x means losing information in the within-individual variability of x. 2) The mean is itself a statistic, so by putting it in the model we end up doing statistics on statistics. 3) The number of offspring an individual had is in the model, but it is also used to calculate the mean of variable x, which I think could cause trouble. So, my question is how would people go about modeling this type of data? At the moment, I would probably run separate models for individuals that had one offspring, then for individuals that had two offspring etc. Also, I would not use the mean of variable x and just use the raw data for each birth, but I am not convinced this is much better either. Thank you for your time (PS: I apologize that its quite a long question, and I hope that the example is clear)
