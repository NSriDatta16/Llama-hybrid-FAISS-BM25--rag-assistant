Model not learning in Cat-Dog Image classification using Keras

def CNN(cat,dog,test): cat=np.reshape(cat,(cat.shape[0],64,64,3)) dog=np.reshape(dog,(dog.shape[0],64,64,3)) xtrain=np.concatenate((cat,dog),0) ytrain=np.asarray([1 if i After training, I am getting accuracy of around 55-59 % but it is expected to go above 90% easily. I think I have made a very silly error with the model or with the data formatting. Can you please help me point the mistake.
