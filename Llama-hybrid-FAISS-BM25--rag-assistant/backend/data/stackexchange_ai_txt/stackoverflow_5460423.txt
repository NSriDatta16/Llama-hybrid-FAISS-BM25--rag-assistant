iOS UPnP Server

I wrote a UPnP controller for iOS on Obj-C using cybergarage and now I want to add a UPnP Server for the same app using the same cybergarage library. But I got a problem: I didnt found any tutorials or good documentation for anything except ControlPoint. CGUpnpDevice *device = [[CGUpnpDevice alloc] initWithXMLDescription: @""]; [device setUdn: @"uuid:0000d8c8-20a0-00d8-9999-4858001808d8"]; [device setDeviceType: @"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:1"]; [device setFriendlyName: @"OMG server by spe"]; [device setUserData: @"omg user"]; [device start]; NSLog(@"running: %i", (bool)[device isRunning]); It says running: 0 I dont know the correct xml for constructor and if I use default constructor [[CGUpnpDevice alloc] init]; it crashes. Is there anybody with cybergarage programming experience? Any ideas how to run the server?
