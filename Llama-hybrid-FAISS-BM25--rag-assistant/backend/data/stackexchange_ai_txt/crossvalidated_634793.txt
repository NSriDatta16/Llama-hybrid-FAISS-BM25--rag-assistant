IrishStat gave a good comment that points to an answer. He isn't on the site any more, so I will attempt an answer. If you have autocorrelated errors, then you have to fix those before you worry about heteroscedasticity. One way to attempt to do this is as IrishStat suggests: Don't use linear regression; use ARIMA (or another time series method). Or, if you have a short time series, you could try a multilevel model or generalized estimating equations (GEE). All of those methods have been discussed a lot here, and there is also a huge literature about them.
