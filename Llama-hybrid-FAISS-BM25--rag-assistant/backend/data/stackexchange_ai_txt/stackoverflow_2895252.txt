According to the last editor's draft : The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. As I interpret that, your use is perfectly fine semantically, although I really must question your use of a list in the first place. Given that each article is probably much more text than a couple of lines, an unordered list just seems to make things clotty. I imagine you'll "style away" the bullets etc with css, and I can't see why you'd want a bulleted list of articles if the page is displayed with css disabled. I'd suggest merely The header Some text The header Some text And maybe another paragraph
