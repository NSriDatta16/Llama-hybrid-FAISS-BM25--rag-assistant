Straight from the Dets man page : "Since all operations performed by Dets are disk operations, it is important to realize that a single look-up operation involves a series of disk seek and read operations. For this reason, the Dets functions are much slower than the corresponding Ets functions, although Dets exports a similar interface." That is, for a read-mostly storage, Dets is not an optimal choice. (I must admit I find this design decision weird - A better implementation should cache recent lookups. However, since that Ets and Dets are basic facilities in Erlang, I guess that the implementors left that optimization for the users.)
