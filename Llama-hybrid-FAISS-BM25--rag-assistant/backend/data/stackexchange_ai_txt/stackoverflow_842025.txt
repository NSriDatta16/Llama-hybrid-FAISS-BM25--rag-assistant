I read your question to require (as I do) a programmatic way to set button color. It's a glaring omission from the UIKit, and I couldn't get the undocumented UIGlassButton to work. I've solved this with a single segment UISegmentedControl , which allows you to set the tintColor : UISegmentedControl * btn = [[UISegmentedControl alloc] initWithItems:[NSArray arrayWithObject:name]]; btn.momentary = YES; btn.segmentedControlStyle = UISegmentedControlStyleBar; btn.tintColor = color; [btn addTarget:self action:@selector(action:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged]; Note please that the momentary and segmentedControlStyle properties do matter, and that an image can be used instead of a NSString * name. A stretchable image with end caps works fine if you can use a finite set of canned images, but that doesn't fit the requirement! E.g., buttonImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"button.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:26 topCapHeight:16];
