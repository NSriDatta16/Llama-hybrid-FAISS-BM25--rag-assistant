Mercurial, authentication by key

I have such section in my ~/.hgrc config file [auth] repo.prefix = ssh://hguser@192.168.132.72/repos repo.key = /home/zerkms/.ssh/mercurial-repo/id_rsa But when I write: hg clone ssh://hguser@192.168.132.72/repos/rps . mercurial still requires password to enter. What have I done wrong? To prevent obvious questions: Yes, there is a valid key in the specified path and it works if use it with ssh-agent . My question is how to work with keys in [auth] section.
