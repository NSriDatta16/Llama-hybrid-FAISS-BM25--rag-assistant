You're right that this analysis will not be causal, but it could still be interesting for you to perform.

One way to attempt to overcome issues with your planned analysis would be to construct treatment and control groups. Research Difference-in-Differences to learn more about this. There are other ideas, too, that might be worth your time and build upon the ideas above. Here is one from Google that goes into great detail on how they dealt with this very problem via bayesian structural time series models (it also provides both python and r code to boot).
