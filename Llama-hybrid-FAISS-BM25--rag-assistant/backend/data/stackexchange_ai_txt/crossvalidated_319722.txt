What happens in the fully connected layer of a Deep-Q-Network?

I am currently reading Deepminds "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"-Paper (2013) and since I don't quite understand it, I would like to ask here. What exactly happens in each fully connected layer? I understand what the convolutional layers do. How do the fully connected layers decide on which action to take? From my understanding, we train, using the shown algorithm in the paper and when we finally got it trained, we just simply combine the information we get from the input with the weights and it's done. Please help me :)
