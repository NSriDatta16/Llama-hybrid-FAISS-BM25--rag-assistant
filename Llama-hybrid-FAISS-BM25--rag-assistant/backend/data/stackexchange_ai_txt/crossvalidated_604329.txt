Significant ICC value, but design effect <2: Is a mixed model approach justified?

An epidemiology study used mixed-level modelling to investigate the effect of individual and household-level exposures on malaria infection (Bannister-Tyrrell M. et al. Importance of household-level risk factors in explaining micro-epidemiology of asymptomatic malaria infections in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia. Sci Rep . 2018; 8(1). The authors seemed to justify their use of an MLM approach based on the ICC of the null model being statistically significant (ICC: 0.19, p = 0.046). However, I am reading another paper - A practical guide to multilevel modelling. Peugh J. Journal of School Psychology 48 (2010) 85 - 112 - where the author states that "a non-zero ICC estimate does not necessarily indicate the need for multilevel analyses" . Rather, it is, according to these authors, dependent on the design effect: DE = 1 + (n - 1)ICC Where n is the average number of individuals in each cluster, which, in the paper above is 4.2. Using the numbers from the malaria paper gives me a DE = 1.608. Peugh goes on to say that "some researchers believe that design effect estimates greater than 2.0 indicate a need for MLM", which, given the values from the malaria paper indicates that an MLM approach was not needed after all. I have also read another paper (cited in another post on this website): Nezlek J. "An introduction to multilevel modeling for social and personality psychology" Social and Personality Psychology Compass 2/2 (2008): 842â€“860, where the authors seem to suggest that if the hierarchal structure of the data indicates clustering, an MLM is justified regardless of the ICC (presumably the design effect then also). I am confused as I do not have the statistical knowledge/background to make a judgement call myself. The reason I am nitpicking over this is because, like the malaria study above, I have hierarchal data where the ICC is statistically significant but the design effect is only 1.68. And, if I am justified in using traditional single-level logistic regression then my sample size can be smaller, which would help as I am planning a secondary analysis of existing data where the sample size is fairly limited (using an MLM approach, the sample size only has sufficient power to detect a significant difference if the effect size is around 0.7, for a medium effect size (0.5) the power of the study, given an MLM approach, is only 50%). So, should I be considering the ICC, the DE, or both in my decision-making?
