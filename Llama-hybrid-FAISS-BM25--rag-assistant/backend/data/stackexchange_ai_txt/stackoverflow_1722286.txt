You're right that the emphasis in ASP.NET MVC is on the implementation of the View and the Controller - this is because those were elements that were not well supported - View in particular - in ASP.NET. Model on the other hand we've had in abundance almost from the start so that is not, pragmatically, an issue that needed to be addressed. You're also right the convention goes a long way toward making a framework useable however it also places constraints on the developer, sometimes this is good others less so. In terms of things like validation and probably some other stuff that's convention based - MS is taking steps in that direction using annotation, it seems to me there's a lot that seems to be using a meta-data/annotation route to provide the sort of benefit you get from strong conventions in a more generic fashion.
