Do negative probabilities/probability amplitudes have applications outside quantum mechanics?

Quantum Mechanics has generalized probability theory to negative/imaginary numbers, mostly to explain interference patterns, wave/particle duality and generally weird things like that. It can be seen more abstractly, however, as a noncommutative generalisation of Bayesian probability (quote from Terrence Tao). I'm curious about these things, though by no means an expert. Does this have any applications outside Quantum Mechanics? Just curious.
