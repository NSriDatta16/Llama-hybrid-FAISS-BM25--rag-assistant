It seems IE7 is sharing same session cookie in multiple tabs. Is there a workaround for the same scenario. Well no. Cookies are by design shared between all instances of the same browser, whether in multiple tabs or multiple windows. You can only get two separate sessions by using different browsers, like an instance of IE and one of Firefox. This changes a little in IE8, but in quite a complicated way you probably don't want to rely on. See http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/05/06/session-cookies-sessionstorage-and-ie8.aspx This is why you should generally not be using cookies/sessions for keeping track of partially-completed transactions; one transaction will always interfere with the other. Better to either: keep track of all incomplete transaction data in page/form data, like hidden fields if that's too much data to keep passing back and forth, create an ID for the transaction that is remembered through page data, and store the actual data in the database. You can also use a unique ID tied to the page to generate more unique cookie names, eg. 'preference.1234=foo' instead of just 'preference=foo', so that each instance will have its own cookies.
