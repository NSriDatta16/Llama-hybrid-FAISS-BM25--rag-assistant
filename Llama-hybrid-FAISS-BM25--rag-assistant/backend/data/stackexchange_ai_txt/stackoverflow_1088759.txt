For remote debugging you should use JPDA . There's a sort of tutorialish article about it available here . In short, start your JVM with the argument: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000,suspend=n and you are able to connect to the underlying JVM listening on port 8000 via the standard Eclipse debugger.
