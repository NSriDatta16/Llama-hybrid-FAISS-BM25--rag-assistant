Linq to SQL - design question

HI, Currently i have one big datacontex with 35 tables (i dragged all my DB tables to the designer). I must admit it is very comfortable cause i have ORM to my full DB and query with linq is easy and simple. My questions are: 1. Would you consider it bad design to have one datacontext with 35 tables or should i split it to logic units? 2. Is there any performance penalties for using such a big datacontext? Thanks, Pini.
