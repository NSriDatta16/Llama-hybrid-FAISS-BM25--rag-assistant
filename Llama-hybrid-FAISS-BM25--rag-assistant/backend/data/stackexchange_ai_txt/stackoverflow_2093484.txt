Download bandwidth difference in Operating Systems?

Hello I've recently discovered an interesting thing. I've made my own Speedmeter using Flash CS4 and ActionScript 3.0 . The Download side is based on downloading 2 Mp3 noise files . Using the built-in method getBytesLoaded() and a simple math it's easy to calculate actual connection speed. Actual speed is evaluated every second. It works pretty good and the actual and average speed is very accurate under Windows. But when I've tried this under Ubuntu the actual speed results are different--and by different I mean that my connection from ISP is 5 Mbit/s and it sometimes shows like 7 or 8 Mbit/s . But the average speed seems to be good. What causes this strange behaviour? Does Ubuntu have some kind of download cacheing thing?
