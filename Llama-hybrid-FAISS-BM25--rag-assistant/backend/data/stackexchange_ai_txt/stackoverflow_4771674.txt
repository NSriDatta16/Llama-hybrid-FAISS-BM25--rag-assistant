quick question about HTML5 article and figure element

I have a section where there is a image of a site and a paragraph thats referencing to that site. I am wondering what would be the correct way, in your opinion how I should wrap these 2 HTML objects. I have originally thought this would just work(ignore .img-wrap and the h2 ): Featured Project Title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, seddo eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco But what if my client adds multiple paragraphs? It will be styled with a background color and margin so it wouldn't look right. Wouldn't figure and figcaption be appropriate? I can't really tell when I read on it on HTML5Doctor. Featured Project Title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, seddo eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco Or maybe just wrap the paragraph?
