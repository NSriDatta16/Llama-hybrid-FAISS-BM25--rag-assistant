Why overfitting is a problem for neural networks but not for models fitted through MCMC methods?

why for neural networks it is advised to set a test dataset apart to check if it overfitted while for statistical models fitted through mcmc this is never done? if a model has too many parameters shouldn't it overfit with both methods?
