What is the meaning of preserving local or global structure of the data?

I read about PaCMAP dimensionality reduction method ( PaCMAP ). They wrote that this method preserving both local and global structure of the data in original space . What is the meaning of preserving local structure of the data ? What is the meaning of preserving global structure of the data ? Can you please add examples for those preserving structures ?
