RNN is applicable. Each test is a time step. Each time step has an output, which is the label. The input of each time step is the features of the test and/or patient (You may also want to include the true label of the previous time step as the input of the current time step, since in test data you have some past test result of a patient). The RNN is fed patient by patient. You may wanna check many-to-many RNN ( The last example in the first figure ). I think your case is a common application in which RNN time series is used. So you may find a lot of papers and blogs about the design and implementation.
