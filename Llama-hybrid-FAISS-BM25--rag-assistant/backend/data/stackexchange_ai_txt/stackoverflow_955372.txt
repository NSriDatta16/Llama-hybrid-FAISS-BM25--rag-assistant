If I understand you correctly, you want to keep playing the sound as long as the slider is touched, whether it's moving or not. To do this, register one method as the target for UIControlEventTouchDown (and perhaps UIControlEventTouchDragInside) events and another for some combination of UIControlEventTouchDragExit/TouchUpOutside/TouchUpInside/TouchCancel (depending on what you need). The first method starts playing the sound and the second one stops it. If you want to play another sound when the slider is still touched but not moving, I would recommend starting a timer each time you receive a TouchDown/ValueCahanged/etc event: self.touchTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval: kDelay target:self selector:@selector(noMovement:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO]; Then, whenever you receive another ValueChanged even, you cancel the timer and trigger another (or, better, reschedule the original one). When the timer triggers, it means the user hasn't moved the slider since kDelay, and you can change the sound being played. (You need to cancel the timer when you get a TouchUpInside/Outside event too.)
