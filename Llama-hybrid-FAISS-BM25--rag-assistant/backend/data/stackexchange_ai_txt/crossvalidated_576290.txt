Bickel & Lehmann (1975) suggest three criteria that a measure of location $\mu$ ought to meet to be worthy of the characterization, & it seems to me they might as well have talked of central tendency. The criteria are these: $\mu(X) \geq \mu(Y)$ when $X$ is stochastically larger than $Y$ , i.e. when $\Pr(X > k) \geq \Pr(Y > k)$ for any $k$ & $\Pr(X > k) > \Pr(Y > k)$ for at least some $k$ $\mu(aX+b) = a \mu(X) + b$ for $a>0$ $\mu(-X) = -\mu(X)$ (The 2nd & 3rd together ensure that $\mu$ identifies the centre of symmetry of a symmetric distribution.) It's already clear from @Ben's answer that the mode sometimes only barely meets the first criterion (perhaps oddly, B. & L. don't mention the mode): the scale family of exponential distributions is totally ordered, yet each distribution has the same mode. † Worse still, it can fail to meet it: let $X$ have a triangular distribution on [0,10] with mode 1, & $Y$ a triangular distribution on [0,4] with mode 2; then $X$ is stochastically larger than $Y$ despite having a lesser mode. The median (obviously) & the mean (see https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3116135/59351 ) meet all three criteria, by the way. All the same, the mode seems fairly well entrenched as a measure of "central tendency", whatever exactly that's supposed to be. Perhaps it'd be sensible to follow B. & L. in requiring measures of location to meet all three criteria & then requiring measures of central tendency to meet only the 2nd & 3rd. On the other hand, the geometric, harmonic, &c., means perhaps have a claim to be measures of central tendency in their own right, though not of location; so there's a case for saying measures of central tendency need only meet the 1st criterion. At any rate just making such distinctions is the interesting & useful part. † In light of this example it's tempting to propose an additional criterion along the lines of 1.(a) $\mu(X) > \mu(Y)$ when $\Pr(X > k) > \Pr(Y > k)$ for any $k$ such that $0 k) or $0 k) .
