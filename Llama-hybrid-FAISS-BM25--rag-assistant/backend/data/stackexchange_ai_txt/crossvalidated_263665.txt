Transformations for Logistic Regression Predictors

I was curious about what types of transformations (if any) are used on predictors for logistic regression. Linear regression transformations seem fairly straightforward; scatter and density plots can help identify if logging the predictors or using a polynomial is necessary. I haven't read too much on similar types of predictor transformations for logistic models. I was just curious if there are common transformations and, if so, how are they identified (graph, etc.)?
