Any penalized ensemble classifiers in `Scikit-learn` that result in sparse solutions?

Is there an ensemble classifier that results in sparse solutions for the feature vector like Lasso Regression? With Logistic Regression, I can choose L1 penalization from the penalty hyperparameter. Is my only option to build an ensemble with VotingClassifier to do this or is there an out-of-the-box ensemble classifier in sklearn that is known to produce sparse solutions?
