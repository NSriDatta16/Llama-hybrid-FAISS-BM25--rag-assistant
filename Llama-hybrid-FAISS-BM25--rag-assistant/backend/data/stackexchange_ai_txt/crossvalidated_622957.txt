Estimating posterior of proportion of positives in population from per-observation probabilities

I have a sample from some population of 0s and 1s and need to estimate the posterior of the proportion of 1s in this population. But the catch is: for each observation in the sample I only have probabilities of the observation being positive. If I had true labels for each observation I would just go with $ Beta(1+num\_positive, 1+num\_negative) $ taking $ Beta(1, 1) $ as prior. But in my case where I have probabilities what should the solution be? One solution I can think of is $ Beta(1+\sum_i p_i, 1 + n - \sum_i p_i) $ where $n$ is sample size and $p_i$ are per observation probabilities. Basically taking the expectations of the numbers of positives and negatives. Am I thinking in the right direction? The practical reason for this: the probabilities come from a perfectly calibrated binary classifier outputs on an unlabeled dataset and I need to estimate credible interval of the proportion of positives in this dataset. Also what about the case where instead of perfectly calibrated probabilities they themselves are random variables with certain distribution (let's say I perform Bayesian Platt scaling and have posterior of A and B parameters)?
