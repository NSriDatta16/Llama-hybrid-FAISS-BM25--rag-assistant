For ii) you have several options but two of them are particularly appealing. One option is to go for a Wald-type confidence interval the other is to go with an interval based on the log-likelihood ratio statistic. For the Wald-type you first get the limiting distribution of the MLE of $\theta$ , thus something along the line $\hat \theta \sim N(\theta, \text{se}(\hat\theta)^2)$ , where $\text{se}(\hat\theta)^2$ is the estimated variance of the distribution of $\hat\theta$ , the MLE of $\theta$ . The Wald-type interval of approximate confidence level $1-\alpha$ is (the usual) $$ \hat\theta \pm z_{\alpha/2}\text{se}(\hat\theta). $$ where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is s.t. $P(Z\leq z_{\alpha/2}) = \alpha/2$ and $Z\sim N(0,1)$ . This is what JohnK is suggesting in his answer. For the confidence interval based on the log-likelihood ratio statistic, you find the full explanation here with the associated R code. You'll have to adapt it to your situation; i.e. just replace the log-likelihood function used there with yours. Note that with this method you'll have to use a computer to compute the interval since the method entails the inversion of a non-linear function. These two confidence intervals are approximate in that the coverage probability for a given fixed sample will not typically be exactly $1-\alpha$ ; nor will it be always $\geq 1-\alpha$ . But, the guarantee is that for increasing sample size, we expect the coverage probability to converge at $1-\alpha$ .
