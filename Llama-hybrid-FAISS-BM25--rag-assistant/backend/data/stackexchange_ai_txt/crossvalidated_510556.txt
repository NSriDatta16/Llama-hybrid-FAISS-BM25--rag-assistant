Kushner (1964) (H. J. Kushner. A new method of locating the maximum of an arbitrary multipeak curve in the presence of noise.J. Basic Engineering, 86:97â€“106,1964.) is probably the first one with PI acquisition function. And Bayesian optimization builds on the top of the Gaussian process regression (GPR). Note that the Gaussian process and Gaussian process regression are similar but distinct concepts.
