How to rewrite a sum of probabilities formula as multiplications?

I have an equation like that: $p(r|s)= \frac{p(s,r)}{p(s)}=\frac{ \sum_{w,c} p(c,s,r,w)}{\sum_{w,c,r} p(c,s,r,w)} $ I am new to probability and I want to learn that how can I write sum formula as multiples of probabilities? PS 1: I want something like: $p(r|s)= \frac{ p(w,r|c,s)p(c,s)p(w,r|~c,s)p(~c,s)...}{ p(s|w,r,c)p(w,r,c)...} $ PS 2: Here is my Bayesian network: PS 3: Because of conditionally independence I have that equations: $p(w|r,s,c) = p(w|r,s)$ $p(r,s|c) = p(r|c)p(s|c)$ $p(r|s,c) = p(r|c)$ $p(s|r,c) = p(s|c)$
