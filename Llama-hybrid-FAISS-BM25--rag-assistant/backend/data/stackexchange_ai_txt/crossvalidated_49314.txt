I doubt that your question has a definite answer just from mathematics/statistics point of view. In your position, I would just try out the different combinations. Also notice that if x2 and x4 are strongly correlated and in the same scale range, their difference will be likely in a much smaller scale, so you might need to re-scale the difference before applying PCA.
