Combining P-Values from multiple trials of the same experiment

this is my first question here, a little background about me, im a biomedical engineer, im studying a PhD in Neuroscience, and a Micromaster in Statistics and Data Science. Here in my lab, very few people are interested at maths , models, etc. (incredible i know...) So i have so little references to ask about the best math procedure to validate or model things. Once said my sad situation lol this is my question: Im doing a Causality test based on Granger Causality between 3 zones in the brain. The analysis give me p - values associated with statistical causal conections between signals. as an example of a event of interest: ZONE P Val 1 -> 2 .056345 1 -> 3 .005321 2 -> 1 .003214 2 -> 3 .000123 3 -> 1 .245021 3 -> 2 .002455 So imagine i have 50 events of interest and i apply this analysis for each one, then i will have 50 p-values per conection, and i want to give as a result the "mean" granger causal connection per pair of zones, as a function of the statistical significance, in other words by the p-values: Â¿What is the better way to combine all those p-values? I can use the Fisher method? or apply the mean of the p-values over the trials, or there are more appropiate methods? Thanks Thanks a lot since now.
