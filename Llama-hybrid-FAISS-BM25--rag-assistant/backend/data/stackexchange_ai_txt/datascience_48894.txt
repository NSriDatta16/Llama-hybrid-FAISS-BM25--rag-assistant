Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) is an open source machine learning library used primarily for computer visions applications. OpenCV contains over 2,500 optimized algorithms (including state of the art Computer Vision ones). OpenCV was built natively with C++, but includes interfaces for C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB. This software is popular for large-scale commercial, startup, and individual applications.
