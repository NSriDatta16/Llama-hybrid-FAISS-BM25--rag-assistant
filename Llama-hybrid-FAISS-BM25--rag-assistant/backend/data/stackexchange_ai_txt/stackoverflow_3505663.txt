Scale Two Canvases Proportionally

I am trying to think of the best way to scale two panels proportionally. If I have a grid that contains two canvases, both stacked horizontally next to each other, I want canvas (A) to scale to the size of canvas (B), proportionally, though. So, essentially, if canvas (B) increases in size, canvas (A) decreases, and if canvas (A) increases, canvas (B) decreases. I'm thinking of using a converter to do this, but wanted to know if anyone had any good ideas. Below is a link that demonstrates the desired behavior. Refer to the pan/zoom control in the lower right corner of the screen. That control represents a preview of the main screen. If you press on the zoom button within the pan/zoom control, the main screen zooms in, and the rectangular "pan" area in the pan/zoom control decreases in size. http://quince.infragistics.com/#/Search/ViewPattern $pattern=Button+Groups/PatternExamples$guid=289a497a-6632-455a-87b6-74ee70c2d3be Thanks!
