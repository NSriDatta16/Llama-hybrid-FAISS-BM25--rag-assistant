It looks like the current JDT API (Java Development Tool, the part that includes package renamming) does only rename one package at a time (and not the sub-packages) See: bug 255484 When refactoring a package, that has subpackages, JDT creates child packages again, instead of just renaming the parent bug 255683: IPackageFragment should offer API for hierarchical rename we need an API on IPackageFragment to rename not only the fragment but also also all subpackages. Effectively, the implementation would rename the folder of the package fragment and then update the package declarations in all contained CUs (including those in subpackages) So it's "by design" at then moment (eclipse 3.5), but an enhancement is logged and will be taken into account for 3.6. Note: that "lack of feature" has been noted since 2005! bug 109988 I was testing the new hierarchical package rename and had two source folders with same package structure. To rename the packages in both I had to do the same operation twice. It would be nice to get a hint and being asked whether the package rename should be applied to the other source folder(s) as well.
