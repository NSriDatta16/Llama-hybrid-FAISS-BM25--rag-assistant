If your confounder is an effect modifier (i.e., the treatment effect varies across its levels), then it is important to stratify based on the confounder. A single treatment effect doesn't tell the whole story. If your confounder is not an effect modifier, you can still stratify based on the confounder, but rather than present a separate effect estimate for each level, you can compute a marginal effect, which is a weighted average of the stratum effects (where the weights are the proportion of individuals in each stratum). This way, you can present a single effect estimate to your readers, you don't have to consider multiple comparisons, and you still address the bias due to the confounder. This latter method is called "standardization" or the "g-formula" in the epidemiology literature. You can still perform standardization in the presence of effect modification, but you need to ensure your readers understand that the marginal effect is generalizable only to a population with the same proportion of individuals in each level of the confounder.
