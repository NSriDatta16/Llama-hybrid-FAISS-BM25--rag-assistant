Supervised Learning is learning from labeled data, while in Unsupervised Learning, you learn without labels. Now to your questions: Could someone clarify whether Facebook's Prophet and ARIMA are considered supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms in the context of time series forecasting? They are supervised learning algorithms, as they are autoregressive models, so the target is inferred directly from the time series value you want to predict. What are the key characteristics that determine whether a time series forecasting method like Prophet or ARIMA belongs to supervised or unsupervised learning categories? As I mentioned at the beginning, it depends if you need labels or not, these methods are not unsupervised. Unsupervised Learning could be for example Clustering, Feature Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, none of which Prophet or ARIMA do. Are there specific features or elements in the implementation of these algorithms that make them align more closely with supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms? No, the kind of model defines if its unsupervised or supervised, this does not depend on the implementation.
