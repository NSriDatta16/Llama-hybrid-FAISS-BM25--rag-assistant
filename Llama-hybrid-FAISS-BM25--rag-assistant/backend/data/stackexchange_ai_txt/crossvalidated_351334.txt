Terminology, is this a mixed effects logistic regression?

I have built this model in R and I am getting confused with the terminology. For each individual ID I have a number of failures fail and successes success and one treatment. mod1=glmer(cbind(fail,success)~treatment+(1|ID),family=binomial) Is it correct to call this a mixed effects logistic regression? Is it correct to say that this is a kind of GLMM?
