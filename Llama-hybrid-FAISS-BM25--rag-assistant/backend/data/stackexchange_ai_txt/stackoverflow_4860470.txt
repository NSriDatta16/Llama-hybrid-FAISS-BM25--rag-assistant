textWidth = -1 means, that "[...] the text will not be broken into multiple lines unless it is enforced through an explicit line break or a new paragraph." ( QTextDocument::textWidth() ) So, if you want to get the length of your QGraphicsTextItem you can't use textWidth , but instead you need the actual length of the String within this QGraphicsTextItem . Have a look at QGraphicsTextItem::toPlainText() , which returns a QString. Call size() on that string. int length = my_graphics_text_item.toPlainText().size() Now you have the number of characters in this string and can implement a resize function to make your rectangle grow, when there are too many characters. It's a kind of workaround, but I hope it helps solving your problem.
