Is there a way to subscribe to IIs application pool events?

I'm in the need of monitoring IIs (v6) events. More specifically the application pool and Web Site events. Is there some API or WMI instrumentation to do this? This is not from an application perpective, but from an adminsitration perspective. I am not interested in starting, stopping or recycling programmatically. I'm interested in monitoring the status. Polling is not very elegant, are there any events that I can hook into? From managed or unmanaged code, it doesn't matter.
