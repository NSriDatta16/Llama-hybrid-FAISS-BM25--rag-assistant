I agree with @Ed Swangren, it will take a lot of playing with samples of data for a lot of sources. To me, it sounds like the trick will be to limit or hopefully eliminate false positives. My experience with babies is they are much louder crying than the environment. so, keeping track of the average measurements (freq/amp/??) of the normal environment and then classifying how well the changes match the characteristics of a crying baby which changes from kid to kid, so you'll probably want a system that 'learns'. Best of luck. update: you might find this library useful http://naudio.codeplex.com/
