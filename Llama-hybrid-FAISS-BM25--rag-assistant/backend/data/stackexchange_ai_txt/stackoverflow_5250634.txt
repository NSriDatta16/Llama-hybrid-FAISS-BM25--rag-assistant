Since all my type T's do have a constructor of the form T(G) I don't understand why I can't do new T(temp) . Also I edited my original question to display the failed hack described in the previous comment. Java generics is an instrument to guarantee type safety, not to create different code depending on parameter. The compiler erases most type variables, so at runtime the actual type T is not known at all - thus we can't invoke any of its constructors (or create arrays of this type, by the way). This way we can use the generic method (or class) with types which were not yet existent when the method was created. And actually, the compiler could not guarantee that all possible classes have such constructors, as there always could be later subclasses without. So, in your case, you should think about using some kind of factory object, which takes a G and gives back the right T object, (for example a Transformer type, like Andrzej proposed.)
