How to average several posteriors distributions from a Monte Carlo Simulation

Say you produce several posteriors distributions from different runs of the same model under different seeds. That is to say you have something like the following: library(ggplot2) set.seed(10100101) N I would like to add to the plot the "average posterior" produced by the different runs of my model. At first I thought that I would be as easy as to apply the mean of the posteriors. However, I am getting something that converges to zero because I am simply averaging values that came from a standard normal distribution as you can see in the picture below: library(ggplot2) set.seed(10100101) N Finally, my questions is how to correctly average the posteriors generated by my model under different seeds.
