The answer to this question depends on the people involved and the size of the project. In general it is easier to keep each layer of the application coherent if there is a single person writing the layer (horizontal separation), but with a close knit team of good devs, you could slice a project vertically and organize the labor by actual "features." Working horizontally like you suggest breeds less overall knowledge of the application, since each dev knows their layer, and not the other layers.
