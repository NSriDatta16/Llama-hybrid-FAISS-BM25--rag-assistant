As a variation on the rental analogy, what about a car park analogy? The car park has numbered spaces - those are your basic units of memory (C chars - which sounds almost like cars ... ;). If you want to park your car, it doesn't really matter which space you get - they're all pretty equal. You can even explain memory fragmentation this way - if you want to park your B-double semi-trailer, it's not just enough to have 6 spaces - you'll need 6 adjacent parking spaces.
