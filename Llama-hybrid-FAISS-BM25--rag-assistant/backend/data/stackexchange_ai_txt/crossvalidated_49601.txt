I think you want to go for something along option A). Obviously, patients are nested within physicians, i.e. you want to account for the effect of physicians on your measurements. Finally, you are dealing with repeated measures on the patient level. Approaching the multilevel/hierarchical modeling this way guarantees the correct shrinkage towards the appropriate levels of hierarchy. You want the individual time courses to tend towards the 'average' time course for this particular physician, which in turn shrinks toward the sample 'average'.
