I think I don't understand something here. An NSInputStream can take data from three places: a socket, an NSData object, or a file. You haven't said that you want to use a socket, which leaves the other two as your data sources. Also, docs for NSStream say that only file-based streams are seekable. (NSStream, overview, 3rd paragraph) Given that, I'd think that an NSData object would be a better choice. An NSData object will handle both files and bytes (which I think is what you mean by data in memory). But you consider that and say that you'd prefer to stick with streams. Is there some other consideration here? (Edit) Sorry, I should have made this a real answer. My answer for the issue you've described is that using NSData really is the right thing to do. If you prefer a different answer, then please give more details.
