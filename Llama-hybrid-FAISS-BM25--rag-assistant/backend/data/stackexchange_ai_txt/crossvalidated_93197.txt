Determine the probability density function

I have the following problem. Let's say g is a function of A and R . I run a Monte Carlo analysis to determine the pdf of g considering the real pdf of R but with A having a rectangular pdf. Now I have new information about the pdf of A . My question is: Do I need to run my Monte Carlo again or can I apply to my old pdf of g the newly available pdf of A ? EDIT 1: Both old and new pdfs of A share the same minimum and maximum possible values, i.e. both pdfs are bounded by the same lower and upper limits. The difference is that while in the first Monte Carlo run A was considered to have a rectangular pdf, now with new information A pdf is Gaussian. It can be assumed that A and R are independent. Let the old pdf of A be a uniform pdf with minimum value equal to a=0 and maximum value equal to b=0.1 and the new pdf of A be a truncated Gaussian with equal a and b and an average value of 0.06 and a standard deviation equal to 0.01. EDIT 2: If g was a function of R , A1 , A2 , ..., An and all these random variables were independent is it also possible to update the old pdf of g not needing to run Monte Carlo again?
