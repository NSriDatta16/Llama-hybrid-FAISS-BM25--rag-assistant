And there I was thinking that well designed code should stand up on its own to be read, not deciphered. I understand that people who care about obfuscation are encouraged to use tools like dotfuscator and its equivalents in other environments. Obfuscation in the sense of making the code harder to decompile though, not just making it a pain to work with. Why anyone would deliberately design horrible code (except to demonstrate the gotchas) is beyond me.
