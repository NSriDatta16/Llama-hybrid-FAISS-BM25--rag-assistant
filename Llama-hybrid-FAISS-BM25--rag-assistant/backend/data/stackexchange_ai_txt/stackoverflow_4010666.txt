Well just to give you an example, I am doing somehting simmilar. In ColdFusion, Hibernate is integrated and in order to save your Hibernate Object, you hvae to do EntitySave(Obj). However what we have done is build the Orm object, and then use a mongoDB Coldfusion component and just save the object by going mongo.Save(obj,collectionName).
