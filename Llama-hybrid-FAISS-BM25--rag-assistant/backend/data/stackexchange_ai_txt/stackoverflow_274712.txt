Depends on what you are using the LOC for. As a complexity measure - not so much. Maybe the 100KLOC are mostly code generated from a simple table, and the 10KLOC kas 5KLOC regexps. However, I see every line of code associated with a running cost. You pay for every line as long as the program lives: it needs to be read when maintained, it might contain an error that needs to be fixed, it increases compile time, get-from-source-control and backup times, before you change or remove it you may need to find out if anyone relies on it etc. The average cost may be nanopennies per line and day, but it's stuff that adds up. KLOC can be a first shot indicator of how much infrastructure a project needs. In that case, I would include comments and tests - even though the running cost of a comment line is much lower than one of the regexp's in the second project.
