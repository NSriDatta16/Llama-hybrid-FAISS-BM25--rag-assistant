Injecting an XML fragment into the current document from an external file

I'm currently parsing an XML file using REXML and trying to come up with a way of inserting an XML fragment from an internal file. Currently, I'm using some logic like the following: doc.elements.each('//include') do |element| handleInclude( element ) end def handleInclude( element ) if filename = element.attributes['file'] data = File.open( filename ).read doc = REXML::Document.new( data ) element.parent.replace_child( element, doc.root ) end end Where my XML looks like the following: But this seems a little bit clunky, and I'm worried that REXML might not always parse XML fragments correctly due to absence of a proper root node in some cases. Is there a better way of doing this?
