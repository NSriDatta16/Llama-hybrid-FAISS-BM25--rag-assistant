Within the comments I can see you keep saying 'emerged faster/quicker/in a shorter amount of time' but a plain logistic regression, with the variables you've presented us, does not answer this question. The plain interpretation of a coefficient in a logistic regression is: a change in one unit of the independent variable will cause beta change in the log-odds of the dependent variable, given the other independent variables fixed. Now, to interpret log-odds, keep in mind that a log-odds of 5 is equivalent to a probability of y = 1 close to 0.99. (you can see the code for a table showing this right here ). With that in mind, what I can interpret from your glm output is: it is highly unlikely that a emerged result will happen if sp == 0, unless the observation has a trait closer to 35 associated with it. if the observation is of sp == 1, the chance of emerged is higher, and the higher the trait the greater the chance (at lowering rates of importance). But, a picture is worth a thousand words they say, and to picture this type of relationship, there is something called a counter factual plot, which I've built using the glm output you've provided. You can sure make it tangible, pretty, and more informative, but I think you get the idea. The code I've used to make this plot is: library(tidyverse) cf % crossing(tibble(sp = c(0, 1))) %>% mutate(pred_log_odds_ratio = -66.0207 + sp*43.7401 + trait*2.0491 + sp*trait*(-1.2903), pred_p_emerge = exp(pred_log_odds_ratio)/(1+exp(pred_log_odds_ratio)) ) cf %>% mutate(sp = as.factor(sp)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = trait, y = pred_p_emerge)) + geom_line(aes(group = sp, color = sp), size = 1)
