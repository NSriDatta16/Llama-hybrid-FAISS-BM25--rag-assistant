I would suggest you to create your own User Control for TextBox, DataGridView and any other controls that you want to capitalize it. That way, you can simply drag and drop your User Controls to any forms in your application. Sample Code: public partial class CapTextBox : UserControl { public CapTextBox() { InitializeComponent(); } private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { textBox1.Text = textBox1.Text.ToUpper(); textBox1.SelectionStart = textBox1.Text.Length; } }
