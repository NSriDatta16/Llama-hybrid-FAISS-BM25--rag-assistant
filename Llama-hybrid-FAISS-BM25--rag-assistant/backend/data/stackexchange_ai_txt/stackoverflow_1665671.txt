jquery - rearranging elements on a page using dropzones?

Anybody come across a good plugin or code to allow you to rearrange elements on a page using drap and drop and dropzones? iGoogle and windows live does similar things.... Be nice to be able to drag and drop and close an element - add new elements.. And persisting this somewhere, i presume in cookies or an external db? I took a look on the jquery UI stuff and its got potential but it would be nice to leave a dotted line of the actually element in its original position while dragging so you can see where you was etc Anyone come across something like this? thanks
