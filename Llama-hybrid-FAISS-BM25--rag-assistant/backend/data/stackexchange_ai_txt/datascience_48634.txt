If you look at this from the perspective of "this isn't my job, so why should I do it" then that's a fairly common, general problem not specific to data science. Ultimately, your job is to do whatever the boss tells you to do, but in practice there is little reason for the boss to be dictatorial about this and usually they can be persuaded. Or at least they will give you a sincere explanation of why it has to be that way. But as far as appealing to authority, there is no official definition of "Data Science" that says you can only do at most X% data cleaning. The authority is whoever is paying you, so long as they have the legal right to stop paying you. You could also look at it from another perspective: Is this a good use of your time? It sounds like you took a job to do some tasks (which you mean by "data science") but you are having to do another thing (which you call "data wrangling"). Job descriptions and personal feelings are a bit beside the point here because there is something more pertinent: The company presumably pays you a good amount of money to do something that only you can do (the data science). But it's having you do other things instead, which could be done by other people who are some combination of more capable, more motivated or less expensive. If the data wrangling could be done by someone making half your salary, then it makes no sense to pay you twice as much to do the same thing. If it could be done faster by someone paid the same salary, the same logic applies. Therefore it is a waste of resources (especially money) to have the company assign this task to you. Coming at it from this perspective, you might find it much easier to make your superiors see your side of things. Of course, at the end of the day, somebody has to do the data wrangling. It may be that the cheapest, fastest, easiest way of doing it -- the best person for the job, is you. In that case, you're kind of out of luck. You could try to claim it's not part of your contract, but what are the odds they were naive enough to put something that specific in the contract?
