I was about to post something snarky about you not reading the article, but when I saw that it was just a page of vitriolic rage with no explanation, I figured I'd answer. It's because there are better ways of doing what you want to do -- namely, by using CSS in the way he does in the article, he has separated the semantics of the elements he's displaying from how he's displaying them. Why is this a big deal? Well, for one, he can more easily transform how his page looks when it's shown on different platforms (mobile, desktop) and media (screen, print, a screen reader for the blind), simply by editing CSS and not having to touch the document itself. This feature of CSS is pure gold. On the other hand, if you use a construct such as this, you put in a hard constraint about your document's presentation that sticks around no matter what media or platform you're dealing with. What makes him so mad? Because once a developer has come in before him and used , he has to take it out in order to get the benefits I just mentioned. That's why it's so frustrating. One bad developer can disable a whole host of development scenarios for every other developer who comes after. As far as CSS goes, I have to say that it's a very difficult subject to just pick up without reading all about how it works. It's hard to explain how the clear attribute works if you don't understand floats . I had quite a hard time myself until I bought a great book on the subject .
