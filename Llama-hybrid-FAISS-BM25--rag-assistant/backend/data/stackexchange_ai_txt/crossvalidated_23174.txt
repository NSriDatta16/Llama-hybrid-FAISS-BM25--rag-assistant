In the past I have used Median Absolute Deviation to test for outliers in a static series of data. This is a simple measure to implement and is related to standard deviation for normally distributed data points. It is very robust against outliers. I have used it for very large static data sets rather than with a time series but it should still be an efficient measure to detect outliers. The median absolute deviation is defined as the median of deviations from the median $$\text{MAD} = \text{median}_i\left(|X_i - \text{median}_j(X_j)|\right)$$ and you can find out more about it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation
