Interprete GARCH residuals QQ plot

How to conclude, that time series' volatilty is not constant? I used GARCH, but have trouble with interpretation. I did the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution with GARCH residuals, which tells me that they are not normally distributed, but again I have trouble with interpretation of what that means for the time series. I m not very skilled in statistics.
