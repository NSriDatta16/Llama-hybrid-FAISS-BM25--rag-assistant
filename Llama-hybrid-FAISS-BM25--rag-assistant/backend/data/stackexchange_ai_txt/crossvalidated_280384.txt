Seasonal survival using coxph

I am having issues including "season" as a predictor variable in my survival analysis using cox proportional hazard models. I work with sage-grouse and have reason to believe their survival varies by season. I provided a sample data set below. library(survival) library(dplyr) BirdID I have formatted my data so that each row is a different season because I have time-dependent variables (e.g. Avg.Move = average distance moved per season). I'm guessing that this may be part of my problem. Anyway, when I try to run basic coxph models with different combinations of my predictors (Season and Avg.Move) I continually get errors. L I've tried coding Season as numeric (1,2,3,4) and binary (10000, 0100, 0010, 0001) but nothing has helped. Thanks in advance, Kyle
