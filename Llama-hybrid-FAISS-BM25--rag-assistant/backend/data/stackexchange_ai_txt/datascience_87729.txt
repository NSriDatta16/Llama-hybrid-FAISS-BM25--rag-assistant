I know this is a really old question, but if you can provide examples of the values that OpenRefine didn't cluster correctly, that you thought it should, we'd be happy to look at improving the tool. Having said that, I'd probably approach your problem from a different angle and instead of using text similarity clustering, I'd attempt to reconcile against a database of organization names like Wikidata or OpenCorporates. This has the advantage that it should take into account things like aliases, former names, etc which aren't similar from a string similarity point of view, but which humans have curated. Both of the examples given have OpenRefine reconciliation services that can be used for this.
