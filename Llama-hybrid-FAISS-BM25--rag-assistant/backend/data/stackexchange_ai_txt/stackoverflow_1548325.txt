My interest in ruby was for rails, like many other engineers. I started with this book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition It's awesome. I learned rails and ruby at the same time, basically. Some recommend learning ruby first, but I'm way too impatient for sound advice. Here's their book on strictly ruby, haven't read it but I imagine it's as good as the others. http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9
