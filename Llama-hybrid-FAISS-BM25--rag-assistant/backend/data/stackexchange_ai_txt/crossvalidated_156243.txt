Correlation coefficient is very small

I am currently doing a project for a class in which I am looking at yelp data. In the graph shown below, I am comparing a users average review rating with their total useful votes on their reviews. The variables in my eyes look to be definitely correlated, however the r value calculated seems to disagree. Could this be because of the large amounts of data I have? Maybe I'm missing the point of the correlation coefficient?
