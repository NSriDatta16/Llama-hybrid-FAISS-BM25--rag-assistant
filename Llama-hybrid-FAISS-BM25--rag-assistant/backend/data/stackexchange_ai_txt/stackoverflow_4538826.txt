Have a look at Weka . It's kind of popular in my neck of the woods... It's open source and written in Java. This will tell you about bayesian networks in Weka, from the abstract: Structure learning of Bayesian networks using various hill climbing (K2, B, etc) and general purpose (simulated annealing, tabu search) algorithms. Local score metrics implemented; Bayes, BDe, MDL, entropy, AIC. Global score metrics implemented; leave one out cv, k-fold cv and cumulative cv. Conditional independence based causal recovery algorithm available. Parameter estimation using direct estimates and Bayesian model averaging. GUI for easy inspection of Bayesian networks.
