Not an answer, but maybe related: Brockwell and Davis (Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, 2016), Proposition 2.2.1 says the following: Let $Z_t$ be a stationary time series with expectation zero and acf $\gamma_Z$ . If $\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi_j| , then the series $$ Y_t=\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_j Z_{t-j} $$ is stationary with expectation $0$ and acf $$ \gamma_Y(h)=\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_j\psi_k\gamma_Z(h+k-j). $$ If, however, one were to just delete some lags, the statement could not be proven. E.g., having a look at the "stationarity triangle" stated here , reveal that $$ Y_t=1.1Y_{t-1}-0.2Y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t $$ is stationary (in the sense of admitting a causal representation), while omitting the second lag and just keeping the explosive first lag $1.1Y_{t-1}$ clearly isn't.
