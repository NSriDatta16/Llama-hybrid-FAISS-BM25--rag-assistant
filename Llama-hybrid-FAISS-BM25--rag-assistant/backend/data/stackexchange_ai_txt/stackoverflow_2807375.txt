Essentially, fail fast (a.k.a. fail early ) is to code your software such that, when there is a problem, the software fails as soon as and as visibly as possible , rather than trying to proceed in a possibly unstable state. Fail Fast by Jim Shore edited by Martin Fowler http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf ... Fortunately, there’s a simple technique that will dramatically reduce the number of these bugs in your software. It won’t reduce the overall number of bugs, at least not at first, but it’ll make most defects much easier to find. The technique is to build your software to “fail fast.” Immediate and visible failure Some people recommend making your software robust by working around problems automatically. This results in the software “failing slowly.” The program continues working right after an error but fails in strange ways later on. A system that fails fast does exactly the opposite: when a problem occurs, it fails immediately and visibly. Failing fast is a nonintuitive technique: “failing immediately and visibly” sounds like it would make your software more fragile, but it actually makes it more robust. Bugs are easier to find and fix, so fewer go into production. ... Also note the related concept of a fail-fast iterator - an iterator that, after certain modifications to the collection outside of the iterator, throws as soon as possible rather than proceed in a potentially unstable, or non-deterministic state.
