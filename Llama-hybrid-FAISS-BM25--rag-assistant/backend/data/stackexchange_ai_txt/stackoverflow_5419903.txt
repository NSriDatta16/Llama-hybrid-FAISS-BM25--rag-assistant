Statistics is the scientific study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Numerous programming languages provide support for implementing statistical techniques. Consider whether your question would be better asked at CrossValidated , a Stack Exchange site for probability, statistics, data analysis, data mining, experimental design, and machine learning. StackOverflow questions on statistics should be about implementation and programming problems, not about theoretical discussions of statistics or research design. Therefore, this tag should never be used alone but always in combination with a specific programming language (like for example r , python , spss , sas , matlab ).
