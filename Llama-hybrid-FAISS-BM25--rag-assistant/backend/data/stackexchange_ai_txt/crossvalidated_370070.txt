You say "multiple observations" per week, is this in some irregular pattern? Then you have an unevenly spaced time series , and should look into methods/models for that. Should you aggregate data per week? That cannot really be answered in the abstract. Is it count data? sums of counts is a count, so yes, you should sum (not average). Is it sales data (for some nonoverlapping periods) you should sum. More general, if this is extensive variables, summing makes sense. Averaging is more problematical, it makes sense conceptually for intensive variables, but if will change the variance/correlation structure of the series, so can lead to misleading results. If you are able to construct (with advice in first paragraph) a weekly time series, you could look into modeling with arima. But maybe, in either case, start with some time series decomposition method. See also the comment by @DJohnson: The basic idea is that you want to understand the relationships over time in the absence of spurious relationships -- to the extent that this is statistically possible. There could be lots of issues lurking in your time series besides seasonality, e.g., autocorrelation, nonstationarity, trends, unit roots, and so on. Luckily, you have lots of data to work with. Look into removing these potential biases by developing "white noise" residuals and modeling that. One basic approach to this is a Holt-Winters decomposition of the data.
