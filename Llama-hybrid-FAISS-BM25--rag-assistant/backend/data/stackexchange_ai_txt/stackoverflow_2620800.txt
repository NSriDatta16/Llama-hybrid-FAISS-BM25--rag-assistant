I have the same kind of application. Some things to consider: you can cross query between collection bu not between databases. So It's probably better to have a database with all you data and then a collection for each Object. Then each document can contain any kind and number of fields. I tried to avoid embedding arrays b/c I had trouble query properly my object (it was working fine, but the architecture of my system was designed for this use) And a database can be shared between several sever automatically so space is not an issue (if you have more than 1 server)
