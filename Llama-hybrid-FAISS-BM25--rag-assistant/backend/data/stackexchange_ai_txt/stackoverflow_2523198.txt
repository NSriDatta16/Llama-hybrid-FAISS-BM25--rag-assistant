Handling Google clientLogin Captcha Example

I have a desktop application. I try to perform authentication using http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps.html However, whenever I get a Captcha challenge, I use a HTTP GET request (I test using web browser) to get the image to present to user. https://www.google.com/accounts/Captcha?ctoken=Y-DrsDJRiWNOP3gR7fq0PAq4Yxvi3UXewu7P7jgAKjk0eZKQ358nbh27-JZ3-nlzXvfKOD3JvZNXwmlRunyz8jPKzqmkOLw2LYb3ZWjg-tE%3A0gMUFttsSH7QwganSJd1aw However, I always get the images : Sorry, we are unable to handle your request at this time. Please try again later. Any idea what I had did wrong? Thanks!
