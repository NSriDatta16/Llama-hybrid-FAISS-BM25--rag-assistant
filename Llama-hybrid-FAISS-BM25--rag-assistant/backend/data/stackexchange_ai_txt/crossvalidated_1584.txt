Differences between factor analysis and principal component analysis are: • In factor analysis there is a structured model and some assumptions. In this respect it is a statistical technique which does not apply to principal component analysis which is a purely mathematical transformation. • The aim of principal component analysis is to explain the variance while factor analysis explains the covariance between the variables. One of the biggest reasons for the confusion between the two has to do with the fact that one of the factor extraction methods in Factor Analysis is called "method of principal components". However, it's one thing to use PCA and another thing to use the method of principal components in FA. The names may be similar, but there are significant differences. The former is an independent analytical method while the latter is merely a tool for factor extraction.
