Why does changing random seeds alter results?

I'm running some SVMs for a seminar and a friend of mine noted I should set a seed so my results don't change everytime I run the code. I was wondering why is that the case. If a different seed can induce different results, why should I trust SVMs at all? Should I set a specific seed or is it ok to just set the first number that comes to my mind?
