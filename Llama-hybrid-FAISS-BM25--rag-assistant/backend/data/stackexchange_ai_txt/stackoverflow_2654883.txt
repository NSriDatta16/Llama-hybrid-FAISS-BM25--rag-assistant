You'll want to do something like this using .appendTo() to make it faster and more important, work :) var tbl = $(" Advisor Packs In Pack In (£) Packs Out Pack Out (£) PDQs PDQ (£) ") $.each(data.AdvisorPerformances, function(i) { tbl.append(" " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].Advisor + " " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].PackInCount + " " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].PacksInValue + " " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].PacksOutCount + " " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].PaymentsInCount + " " + " " + data.AdvisorPerformances[i].PaymentsInValue + " " + " "); }); tbl.appendTo("#advisorPerformance"); $("#advisorPerfomance").addClass("NOTAPPLIEDSTYLE"); a.append() doesn't just append text and make it html, it's creating DOM elements, so your first line is currently creating an unclosed ...so from that point on you'll have unpredictable results. Instead either append complete valid elements, or build your table like I have above, then add it to the DOM. The above method creates the table outside the DOM in a document fragment then appends it, this is both faster and a bit cleaner. When complete it adds the entire table to #advisorPerformance .
