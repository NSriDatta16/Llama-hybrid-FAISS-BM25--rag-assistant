Machine learning accuracy for not a class-imbalanced problem

I would like know if the accuracy has an impact on not class-imbalanced dataset ? I know that accuracy is sensitive to class-imbalance and also always good to be able to appreciate precision and recall values. Is it also the case to not class-imbalanced dataset?
