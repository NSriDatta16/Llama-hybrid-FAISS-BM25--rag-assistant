Some additional things to consider (You have already been made aware of the copy semantics of STL containers): Are your objects really smaller than pointers to them? This becomes more relevant if you use any kind of smart pointer as those have a tendency to be larger. Copy operations are (often?) optimized to use memcpy() by the compiler. Especially this is probably not true for smart pointers. Additional dereferencing caused by pointers All the things I have mentioned are micro optimizations considerations and I'd discourage even thinking about them and go with them. On the other hand: A lot of my claims would need verification and would make for interesting test cases. Feel free to benchmark them.
