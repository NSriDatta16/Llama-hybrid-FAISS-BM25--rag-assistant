Can you execute a callback function instead of a whole php file?

$.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "some.php", data: "name=John&location=Boston", success: function(msg){ alert( "Data Saved: " + msg ); } }); Here is a typical example using jquery ajax to send variables to a php page for processing, where upon completion you get the returned html or json etc... I used something in wordpress that allows for the ajax to be sent to a callback function for all the processing instead of a whole php page. Basically I want to have all my callback functions in ajax.php and so it's more organized. Thanks
