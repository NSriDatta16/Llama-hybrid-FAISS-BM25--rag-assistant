Proper syntax in RoR for time in datetime comparison

I am trying to attribute the time param with .to_date to generate the proper comparison Organization.find(1140).events.all(:conditions => ["time How would I do that? I tried this : Organization.find(1140).events.all(:conditions => [time.to_date And that's a big fail :D
