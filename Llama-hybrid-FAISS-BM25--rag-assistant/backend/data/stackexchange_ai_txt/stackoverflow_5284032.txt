state-of-the-art of dimensionality algorithms

We know there are algorithms to reduce the dimension of data sets like PCA and Isomap What is the state of the art in the reducing dimensionality to data sets. Do you have an example, maybe on MATLAB? Lets say we have a data set with 100,000 attributes like Dorothea Data Set (Chemical compounds represented by structural molecular features must be classified as active (binding to thrombin) or inactive. This is one of 5 datasets of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge.) Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate Number of Instances: 1950 Area: Life Attribute Characteristics: Integer Number of Attributes: 100000 Date Donated 2008-02-29 Associated Tasks: Classification Missing Values?
