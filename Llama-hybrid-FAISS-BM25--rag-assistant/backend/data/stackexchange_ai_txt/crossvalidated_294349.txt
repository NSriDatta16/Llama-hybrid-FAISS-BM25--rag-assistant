"hard-mining", "hard examples", ... - Does "hard" mean anything specific in statistics when not applied to problem difficulty?

The conference paper Jean Ogier Du Terrail, Frédéric Jurie. ON THE USE OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR THE DETECTION OF SMALL VEHICLES IN ORTHO-IMAGES. IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, Sep 2017, Beijing, China. ( PDF ) uses the terms "hard-mining" (6×), "hard mining" (2×), "hard examples" (3×), "hard example mining" (1×), "hard negative" (2×), "hard-negative samples" (1×) and "hard-negative-mining strategies" (1×). I have no idea what the "hard" specifyer means in this context. As it is mentioned in conjunction with bootstrapping, I suspect that it might be a term from statistics rather than GIS or AI/IR/machine learning/visual object detection or (deep convolutional) artificial neural networks. (It might, of course, be a remote-sensing-specific term.) [...] 2.3. Hard-Mining strategies Bootstrapping offers a lot of liberties on how the hard examples are chosen. One could for instance pick a limited number of false positives per image or one could fix a threshold and only pick a false positive if its score is superior to a fixed threshold (0.5 for instance). [...] Does "hard" (in general, or within the terms listed above) mean anything specific in statistics, and if so, what? From the context, I don't suppose that it refers to the difficulty of the problem. I figured it may be related "hard evidence", but that didn't help me in determining what it might mean here.
