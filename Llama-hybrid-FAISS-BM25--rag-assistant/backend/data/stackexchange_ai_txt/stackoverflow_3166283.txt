Weblogic 11g and JavaEE 6

I was wondering if Weblogic 11g already supports JavaEE 6. As I didn't find anything about it in google, I thought that it didn't, until I found a comment saying that Oracle WebLogic Server 11g is Java EE 6 complaint. Despite that, I haven't found yet the modules to support the new Java EE 6 features. Does somebody knows something about this?
