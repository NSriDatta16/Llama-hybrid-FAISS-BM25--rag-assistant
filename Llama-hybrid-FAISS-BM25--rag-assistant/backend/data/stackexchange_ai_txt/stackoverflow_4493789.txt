There are as many styles of doing OSS as there are projects. The guidelines below have worked so far for me . YMMV. Don't give write access to your repository to everyone. One of the biggest benefits of DVCS is that you don't have to, everyone gets their own repository, in principle equal to yours. Only give write access to people you really trust and that you know has similar views about the project. Always encourage patches and pull requests. Sometimes you will have to reject some patch, however make sure you really justify your rejection to the contributor; people don't like being rejected without good reason and it would discourage them (and other people too, because other people will see the issue history in the tracker) from further contributing. Also, by pointing out what's wrong with the patch, both you and the contributor will learn from the experience. Ownership is a very relative thing. If someone contributes 10 times more than you have throughout the whole history of the project, then who really owns the project? Don't worry too much about ownership, concentrate on the project itself . Make sure you always do what's best for the project . Everything else will follow naturally.
