The problem, I'm assuming, is that in your onmousedown handler you're using the event object's srcElement or target properties. When you do that, you're going to get the innermost child (due to how bubbling works). However, if you instead use the this variable in your event handler , you will get the DOM element that you registered the event on. Below are two examples. Incorrect example: function onMouseDown(e) { var event = e || window.event; var element = event.target || event.srcElement; //refers to innermost element onDragStart(element, event); } Correct example: function onMouseDown(e) { var event = e || window.event; var element = this; // refers to the element that you set the callback on onDragStart(element, event); }
