How could i get the correct external storage on Samsung and all other devices?

The official method Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() seems to be not working on Samsung devices... It return "/sdcard/" but not the real path "/sdcard/external_sd/", you could refer to the following post Android SD Card Characteristics on Samsung Galaxy Is there another methods to detect the external real storage path and suitable for all devices ?? or just teach me how to avoid this issue ?? Thanks.
