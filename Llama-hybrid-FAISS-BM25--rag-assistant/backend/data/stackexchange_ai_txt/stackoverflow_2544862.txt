How to extract paragraphs instead of whole texts only for XWPFWordExtractor (POI Library) Java

I know the following code could extract whole texts of the docx document, however, I need to extract paragraph instead. Is there are possible way?? public static String extractText(InputStream in) throws Exception { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Start extracting docx"); XWPFDocument doc = new XWPFDocument(in); XWPFWordExtractor ex = new XWPFWordExtractor(doc); String text = ex.getText(); return text; } Any helps would much appreciated. I need this so urgently.
