Delphi - Reverse Lookup ' who includes this unit'

I am debugging a large application distributed over many units. I ran into a compilation error in a low level unit and do not have the slightest idea in which part of the application this unit is referenced. Is there a way to use RAD studio 2010's IDE to create some kind of include-graph? As most of the units used are not part of the project and spread over quite a branchy source tree, i can not simply use the 'find in files' option. I am currently traversing through my tree using a search-in-files-utility, but this is cumbersome. Do you know of amore elegant way? Development is in Embercadero RAD studio 2010, windows XP 32.
