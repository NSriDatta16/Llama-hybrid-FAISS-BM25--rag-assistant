Error trying to import a a daml file in protege

I'm trying to import a daml file (.daml) in protege, but I get the following exception: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.noClassDefFoundError: org/apache/xerces/utils/URI$MalformedURIException at edu.standford.smi.protegex.storage.daml.DAMLJenaParser.jenaparse(DAMLJenaParser.java:49)... Does any of you know how to get around this? Does any of you know any other powerful ontology app. dvelopment environment other than protege for developing daml+oil documents? Please reply as soon as you can. Thanks in advance.
