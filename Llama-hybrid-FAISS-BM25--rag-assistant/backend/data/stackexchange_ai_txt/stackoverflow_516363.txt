The documentation suggests that the JMX agent uses a local port -- something unreachable from outside the machine -- unless you specify the following property: com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNum This is for security reasons, as well as for the reason given by Mr Potato Head. Thus, it looks like Java 6 does not open a default remotely accessible port for JMX. EDIT: Added after the OP added an answer with more information. Another option you have is to somehow create a local proxy that listens to all local JMX connections and exports this information. This way, you don't need to have such magic configuration of each JVM instance on the server. Instead the local proxy can connect to all JVMs via JMX and then somehow expose this information remotely. I am not positive exactly how you would implement this, but something like this may be less work than what you otherwise have to do to expose all of your JVMs remotely via JMX.
