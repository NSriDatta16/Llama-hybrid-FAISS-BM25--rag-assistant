Android SQLite - changing journal_mode

I am trying to alter the journal_mode for my database, through code. I tried SQLiteDatabase.execSQL("PRAGMA journal_mode=OFF") but it fails because, the expression "PRAGMA journal_mode=OFF" returns a result (I verified this from the terminal), and so Android thinks this is a query and complains that I should be using execQuery instead. But what I am trying to execute isn't a query. I also tried compiling the pragma expression to a SQLiteStatement and invoked the execute method, but same result. Can someone suggest any alternatives to make this work through code? Thanks, Ranjit
