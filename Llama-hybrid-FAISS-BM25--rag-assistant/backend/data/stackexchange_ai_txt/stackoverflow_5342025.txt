(Trident/4.0 is what identifies IE 8, even if the User-Agent says IE 7 — which is IE 8 running in compatibility mode.) IE 8’s Lookahead Downloader has a quirk that affects url’s that span any 4096th byte. The resulting url generated is a concatenation of the string immediately preceding the cutoff and the string immediately following it. It appears to treat any single or double quotation marks as delimiters. if you use XHTML, there’s no practical way to avoid getting these 404 errors from IE 8 users.
