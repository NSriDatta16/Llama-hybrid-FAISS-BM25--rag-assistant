Best way to organize dependant projects?

I have a set of projects that depend on other projects (you can say utilities), the problem is every time I change the code of any one of these utilities my colleagues need to take the latest code and build on their machines to use the latest assemblies. Is there a good standard solution? or simply centralized the dlls on a shared folder? P.S: We are using MS source safe 2005 and I do not want my colleagues to take the source code everytime and build on their machines as they only need the binaries not the code.
