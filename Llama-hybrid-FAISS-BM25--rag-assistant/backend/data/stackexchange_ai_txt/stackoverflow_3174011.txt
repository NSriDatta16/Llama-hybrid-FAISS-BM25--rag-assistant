Oy. Such awful answers. See? This is what happens when everyone decides that using tables instead of css is some kind of taboo. Everyone's limiting themselves with such CSS arrogance and elitism. When all one has is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Unbelievable. One poster wrote: "That was my starting point and even that isn't reliable, even a simple single column table with a fixed width gets messed up where the table cells expand for no reason past the width." Fixed width is what got you in trouble. A 600-pixel fixed-width table is obviously going to be wider than a 400-pixel email viewing window/area. It doesn't expand wider, it IS wider. [sheesh] There is no way to predict how wide will be the recipient's email viewing window/area. So, create a single table, but set it's width to 100%, not a certain number of pixels. And set its height to "auto." Make its padding nice and wide... 7 to 10 pixels, minimum. Then just do everything within that table as you normally would, but stick with vanilla HTML4, avoiding XHTML, DHTML, XML, java, javascript, etc., etc. Just HTML4. No CSS, either. Just HTML4. Period. Use images that are on a web server somewhere that can be linked to using normal http:// URLs, and then just link to them using normal img tags, placing the entire URL of the image (including the http:// part) between the quotes, as in... src="http://www.website_url.com/filename.jpg" (or .gif or whatever) ...and avoid using the "alt" feature or anything fancy. If you want to strictly control font size, then don't hesitate to use the "span" tag since it will work in nearly every email client... just dont get too fancy with it. Also don't make your images too big... especially, don't make whatever is the "header" or top image too wide. Setting the table width to auto won't help much if the graphic remains 600 pixels wide and the receipient's email viewer is 400 pixels wide. Use a graphic that will nest nicely in the upper-leftmost corner of the email message; and use fairly small photos and other graphics. Do all that and you should find that the email will look the same in pretty much every email client. Double-check by using... http://litmusapp.com/email-previews ...as another poster, here, suggested. Hope that helps.
