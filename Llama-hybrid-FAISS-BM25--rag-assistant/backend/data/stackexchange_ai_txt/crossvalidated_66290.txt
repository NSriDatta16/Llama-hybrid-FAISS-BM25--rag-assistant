The literature calls this ensembling, which may be the word you're missing for google. Your logistic regression idea -- which seems to me to be building vectors [ y_i, predictions of y_i from your 5 models] then simply running a regression to find the optimal weights, seems reasonable. Note you'll then need two holdout sets: one used to build the ensemble weights and another used to estimate performance. If this is too much data to not use, and you can train your models rapidly enough, perhaps try a 10 kfold. Also, perhaps try a tweedie regression; it will deal with with a mass at zero -- ie you have something like a mixture model with a some probability of a deal being won and then a further probability over the deals won of the value.
