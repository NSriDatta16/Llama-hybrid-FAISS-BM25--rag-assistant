Right before invoking addMessage() , call Thread.currentThread().interrupt() . This will set the "interrupt" status flag on the thread. If the interrupted status is set when the call to put() is made on a LinkedBlockingQueue , an InterruptedException will be raised, even if no waiting is required for the put (the lock is un-contended). By the way, some efforts to reach 100% coverage are counter-productive and can actually degrade the quality of code.
