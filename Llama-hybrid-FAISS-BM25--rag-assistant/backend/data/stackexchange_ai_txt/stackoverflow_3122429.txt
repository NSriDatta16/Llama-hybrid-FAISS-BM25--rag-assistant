Ruby elegant way to deal card array to player objects

I'm having trouble finding a nice elegant ruby way to do this. I have a deck array with 52 Card objects, and I want to iterate over it and loop through an array of Player objects, dealing one card at a time into their hand array. Something like: deck = Card.deck.shuffle! deck.each do |card| @players.NEXTELEMENT.hand where NEXTELEMENT would yield the next element and return to the start of the array on encountering the end. I tried adding a method like this to Array, but I got a LocalJumpError. Thanks.
