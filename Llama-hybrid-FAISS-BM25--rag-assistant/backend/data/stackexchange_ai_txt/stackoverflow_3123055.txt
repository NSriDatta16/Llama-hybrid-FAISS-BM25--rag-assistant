What kind of API should I use to elevate user privilege to super-user in a Mac OS X?

I want to elevate my app's privilege to super-user. Installer app supports this by displaying this dialog . How can I show this dialog to elevate privilege? PS. I'm making a kind of packet sniffer application on Mac OS X. I'm using pcap lib. (which is part of tcpdump)
