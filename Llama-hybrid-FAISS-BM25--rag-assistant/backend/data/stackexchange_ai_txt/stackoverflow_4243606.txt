If you just need to check if the brackets are there, you can use '\w\(\)\w' as Chris Morgan said. If you want to get a match just on the () (for example, for re.sub), you can either use non-consuming groups, or use word boundaries. '(? will match just the () but only if it is preceded and followed by a alphanum. '\b\(\)\b' will match just the () but only if it preceded and followed by a word boundary (since both ( and ) would break up the word). Note that if you had to match alphanumeric characters in the middle of a word, you'd have to use \B instead. For example, '\Babc\B' .
