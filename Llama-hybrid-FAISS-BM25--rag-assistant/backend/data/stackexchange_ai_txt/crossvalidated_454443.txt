How can I get the kernel Matrix values of the CNN?

I am new to machine learning. I am working with a Neural Network that implements the U-Net. The thing which I understand is when a convolutional layer is created: createsconv2d = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, v, kernel_size=3, padding=1) let the in_channel = 3 and out_channel = 64 then, for kernel_size = 3 it computes with a 3*3 Kernel. But my question is what are the values of this kernel? How it gets the values?
