How to generate new random variables after using PCA for dimension reduction?

I want to be able to generate random variables, that (more or less) match the distribution of some observed data set. The data set is high dimension and I have reduced the dimension using PCA. Only the first component is significant. I now want to generate new random variables in the rotated space, then reverse the rotation to get data in the original space. So if only 1 principal component is significant, I will generate a random variable along that axis. What do I do with the other components? I don't want to be 'fitting the noise'. Also, I want my simulated data to have the same level of noise as the original data. So I can't just simulate along the 1st principal component and then reverse the rotation because then the resulting simulated data will lie along a hyper line. Is the best strategy just to simulated new variables along each axis but even out the Eigen values for everything except the 1st component, then reverse the rotation?
