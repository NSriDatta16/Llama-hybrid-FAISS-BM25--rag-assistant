Windows has discouraged applications from stealing focus for a while; the rules around it aren't really documented, presumably to prevent applications from working around them. However, you could give this a try: var proc = new Process(); proc.StartInfo.FileName = attachmentPath; proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true; proc.Start(); //Wait for window to spin up proc.WaitForInputIdle(); BringWindowToTop(proc.MainWindowHandle); Define BringWindowToTop with p/invoke .
