I think you have introduced good ideas, but some care is needed to make sense of all this. The unifying concept is of absolutely continuous measure. Given two measures $\nu$ and $\mu$ on the same measure space, $\nu$ is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$ provided $\nu$ never assigns a nonzero value to any set of zero $\mu$ measure. The Radon-Nikodym Theorem asserts this is tantamount to the existence of a $\mu$ -measurable function $f$ which converts $\mu$ into $\nu;$ that is, for all measurable sets $A,$ $$\nu(A) = \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu.$$ In this case $f$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\nu$ with respect to $\mu,$ written $$f = \frac{\mathrm{d}\nu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}.$$ (Think of $f$ as a "multiplicative change of measure:" by multiplying the values of $\mu$ it distorts $\mu$ into a different measure, which is precisely $\nu;$ and provided almost all values of $f$ are finite, $f$ cannot distort the measure too much and make it "singular.") The two most prominent examples in statistics are $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\nu$ is the probability measure of an absolutely continuous random variable $X$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ In this case $f$ is the probability density function (pdf) of $X.$ $\mu$ is the counting measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\nu$ is the probability measure of a discrete variable $X$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ In this case $f$ is the probability mass function (pmf) of $X.$ Measure is the unifying concept and the Radon-Nikodym derivative simultaneously handles ratios of pmfs and ratios of pdfs. The setting of the question concerns two random variables $X$ and $Y$ absolutely continuous with respect to some measure $\mu,$ with Radon-Nikodym derivatives $f$ and $g$ respectively. Suppose, further, that $Y$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $X,$ the probability measure of $Y$ is $\lambda,$ and the probability measure of $X$ is $\nu.$ It follows easily (from the definitions) that the function $h = g/f$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\lambda$ with respect to $\nu$ and it is almost everywhere defined with respect to the measure $\mu.$ In any event, because $\log$ is a convex extended-real function on the non-negative reals (taking the value $-\infty$ at $0$ ), its value at any weighted average of a set of points is never less than the weighted average of its values at those points (Jensen's Inequality). The broadest concept of "weighted average" is the integral against a measure like $\nu;$ thus, for any $\nu$ -measurable function $h:\mathbb{R}\to [0,\infty),$ $$\log \int h\, \mathrm{d}\nu \ge \int \log(h)\,\mathrm{d}\nu.$$ (When both sides are exponentiated this is also known as the (weighted) Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality.) Plugging in $h = g/f$ and $f = \mathrm{d}\nu/\mathrm{d}\mu$ and remembering all probability measures integrate to unity (as part of their definition) gives $$\eqalign{ 0 &= \log(1) = \log \int \mathrm{d}\lambda &&\color{Gray}{\lambda\text{ is a probability measure}}\\ &= \log \int g\,\mathrm{d}\mu &&\color{Gray}{g = \frac{\mathrm{d}\lambda}{\mathrm{d}\mu}}\\ &= \log \int \frac{g}{f}\,f\,\mathrm{d}\mu &&\color{Gray}{gf/f=g}\\ &= \log \int h \,\mathrm{d}\nu &&\color{Gray}{h = g/f\text{ and }f = \frac{\mathrm{d}\nu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}} \\ &\ge \int \log(h)\,\mathrm{d}\nu &&\color{Gray}{\text{Jensen}} \\ &= \int \log\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)\,f\,\mathrm{d}\mu &&\color{Gray}{h=g/f\text{ and } f = \frac{\mathrm{d}\nu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}}. }$$ Negating this inequality produces the desired result, QED.
