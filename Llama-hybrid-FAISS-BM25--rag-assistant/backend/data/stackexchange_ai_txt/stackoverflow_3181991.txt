Visual Studio - automatically add necessary spaces to comments

When I'm writing comments in my code, I often forget to add the initial space after the comment identifier. 'this is a comment when really it is supposed to be ' this is a comment I realize this is quite trivial, and you could simply say "just add the damn space you idiot", but I'd really like to automate this so that I just don't have to worry about it. Can anyone point me in the right direction of an elegant way to add the comment space? note I do realize that a catch all string replace or regex replace could screw up other things ... IE: Dim something As String = "I'm a nerd" would actually come out Dim something As String = "I' m a nerd" So the way I see this being resolved is if it's only on a line by it's self and is not followed by a second single quote... IE: '' would not trigger the replacement.
