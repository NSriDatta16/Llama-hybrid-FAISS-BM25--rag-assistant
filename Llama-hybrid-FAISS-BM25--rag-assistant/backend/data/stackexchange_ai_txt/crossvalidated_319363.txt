Cross Validation - Logistic Regression

I want to make a logistic regression with N independent variables, via cross validation (K splits). I want to use the resulting betas in order to put it in a formula to predict future cases (no yet in my data). Provided K splits, I would get K sets of resulting $?\beta$s, so... the 'final' betas are the average of each $\beta_i$? Because it is clear the average error should be obtained from the average of results, but it is not so clear the average $\beta$s would correspond to the average error.
