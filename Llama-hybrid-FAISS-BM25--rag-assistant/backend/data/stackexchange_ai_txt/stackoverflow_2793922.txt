_export is obsolete in the newer versions of Visual C++, see here . Let me cite this article : It is not possible to maintain a single source for 16-bit and 32-bit code by simply replacing __export with _declspec() because _declspec() is a storage class modifier and __export is a type modifier. The article states, that _export only works for 16-bit programs. So you should actually produce a 16-bit program and DLL.
