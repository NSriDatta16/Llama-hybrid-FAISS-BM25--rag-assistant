My opinion only, YMMV. When I'm messing with any new technology, I figure it should meet two criteria or I'm wasting my time. (Or I don't understand it well enough.) It should simplify things, or worst case make them no more complicated. It should not increase coupling or reduce cohesiveness. It sounds like you feel like you're headed in the opposite direction, which I know is not the intention for either LINQ or ORMs. My own perception of the value of this new stuff is it helps a developer move the boundary between the DL and the BL into a little more abstract territory. The DL looks less like raw tables and more like objects. That's it. (I usually work pretty hard to do this anyway with a little heavier SQL and stored procedures, but I'm probably more comfortable with SQL than average). But if LINQ and ORM aren't helping you with this yet, I'd say keep at it, but that's where the end of the tunnel is; simplification, and moving the abstraction boundary a bit.
