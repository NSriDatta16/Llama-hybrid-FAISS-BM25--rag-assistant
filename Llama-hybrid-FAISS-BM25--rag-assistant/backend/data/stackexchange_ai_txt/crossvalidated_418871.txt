Since no satisfying answer was provided, I consulted one of the proposers of the Birth Death MH algorithm, Dr. Jesper Moller, to clarify this. He confirmed that specifying the proposal distribution for a marked point is arbitrary since it is essentially in the same vein as choosing the proposal distribution in a standard MCMC. It's just that different proposal distribution lead to different speed in convergence. This implies that if we assume a probability model that defines a dependence structure between the locations and the marks, the dependence structure in the simulated data will manifest itself according to the assumed model since it is a MCMC algorithm and it is guaranteed to converge asymptotically no matter the proposal distribution. Hence, the proposal distribution for point locations can be independent from that of the marks. Hope this is help.
