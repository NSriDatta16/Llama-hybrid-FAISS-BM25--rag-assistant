there is no hard limit to the number of records in a global temporary table. Data will eventually be written to disk and therefore will be subject to read/write speed when you insert/update your data or query the table. You would expect performance (i.e data modification and data access) to be roughly of the same level as a regular table -- a little faster since there is less redo generated. You can add indexes to a global temporary table to ease retrieval of a subset of rows (it will obviously slow down insert and consume more temp space, this is a trade-off)
