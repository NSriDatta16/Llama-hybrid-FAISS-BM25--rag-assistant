Logistic Regression: Bias in Intercept vs Bias in Slope

I am trying to learn more about how to apply Logistic Regression in the presence of rare events. I am trying to understand what is written in this paper here: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/0s.pdf If I understand correctly, in the presence of rare events, the MLE estimate for the intercept of a Logistic Regression can be updated using the following correction formula (where $tau$ represents the true proportion of events within the population): $$\hat{\beta}_0 - \ln\left[\left(1 - \frac{\tau}{\tau}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\bar{y}}{1 - \bar{y}}\right)\right]$$ Apparently, using this corrected formula can provide more reasonable estimates for the value of $\hat{\beta}_0$ and the variance of $\hat{\beta}_0$ . I had the following question: In this paper, there is no correction formula provided for the estimates of $\hat{\beta}_1$ - is there any reason for this? In the presence of rare events, is the classical MLE estimate for $\hat{\beta}_1$ somehow less affected compared to $\hat{\beta}_0$ ? Thanks!
