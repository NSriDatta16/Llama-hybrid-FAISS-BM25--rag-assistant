CNN to many outputs

I have a dataset with 100 columns (categorial one-hot encoded) and 1 column with text data (simple sentences) and i want to build a neural network to arround 380.000 outputs labels. I have no idea what can i do. I was thinking about a CNN with Embedding Layer and then many dense layers. Any suggestions?
