I finally tracked down the paper associated with the slides: Kruschke (2010) , also available directly from the author (via CiteSeerX) here , since the journal is not widely carried. The explanation is a little bit prosaic, but I'm still not sure I buy it. In the fixed-N case, the critical $t$-value is computed as follows: $2N$ samples are randomly drawn from the (same) population and a $t$-value is calculated. This process is repeated many times to build up a null distribution. Finally, $t_{crit}$ is set to be the 95th percentile of that distribution. For the fixed duration case, he assumes that subjects arrive at a mean rate $\lambda$. The null distribution is constructed by repeating two steps. In the first step, the number of subjects for each condition $N_1$ and $N_2$ is drawn from a possion distribution with parameter $\lambda$. Next, $N_1$ and $N_2$ random draws from the population are used to calculate a $t$-value. This is repeated many times, and $t_{crit}$ is set to be the 95th percentile of that distribution. This seems a little...cheeky...to me. As I understand it, there isn't a single $t$-distribution; instead it's a family of distributions, with a shape partly determined by the degrees-of-freedom parameter. For the fixed-$N$ condition, there are $N$ subjects per group and the appropriate $t$-value for an unpaired t-test is the one with $2N-2$ degrees of freedom, which is presumably what his simulation reproduces. In the other condition, it seems like the "$t$"-like distribution is actually a combination of samples from many different $t$-distributions, depending on the specific draws. By setting $\lambda=N$, one could get the average degrees of freedom to equal $2N-N$, but that's not quite enough. For example, the average of the $t$-distributions for $\nu=1$ and $\nu=5$ doesn't seem to be the $t$-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. In summary: The author was generating $t_{crit}$ by simulation, instead of just calculating them from the CDF. The way the author simulated the fixed-duration scenario seems like it might fatten up the tails of the corresponding $t$-distribution. I remain unconvinced that this is actually a problem, but would be happy to read/upvote/accept answers if anyone thinks otherwise.
