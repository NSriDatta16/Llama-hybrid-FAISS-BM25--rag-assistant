You have two options. The first and easiest one is to simply perform the dimension reduction on a matrix composed by training set and test set together. At the end of the process just split the final set between training and test set either by selecting lines or by a random process. The second option is to multiply your adjusted test data (values of dimensions subtracted by their mean) by the row feature vector you calculated on the PCA of the training set. If you are not implementing PCA from the ground up, I suggest you choose the first option. However, if you are using a library that provides you the PCA feature vector, then choose whatever works best for you.
