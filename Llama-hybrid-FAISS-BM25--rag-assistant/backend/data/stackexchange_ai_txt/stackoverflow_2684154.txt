If you are willing to use a commercial product, and are calculating a number of sin/cos calculations at the same time (so you can use vectored functions), you should check out Intel's Math Kernel Library. (dead link) It has a sincos function According to that documentation, it averages 13.08 clocks/element on core 2 duo in high accuracy mode, which i think will be even faster than fsincos.
