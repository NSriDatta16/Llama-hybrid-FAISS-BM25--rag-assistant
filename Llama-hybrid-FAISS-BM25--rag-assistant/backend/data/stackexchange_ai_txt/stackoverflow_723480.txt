If you want it to go quick, you might be better off organizing your roads in to major and minor roads. Use the list of minor roads to find a route to the nearest major road. Use the major roads to get you near the destination. Then go back to the minor roads to complete the route. Without a split like this, there are a heck of a lot of roads to search, most of which are quite slow routes.
