K-NN algorithm with maximum distance to be considered a neighbor

Is there a variant of the k-NN algorithm where the label returned is: the average of values of the k nearest neighbors that are closer than a given threshold to the query data point? no value if there is no neighbors closer to the query data point than the threshold The intuition behind k-NN is that similar points in feature space have similar labels. It seems reasonable to discard points farther to query data point than a specified threshold, above which you consider that two point's labels do not correlate. Thanks for your insights!
