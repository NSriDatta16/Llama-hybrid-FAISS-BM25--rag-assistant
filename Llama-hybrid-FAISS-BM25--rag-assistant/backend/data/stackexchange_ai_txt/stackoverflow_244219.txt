Sort List Descending

In c# (3.0 or 3.5, so we can use lambdas), is there an elegant way of sorting a list of dates in descending order? I know I can do a straight sort and then reverse the whole thing, docs.Sort((x, y) => x.StoredDate.CompareTo(y.StoredDate)); docs.Reverse(); but is there a lambda expression to do it one step? In the above example, StoredDate is a property typed as a DateTime.
