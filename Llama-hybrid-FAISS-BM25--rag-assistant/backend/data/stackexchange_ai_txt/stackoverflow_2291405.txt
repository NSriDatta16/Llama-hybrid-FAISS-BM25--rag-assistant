Any considerations before jumping into SQLite?

I have a WCF application that at present is using XML based file storage to store data that gets used to generate reports. Besides this processing decisions are made based on information stored in these XML files. I'm now hitting volumes of around 30 000 text files. This is incredibly taxing, and the application at times comes to a grinding halt. I've always wanted to swop out the XML DAL in favor of an RDBMS, but project managers simply won't allow it. But they would be willing to look at a serverless solution for example SQLLite. I am really tempted to just dive right in and start using it as a replacement DAL (Data Access Layer). I would need no more than around 20 tables in the whole solution, and I would expect to get no more than around 20 000 - 100 000 transactions a day, however this is extreme, the real volumes would be less than this in most cases. Update I am not expecting a great deal of simultaneous connections, when I say transactions, I essentially mean 1 or 2 clients that make calls and execute against the database in order. At times there might be a possibility of external clients making quick calls to the DB. But the bulk of DB connections will be done by my WCF service, which is a back end scheduled task, not serving 100's of people across an organization. Another good point is that I only need to retain data for 90 days, so the DB shouldn't grow too big. My main concerns are: How reliable is SQLLite? What if the DB File gets corrupted, will I loose all processing Data. How easy is the DB to back up? Will it handle my volumes? And lastly how well does the .net provider work (located here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2/ ). If you have any experience with SQLLite, please post your experiences so I can make aan informed decision to switch or not. Thanks in advance...
