Which literature recommends standardization before PCA on such data? I've never seen this being recommended. Essentially, PCA is multivariate standardization, so there is some redundancy between first standardizing every attribute on its own, then doing PCA. As with any form of normalization, it may help, and it may harm. Correlations in your data can be harmful, or helpful. If the variables are corlated because they originate from the same (good) signal, that's great! But if they are correlated because of some root cause that is not helpful, it can be better to reduce the correlation.
