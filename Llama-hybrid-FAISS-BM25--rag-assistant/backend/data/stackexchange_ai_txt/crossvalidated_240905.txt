Methodology on associating human traits to occupational tasks

Note: See Edit 1, 2 for alternative source of human competence instead of by proxy via a Holland survey. I am exploring research where I have a large number of occupational tasks, that is, things you do in a job, like programming , research , lifting boxes , etc. There are over 20,000 tasks. There are about 1000 occupations. Each occupation has a set of core tasks, typically 20 or so. Each occupation also has a set of personality test results, Holland Codes , which aggregates Holland personality survey results per occupation, that is each occupation has a set of Holland Code measurements. I would like to associate a defensible weighting of creative, social competencies to each task. Manually labeling each task would be somewhat arbitrary and hard to defend. My thought was to: Treat each task as an independent variable, with a row per occupation (This makes for a quite a sparse matrix). Each occupation only has a few tasks. Treat the Holland personality code results, per occupation, as dependent variables, particularly the social, artistic results Apply an appropriate type of regression that can handle high dimensional, co linearity and interactions such as Elastic Net Take the regression coefficients per independent variable as a measure of associated creative, social intelligence, that is repeatable and defensible for each task. Are there criticisms to this approach that I should anticipate? What are some better ways to associate the level of human competencies, such social, creative competencies, required for given tasks? edit 0 - normalized language to use competencies instead of different terms (intelligence vs aptitudes) edit 1 - The use of Holland codes has been rightly criticized as they are preferences, not competencies. So far in the industrial/organization pysch literature I haven't come across much on using Holland codes as a proxy for anything else, nor as an indirect measure of occupational competency. However I did see that ONET gives occupation requirements in Generalized Work Activities (GWA) which describe frequency of various aggregated tasks grouped by general statements. But using GWAs raises a similar question: these activities were not designed to measure social, creative competence. At that point is the only resort to have several human raters re-interpret them in terms of social, creative, etc dimensions? edit 2 - I found a MIT paper, "Racing with and against the Machine" by MacCrory, et al, wherein they select variables from both ONET's Worker Characteristics and Occupational Requirements which conflates preferences for requirements since they analyze effects on occupations using work preferences. But, what I find interesting is that they use PCA and evaluate the orthogonal dimensions empirically (see Data and Methods). Their methods of constructing orthogonal dimensions is interesting here. In my case I would then select from Occupation Requirements only (measuring requirements, competencies) and pull out those in which human competences (creativity, artistic) of interest largely act out within. I figure if this method is good enough for MIT then it's good enough for me. I'll place a bounty on this question and see if anyone provides a better approach.
