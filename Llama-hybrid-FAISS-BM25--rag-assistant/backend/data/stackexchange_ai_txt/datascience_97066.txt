Since in the comments you mentioned making predictions based on trained models, the number data examples is not a factor. Training data can be ignored; You only need to use the trained model architecture and weights. You probably want to use an existing distributed machine learning framework such as Spark or H20. That framework will hand distributing the predictions across the cluster and aggregating the results.
