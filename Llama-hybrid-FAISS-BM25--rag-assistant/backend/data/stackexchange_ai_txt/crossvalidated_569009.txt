It isn't that beta regression on its own solved the problem. It's that you adjusted the data with a line of code: y.doubleprime = ((y.prime*(length(y.prime)-1))+0.5)/length(y.prime)) so that the beta regression software didn't have to deal with the exact 0 or 1 proportions that it (like logistic regression) can't handle directly. A vignette on the betareg package says that's "a useful transformation in practice ... where n is the sample size." I'm not sure whether that adjustment based on n should be done for each set of observations as you seem to (I'm not fluent in tidyverse ) or if that should be based on the entire set of observations. Presumably you followed the recommendation of the paper you linked. In this thread one of the package authors describes the proper use of weights in the betareg() function: "make sure that your weights are scaled such that sum(weights) corresponds to the number of independent observations." That seems to be what you did. As you "score mortality not on individuals, but on groups of individuals as a proportion (the denominator, i.e., number of trials, is known)," there's an alternative that would allow the Firth penalization. Just put your data into a longer form with one row per alive/dead (0/1) observation. For example, you would expand your first batch of treatment a observations into 6 rows with outcome 0 and 4 with outcome 1. Then the outcome would be a set of 0/1 values as the logistf package expects. If you want to keep track of which batch of a treatment was involved (your example suggests 5 separate batches for each of the 4 treatments) you could annotate that in each row, too. Added in response to another answer: I wasn't aware of the brglm2 package recommended in another answer and agree that is probably the simplest and most appropriate way to proceed. Make sure you understand the nature of the penalization you use, however. For example, the original Firth method penalizes both the intercept and the regression coefficients . Thus probability estimates from such a model might be biased even though you get better coefficient estimates. Modified approaches are now available in the logistf and brglm2 packages.
