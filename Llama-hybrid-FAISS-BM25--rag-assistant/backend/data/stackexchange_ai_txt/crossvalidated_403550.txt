Wikipedia's version of the Brier score for multiple categories is correct. Compare the original publication by Brier (1950) , or any number of academic publications, e.g. Czado et al. (2009) (equation (6), though you would need to do some simple arithmetic and drop a constant 1 to arrive at Brier's formulation). If sklearn calculates a binary "one against all" Brier score and averages over all choices of a focal class, then it can certainly do so. However, it is simply not the Brier score. Passing it off as such is misleading and wrong. The misconception lies entirely with sklearn. Just use your brier_multi , it's completely correct.
