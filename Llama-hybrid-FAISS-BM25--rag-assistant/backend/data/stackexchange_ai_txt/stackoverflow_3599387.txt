Sys.path modification or more complex issue?

I have problems with importing correctly a module on appengine. My app generally uses django with app-engine-patch, but this part is task queues using only the webapp framework. I need to import django settings for the app to work properly. My script starts with: import os import sys sys.path.append('common/') # Force Django to reload its settings. from django.conf import settings settings._target = None # Must set this env var before importing any part of Django os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings' I always get this error, or something related: : No module named ragendja.settings_pre because the settings.py file starts with from ragendja.settings_pre import * I think I need to add ragendja to sys.path again but I had several tries that didn't work. Here is my directory: project/ app.yaml setting.py common/ appenginepatch/ ragendja/ setting_pre.py myapp/ script.py Is it only a sys.path problem and how do I need to modify it with the correct syntax? Thanks
