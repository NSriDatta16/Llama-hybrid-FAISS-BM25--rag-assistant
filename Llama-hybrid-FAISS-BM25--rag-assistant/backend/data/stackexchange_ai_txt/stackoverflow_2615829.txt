Detect ANY touch in a view (iPhone SDK)

I'm currently using ... - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { to detect swipes. I've got everything working. The only problem is if the user touches on top of something (eg a UIButton or something) the - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { is not called. Is there something like touchesBegan but will work if I touch ANYWHERE on the view? Thanks in advance, David
