Are "Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)" and GBDT exactly the same thing?

In the category of Gradient Boosting, I find some terms confusing. I'm aware that XGBoost includes some optimization in comparison to conventional Gradient Boosting. But are Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and GBDT the same thing? Are they just different names? Apart from GBM/GBDT and XGBoost, are there any other models fall into the category of Gradient Boosting?
