Quesiton about markov chain period of transient

I got a quick question I got a markov chain with this trans matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\1/2&1/2\end{pmatrix}$$ And I got 2 states right [0,1] right. So I know state 0 has a period 1 and is positive recurrent cause it keep returning to itself but has period 1. But not sure about state 1. I know it has period 1 because it keep returning to itself. But I think it also transient because once it leave for 0 it cannot come back. So would it be period 0 or period 1. Cause I guess you could make a choice to never leave state 1.
