Question 1 is not really a single question, but multiple dichotomous questions hidden under the guise of one question. These hidden questions are: Treatment A: Yes/No, Treatment B: Yes/No, etc. Consequently, you might be able use them as multiple independent variables in something like a logistic regression model , possibly with interactions between treatments. However, you have to correctly specify the model (e.g. do you want to model every possible interactions between treatments?), and your sample size should be adequate for the model complexity. In addition, if this is not an experimental design, it may be particularly challenging to make causal inference. Besides these possible issues, here's a more mundane one: if checkboxes have been used to ask respondents these questions (instead of explicitly asking "yes/no"), it may be very difficult to distinguish between someone who answered "no" and someone who didn't respond. In other words, it is hard to know if they didn't take the treatment, or if they took the treatment but refused or omitted to check the corresponding box. In this case, it could introduce bias into your analysis. If respondents had to pick treatments in a long list of options, or if there was a long series of questions before, the answers may be particularly prone to this issue.
