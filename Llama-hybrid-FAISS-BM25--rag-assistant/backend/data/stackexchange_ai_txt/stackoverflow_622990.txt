When I built a self-updating app, I used the stub idea, but the stub was the app itself. The app would start, look for updates. If it found an update, it would download a copy of the new app to temp storage, and then start it up (System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()) using a command-line option that said "you are being updated". Then the original exe exits. The spawned exe starts up, sees that it is an update, and copies itself to the original app directory. It then starts the app from that new location. Then the spawned exe ends. The newly started exe from the original app install location starts up - sees the temp file and deletes it. Then resumes normal execution.
