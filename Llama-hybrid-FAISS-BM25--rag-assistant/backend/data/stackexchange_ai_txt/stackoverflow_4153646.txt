It's difficult to tell exactly what you're trying to accomplish here. I'm going to assume that you want to move a label from its current position on the form to a new position while the application is running. I also assume that you want to make the label invisible while you're moving it so that you cannot see it move across the form. You can do this easily by setting the Location property of the label you want to move to its new location. (If necessary, like if you want to move the label a relative number of pixels, you can get the label's current position from the Location property before you set it.) The label control also has a Visible property that you can set to True or False to show/hide the control, respectively: //Hide the label first myLabel.Visible = false; //Move the label to a new location on the form myLabel.Location = new Point(30, 25); //Make the label visible again myLabel.Visible = true; If I guessed wrong, and you're just trying to move the label during design-time (before you start running your program), you can just drag-and-drop it to a new position on the form.
