Handling binned feature

I am new to the field of data science and trying to figure out ways to handle data quality issues before performing any modeling. I am working on a house rental price data set. In this data there is feature called Total Squarefeet . The issue I am facing here is that out of 12000 records 200 have a range, for e.g., 1200 - 1800, OR 850 - 855, OR even and these ranges also have a random difference between them. Rest other are simple numbers. Is there a way to correctly handle this kind of data. Can anyone help me or guide me to a place from where i can learn and use techniques to handle such data. Thanks in advance.
