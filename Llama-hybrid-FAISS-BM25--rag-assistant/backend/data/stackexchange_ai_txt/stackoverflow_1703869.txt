How does "Language Oriented Programming" compare to OOP/Functional in the real world

I recently began to read some F# related literature, speaking of "Real World Functional Programming" and "Expert F#" e. g.. At the beginning it's easy, because I have some background in Haskell, and know C#. But when it comes to " Language Oriented Programming " I just don't get it. - I read some explanations and it's like reading an academic paper that gets more abstract and strange with every sentence. Does anybody have an easy example for that kind of stuff and how it compares to existing paradigms? It's not just academic fantasy, isn't it? ;) Thanks, wishi
