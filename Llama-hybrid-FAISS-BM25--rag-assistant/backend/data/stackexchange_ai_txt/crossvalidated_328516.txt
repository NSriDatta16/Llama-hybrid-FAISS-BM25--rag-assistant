In order to include a random effect (and potentially other fixed effects) you need to format your data in long (rather than wide) format, and use nested indexing with separate vectors as indicator variables for your fixed and random effects. The easiest way to generate this model is to use the runjags::template.jags function to create the model for you based on your lme4 model syntax: # Generation of simulated data set.seed(123) varY You will then have a text file within your working directory that contains a fully functional JAGS model. The important parts are within the main loop: regression_fitted[i] This includes the fixed effect of facX and random effect of block, both indexed using the appropriate explanatory variable. The other part for the random effect is: for(block_iterator in 1:25){ block_randomeffect[block_iterator] ~ dnorm(0, block_precision) } Which ensures that each random effect level is normally distributed with a mean of zero and precision to be estimated, which is equivalent to your frequentist model (although remember that precision is 1/variance!). Once you have checked/edited the model as appropriate (e.g. adjusting priors) then you can run it using: results The help file for ?template.jags contains another example of comparing a frequentist linear model to an equivalent Bayesian model, which may be of interest to you.
