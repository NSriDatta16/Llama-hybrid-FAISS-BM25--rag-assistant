I don't know about standard, but using Hungarian notation on enums and enum values is not something I have seen before. Your second example is closer to the kind of code I normally see, so in that respect, yes, it is more standard. See section 8.2.3 on this guideline - pascal casing and no prefix/postfix. Guideline 16 of Section 2.1 of Lance Hunt's C# coding standards also says to avoid prefixes and postfixes. I would say this is pretty universal - the point of having enums it to aid readability. Using prefixes and postfixed reduces readability and thus is pretty universally discouraged.
