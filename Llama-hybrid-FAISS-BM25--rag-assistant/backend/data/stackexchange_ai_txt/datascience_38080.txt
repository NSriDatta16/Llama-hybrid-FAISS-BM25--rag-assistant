Interactive labeling/annotating of time series data

I have a data set of time series data. I'm looking for an annotation (or labeling) tool to visualize it and to be able to interactively add labels on it, in order to get annotated data that I can use for supervised ML. E.g. the input data is a csv-file and the output is another csv-file of the format timestamp,label. Therefore I need something like this: to visualize data to select a specific area output the labels with timestamps As an example: Building such a tool in python will not take too long, however I was just wondering how other people solve this problem and maybe there are already nice OS tools for doing this. Thank you!
