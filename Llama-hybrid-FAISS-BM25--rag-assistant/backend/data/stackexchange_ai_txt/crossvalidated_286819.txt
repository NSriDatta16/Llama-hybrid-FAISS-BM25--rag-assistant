Statistics book for Machine Learning people

I have been doing Machine Learning for a while and have worked with things like probability models, MCMC, variational inference, kernel methods, time series etc. I am looking a for a book to complement my statistics knowledge. The book should not ideally revisit things that are mostly covered in ML books or elementary probability theory books but should explore things like survey sampling, a/b testing, experiment design, quantitative marketing, counterfactuals, visualization and summarization of findings etc. It would be much better if the book is more intuitive than rigorous, and shorter/more concise the better for me. Overall, I am looking for a book that can give me a glimpse of how a statistician approaches data science problems.
