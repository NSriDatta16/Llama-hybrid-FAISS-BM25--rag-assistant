faster alternatives to sparse.model.matrix?

I have a large dataset that is entirely categorical. I'm trying to train with it using xgboost, so I must first convert this categorical data to numerical. So far I've been using sparse.model.matrix() in the Matrix library but it is far too slow. I found a great solution here , however, the sparse matrix it returns in not the same one that sparse.model.matrix returns. I know there is a way to force sparse.model.matrix to return identical output as the solution in the link ( by providing contrasts) , however, that is not an effective solution as it is still too slow and results in different representation (and hence different training model). Is there a way to accomplish the job sparse.model.matrix does even nearly as fast as the solution I posted? For my data, the solution I posted does it in about 15% of the time.
