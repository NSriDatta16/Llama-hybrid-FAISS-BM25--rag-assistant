The problem can be modeled as Markov Decision problem. I have tried to fit the problem in MDP framework, let me know if this is of any help. Assuming that there exists a method to select a song within a playlist 'cluster', the states would act as such clusters for MDP. Defining a transition probability matrix between clusters, actions by MDP would be a change in this matrix. Here, app user inputs would act as external disturbances in the model. The reward/cost model would depend on these external disturbances. In summary, States: Playlist clusters Actions: Updates in transition probability matrix Disturbances: App user inputs as accept/reject the song Cost function: Stochastic output on whether a user would accept/reject next few suggestions An extension would be to simulate user behavior as a stochastic process, and infer the parameters based on actual data.
