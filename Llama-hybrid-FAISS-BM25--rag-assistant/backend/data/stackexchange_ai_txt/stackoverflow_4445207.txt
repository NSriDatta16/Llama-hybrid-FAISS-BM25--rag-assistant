The general rule is that, during initialization, you must not access uninitialized parts of the object. As ItemStorage is already initialized when items gets initialized, calling size is indeed fine. Even if size was virtual, and even if it was overwritten, it still would be fine: it would just call the base version (i.e. virtual methods only bind to the level which is under construction).
