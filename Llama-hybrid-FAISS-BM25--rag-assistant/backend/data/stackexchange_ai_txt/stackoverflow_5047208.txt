Proper method to use referral data for a PHP based website

We manage an online enrollment site. Customers can ONLY enroll in our program if they come through an agent URL which currently has the format: www.site.com?Agent=AGENTID While this approach works, it makes it very difficult for our agents to simply send out or 'tell' their URL to a potential customer. I have tossed around the idea of making a subdomain redirect to the format above but our Media temple configuration requires major changes to the apache conf file which we are trying to avoid. Similarly, I think we could just direct customers to www.site.com/agentid but run into the issue where /agentid will be treated as a page instead of an ID (and other times www.site.com/pagetitle may actually be used for a real page). Anybody ever had a similar issue in the past? I'd be happy to hear any opinions for the best approach.
