Originally developed by Data Dynamics as the first ActiveX Designer for Visual Basic 5 in 2001, it was rewritten in C# for the .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET. GrapeCity acquired the product in 2009, in 2012 GrapeCity acquired ComponentOne and began marketing the product under the company name "ComponentOne, a division of GrapeCity." It is now in Version 9 and is fully integrated into Visual Studio 2010 through 2015, and is no longer marketed with ComponentOne. Since version 7, it has provided two different kinds of reports. Section reports use an event-based banded section report design similar to Microsoft Access or Crystal Reports. It also offers Page reports which focus on the design of the page and use a variety of data regions to manipulate and display the data. In version 8, a third type of report, CPL (continuous page layout), was added, and was renamed to RDL reports in version 9. This type of report has controls that can shrink or grow, and allows for the most interactivity with drill-down action for hidden data, interactive sorting, drill-through links to other reports, and bookmark links to other sections of the same report. Since its introduction, it has been and remains the best selling reporting tool among Microsoft Developers on ComponentSource and other industry resellers. It includes controls for Windows Forms, ASP.NET, Silverlight, and HTML5. It can also be used in WPF and Windows Azure applications. In August 2011 ActiveReports Server was launched. ActiveReports Server is a web-based ad hoc report designer with built-in, secure, scalable storage and distribution capabilities that allow companies to rapidly deploy self-service reporting to a large number of users more effectively than traditional reporting tools.
