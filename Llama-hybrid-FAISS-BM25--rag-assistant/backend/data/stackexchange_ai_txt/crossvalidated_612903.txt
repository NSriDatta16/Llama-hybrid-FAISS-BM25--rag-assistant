Logistic linear regression and time series

Is it safe to run a logistic regression with time as independent variable? For example, I want to test whether a certain outcome (say, blue or red) changes along time. I know that, in general, one should be careful on time series because of autocorrelation. EDIT: the dataset I have contains hundreds of observations per months, where there is a decrease in the outcome blue at the advantage of red at the end of the time span. Note that the data might not be completely independent as I have multiple observations for each month coming from the same individual, but the individuals are different for each month (this is not a consequence of poor experimental design, it is impossible to get an observation from the same individual in different months).
