If you're moving two separate database processes (and their storage) to a single machine, you pretty much have two options Start the executable for the database twice, each from different config files (which specify different ports). The client will need to be able to connect to the two instances on their respective ports. Depending on your database and operating system, this might not be possible. Run two virtual images, on per db/shard. The client connects to each by whatever IP address you configure the VM to have.
