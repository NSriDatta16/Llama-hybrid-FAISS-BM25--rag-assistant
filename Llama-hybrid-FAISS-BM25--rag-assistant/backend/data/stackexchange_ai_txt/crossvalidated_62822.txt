You could use the Earth-Movers-Distance (EMD), which takes into account a ground-distance between the bins and solves a transportation problem (basically, and hence the name: one histogram is a set of piles of earth, one a set of holes and you want to fill the holes as efficiently as possible). Afaik it is quite a standard distance comparing images in content-based image retrieval.
