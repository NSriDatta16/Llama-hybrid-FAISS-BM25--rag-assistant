The best solution is to have a separate field which stores the int value of the token. You should maintain this column when you maintain the token column. Then when you sort, order by the int value column then the token column. This will allow you to index these columns for fast retrieval of data with large data sets. Conversion functions from alpha to int are slow and cannot take advantage of indexing to speed up queries. As your data set grows, this type of solution will only get slower and bog down your database.
