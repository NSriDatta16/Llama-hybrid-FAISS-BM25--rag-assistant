Matlab loops for a function

I am trying to make a loop to redo a Matlab function 1000 times. Here's the program d = unifrnd (0,10,[10,1]); c = d.^(-2); a = round(unifrnd(0,1,[1,10]); e = a*c btotal = e+1 SIR = 1/btotal What I want is to iterate this function 1000 times, each time the value of SIR will vary due to the random number generated. For every iteration, I want the value of SIR to be added together (summed up), and in the end of the 1000th iteration, find the average SIR(mean). Thanks for the help
