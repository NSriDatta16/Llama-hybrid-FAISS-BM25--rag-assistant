Here comes a little short description of div and span html tags. The span and div tags are very useful when dealing with Cascading Style Sheets. People tend to use the two tags in a similar fashion, but they serve different purposes. div also gives you the chance to define the style of whole sections of HTML. You could define a section of your page as a call out and give that section a different style from the surrounding text. The div tag also gives you the ability to name certain sections of your documents so that you can affect them with style sheets or Dynamic HTML. One thing to keep in mind when using the div tag is that it breaks paragraphs. It acts as a paragraph end/beginning, and while you can have paragraphs within a div you can't have a div inside a paragraph. The span tag has very similar properties to the div tag, in that it changes the style of the text it encloses. But without any style attributes, the span tag won't change the enclosed items at all. The primary difference between the span and div tags is that span doesn't do any formatting of it's own. The div tag acts includes a paragraph break, because it is defining a logical division in the document. The span tag simply tells the browser to apply the style rules to whatever is within the span .
