One solution would be to install a Wi-Fi access point, and a routing server if necessary, outside of the organization's network -- then tunnel the necessary ports and addresses through the organization's firewalls. If the ban is so strict, or the firewall rules so unchangeable that even that is not feasible, I suggest a solution which is not inventive at all (comes straight from the books) but which I firmly believe will work better than any inventive one. Maybe not on this particular problem, but certainly for the future success of the project and the organization: Buy some books on agile development, mark the chapters on impediments and dysfunctional organizations, and give them to your managers. Change your organization or change of organization. Best.
