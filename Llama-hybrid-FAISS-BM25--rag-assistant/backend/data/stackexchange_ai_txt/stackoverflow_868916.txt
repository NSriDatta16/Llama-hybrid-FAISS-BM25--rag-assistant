Why EL gives me the wrong object as parameter between parenthesis?

Here's the situation: In a rich:dataTable in an a4j:form, i create a a4j:commandLink to select the values and pass it to the bean with the jboss el action syntax action="#{bean.myaction(myparameter)}" This works without problem. But If I re-render the form to filter the datatable with an ajax call, when I select the value, it gives me the wrong results: the index from the selection, but the data from before the filtering. Any ideas? Thank you Zack for giving me the right solution in only 5 minutes. I think passing parameter in the action between parenthesis is more elegant but, hey: this works. :) Thank you a lot. P.s. I'm editing the title too.
