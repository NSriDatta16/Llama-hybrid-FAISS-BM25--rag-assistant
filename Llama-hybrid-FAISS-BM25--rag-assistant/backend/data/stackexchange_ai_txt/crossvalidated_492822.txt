Prior distribution for Bayesian binary logistic regression

I am still quite new to regression models, but I am trying to apply a regression model to predict victimization(0,1) in R given childhood experience. I have done many research but i still cannot find a suitable prior distribution to give us an informative(or at least weakly informative) prior. It is known that the observation for victimization is either 0 or 1, with a mean of 0.03441526. Any input will be much appreciated.
