Practical problems with difficult posteriors

I'm looking for difficult Bayesian inference problems to test out different Monte Carlo sampling methods. I've mostly been looking at Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based algorithms and in particular, I've been using the trick of using the hessian at the Maximum A Posteriori point for the mass matrix. What are some practical inference problems with difficult posteriors to sample from?
