Question about word/discourse similarity analysis

Question about a investigative journalistic proof involving LDA and prior along with general probability distribution model for an unusual type of problem. Basically I have an email I wrote to a stranger who instead of replying or attributing to my two-to-three paragraphs of text (~ 75-100 words) he or she reposted similar (in idea somewhat in language) text on Wikipedia 12 hours later on an article that had existed for two years nearly enduring nearly no topic or subtopic emergences in that span until coincidentally hours after my email. So I am wondering 1. How does one determine the similarity of text in the Wikipedia vs email text? 2. How would one determine the probability of this text being random vs non-random i.e. corelated or coauthored. Thank you, - Peter
