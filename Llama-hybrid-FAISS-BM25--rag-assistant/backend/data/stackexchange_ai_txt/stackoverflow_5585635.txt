What we do is leverage a freely available tool called autoit which can interact with the windows component object model. If you are expecting the dialog you can invoke it with an exec and then proceed with selenium commands. If you want to catch unexpected ones, what we do is execute our selenium commands in a thread and if they time out we then run autoit having it return 0 or 1 depending if it finds a dialog and take things from there.
