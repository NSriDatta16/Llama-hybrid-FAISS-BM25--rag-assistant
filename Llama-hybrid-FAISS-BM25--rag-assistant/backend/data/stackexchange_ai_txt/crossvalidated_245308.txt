You don't do this. You shouldn't do what you are describing in a linear regression context either. All you need to do is include both variables in a multiple regression (multiple logistic regression) model. That will take care of this for you. Moreover, it won't matter if $x$ is correlated with $z$. If they are, then the standard errors will be larger (appropriately), but the estimated coefficients will be correct. You may be interested in reading: How exactly does one “control for other variables”? How well can multiple regression really “control for” covariates? Is there a difference between 'controlling for' and 'ignoring' other variables in multiple regression?
