monotonicity of sample averages tails as a function of sample size

Let $X_1,...$ be iid mean zero random variables. The LLN says $\overline{X}_n\to 0$ . I am curious if the following is true: is $P(|\overline{X}_n|>x)>P(|\overline{X}_{n+1}|>x)$ for $x$ arbitrary; is $|\overline{X}_{n+1}|$ stochastically less than $|\overline{X}_{n}|$ ? By the LLN the limsup as $n\to\infty$ is $0$ but maybe there is fluctuation and the sequence isn't monotone decreasing. I could not even establish the case $n=1$ and I think I found playing around in R a counterexample. But I don't understand how it could be that averaging could increase the tail probability, and would be interested in knowing if anything can be said, eg, maybe $P(|\overline{X}_n|>x)>P(|\overline{X}_{n+k}|>x)$ for some (distribution-dependent) $k$ or certain values $x$ . Full disclosure: I posted this on math se a couple days ago and it got closed for not having enough background. I don't know what to add and thought maybe the intrinsic value maybe would be appreciated here. It isn't homework. I think it is a basic part of understanding concentration to the mean.
