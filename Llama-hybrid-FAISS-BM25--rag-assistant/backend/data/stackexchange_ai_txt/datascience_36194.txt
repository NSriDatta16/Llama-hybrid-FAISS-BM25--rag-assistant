storing a huge dataset in h5py file format

I work on preparing the luna16 dataset for feeding into the CNN model, after reading all '.mhd' files and the labels(0, 1) in the annotated CSV file, I get a memory error, I know the problem is because of the data size is need a lot of RAM that I do not have on my computer, is there any solution to that?
