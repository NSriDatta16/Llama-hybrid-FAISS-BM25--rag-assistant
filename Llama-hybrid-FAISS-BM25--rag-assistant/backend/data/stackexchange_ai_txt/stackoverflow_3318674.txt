You will have a lot of group overlapping, so when a user is a member of teacher, sports ... how do you know which group he posts for? The solution instead of creating a ton of groups, is to create different content types, one for each type. Then you only have to manage the permission, which users should be allowed to create and view the content. A combination of CCK , Views , Content access should be able to do it for you. Organic groups like Fabian suggests could also be useful, but it might be better with a simpler solution in this case.
