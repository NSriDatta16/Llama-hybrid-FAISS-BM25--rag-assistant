Rails: find by day of week with timestamp

I need to grab the records for same day of the week for the preceeding X days of the week. There must be a better way to do it than this: Transaction.find_by_sql "select * from transactions where EXTRACT(DOW from date) = 1 and organisation_id = 4 order by date desc limit 7" It gets me what I need but is Postgres specific and not very "Rails-y". Date is a timestamp. Anyone got suggestions?
