Assuming you are interested in smoke vs no-smoke , you probably want to model your binary response variable using logistic regression. This will give you the average probability of someone being a smoker (or not) given your predictor variable(s). If you have further information on the number of cigarettes smoked, you could model the average count of cigarettes smoked given your predictor variable(s) using a Poisson or negative binomial regression model. If you further have information on how many cigarettes smoked per day (week, month, etc), you could model the average rate of cigarettes smoked given your predictor variable(s), also using a Poisson or negative binomial regression model. Eventually everything depends on your scientific model first, then you can derive a statistical model to test that scientific model. EDIT: I immediately associated smoke with being a smoker, that might have been wrong. However, the general idea should apply to any other binary variable as well.
