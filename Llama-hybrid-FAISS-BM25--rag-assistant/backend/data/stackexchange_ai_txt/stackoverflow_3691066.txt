Files listed as content in the Visual Studio project are copied to the generated XAP file (which is analogous to a ZIP file). They are not copied to isolated storage. In the case of an XML file, you can call XmlReader.Create with the path to the file as argument, as follows: using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create("path/to/file.xml")) { // read XML file here } Or you can also call Application.GetResourceStream and use the Stream property of the returned StreamResourceInfo object: StreamResourceInfo sri = Application.GetResourceStream( new Uri("path/to/file.xml", UriKind.Relative)); // read XML file here from sri.Stream, e.g. using a StreamReader object
