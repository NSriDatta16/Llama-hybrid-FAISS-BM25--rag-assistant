How does the proportion of X > a compare to the proportion of Y > a?

I am completing CS109 Data Science class available online for free. I'm not quite sure what they are asking for. In general, if group A has larger values than group B on average, does this mean the largest values are from group A? Assume you have two list of numbers, X and Y, with distribution approximately normal. X and Y have standard deviation equal to 1, but the average of X is different from the average of Y. If the difference in the average of X and the average of Y is larger than 0, how does the proportion of X > a compare to the proportion of Y > a? What proportion are they talking about here: of X > a compare to the proportion of Y > a? What do I need to discover? Thank you.
