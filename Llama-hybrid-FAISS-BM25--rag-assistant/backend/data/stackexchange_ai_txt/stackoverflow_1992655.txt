LVDiff not working in Git

I'm trying to get lvdiff from meta-diff suite to work with Git. My .gitconfig looks like this: [gui] recentrepo = C:/Users/Tanner/Desktop/FIRST 2010 Beta/Java/LoganRover [user] name = Tanner Smith email = tanner@notimportant.net [merge "labview"] name = LabVIEW 3-Way Merge driver = 'C:/Program Files/National Instruments/Shared/LabVIEW Merge/LVMerge.exe' 'C:/Program Files/National Instruments/LabVIEW 8.6/LabVIEW.exe' %O %B %A %A recursive = binary [diff "lvdiff"] #command = 'C:/Program Files/meta-diff suite/lvdiff.exe' external = C:/Users/Tanner/Desktop/FIRST 2010 Beta/lvdiff.sh [core] autocrlf = true lvdiff.sh looks like this: #!/bin/sh "C:/Program Files/meta-diff suite/lvdiff.exe" "$2" "%5" | cat And my .gitattributes file looks like this: #Use a cusstom driver to merge LabVIEW files *.vi merge=labview #Use lvdiff as the externel diff program for LabVIEW files *.vi diff=lvdiff But everytime I do a diff, all Git returns is: diff --git a/Build DashBoard Data.vi b/Build DashBoard Data.vi index fd50547..662237f 100644 Binary files a/Build DashBoard Data.vi and b/Build DeashBoard Data.vi differ It is like it is not using it or even recognizing my changes. Any ideas?
