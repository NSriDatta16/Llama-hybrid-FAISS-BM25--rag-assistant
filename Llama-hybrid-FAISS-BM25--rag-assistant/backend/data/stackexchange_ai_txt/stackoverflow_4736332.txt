I should note that you have not completely quoted the outputted stuff (I got the url to work in your answer - that should have been edited into your question rather than put as an answer). The string I got back in a file was this: "[{\"$id\":\"1\",\"CreationDate\":\"\\\/Date(1293186324257+0000)\\\/\",\"ImageUrl\":\"http:\/\/www.c-tina.com\/MyVoucherAdmin\/Images\/shop22\/burger.jpg\",\"Title\":\"Get one burger for free\",\"Description\":\"Bla lbzlfpzkfgmzke\\rdmjdgmj\\r\\r\\rlgfpzkegmkzepk\",\"ShopId\":22,\"PromotionId\":15,\"Shop\":null,\"Features\":[],\"SingleStats\":[],\"WhatsHots\":[],\"EntityKey\":{\"$id\":\"2\",\"EntitySetName\":\"Promotions\",\"EntityContainerName\":\"MyVoucherEntities\",\"EntityKeyValues\":[{\"Key\":\"PromotionId\",\"Type\":\"System.Int32\",\"Value\":\"15\"}]}}]" the key thing to me is that there are unescaped quotes at the front and end which makes me think that whatever is outputting it is deciding it needs to be quoted and if you are surrounding it in quotes you ahve to escape the quotes that are inside it. Without seeing the full output its hard to say if the problem is in teh code you've quoted above to generate the JSON or if there is a problem at a later step of processing this which is causing the quoting. Have you debugged and confirmed that the output of your serialize call is definitely producing the escaped version rather than it being done at a later stage potentially? If you're not used to the debugger then pay attention to Jon Skeet's suggest of dumping it to file or console to make sure there is no confusion that way.
