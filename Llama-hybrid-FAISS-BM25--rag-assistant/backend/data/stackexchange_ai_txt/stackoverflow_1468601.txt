Using related objects after an object is saved?

I have a situation where I want to offload an xml fragment (an atom event) each time a model instance is saved, updated or deleted. The fragment needs to include information about related objects. I can't find an event that lets me use information from related objects after saving my object. The post_save signal seems o be triggered before related object have been saved. Currently I am overriding the ModelAdmin save_model method to output a complete atom entry containing details about the instance and its related objects. But this will only work as long as instances are managed via the admin interface and not when instances are updated programmatically. Anyone who has managed to create something similar to a post_save_of_everything signal?
