I would say take it piece-meal. Solve the biggest problems first, which is in your case having business logic in the jsp pages. You can accomplish this using any web MVC framework of your choice (Struts, Spring MVC, Grails are all good. Pick one that you are most comfortable with). The next problem is organizing your business logic in a separate Model layer that your controllers can invoke. Spring is a good DI framework for organizing and bootstrapping your application. Also, Spring supports a number of web MVC frameworks including Struts, JSF etc. The last problem is your Dao layer. You mentioned you want to use Hibernate/JPA. I dont know how familiar you are with Hibernate, but make sure that you are trying to solve an actual problem by switching to Hibernate (since switching to Hibernate usually comes at a significant cost and headaches).
