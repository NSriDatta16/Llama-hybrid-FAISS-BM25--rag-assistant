Yes, you can. You should add a Copy Files build phase to your target (right-click your target, then choose Add > New Build Phase > New Copy Files Build Phase ). Set the destination of the Copy Files build phase to Resources with a path of Fonts . This will make sure the font is copied into a folder named Fonts in your application bundle. Add your font file to the new build phase by dragging the font file onto the build phase. You then need to add the ATSApplicationFontsPath key to your Info.plist file, with the name of the folder containing your font as its value: ATSApplicationFontsPath Fonts You can then use the font in your app as if it were a built-in system font by calling [NSFont fontWithName:@"yourFontName"] . Of course, you should make sure that you have permission to distribute the font before doing this.
