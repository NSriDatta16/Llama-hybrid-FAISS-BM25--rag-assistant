UISwitch is a child of UIResponder. So you can try to use methods like touchesBegan:withEvent: , touchesMoved:withEvent: and touchesEnded:withEvent: to detect user actions. The idea is to set some flag to 'changes are not allowed' state, when user began touches. Change it, depending on touch coordinates - for example, change state to 'changes are allowed', if user moved touch more than 25 pixels right. And make real changes when touches ended, depending on final flag's state.
