AttributeError: 'DecisionTreeRegressor' object has no attribute 'tree_'

everyone. I'm a noob in data science and I'm building my first ML model. But I keep getting this error, 'DecisionTreeRegressor' object has no attribute 'tree_' This is my code below. df = pd.read_csv('/Users/mog/Downloads/train_data.csv') from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 1) df.model = DecisionTreeRegressor() df.model.fit(x_train, y_train) from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score print('Training score...', accuracy_score(y_train, df_model.predict(x_train))) print('Test score...', accuracy_score(y_test, df_model.predict(x_test))) Please help.
