I think it is because allocator somewhere bite a big piece of memory. It will use it for more than one object. Try to do: GetTotalMemory(); Titles t = Titles.Dr; GetTotalMemory(); Titles t2 = Titles.Mr; GetTotalMemory(); and see what happens. here is what i see, and GetTotalMemory() is not so innocent: GetTotalMemory(); Titles t = Titles.Dr; GetTotalMemory(); outputs: 12828 19484 and this: GetTotalMemory(); //Titles t = Titles.Dr; GetTotalMemory(); outputs: 12828 19484 actually you should not pay attention to small fluctuations of free memory: Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's :)
