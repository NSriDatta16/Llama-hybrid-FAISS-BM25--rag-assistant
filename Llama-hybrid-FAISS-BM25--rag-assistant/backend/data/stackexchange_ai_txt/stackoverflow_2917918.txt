Animations: Sliding & Fading controls on a C# form (winforms)

I'm trying to implement a way to animate (translate, fade) controls around (more than one at the same time possibly) elegantly. For example, lets say I had a picture in the top left corner, and a textbox in the bottom right corner, I'd like to be able to have them smoothly slide across the window and switch places. I've been working for awhile but have not come up with anything that achieves this smoothly or easily.
