Model confusing classes

I'm training a bidirectional lstm with attention on a dataset with text data and six target classes. The F1 score on the test set by class is about 0.7 for four of the classes, and about 0.35 for the other two. Not, only that, the model is confusing those two classes and I can't find the pattern in the data by which it's making the prediction for them. I'm using fasttext pretrained word vectors. I couldn't find a proper solution for such a problem. So, my question is: Is there a research on this topic that you could guide me to, or a solution that I could use?
