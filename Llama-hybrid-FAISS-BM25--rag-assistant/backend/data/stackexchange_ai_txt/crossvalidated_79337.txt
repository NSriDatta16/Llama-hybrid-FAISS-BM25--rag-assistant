Dealing with a variable amount of entries for a given attribute

I want to analyze a .csv file with the results of a customer survey. One of the questions is: "Tell us the top 3 reasons you chose us.". The answers are short paragraphs of text listing a ranging number of reasons (not always 3). An example answer could be "1. Speed, 2. Customer service, 3. Price". Another might be: "I liked your customer service, and it wasn't that expensive!" I would like to be able to turn this data into an overview like this: REASONS Customer Service: 2 Price: 2 Speed: 1 I'm facing two problems: I'm interpreting and splitting up the reasons manually in a spreadsheet. Any tips on how to do this more efficiently are very welcome. I have a field "Reasons" which I want to contain a variable amount of values per record. I don't think spreadsheet software such as Libre Calc supports that, and I suspect I might need to export this to SQL. Am I right in suspecting that? And how would I achieve the desired multiple-fields-per-attribute requirement in SQL?
