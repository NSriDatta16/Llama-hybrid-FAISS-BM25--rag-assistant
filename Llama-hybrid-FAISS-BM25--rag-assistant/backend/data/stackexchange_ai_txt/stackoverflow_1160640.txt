You can't do it. If the help page (which is what you're describing) does not have an input box for a particular parameter, then it means it doesn't know how to do that. You should not pay too much attention to those pages in any case. They go away with WCF. They were never of very much use anyway, except for the simplest web services. They were a way to get people into the web service game way back in the beginning when there were no tools to help you test a web service. Use soapUI instead. BTW, also see Microsoft: ASMX Web Services are a “Legacy Technology” for why it makes good sense to ignore ASMX-only pages.
