There can certainly be fragmentation in MySQL data files or index files. This is common, even deliberate . That is, the storage engine may deliberately leave some extra space here and there so when you change values, it can fit the rows in without having to reorder the whole data file. There are even server properties you can use to configure how much of this slop space to allocate. I wouldn't even blink at a file discrepancy of 1-3%.
