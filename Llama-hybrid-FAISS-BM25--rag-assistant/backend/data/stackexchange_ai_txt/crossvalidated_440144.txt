Which image format is better for machine learning .png .jpg or other?

I'm trying to train a neural network with images. Since I'm extracting images from a video feed I can convert them either to .png or .jpg. Which format is preferred for machine learning and deep learning. My neural network model contains convolutional layers, max pooling layers and image resizing.
