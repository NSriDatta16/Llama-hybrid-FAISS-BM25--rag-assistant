How to distinguish between different values of a hyperparameter in communication?

From Wikipedia : In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. If we go by the definition of parameter in What's the difference between an argument and a parameter? , then a hyperparameter wouldn't be considered a value itself. Rather, it would be the spec for this value (for example, this value is a learning rate, or this value is a dropout). This also seems to agree with the way people use "hyperparameter" in communication. There are a lot of times where I want to distinguish between particular values of a hyperparameter. Going by the question I linked, I could say something like hyperargument. For example, the hyperargument 0.001 is different than the hyperargument 0.01 , even though they are under the same hyperparameter (let's say learning rate). This is what I do in my own codebase for variable names. For example, if I had this dict : hyperarguments = { "learning_rate": 0.001, "dropout": 0.25, } I would iterate over it like this: for hyperparameter, hyperargument in hyperarguments.items(): ... Is there a more common terminology to emphasize this distinction of values?
