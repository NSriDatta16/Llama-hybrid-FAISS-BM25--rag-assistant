Time Series Multivariate Forecasting

I am building a time series forecasting model in which I am considering the macroeconomic indicators as predictors.I wanted to understand 3 things How do I generally go about feature selection for my model?How do I reduce the no. of predictors? I know about CCF and Grangers causality test which both requires stationarity. Is there any better way? All the data for indicators are given in two forms on govt websites - seasonally adjusted and seasonally not adjusted. I am using seasonally adjusted data for my model building.Is that correct? How do I get the future values?I have seen trading economics and some other sites but they are paid. Also if I want predict indicators on my own how should I go about that?How are macroeconomics variables generally forecasted? Appreciate your help
