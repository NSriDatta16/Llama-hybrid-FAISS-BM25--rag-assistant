It's possible to write a crawler in javascript, using, for example, Node.JS . However, you probably won't be able to write one in a user's browser. This is because: The browser security model restricts the javascript to accessing only your own domain, so you can only index your own site. Each user will need to re-crawl your entire site each time, meaning lots of time (minutes, hours, or even days depending on the size of the site) spent crawling before the user's query can be answered, as well as lots of bandwidth usage because this is multiplied over your entire userbase. Not to mention the user's browser might not allow your JS enough storage for its index.
