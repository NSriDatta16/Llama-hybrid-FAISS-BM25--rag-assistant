all devices automatically added to team provisioning profile?

i have a development provisioning profile thats managed by xcode "Team Provisioning Profile: *", and i also have an ad-hoc provisioning profile that i use for distributing builds for testing. everytime i add a device to the ad-hoc profile (when i want to add a new beta tester), that device also gets added to my development profile. i would like my development profile to only contain developers, and the ad-hoc testing profile to only contain testers. 'automatic device provisioning' is checked in xcode organizer, i'm not sure what that does, but could it be the cause?
