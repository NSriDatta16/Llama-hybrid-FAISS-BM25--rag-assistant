Your solution will be a generalization of spam filters for email. You can either write a rule-based solution or one that learns as it goes (e.g. Bayesian filters). Defining what's "safe" and what's not will be the real trick. It's subtle. Obviously no child should be exposed to pornography. How will your filter know it? From the URL? The content? Headers? What about violent images? Do you consider reading about evolution or creationism "unsafe"? How will your filter figure those out? I don't know if it can be done. Or if it's worth it. We're all unsafe while we're here. Best to learn how to navigate the shoals. Good luck.
