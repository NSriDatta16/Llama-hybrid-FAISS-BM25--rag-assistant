I am a book person so I would recommend one of the following books: Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie and Tibshirani). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop). The first book is available as a free download from the authors' website. You may download and start reading it. You will get an idea about your deficiencies. If it's too difficult, then you need to improve your statistics and linear algebra skills. For Linear Algebra I recommend: Linear Algebra and its Applications (David Lay). For statistics I like: Discovering Statistics (Andy Fields). Stay away from the recipe books if your aims are long-term.
