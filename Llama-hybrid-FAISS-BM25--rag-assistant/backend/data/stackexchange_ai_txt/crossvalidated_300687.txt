Random forest overfits too. It happened everytime I tried RF model. All the models I tried had more than 15 features to somewhere more than a couple of hundred. I have read in many places that it does not overfit but it does and sometimes by a big margin. Sometimes, it does really well on the development sample but really poorly on the validation. It depends on the data (noise level) and many other parameters.
