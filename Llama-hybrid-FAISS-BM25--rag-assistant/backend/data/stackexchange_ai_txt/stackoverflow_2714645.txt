Decimal - truncate trailing zeros

I noticed that .NET has some funky/unintuitive behavior when it comes to decimals and trailing zeros. 0m == 0.000m //true 0.1m == 0.1000m //true but (0m).ToString() == (0.000m).ToString() //false (0.1m).ToString() == (0.1000m).ToString() //false I know about necessity to comply to the ECMA CLI standard. However I would like to know if there is built-in way to truncate the trailing zeros for a decimal value without going through string representation (.ToString("G29") and parse back trick would work, but is neither fast nor elegant solution)? Any ideas? Thanks a lot.
