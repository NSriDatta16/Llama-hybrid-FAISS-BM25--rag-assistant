When to give up CNN?

i'm implementing my first CNN for image classification in a field with very few research. I'm aware i could extract feature and then try SVM, knn... But i want to be sure CNN is not a viable solution. I have already tryied different architecture, hyperparametrisation... Result have increase from 45% to 60%. I still have thing to try (data augmentation,dropout, transfer learning...) Are there clue that can tell me CNN will not work fo my task, or should i try all method to be sure cnn is not viable? For exemple in my case, i got 12 categorie. 8 are easy to classify but for the 4 other it's very hard, and all my modification significantly affect my accuracy for the 8 class, but just increase accruracy for the 4 other class a little
