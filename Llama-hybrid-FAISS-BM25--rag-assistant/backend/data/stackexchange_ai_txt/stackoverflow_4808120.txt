NSSlider NSSliderCell clipping custom knob

I am creating a custom NSSlider with a custom NSSliderCell. All is working beautifully, other than the knob. When I drag it to the max value the knob is being clipped, I can only see 50% of the knob image. When assigning my custom NSSliderCell I am setting the knobThickness to the width of the image I am using as the knob. I assumed (I guess wrongly) that it would take that into account and stop it from clipping? Any ideas what I am doing wrong? The slider is hitting the maxValue only when the knob is clipped at 50%, so its not travelling without adding any value. - (void)drawKnob:(NSRect)knobRect { NSImage * knob = _knobOff; knobRectVar = knobRect; [[self controlView] lockFocus]; [knob compositeToPoint: NSMakePoint(knobRect.origin.x+4,knobRect.origin.y+knobRect.size.height+20) operation:NSCompositeSourceOver]; [[self controlView] unlockFocus]; } - (void)drawBarInside:(NSRect)rect flipped:(BOOL)flipped { rect.size.height = 8; [[self controlView] lockFocus]; NSImage *leftCurve = [NSImage imageNamed:@"customSliderLeft"]; [leftCurve drawInRect:NSMakeRect(5, 25, 8, 8) fromRect:NSZeroRect operation:NSCompositeSourceOver fraction:1]; NSRect leftRect = rect; leftRect.origin.x=13; leftRect.origin.y=25; leftRect.size.width = knobRectVar.origin.x + (knobRectVar.size.width/2); [leftBarImage setSize:leftRect.size]; [leftBarImage drawInRect:leftRect fromRect: NSZeroRect operation: NSCompositeSourceOver fraction:1]; [[self controlView] unlockFocus]; }
