You aren't getting duplicates. 'Pam' is not equal to 'Pamella' from the perspective of the database; the fact that one is a colloquial shortening of the other doesn't mean anything to the database engine. There really is no reliable, universal way to do this (since there are names that have multiple abbreviations, like "Rob" or "Bob" for "Robert", as well as abbreviations that can suit multiple names like "Kel" for "Kelly" or "Kelsie", let alone the fact that names can have alternate spellings). For your simple example, you could simply select and group by SUBSTRING(FirstName, 1, 3) instead of FirstName , but that's just a coincidence based upon your sample data; other name abbreviations would not fit this pattern.
