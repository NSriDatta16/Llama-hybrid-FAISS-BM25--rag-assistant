Would you definitely spot if any exceptions were being thrown? If not, fix that before you do anything else. As for why it might be browser-specific: If it depends on what data is sent by the browser and how, then clearly the browser can change the behaviour I believe ASP.NET renders in a browser-specific way; if your code is touching the rendering logic, it may be behaving differently depending on user agent.
