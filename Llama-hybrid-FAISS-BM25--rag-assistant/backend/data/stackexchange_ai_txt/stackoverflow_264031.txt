I don't think going through the file system would be the best option. Even if you could get access to file system activity, I would think it would be difficult to discern what file operation added data vs any other type of file activity like maintenance, index defrags, etc. A possible alternative would be to look into the Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Trace Namespace as a mechanism to hook into SQL Server and look for the specific events that you want to respond to. I would be cautions however of the performance impact this may cause.
