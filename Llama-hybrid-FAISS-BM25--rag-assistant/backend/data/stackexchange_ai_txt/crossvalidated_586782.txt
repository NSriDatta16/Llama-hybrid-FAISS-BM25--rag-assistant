kjetil b halvorsen's comment is witty and accurately pointed out the necessity. In any case, this is a routine procedure covered by any good time series textbook. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I am jotting down (paraphrasing) the proof, which basically is the characterization of acv functions. Kolmogorov Consistency Theorem : Let $\{\mathbf F_{\mathbf t}, ~\mathbf t := \left(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)^\mathsf T\in \mathbb R^n, ~t_1 be the set of finite dimensional distribution functions. $\bf F_t$ s can be the distribution functions of a stochastic process if and only if $$\lim_{x_i \to \infty} \mathbf F_{\mathbf t}(\mathbf x) = \mathbf F_{\mathbf t(i)} (\mathbf x(i)),$$ $\mathbf t(i)$ is $\mathbf t$ sans the $i$ th component. It would take more of a space to derive this and it would, frankly, derail from the matter in hand. Nonetheless, here is discussed elegantly the proofs both for countable as well as uncountable products. Theorem : A function $\gamma: \mathbb Z \to \mathbb R$ is acv function of a stationary time series if and only if it is even and non-negative definite. I would adumbrate the proof here. Let $\mathbf a\in \mathbb R^n,~ \mathbf t \in \mathbb Z^n$ and let $\mathbf Z_{\mathbf t} := (X_{t_1}- \mathbb EX_{t_1},\ldots, X_{t_n}- \mathbb EX_{t_n})^\mathsf T. $ Since $\mathbb V(\mathbf a^\mathsf T \mathbf Z_{\mathbf t}) \geqslant 0$ and $\mathbb V(\mathbf a^\mathsf T \mathbf Z_{\mathbf t}) = \mathbf a^\mathsf T \mathbb E \mathbf Z_{\mathbf t}\mathbf Z_{\mathbf t}^\mathsf T\mathbf a, $ one can conclude $[\gamma(t_i-t_j) ]_{i, ~j~=~1}^n$ is non-negative definite. For the converse, the approach would be to show the existence of a stationary process that is associated with an even non-negative definite function $\gamma(\cdot),$ the latter being the acv of the former. Let $\mathbf K:= [\gamma(t_i-t_j) ]_{i, ~j~=~1}^n.$ For each $n\in \mathbb N, ~\mathbf t\in \mathbb R^n, :t_1 let $\mathbf F_{\mathbf t}$ be the distribution function in $\mathbb R^n$ with characteristic function $$ \varphi_{\mathbf t}(\mathbf u) := \exp\left(-\mathbf u^\mathsf T\mathbf K\mathbf u/2\right),~\mathbf u\in \mathbb R^n.$$ By assumption, $\mathbf K$ is non-negative and this means $\varphi_{\mathbf t}(\cdot) $ is the characteristic function of an $n$ -variate normal distribution with mean $\bf 0$ and covariance matrix $\bf K. $ Now, the critical thing is to note that $$\varphi_{\mathbf t(i)}(\mathbf u(i)) = \lim_{\mathbf u(i) \to 0}\varphi_{\mathbf t}(\mathbf u) , \forall\mathbf t. $$ This implies $\mathbf F_{\mathbf t}$ is Kolmogorov consistent and hence there exists a time series $\langle X_t\rangle$ with the distribution function $\mathbf F_{\mathbf t}.$ Reference: Time Series: Theory and Methods, Peter J.
