Where to store Shopping Cart in MVC Application?

I am working on a Railway Portal and would require maintaining a shopping cart of components user has selected, there could be multiple components of different type in the cart. I don't see a value in storing the cart in database, would like to store the final order in DB. Where can I store/hold (temporary) the cart data per user session in MVC? All MVC samples I saw online save the cart data in DB – not sure why. MVC presentation layer will be communicating with external web services for pricing and availability of these components, so I can't store only the product IDs to do a lookup for actual product descriptions/prices during the shopping process... I have to store everything in the cart (Product IDs, Descriptions, Prices etc) some place in memory. My application will be running in WEB FARM environment and cannot use in-process session storage. Options come to my mind are: SESSION STATE in SQL SERVER Using some kind of Distributed Caching Mechanism to store Session data such as “Windows Server AppFabric”
