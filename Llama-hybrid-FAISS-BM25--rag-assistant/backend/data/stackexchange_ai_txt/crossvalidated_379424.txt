It is true that with a standard hypothesis test you either reject the null hypothesis or you do not. I.e. type II error + power = 1 under $H_A$ and non-rejection probability + type I error = 1 under $H_0$ . However, the statement the way you phrase it is not true. Type I and type II errors cannot happen under the same scenario within the traditional frequentist hypothesis testing paradigm. I.e. either $H_0$ is true, in which can you can either wrongly reject (type I error) or not reject the null hypothesis, or $H_a$ is true, in which case you can either correctly reject $H_0$ (how often you do this on average is the power) or wrongly not reject (type II error).
