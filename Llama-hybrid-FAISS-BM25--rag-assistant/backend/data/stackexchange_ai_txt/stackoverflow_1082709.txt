I feel that I'm cheating, but using Perl this would do what the OP wants: sub byte_substr { use bytes; index shift,shift } Normally index() in Perl works on strings with character semantics, but the "use bytes" pragma makes it use byte segmantics instead. From the manpage: When "use bytes" is in effect, the encoding is temporarily ignored, and each string is treated as a series of bytes.
