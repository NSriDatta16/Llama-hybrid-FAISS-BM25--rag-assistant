How can I handle a mouseMiddleDrag event in PythonCard?

I would like to use the middle mouse button to drag an image in an application written in Python and using PythonCard/wxPython for the GUI. The latest version of PythonCard only implements a "left mouse button drag" event and I am trying to modify PythonCard to handle a "middle mouse button drag" as well. Here is the relevant code from Lib\site-packages\PythonCard\event.py : class MouseMoveEvent(MouseEvent, InsteadOfTypeEvent): name = 'mouseMove' binding = wx.EVT_MOTION id = wx.wxEVT_MOTION def translateEventType(self, aWxEvent): if aWxEvent.Dragging(): return MouseDragEvent.id else: return self.id class MouseDragEvent(MouseMoveEvent): name = 'mouseDrag' id = wx.NewEventType() class MouseMiddleDragEvent(MouseMoveEvent): #My addition name = 'mouseMiddleDrag' id = wx.NewEventType() My addition does not work. What can I do instead? Is there a specific wxPython method that I could use to bypass PythonCard?
