Think of JQuery as being an abstraction that just happens to be built using Javascript. Most things that you need to do can be done elegantly with JQuery. To use JQuery effectively it is more important to understand the DOM, Events and CSS. It helps me to think of JQuery and Javascript as being different paradigms even though we all know that JQuery is written in JS. I came to Javascript from a C/C++ background and it took me a while to really get to grips with the object model first-class functions, inner functions and closures and prototypes. JQuery is much clearer, easier to follow, and more powerful once you understand what it is that you are manipulation (i.e. DOM, Events, CSS). So I'd learn JQuery first and fill in the Javascript gaps as they appear.
