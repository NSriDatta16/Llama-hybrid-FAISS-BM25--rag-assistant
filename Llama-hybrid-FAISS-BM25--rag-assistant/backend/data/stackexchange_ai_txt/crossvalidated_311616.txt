Logistic regression, use of lagged indicator counts as explanatory variable

I am an intern and new to make sas scorecard model. A former colleague tells me that, when selecting features for a logistic regression model, you better not choose ones that are related to the past value of the outcome. E.g. in a model that predicts whether someone will buy stock, you should not use "the number times the stock was bought in past 3 months" as an explanatory variable. The same would hold for e.g. "the total amount invested in stock for last week", ... Is it correct that such explanatory variables are better not used in a logistic regression model, and if so, why is that ?
