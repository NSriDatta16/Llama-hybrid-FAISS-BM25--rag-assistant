Without knowing more about your app, I think one of the better solutions would be to keep the array on the main thread and dispatch back to it whenever another thread needs to make a change. Like this: dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ [array addObject:object]; [tableView reloadData]; }); Of course, you can get much more complex with the dispatch API, but it does handle locking and everything for you. Definitely more elegant than using an NSLock. It does only work on iOS 4 or later though.
