I know little about meteorology, so my following assumptions may be wrong: today's temperature is similar to yesterday's and the day before yesterday's (maybe more days going back), and also similar to temperature a year age, two years ago, three years ago, etc. If these assumptions got reinforcement I would use an ARMA model using days -1, -2, … and -365, -365*2, -365*3, … as predictors of today's temperature, and maybe a few days looking back in the moving average terms. (You can imagine many variants of this model.) After fitting the model I would make a large number of model based simulations predicting the temperatures for each of the following 365 days, and count the cases satisfying the two conditions.
