Is there ever a time when the touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded methods would be handled inside a UIViewController vs. UIView?

Is there ever a time when the touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded methods would be handled inside a UIViewController vs. UIView? I understand that they are typically used in a custom UIView but I am curious about this situation. Thanks
