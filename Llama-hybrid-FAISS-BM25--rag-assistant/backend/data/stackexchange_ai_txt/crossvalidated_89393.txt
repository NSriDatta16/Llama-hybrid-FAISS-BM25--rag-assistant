SAS is extremely expensive as an enterprise wide solution. It is used by some large organisations specially in banking and insurance. Many companies today are taking a different approach, looking for less expensive and scalable solutions. Open source is getting a lot of traction even in large organisations. I would start with R programming and maybe Python. Once you have enough exposure to these, and if you decide to learn SAS, it will be a lot easier to digest.
