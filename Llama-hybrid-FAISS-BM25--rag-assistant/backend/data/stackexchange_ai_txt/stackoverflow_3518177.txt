How do I translate the output of a filter in Django

I have some template code that looks like: I'd like to be able to translate it but that appears to be difficult to accomplish. http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3804 mentions {{ _("Some String") }} which appears to work for literal strings, but when used like {{ _(Variable) }} gives the error Variables and attributes may not begin with underscores: '_' So, how do you do it? Oh yea, I tried doing: '{% if blah %}{% trans "Resend..." %}{% else %}{% trans "Send..." %}{% endif %}' which works, but look so ugly I don't want to. Surely with Django there is some more elegant way to do this..... Seems like a |trans filter would be in order, but that was shot down as a non-issue with http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3804
