There's no built-in function to accomplish that - you will have to code it yourself. You can accomplish the same thing using modulo, but you will have to use a for loop (or some kind of index): var colours = new List {"Red", "Green", "Blue"}; for (int i=0; i " + rows[i].Name + " "); } Now, I'm sure you will agree that this is much more elegant than that silly Ruby stuff ;-)
