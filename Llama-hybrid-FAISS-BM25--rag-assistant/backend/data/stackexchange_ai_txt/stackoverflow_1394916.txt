AIR: Security Sandbox Violation when using remote images

The code below is simplified for example I'm developing an AIR application (using Flex) which loads several of its images from a remote web server. The images display fine, however, whenever I'm manipulating the containers which hold the remotely-loaded images, I get errors in my console: *** Security Sandbox Violation *** SecurityDomain 'http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif' tried to access incompatible context 'app:/sandbox_test.swf' The images don't seem to be affected, but I don't like having errors displayed that I don't understand. Here's a sample app that exemplifies the problem: If you drag using the dragger on the HDividedBox, the security error appears. I've looked at some of the Security class / security sandbox stuff for AIR, but by default AIR should have access to networked resources (which is why the images load I think). Using Security.allowDomain("www.google.com") isn't an option in AIR - it just throws a SecurityError. Does anyone know what's causing it, or how to fix it? (Or maybe it's just a Flex/AIR bug?). Also - does anyone know if there's a way to break when the error happens, so I can trace it to the root action causing it?
