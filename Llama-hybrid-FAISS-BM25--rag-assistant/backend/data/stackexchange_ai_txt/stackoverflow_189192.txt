Let me say this MS TEST is not a professional product and should be avoided whenever possible. If you want to use a good testing framework then use MBUnit with TestDriven.NET. MBUnit comes with many new attributes including RollBack and RowTest , Row. Also, TestDriven.NET will allow you to debug your unit tests (How cool is that). You can also run the code coverage from TestDriven.NET which shows you how much of your code is covered under tests. Give it a try I am sure you like it. PS: IT is FREEE
