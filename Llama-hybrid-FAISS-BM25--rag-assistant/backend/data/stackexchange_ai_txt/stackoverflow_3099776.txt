I've found a solution that worked for my project. I have (mis)used the Tag property of the slider and put the time information in it. I then databound this to a textblock in the template, displaying the information. It's not the most elegant solution, but it was sufficient for the job. Maybe I will choose to put the entire slider inside a user control, as @ErikHeemskerk suggested.
