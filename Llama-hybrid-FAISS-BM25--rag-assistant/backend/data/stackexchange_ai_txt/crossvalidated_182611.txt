Let $\theta$ denote an unknown quantity that affects the decision process. We call $\theta$ the state of the world . Let $\Theta$ denote the parameter space, such that $\Theta=\{ \text{the state of all possible states of nature}\}$. Let $d$ denote the decision that might change depending on $\theta$, and $D$ be the set of all possible decisions. Given that particular action $d$ is taken and $\theta$ in fact is true state of the world then one can consider a loss function (utility function) $L(\theta, d)$. It is important to note, that $L(\theta, \theta)$ = 0. In statistical problems, $\theta$ is a often an unknown parameter that needs to be estimated, and the decision $d$ corresponds to a point estimator. The $L(d,\mu)$ corresponds to squared-error loss and the $c$ can be thought of as a scaled version that penalizes you more when $c>1$. You should pick up any book on Decision Theory if you really want to read/know more though about loss functions. Although, if you are comfortable with Bayesian statistics, I highly recommend this book for a good explanation of loss functions: The Bayesian Choice
