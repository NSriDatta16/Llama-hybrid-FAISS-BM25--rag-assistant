How to improve Visual C++ compilation times?

I am compiling 2 C++ projects in a buildbot, on each commit. Both are around 1000 files, one is 100 kloc, the other 170 kloc. Compilation times are very different from gcc (4.4) to Visual C++ (2008). Visual C++ compilations for one project take in the 20 minutes. They cannot take advantage of the multiple cores because a project depend on the other. In the end, a full compilation of both projects in Debug and Release, in 32 and 64 bits takes more than 2 1/2 hours. gcc compilations for one project take in the 4 minutes. It can be parallelized on the 4 cores and takes around 1 min 10 secs. All 8 builds for 4 versions (Debug/Release, 32/64 bits) of the 2 projects are compiled in less than 10 minutes. What is happening with Visual C++ compilation times? They are basically 5 times slower. What is the average time that can be expected to compile a C++ kloc? Mine are 7 s/kloc with vc++ and 1.4 s/kloc with gcc. Can anything be done to speed-up compilation times on Visual C++?
