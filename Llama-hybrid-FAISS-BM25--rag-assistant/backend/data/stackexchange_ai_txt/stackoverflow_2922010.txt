This is a common problem in Windows Mobile whenever an error triggers a shutdown (which I'm assuming is what's happening in your case, given the URL you're going to). Even when you catch the unhandled exception, you can execute a bunch of statements reliably before the application then closes, but MessageBoxes may or may not be displayed. They're almost always displayed when running the app in debug through Visual Studio, but they almost never appear when the app is run as a compiled EXE. Weirdly, if you call MessageBox twice in this situation, the second call usually shows a box (even in the EXE). I don't know if the same problem exists with regular Windows, but it sounds like you're describing the exact same situation. Complete guess here, but it's possible that the Windows OS is aware that the application requesting the message box is in its death throes, and sensibly ignores the request (in the olden days, dying apps often used to throw up a barrage of "help me, I'm dying" message boxes).
