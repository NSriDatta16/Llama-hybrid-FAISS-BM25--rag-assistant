Hey Rohan! My name is Robert Plummer, I'm the creator and lead developer of jQuery.sheet. To answer your question, YES! With the latest release of jQuery.sheet, customizing calculations has never been easier. Here is a really quick example: $('#sheetContainer').sheet({ calculations:{ SUM_V2: function(value_as_array) { var sum = 0; for (var i = 0; i Then you can use it inside a cell's value like this: =SUM_V2(A1:A10) Download the latest release here: http://visop-dev.com/Project+jQuery.sheet Thanks for the interest in my project, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know!
