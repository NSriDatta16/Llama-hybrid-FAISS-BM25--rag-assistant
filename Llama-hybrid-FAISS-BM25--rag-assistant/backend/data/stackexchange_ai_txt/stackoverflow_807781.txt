There are several other measures of cluster validity that I've been using in some research I've been doing in accessing clustering methods. In cases where you have a dataset labeled with classes (supervised clustering) you can use precision and recall as mentioned above, or purity and entropy. Purity of a cluster = the number of occurrences of the most frequent class / the size of the cluster (this should be high) Entropy of a cluster = a measure of how dispersed classes are with a cluster (this should be low) In cases where you don't have the class labels (unsupervised clustering), intra and inter similarity are good measures. Intra-cluster similarity for a single cluster = average cosine similarity of all pairs within a cluster (this should be high) Inter-cluster similarity for a single cluster = average cosine sim of all items in one cluster compared to all items in every other cluster (this should be low) This paper has some good descriptions of all four of these measures. http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/papers/edcICAIL05.pdf Nice link with the unsupervised F-measure, I'm looking into that right now.
