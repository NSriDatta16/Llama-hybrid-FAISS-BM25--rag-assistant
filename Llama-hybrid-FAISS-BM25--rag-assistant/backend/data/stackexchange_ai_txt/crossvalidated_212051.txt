I would first of all carry out an overall test on the 2 by 4 table using chi-squared or the extended form of the Fisher exact test. If this was significant I would compare each category with the reference. You could fit a model using logistic regression as well of course. Note that you may run into some problems with your never attender category as you have a zero there.
