send a HTTP request using raw socket and WinPcap

as part of my project, I'm trying to send IP packets that contain HTTP requests to Google. I'm using Winpcap library and VC++. Currently, I have the TCP three-way handshaing packets done, but I'm stuck on sending the actual HTTP request packet after I send the TCP ACK packet. When I capture the packets using wireshark, this packet is marked "TCP segment of a Reassembled PDU". The protocol column is 'TCP' not 'HTTP' also. What's wrong? How would I send HTTP packets in this way?
