I really haven't done much with Bayesian posterior distributions ( and not for a while), but I'll try to help with what you've given. First, k!(N-k)! / (N+1)! = 1 / (B(N,k) * (N + 1)) and you can calculate the binomial coefficients in Matlab with nchoosek() though it does say in the docs that there can be accuracy problems for large coefficients. How big are N and k? Second, according to Mathematica, integralFromZeroToOne( q^k * (1-q)^(N-k) ) = pi * csc((k-N)*pi) * Gamma(1+k)/(Gamma(k-N) * Gamma(2+N)) where csc() is the cosecant function and Gamma() is the gamma function . However, Gamma(x) = (x-1)! which we'll use in a moment. The problem is that we have a function Gamma(k-N) on the bottom and k-N will be negative. However, the reflection formula will help us with that so that we end up with: = (N-k)! * k! / (N+1)! Apparently, your notes were correct.
