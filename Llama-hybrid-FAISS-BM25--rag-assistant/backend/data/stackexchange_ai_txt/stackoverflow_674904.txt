Salting Your Password: Best Practices?

I've always been curious... Which is better when salting a password for hashing: prefix, or postfix? Why? Or does it matter, so long as you salt? To explain: We all (hopefully) know by now that we should salt a password before we hash it for storage in the database [ Edit: So you can avoid things like what happened to Jeff Atwood recently ]. Typically this is done by concatenating the salt with the password before passing it through the hashing algorithm. But the examples vary... Some examples prepend the salt before the password. Some examples add the salt after the password. I've even seen some that try to put the salt in the middle. So which is the better method, and why? Is there a method that decreases the chance of a hash collision? My Googling hasn't turned up a decent analysis on the subject. Edit: Great answers folks! I'm sorry I could only pick one answer. :)
