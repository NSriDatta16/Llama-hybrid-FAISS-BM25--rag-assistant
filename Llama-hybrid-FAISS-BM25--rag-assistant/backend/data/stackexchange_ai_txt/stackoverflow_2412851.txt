Embedding JTextArea into a JMenuItem

We are building our own Web Browser in Java. It doesn't have to be anything too complicated, we just want several things to do so we could distinguish our project from others. What we want to know is this: Is it possible to somehow embed a JTextField object into a JMenuItem? To be more precise, we want our address bar (text field) to show when we click on a certain item within our menu.
