Agile Development 101 Video

I've been trying to find a good video that I can show at a "Lunch and Learn" on Agile Development / Scrum. Our organization is primarily Waterfall and most people have never even heard of Agile development let alone have any concrete knowledge of the topic. There are plenty of great resources out there that talk about Agile, but they all seem to assume a basic working knowledge of Agile. I can not find one that gives a good, down to earth, introduction to Agile development for those who know nothing about. Can anyone provide such a link? Thanks in Advance.
