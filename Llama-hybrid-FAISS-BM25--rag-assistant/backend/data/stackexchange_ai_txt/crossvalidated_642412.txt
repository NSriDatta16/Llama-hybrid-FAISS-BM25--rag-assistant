A different point of view, does understanding regression make you a good data engineer? It is much more important to be a good programmer and for example be able to program in python and SQL and have experience with some fancy platform like hadoop, google cloud and visualization software like tableau or shiny. Or at least, that is often in the descriptions. (This is not based on experience as a recruiter, but based on being someone that understands regression and occasionally looking out for vacancies in the field of data science. They are often very detailed, relating to specific practical skills). Although regression is very basic and it would raise some eyebrows if knowledge about it is lacking, I believe that most recruiters are looking for simple muscle rather than brains. Not being able to perform a simple regression analysis is a bit disappointing, yet is it essential for the data job? If you are asking this question then probably you already got the answer.
