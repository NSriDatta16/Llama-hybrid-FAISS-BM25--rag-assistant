Facebook javascript SDK works with one app id but not another

I have been working on creating a publish to stream dialog box with the javascript sdk. I couldn't get it to work, so in frustration I tried replacing the app id with the app id of another app I had previously worked on. Somehow this worked perfectly! There is no difference in the code, only the app id changed. This is the code. What could be the difference between the two app settings that would cause the sdk to work with one id and not the other? In fact, no new facebook application which I create will work with the javascript sdk. Only my original app. (function() { var e = document.createElement('script'); e.async = true; e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js'; document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e); }()); window.fbAsyncInit = function() { FB.init({ appId: '696969696969', status: true, cookie: true, channelUrl: 'http://example.com/channel.html' }); FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) { console.log(response.session); }); var publish = { method : 'stream.publish', message : '', attachment : { name : 'name', caption : 'caption', description : 'description', href : 'http://www.fjdjdj.com' }, action_links : [ { text : 'action link', href : 'http://www.cnn.com' } ], user_message_prompt : 'user prompt' }; FB.ui(publish, function(response) { console.log(response); }); };
