What are key differences between Theano (Python) and Torch (Lua) for deep learning?

Theano and Torch both supports GPU calculations. My question is whether Theano or Torch have significant differences in: performance ease of use (assuming one knows the programming language) libaray support for optimizaiton algorithms (e.g. pylearn2 for Theano) parallelizm (regarding parallel calculation inside one PC and distributed calcualtions across computers... Theano is not fit for the latter) hardware support (e.g. OpenCL support is quite young in Theano) EDIT Torch actually doesn't have symbolic differentiation, so no question which one to use for my own optimization problems (having no time to do the differentiation for each problem). Also only Theano is symbolic/functional of the two, which I actually do enjoy. (Some might not.) This reddit link was pretty helpful to learn about the differences.
