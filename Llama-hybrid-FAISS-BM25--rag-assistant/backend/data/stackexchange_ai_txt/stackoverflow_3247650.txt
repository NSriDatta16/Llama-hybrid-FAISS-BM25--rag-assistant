How do I generate test data for heterogeneous environments?

I am facing a new task in my job and I need to find out how to generate and administer test data. Googling led to a lot of information about specific test data generation like filling a database with random data or camouflaged production data, generating files, generating test data with multi-objective genetic algorithms to minimize test data and optimize coverage, etc. But my task is somehow harder, because the environment is not only one database, it's a heterogeneous environment, which evolved over time, consisting of databases, files, different servers, programs, etc. Time shall also be simulated by the files aging and so on. I am somehow lost here and need some starting points from where I can dig further into the materia. Do you know any tools, knowledge sources, websites, books, experiential reports or something else considering the topic "Evolving testing environments"?
