WPF GridSplitter Doesn't Work With WebBrowser Control?

I've been struggling with the GridSplitter . It seems to be incompatible with the WPF WebBrowser control. If I resize my window and move the GridSplitter, then I can make my grid wider than my window and non-viewable. Before: WPF GridSplitter WebBrowser Before http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/4061/grid1vn8.gif After: (note scrollbars) WPF GridSplitter WebBrowser After http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/4303/grid2so0.gif My XAML... Steps to reproduce the problem... Drag the window's right edge to the right to about double its width Drag the splitter to the left as far as it'll go Drag the window's right edge to the left as far as it'll go. How do I keep the GridSplitter from changing the size of my Grid beyond what the Window can contain? Does anyone know more about this problem? ...or have a workaround?
