Most project managers equate responsibility with status, so a project manager who has spare capacity is quite likely to volunteer to take on a new responsibility, because it's in his/her own best interest. In all but the most functional organizations it's often better to be visibly overloaded, for that heroic look. It's more likely to be in the organization's best interest to slightly under load its project managers, so that there is some spare capacity available should something start to go wrong. A project manager might well choose to apply his/her spare capacity in some constructive way in any case. Excessive politicking or other unconstructive activity is a good indicator of someone who could be more constructively deployed. Even on agile projects, workload tends to be uneven across a project cycle - e.g. delivery is often a management-intensive activity - somebody who is continuously heavily loaded probably has too much to do, and may be ignoring or hiding a serious problem. If the next level of management conducts regular project reviews, pays attention to how many problems are being escalated, whether the project reports correlate with the news from the grapevine, and does some basic estimation on workload projections for each project manager, then the organization should be able to run a reasonably efficient system. Managers tend to be political and psychological animals. Any methodology that doesn't take that into account is ignoring reality, so a good methodology for this problem is likely to be based more on observed behaviors than on hard numbers.
