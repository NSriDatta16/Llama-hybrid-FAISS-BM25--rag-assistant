Storing complex XML values in PHP

Consider this hypothetical xml: foo Some paragraph of text. What would be the best way in PHP to parse out the 2nd argument. The full xml-structure must be stored in the database, but consideration has to be made for the fact that it could reference already-declared xml namespaces higher up in the document. Is there a good way to take out a chunk of XML using any of the readily available PHP parsing libraries, and store all the semantic information?
