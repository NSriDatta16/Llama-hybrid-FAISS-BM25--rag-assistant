Your difficulties seem to stem from translating the original form of equation (1.31) into the "probability that an interval $[t+\tau, t+\tau + \Delta t]$ is an interspike interval". This is due to the authors using the word "interval" synonymously with "length of an interval". I rewrite the book paragraph using a bit more formalism and hope it becomes easier to understand. I also find it much easier to work with the cdf instead of the pdf. Rewrite of book paragraph: The probability density of length of time intervals between adjacent spikes is called the interspike interval length distribution, and it is a useful statistic for characterizing spiking patterns. Let $L$ denote this random length, and $F$ be its cumulative density function. Suppose that a spike occurs at a time $t_i$ for some value of $i$ . The following interspike interval is at least of length $\tau$ , if there is no new spike in the interval $(t_i, t_i+\tau)$ . From equation 1.29, with $n=0$ , the probability of not firing a spike in this period, i.e., the probability that the interspike length exceeds $\tau$ is $$ P(L > \tau) = \exp (-r\tau). $$ From this we get the cdf of $L$ , namely $$ F(\tau) = P(L\leq \tau) = 1 - \exp(-r\tau). $$ This is the cdf of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $r$ . New interpretation of book text: Now look at equation (1.31). Using the symbol $L$ for length of interval again, we read $$ P(\tau\leq L This probability can be written as difference of cdf in $\tau$ and $\tau+\Delta t$ , which gives us $$ \frac{F(\tau+\Delta t)-F(\tau)}{\Delta t} = r\exp(-r\tau). $$ Now we can take the limit on the left hand side for $\Delta t \to 0$ and get the pdf of an exponential distribution.
