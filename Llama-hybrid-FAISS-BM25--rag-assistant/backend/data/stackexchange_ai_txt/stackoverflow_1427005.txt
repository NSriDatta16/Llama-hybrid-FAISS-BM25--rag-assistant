How to disable indentation of LaTeX list items?

By default the "enumerate" environment is indented with respect to the current environment. How can I disable this indentation so that an enumerate environment of three items would produce the same output as the following piece of code? \documentclass{article} \begin{document} \paragraph{1.} \paragraph{2.} \paragraph{3.} \end{document}
