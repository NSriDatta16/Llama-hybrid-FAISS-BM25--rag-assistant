Manage widgets from page edit screen

I'm looking to find a way to integrate the widget control area into the page edit screen. For the site I'm making it would be perfect with the same drag and drop functionality. I want a list of the available widgets that I can drag and drop into the page widget area. The widgets will then only be shown on that particular page. I've looked through the wp-admin/widgets.php file and tried to use some code from there. I even tried just including widgets.php at the end of the post.php (which is basically what I want, but of course gave me funny results). Please don't suggest plug-ins like Widget Context or Widget Logic. Those are my fallback if I cant do this :) So I would like ideas and/or input on how to accomplish this. Preferably I'd like to do it in the functions.php file, or in a plug-in. Edit: I'm still interested in this. Just a theoretical description on how to do this would be awesome :)
