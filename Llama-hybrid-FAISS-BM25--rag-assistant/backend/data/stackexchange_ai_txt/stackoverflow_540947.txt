Searching for the beginning of a string in an array in C#

I have a List containing a lot of paths. I have a specific path I want to check against this list to see if there are any paths there that uses this path, ie: f.StartsWith(r.FILENAME) && f != r.FILENAME What would be the fastest way of doing this? edit: Complete function from answer below: static bool ContainsFragment(string[] paths, string fragment) { // paths **must** be pre-sorted via Array.Sort(paths); if (paths.Length == 0) return false; int index = Array.BinarySearch(paths, fragment); if (index >= 0 && index+1
