Should all parameter coeffiecients be negative for WOE in logistic

I am currently Modeling fraud where the event that fraud occurs is a 0. I am using weight of evidence A statement was made that all of the parameter coefficients must be negative for the logistic regression regardless of whether the explanatory variable positively or negatively correlates with the event of fraud. Some of the binary indicators increase risk and others decrease it. Should all of my parameter coefficients be negative? Regardless of there influence on the response?
