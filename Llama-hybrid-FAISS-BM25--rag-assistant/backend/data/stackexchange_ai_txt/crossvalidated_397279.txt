Something that bothers my intuitive thinking

Here is an interesting situation I came along recently: Turnover January: 5 million February: 6 million Cost of goods sold (CoGS) January: 2 million February: 4 million If we look at the relative percentages of CoGS from turnover we get 40% in January and 66.6% in February or an average of them of 53.3%. If we look at the total for the two months we have a total of 11 million turnover and 5 million CoGS thus 54.54% of CoGS from sales. I know averaging percentages is not indicated but my question is, is there a way to actually calculate that 54.54%-53.3% = 1.24% change beforehand? Thanks! I hope my question is not too ambiguous.
