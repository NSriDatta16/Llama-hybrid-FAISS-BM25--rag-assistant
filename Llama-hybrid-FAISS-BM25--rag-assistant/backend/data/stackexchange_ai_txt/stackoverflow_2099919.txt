What are the binary storage formats for sqflt8, sqlmoney and other native SQL data types?

According to the documentation, native (binary) data can be imported or exported with bcp formatted in the native SQL Server data formats. Examples of these are SQLFLT8, SQLFLT4, SQLMONEY or SQLNUMERIC. Does anyone know either what the data formats for the various types are, or where documentation specifying these formats might be found. For example, is a SQLFLT8 stored as an IEEE double precision number or in some other format? Edit: From the answers by kevchadders and Andrew I had a little epiphany did a little bit of googling for #define and typedef to see if I could find C header files with definitions. This came up with a file odbcdss.h ; the answer I've posted below has some out-takes from the file, which looks quite promising.
