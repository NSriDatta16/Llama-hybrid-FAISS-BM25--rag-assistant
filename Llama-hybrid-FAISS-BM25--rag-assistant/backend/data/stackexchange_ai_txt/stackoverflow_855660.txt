I'll preface this by saying I use Blogger not Wordpress but I imagine there are similarities. In Blogger there is a setting to convert line breaks into tags.

I had to turn it off and put in my paragraph tags, etc manually. Here is one less than ideal solution , which also mentions the issue of Wordpress inserting tags in forms.
