the source code of manageAjax is available here: http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/jquery.ajaxmanager.js The global jquery 'complete' function is sent via those line : if (opts.global) { $.event.trigger("ajaxComplete", args); } This creates a new Event object on the fly so it blanks out any data you may have available on the original event. I might be wrong, but after reading the code quickly, the headers are lost early in manageAjax and I am not sure you can do what you want while using this library until the library gets patched to allow this. So Roberto's comment seems like a good advice : try it without manageAjax and it will most probably work I hope this will help you, Jerome Wagner
