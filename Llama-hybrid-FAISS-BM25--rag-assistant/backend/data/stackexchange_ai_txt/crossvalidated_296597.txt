Sentiment Analysis - Emoticon

I am working on an NLP project, my objective is to compute a Sentiment Analysis over short text message. So far, I did not come up with a solution to account the emoticons. I want to use a machine learning approach, but I also would like to include somehow the emoticons in the text for the analysis. Most of the research papers I have read that imply a machine learning approach do not account for emoticons (instead, they just clean the text from all the special characters). I only found lexicon based approaches that account for emoticons. Any advised approach to include emoticons in my analysis?
