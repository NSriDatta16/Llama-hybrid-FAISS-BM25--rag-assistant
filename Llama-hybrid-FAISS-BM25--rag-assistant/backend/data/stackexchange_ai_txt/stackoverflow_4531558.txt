Open Visual Studio. Open the server connections tab and connect to your SQL server. In your project, add a new Linq To SQL Data Context. This will add a new file. Once this is open in the designer, drag and drop the tables from your database into the SQL Data context. At this point, you can now go to your code and say. NameOfYourDataContext dc = new NameOfYourDataContext(); var query = from row in dc.table where property == 0 //Filter if needed select row; //OR var query = dc.table.where(row => row.Property == 0); int i = 0; foreach(var row in query) { row.property = i++; } dc.SubmitChanges(); If you are really trying to control the class that is created then I recommend that you look into the SQL Metal tool which can create data contexts from an xml file.
