I can't say for sure where things are going wrong, but I discourage using a form's name attribute to reference it like you have done here: document.forms['FindForm'].action = theAction; document.FindForm.submit(); Why not try the following jQuery: $("form:FindForm").action = theAction; $("form:FindForm").trigger("submit"); You should also check that $("form:FindForm") is indeed referencing the desired form element.
