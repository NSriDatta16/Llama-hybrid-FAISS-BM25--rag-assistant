I wrote a blog post about why High Test Coverage Ratio is a Good Thing Anyway . I agree that: when a portion of code is executed by tests, it doesnâ€™t mean that the validity of the results produced by this portion of code is verified by tests . But still, if you are heavily using contracts to check states validity during tests execution, high test coverage will mean a lot of verification anyway.
