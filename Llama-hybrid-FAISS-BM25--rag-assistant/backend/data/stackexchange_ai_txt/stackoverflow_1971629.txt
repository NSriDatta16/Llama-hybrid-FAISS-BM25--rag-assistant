JSF Eclipse Designer

Is there any Eclipse plugin that will allow me to do a Visual Studio like drag-and-drop for JSF components on a web page? So I won't have to write and the tool would just create this code for me? If not eclipse, are there are other options? (I do not plan to actually use something like this but I do need to know).
