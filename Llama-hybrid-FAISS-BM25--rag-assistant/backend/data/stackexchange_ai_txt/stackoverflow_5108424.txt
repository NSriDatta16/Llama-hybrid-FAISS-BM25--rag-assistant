@Andrew B: Your code can even be improved: public String getOperationsAsString() throws Exception{ StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, "yes"); for (Node node: operations) { transformer.transform(new DOMSource(node), new StreamResult(writer)); } return writer.toString(); } That way, you create the Transformer only once and you do not need the StringBuilder. StringWriter already writes into a StringBuffer internally.
