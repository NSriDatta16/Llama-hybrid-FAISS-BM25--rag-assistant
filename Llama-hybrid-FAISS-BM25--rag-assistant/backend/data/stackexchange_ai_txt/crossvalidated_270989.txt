Imputing categorical 'string' data for missing values in python

I'm working on binary classifier model with 30% N/A values aka missing fields. I have one continuous feature and two categorical 'string' features missing in my data. For a continuous feature, I've imputed 'mean'. Can someone guide me how could I Impute categorical 'string' data? Does Random forests/Decision tree will overcome this?
