Re: your question about the binmode being lost when $^I opens a new output handle, you could solve this with the open pragma: use open OUT => ':raw'; which will force all filehandles opened for writing to have the ':raw' PerlIO layer (equivalent to binmode with no argument) to apply to them. Just take care if you're opening anything else for output that you apply :crlf or any other layer as needed.
