Use resignFirstResponder in touchesBegan, like so: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; if(touch.phase == UITouchPhaseBegan) { [self.myTextField resignFirstResponder]; } } You may need to call this on multiple text fields if you're not sure where the focus is currently located; I haven't tested that case. Additionally, in Interface Builder, you'll need to enable the "User Interaction Enabled" checkbox for the view, or programatically use: myView.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
