What does "clustered" mean in "clustered index"?

Possible Duplicates: Difference between clustered and nonclustered index What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean? Hi experts, What does the word " clustered " mean in " clustered index "? I am doubting that it has something to do with the disk sector usage. Because I vaguely remember that Windows organizes disk space into clusters , which is composed of one or more 512-byte sectors . Do these 2 concepts have any connections? Thanks.
