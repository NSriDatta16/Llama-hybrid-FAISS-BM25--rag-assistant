How do I get zend to recognize the paths to Propel ORM

I am trying to get Propel to work in my Zend app, it seems that I can get the Propel library to load (from library/propel) but when called I get the exception: 'No connection information in your runtime configuration file for datasource [default]' (when I try to make a connection: 'Propel::getConnection'). My Db is not even named 'default'. I have this in my bootstrap.php from another SO question/answer: require_once 'propel/Propel.php'; Propel::setConfiguration($this->getOptions('propel/MyPropel-conf.php')); Propel::initialize(); // so we can get the connection from the registry easily return Propel::getConnection(); I want the Propel configs (classmap conf as well) to be in the '/application/configs' (copies are there too right now), but I thought If I can get Propel to load from library/propel, then maybe moving my 'conf' files there, I may get them to load too. It seems that if I 'force' the config, by manually loading the params, or if I seem to get it in a temporary 'right' location (or use an absolute path), the exception I then get is this: 'Unable to open PDO connection [wrapped: SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'www-data'@'localhost' As if Propel is not paying any attention to my configs. My config looks like this; converted from the xml: $conf = array ( 'datasources' => array ( 'unmActTestDB' => array ( 'adapter' => 'mysql', 'connection' => array ( 'dsn' => 'mysql://root:PASSWORD@localhost/unmActTestDB', ), ), 'default' => 'unmActTestDB', ), 'log' => array ( 'ident' => 'propel-act', 'level' => '7', ), 'generator_version' => '1.5.6', ); $conf['classmap'] = include(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'classmap-unmActTestDB-conf.php'); return $conf; If it helps, I still have the Zend PDO DB adapter loading in the application.ini file too, would that cause a clash?. Is there a standard way to get Propel to work with Zend? Or can anyone see what I'm doing wrong? I have been to several posts here on SO, and a couple popular posts like this one The Adventures Of Merging Propel With Zend Framework and this one at Zend's dev zone Integrating Propel with the Zend Framework , among others including the Propel Docs. They have been helpful, but I am really struggling with this. Thanks in advance! My current Zend Directory structure looks like this (w/ the two propel confs also in the library/propel folder:
