What you're looking for can be formulated as: $$Imp := \frac {p(E|P,D=1)} {p(E|P,D=0)} $$ Where $Imp$ is Impact of the recommendation, $E$ is Exercising (to a minimum acceptable level at least), $P$ is a patient and $D$ is a binary-valued 'got a Doctor's recommendation or not'. With the notation out of the way, time to model. Since we're only caring about passing a minimum threshold in just one period at any time, we can model Exercise as a Bernoulli-distributed variable. Next, we could say that whether they do exercise or not depends on either Patient-specific baseline factors (inclination, health, free time, whatever) and the Doctor's recommendation independently. That is, if you kidnapped a random person off the street for a checkup, the checkup itself does not itself affect their odds of exercising. If the visit entailed chopping the Patient's leg off, then this assumption would not hold, as it's harder to exercise leg-less. So with that in mind, $p(E|P,D) = p(E|P)p(P) + p(E|D)p(D)$ . Therefore: $$ Imp = \frac { p(E|D=1)p(D=1) + p(E|P)p(P) } { p(E|D=0)p(D=0) + p(E|P)p(P) } $$ If we assume that not making a recommendation has no impact on people's lifestyles, i.e. $p(E|D=0)p(D=0)=0$ that leaves us with: $$ Imp = \frac { p(E|D=1)p(D=1) + p(E|P)p(P) } { p(E|P)p(P) } $$ If you're familiar with the formula for the mean of a Beta distribution, it looks a lot of like the reciprocal of this: $\mu_{Beta} = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$ . This makes sense - if we flipped the question to 'how much fewer people would exercise if not given the recommendation', we'd wind up with some fraction of the total amount of people who would have exercised given proper encouragement. So, the simplest solution is to do just that - fit $Imp^{-1}$ as a Beta then invert the fraction to get your target value. $p(E|P)p(P)$ is the ratio of the pre-treatment exercisers to all patients, $p(E|D=1)p(D=1)$ is the ratio of post-treatment exercises to all exercisers , and both are something you can calculate from your data, probably fairly easily at that. The nice thing about Beta is that in cases like that, you could probably even calculate some small samples on paper if you're fine with just a point estimate of the mean.
