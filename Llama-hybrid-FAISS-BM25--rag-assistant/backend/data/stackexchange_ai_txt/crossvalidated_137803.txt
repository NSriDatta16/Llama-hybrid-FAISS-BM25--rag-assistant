Is precision in recommender system related to mean average error (MAE)?

A recommender system is being evaluated while increasing the neighborhood size. The highest precision was achieved between 10-15 neighbors(users) while the lowest MAE was in the range from 30-40 users. Shouldn't the highest precision be achieved when the MAE is the lowest? If not, how the above results can be explained?
