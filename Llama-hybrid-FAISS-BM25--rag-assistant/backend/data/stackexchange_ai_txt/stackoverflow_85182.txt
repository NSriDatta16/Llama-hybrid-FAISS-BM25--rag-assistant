While not solving the problem of brute force (as others already mentioned) you might want to sort your numbers first, and then go over the possible ones left (since once you passed Sum value, you can't add any number larger than Goal - Sum). This will change the way you implement your algorithm (in order to sort only once and then skip marked elements), but on the average would improve performance.
