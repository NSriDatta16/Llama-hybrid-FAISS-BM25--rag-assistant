One step better than average is nearest square root: ((delta red)^2 + (delta green)^2 + (delta blue)^2)^0.5 This minimizes the distance in 3D color space. Since a root is strictly increasing, you can search for the maximum of the square instead. How you express this in SQL would depend on which RDBMS you're using.
