Fit a time series model with unknown lag in Stan

I try to fit a population time-series model in stan/rstan(2.7.0) where the death rate depends on the generation before (n-1) but the reproduction depends on a unknown generation (n-x). I haven't found a way to estimate x since stan has no options for integer distributions and the floor function returns reals that cannot be used as indices to arrays. Does anyone know a good workaround to estimate integer time lags in stan?
