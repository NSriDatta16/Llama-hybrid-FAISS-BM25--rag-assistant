I don't understand why you think $q>0$ is a problem for prediction. It is easy enough to forecast using an ARIMA model with MA terms and you don't need to use the innovations algorithm of Brockwell and Davis. That algorithm is useful for estimation ; in particular, in getting starting values when optimizing the likelihood. To answer your specific questions: auto.arima() calls arima() which uses a state space representation for computing the likelihood. Missing values are handled naturally in a state space format. So, yes, they are handled correctly. Missing historical values are not estimated by arima() . If you want to forecast them (i.e., using only past data), just fit a model up to the start of the missing sequence and then forecast from it. If you want to estimate them (using data before and afterwards), you would need to use a Kalman smoother based on the equivalent state space model. An alternative fudge that gives almost the same results is to average the forecasts using data up to the last non-missing data with the backcasts using data up to the first non-missing data after the missing sequence.
