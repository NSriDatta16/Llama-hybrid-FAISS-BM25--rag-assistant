I'm sure there is a way to do it - but I haven't heard of one yet, and I keep up on Magento stuff pretty well. Unfortunately, Magento does not import configurable products through the backend. Typically what you have to do is write your own script utilizing the Magento API, or import all the simple products, and then manually (or again, using the API) create the configurable products assigning the simple products to them.
