We use both tools (DBPro and Red-Gate) in our company. We've used both for a long time. This is not exactly an apples to apples comparison because DBPro does some things Red-Gate cannot. For example, DBPro can compare DBPro project files and databases. Obviously Red-Gate cannot. Both tools will do the job for you. I like Red-Gate better. It's cleaner and generates more efficient T-SQL code in many cases. But I use both tools heavily and I have confidence in both tools. I'm confident both tools will handle your largest and most complex schema's. I have to say though that I am not encouraged by Microsoft neglect of DBPro recently. I don't believe it is still a high priority for them. In fact, I'm pretty certain it isn't. But they are still maintaining it and adding some new features.
