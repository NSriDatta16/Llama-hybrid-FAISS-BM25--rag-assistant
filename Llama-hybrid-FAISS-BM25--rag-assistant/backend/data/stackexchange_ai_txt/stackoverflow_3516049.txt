Creating child CMS pages in Magento

I would like to create a subordinate set of CMS pages in Magento so that the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page looks like this: Home > Parent CMS Page > Child CMS Page Even though I can specify a hierarchical relationship with the URL key field, it seems to be that all CMS pages in Magento are listed in the root directory by default: Home > Child CMS Page Any ideas?
