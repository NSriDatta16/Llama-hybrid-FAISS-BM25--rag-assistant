Why there are specific number of layers with same depth in any CNN architecture?

why each architecture have specific number of layers with same depth like vgg had 2 with 64 depth and 2 with 128d and 4 layers same with ResNet and 34 layer plain like 6 layers with depth of 64 and 8 layers with depth 128. and why depth increasing by last depth *2 ? is there is way or equation to decide number of layers with each depth ?
