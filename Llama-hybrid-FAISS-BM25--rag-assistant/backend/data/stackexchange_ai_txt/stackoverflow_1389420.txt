Search for embedded email and phone numbers

I need to use a javascript form validation routine to scan various input text fields for embedded phone numbers and email addresses. This is for a classifieds system that is free to post but 'pay to connect' with buyers, so the intent is to prevent (as much as possible) the ability for users (those posting the ad) from simply embedding their phone and/or email contact information to bypass the system. I've been googling for awhile now, and RegEx is not my strong suit, so I'm having a bit of a hard time finding a good snippet of code to help. All I want to do is get a pass/fail for a text field (pass if it does not appear to have embedded email and/or phone numbers, and fail if it does) Does anyone already have a good javascript solution for this?
