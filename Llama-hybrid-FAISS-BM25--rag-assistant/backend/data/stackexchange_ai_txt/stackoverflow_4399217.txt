from a private email of Gabriele Lana (good friend and exceptional developer). my order would be: node.js - keyword is being pragmatic here. I just finished a small project with node.js+redis done in 14 days and it's working like a charm. erlang - keyword is performance stability here. If erlang cannot do it probably it's an impossible task. Learning curve is steep but results are fantastic. lift - last because I don't think your project need complex domanin logic (in that case I'd choose scala).
