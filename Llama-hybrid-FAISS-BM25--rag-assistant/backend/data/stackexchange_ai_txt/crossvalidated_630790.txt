I'm assuming your question is about the vegan::simper() function in R. When you request a permutation test it will randomly shuffle group labels and recalculate the contribution of each species to the dissimilarity under that new grouping. The P -value is the fraction of permutations in which the contribution was larger than in the observed sample, so this is essentially a hypothesis test for whether the contribution to the dissimilarity is equal across groups. I do want to draw your attention to the following piece of that function's documentation (which was reworded somewhat in more recent versions): The results of simper can be very difficult to interpret. The method very badly confounds the mean between group differences and within group variation, and seems to single out variable species instead of distinctive species (Warton et al. 2012). Even if you make groups that are copies of each other, the method will single out species with high contribution, but these are not contributions to non-existing between-group differences but to within-group variation in species abundance.
