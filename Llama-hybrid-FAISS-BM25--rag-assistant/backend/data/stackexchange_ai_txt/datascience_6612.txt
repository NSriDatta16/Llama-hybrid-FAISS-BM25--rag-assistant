Reducing the dimensionality of word embeddings

I trained word embeddings with 300 dimensions. Now, I would like to have word embeddings with 50 dimensions: is it better to retrain the word embeddings with 50 dimensions, or can I use some dimensionality reduction method to scale the word embeddings with 300 dimensions down to 50 dimensions?
