Predicting values from linear regression

I've got a data set consisting of olympic years and the winning times for the womens 100m. I can plot a line throught the data using matlab as such: plot(x,w0 + w1*x, 'm-'); Which I believe is from the equation: y=W0+w1x Correct? I also calculated the loss using this function: function [w0,w1, S0, pointloss] = lsfit(x,t) xmu = mean(x); tmu = mean(t); xt = x.*t; xtmu = mean(xt); x2mu = mean(x.*x); w1 = (xtmu - xmu*tmu)/(x2mu-xmu^2); w0 = tmu - w1*xmu; loss = 0; for n = 1:length(x) loss = loss + (t(n)-w0-w1*x(n))^2; end %average loss S0 = loss/length(x); So, assuming the above is correct, I have a few questions: should the distance between the a given point and the line be equal to loss + (t(n)-w0-w1*x(n))^2 ? Given the above, how do I predict the winning time for a given year?
