part of the vbscript code gets trashed with hyphens

on some computers, when a client opens the specific html page, part of the vbscript code on the client side gets trashed with hyphens. i saw that the vbscript code on that page was composed of one huge code section enclosed in script start and end tags. i decided to fragment it to small sections, and it seemed better, but when i fragmeneted it to 10 sections, two of the sections (section means code between start and end tag) were still trashed (meaning the entire section code was replaced with hyphens enclosed with html start and end remark signs: and one of the sections was not so big (maybe 100 lines), surely there were other bigger sections that didn't get corrupted. i can't reconstruct the problem on any computer beside two or three clients, and their patience is a rare resource (which i already used). so, without maneuvering space, should i fragment them some more and hope this will help ? or is it another problem ?
