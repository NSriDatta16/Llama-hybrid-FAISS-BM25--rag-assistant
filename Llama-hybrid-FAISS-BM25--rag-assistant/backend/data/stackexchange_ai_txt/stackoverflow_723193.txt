Most of the Ajax toolkit controls seem to have very dodgy drag and drop supported in the designer. If you want to drag and drop controls from the toolbox, try dragging them into your source view. My suggestion would be to just get accustomed to working in the source, and forgo working with the designer - it tends to be slow and a bit unreliable.
