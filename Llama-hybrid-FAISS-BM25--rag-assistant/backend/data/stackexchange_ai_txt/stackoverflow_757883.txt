Alternatives to swfobject for embedding flashplayer

Does anybody know if there's a better alternative to swfobject? I actually like swfobject, I just wanted to hear if anybody found something better. Or maybe it is the best way. If you do not know swfobject you can find it here: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/
