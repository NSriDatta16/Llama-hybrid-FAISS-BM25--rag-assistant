If you can sample from the posterior (via MCMC for example), then you can approximate the normalized posterior probabilities. The number of times you draw a given "hypothesis" divided by the number of draws is an approximation to the normalized probability of that hypothesis. To get more accuracy, take more draws. After you change the prior, sample from the new posterior. Then you can compare probabilities (for hypotheses) for each of the priors chosen.
