Filtering by category in Magento 1.4

I have a custom module I made to show featured products on the homepage. I set it up to show products that are in a ‘featured’ category. It works fine in 1.3, but now in 1.4 I get the following error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column ‘e.category_ids’ in ‘where clause’ Here’s my code: $_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', $visibility) ->addAttributeToFilter('category_ids',array('finset'=>$featuredcategory)) $_productCollection->load(); The featured category is specified from the admin. Anyone any ideas what might be up?
