K-means attempts to group distributions into $k$ similar categories based on some metric of nearness. If your dataset contains repeated values this is not a problem. It simply means that you have 2 distributions from which you are drawing instances, and the variance of these distributions is essentially zero. For example, if you have a dataset from which you want to cluster two species of fish with 2 features: color and length. However, the fish of each species are all clones (ignore other biology stuff i know nothing about like environmental factors). Thus they will all have exactly the same color and the same length in either group. Each measurement of each individual will be exactly the same. This is fine. We simply have 0 variance in each distribution. Clustering is very well suited for very tight distributions because they are easily separable. However, distributions with high variance will have significant overlap and will thus cause many instances to be wrongfully classified as being a part of the other cluster. The ideal number of clusters This value can be calculated by determining the average distance between each instance and its nearest cluster. You will see that once you surpass 2, the average distance will not decrease in any further in this case, which means a single distribution is being split into 2 groups. Thus 2 is the ideal number of clusters.
