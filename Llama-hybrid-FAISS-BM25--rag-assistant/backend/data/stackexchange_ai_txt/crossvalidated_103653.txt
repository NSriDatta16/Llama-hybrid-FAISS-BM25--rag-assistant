Try to get a copy of "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective" by Kevin Murphy. It is well written, having good coverage with depth. It will give you a nice feel for the topics. I also like David Sontag's approach. All the reading materials are based on freely available materials: http://cs.nyu.edu/~dsontag/courses/ml14/
