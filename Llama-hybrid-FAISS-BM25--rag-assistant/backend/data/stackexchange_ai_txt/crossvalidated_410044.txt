Estimation of NegEntropy

I am trying to evaluate the different ICA algorithms. To do that, one of the measure which I use, is to estimate the non-gaussianity using NegEntropy . I am trying to find a formula/function which can do this on time series EEG data. May I know how can I estimate it for a random variable 'x'.? And how it differs from the entropy of 'x'? Would appreciate any reference.
