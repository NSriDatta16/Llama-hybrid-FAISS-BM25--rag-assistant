Splitting a Paragraph into 160 Character Pieces for Text Messaging

I'm having trouble with the logic of taking a paragraph of text and splitting it on words/sentences to send out in multiple text messages. Each text message can only have up to 160 characters. I want to cleanly break a paragraph up. Here is the solution (thanks Leventix!): public static function splitStringAtWordsUpToCharacterLimit($string, $characterLimit) { return explode("\n", wordwrap($string, $characterLimit)); }
