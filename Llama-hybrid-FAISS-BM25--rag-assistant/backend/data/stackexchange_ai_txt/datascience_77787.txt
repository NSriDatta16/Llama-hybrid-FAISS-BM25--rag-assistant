Monte Carlo for non-episodic tasks

In Sutton's textbook (Chapter 5) it says "To ensure that well-defined returns are available, here we define Monte Carlo methods only for episodic tasks". Can someone explain what exactly breaks down for non-episodic tasks for Monte Carlo methods in Reinforcement Learning?
