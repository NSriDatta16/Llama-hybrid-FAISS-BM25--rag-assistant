Expected number of tosses until winner in game with two players with two different coins

Two players each have a coin which gives heads with probability $0.7$ (player 1) and $0.3$ (player 2), respectively. Player 1 goes first, and the players alternate until someone gets heads. What is the expected number of tosses? The geometric distribution would model for each player separately the number of tosses until the first heads ( $1.43$ and $3.33$ ), but I can't figure out the solution in this alternating case. I also tried an approach using Markov chains but to no avail. This is not my homework; I saw this problem online and couldn't figure out a solution. Simulations place the expected number of tosses near $1.65$ . set.seed(142857) res
