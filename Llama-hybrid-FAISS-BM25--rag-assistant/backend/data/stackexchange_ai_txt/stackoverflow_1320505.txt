I looked over the preview and from the sounds of it all the author is trying to say is to use the tag that is most appropriate for the content it contains. If you have a line of text that is your page header and you want it to look a specific way, place it in a styled H1/H2/H3 tag rather than just a span or div with the same style markup. By using the correct tags to describe your content it makes it much easier for the search engine to properly index and organize what it finds. It's perfectly alright to have "over two hundred divs and spans" so long as the content they surround is intended for a div or span. It's all about semantics.
