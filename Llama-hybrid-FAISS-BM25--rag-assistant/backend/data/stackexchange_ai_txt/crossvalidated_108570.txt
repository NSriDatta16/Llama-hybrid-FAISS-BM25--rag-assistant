Basic Question: how does feed-forward neural network solve regression?

This is a fairly basic question but I can't seem to find an answer on the net (perhaps I'm searching the wrong things). Regression is trying to predict continuous outputs. Since a neural network uses a clamping function (typically giving a value between 0 and 1) before the output.. if the output can only be between 0 and 1, how can a neural network learn a regression function? Thanks in advance
