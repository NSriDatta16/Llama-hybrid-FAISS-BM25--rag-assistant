I started using whatever@example.com for this purpose, but then I began getting responses back from my outgoing email server saying delivery to that address had been delayed. I don't know about the OP, but I want something that I can send to and completely forget about it. Now I'm changing over to whatever@mailinator.com -- I know that it gets delivered to their catchall (so I'm not getting any junk back about delivery errors), and if I like, I can even go check at http://mailinator.com/ to see if the email went through as planned. (But it's not clogging up my inbox if I don't care about it.)
