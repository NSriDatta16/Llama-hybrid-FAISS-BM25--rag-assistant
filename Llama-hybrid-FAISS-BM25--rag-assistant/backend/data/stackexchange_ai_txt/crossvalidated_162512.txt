There are a few different options, which is best depends on what assumptions you are willing to make, what information you consider there to be in the "no answer" group, how you want to generalize, and other things like that. Here are a few possibilities: You are correct that the answers are not independent, but the covariance is known for cases like this so you can still construct an approximate z test that takes the covariance into account. You can essentially do a McNemar's test using the "apple" and "pear" as the off-diagonal responses. I think that this will reduce mathematically to be the same as the previous option. If you condition on just those people who responded, then the only way for the 2 proportions to be the same is if they are $0.5$, so just do a 1 sample test on pears (or apples) against the 50% null hypothesis. Fit a Bayesian binomial or multinomial model then look at the posterior distribution of the difference or ratio of the 2 proportions.
