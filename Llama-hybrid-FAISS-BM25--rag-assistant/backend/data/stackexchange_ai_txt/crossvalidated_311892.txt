Bootstrapping is averaging multiple models trained on slightly different samples. But average of many linear models is also a linear model. This means that your linear model will generally not improve if you bootstrap it. For linear models, bootstrapping is usually applied only to measure uncertainty in coefficients, but not to improve prediction error. With some other types of models, like trees, bootstrapping generally results in better prediction.
