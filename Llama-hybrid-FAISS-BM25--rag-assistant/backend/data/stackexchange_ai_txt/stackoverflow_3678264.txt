TinyMCE and CakePHP

I am using the cakephp tinymce helper. I know I can change the themes from simple and advanced, etc. I'm wondering if it's possible to go further than that and explicitly set the different font, etc the user can choose? So if I only wanted the user to be able to use a paragraph tag and the pre tag?
