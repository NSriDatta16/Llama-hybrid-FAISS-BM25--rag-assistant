Magento has event hooks that might be helpful. A list of events (a bit outdated, I think) can be found here . And there is a useful article about how Magneto's events work here . Also, looking at existing payment extensions could be useful. I would not be surprised if similar events are dispatched by Google Checkout for order cancellations. The Extension repository will have lots of payment methods to look at. Good luck!
