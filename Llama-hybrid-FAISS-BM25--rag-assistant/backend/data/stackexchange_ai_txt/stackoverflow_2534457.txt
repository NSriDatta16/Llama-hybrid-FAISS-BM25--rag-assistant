Media RSS and Zend

I have a Magento application running atop Zend framework. I like to generate Media RSS feed in Zend (In orded to feed the Cooliris application). Does anyone know if Zend framework supports Media RSS feed? (I didn't find anything in http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/en/zend.feed.html , but maybe I dint look in the right place?) Tx, Sty
