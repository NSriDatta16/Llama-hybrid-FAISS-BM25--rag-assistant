I think Ben overstates the resulting result a little in that answer. We do know something that is extremely useful, namely that we can query the function $\pi(\theta|x)$ in such a way that we always receive back $f(\theta|x)/Z$ , where $Z^{-1} = \int_\Theta \pi(\theta|x) d\theta$ , and $f(\theta|x) = L(x|\theta)p(\theta)$ , the product of the likelihood and the prior. But this immediately implies another fact: that if we want to query a ratio of $\pi$ evaluated at two different values $\theta'$ and $\theta$ , the ratio of $Z$ s will immediately cancel, leaving the correct corresponding ratio. We can then proceed to design a clever Markov chain (via the Metropolis-Hastings method) that exactly uses this ratio when generating moves on $\Theta$ .
