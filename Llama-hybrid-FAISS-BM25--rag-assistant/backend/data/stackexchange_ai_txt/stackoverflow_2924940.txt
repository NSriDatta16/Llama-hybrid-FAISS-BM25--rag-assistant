Calculate average in LINQ C# with string representation of property name

I need to calculate a whole bunch of averages on an List of Surveys. The surveys have lots of properties that are int and double valued. I am creating a business object to handle all the calculations (there are like 100) and I'd rather not code 100 different methods for finding the average for a particular property. I'd like to be able to have the UI pass a string (representing the property) and have the the business object return an average for that property. So, like... int AverageHeightInInches = MyObject.GetIntAverage("HeightInInches"); . . . Then have linq code to calculate the result. Thanks!
