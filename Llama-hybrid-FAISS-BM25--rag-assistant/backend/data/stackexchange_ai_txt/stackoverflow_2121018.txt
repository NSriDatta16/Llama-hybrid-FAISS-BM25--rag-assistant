Native Drag + Drop file upload in Firefox 3.6

I've recently been told by a colleague that Firefox 3.6 supports native drag and drop file uploads + image resizing from the operating system without any extensions or plugins required. Can anyone post a code snippet or provide a link which demonstrates this new functionality (as I couldn't find much on a Google search)?
