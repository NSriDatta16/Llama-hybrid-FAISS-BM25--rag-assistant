the weights in Logistic Regression

As I am studying Logistic regression, I just wanted to confirm that I understand it correctly, my main concern is the equation wx+b. here is my understanding : (logistic regression is an algorithm used to classify things. The goal is to classify. So letâ€™s assume that we are classifying if something belongs to class 0 or class 1 . We use a function that gives us a probability of it belonging to a class 0 or 1. We set a threshold such as 0.5, if the prob above 0.5 it belongs to class 1 and vice versa. The function that gives us values between 0 and 1 is called sigmoid. the logistic regression uses decision boundary to decide to which class the data belong to, this decision boundary has the weights w and has the formula of : wx + b or w1x1+w2x2+ b ) or are the weights for the sigmoid and not for the decision boundary ?
