Advantages of OGNL usage over typical EL in Struts2

Say that I don't leverage OGNL to create my Struts2 web application and just purely uses typical el provided by Sun. What would be the downside of it? As far as I know, OGNL is a kind of expression which attempts to match the best matched value from ValueStack based on its current state. Could it also be achieved by just using EL alone instead? Thanks in advance for the responses Daniel
