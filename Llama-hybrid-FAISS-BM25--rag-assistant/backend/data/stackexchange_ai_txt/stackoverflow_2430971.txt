JS or HTML5 would seem to be your best bets. But I have had trouble with d&d in MSIE (FF was ok). The downside is that HTML is not scheduled to be finalized until 2022(!) - you can expect support before then (even today), but it may not be consistent. There is a good HTML demo here http://ljouanneau.com/lab/html5/demodragdrop.html This will also allow you to d&d stuff from the browser to the PC (bi-directional) I don't do JS so can't help you there, sorry (I'm a PHP guy too ;-)
