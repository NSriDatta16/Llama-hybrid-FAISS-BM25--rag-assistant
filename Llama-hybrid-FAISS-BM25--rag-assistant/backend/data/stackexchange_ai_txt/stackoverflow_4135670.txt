There are good reasons for embedding a web server in your app. May not be the best way but you have to do it when Android ties your hands. An example is when you want to decrypt video on the fly at runtime and use the media player to play it. Android media player does not allow me to feed it an in-memory stream as would come from a decryption pipe. In this case, one solution (help me think of others please!) is to embed a web server that would serve up the stream - because Android does accept a stream from a URL!! The other solution would be port some native library over and write a JNI interface to it. Too much work and unstable at best. The point is, there are valid enough reasons out there.
