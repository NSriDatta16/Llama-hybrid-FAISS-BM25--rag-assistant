how can i execute large mysql queries fast

I have 4 mysql tables and have a single query with JOIN on multiple tables and I am requesting it via jquery ajax, but it takes much too long, from about 1-3 minutes while I want to execute them on average 2-5 seconds. Is there any special way to execute the queries fast?
