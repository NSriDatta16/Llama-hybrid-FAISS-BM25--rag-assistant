Using Bayesian Factors in order to select the most appropriate model

I have three models and I use MCMC in order to estimate parameters. In total I have 21, 21 and 42 parameters in three models respectively. Now I am going to select the most appropriate model in between these three models. I use bayesian factor as following. In the first step I estimate parameters in each single model separately and then I recalculate likelihood to find a value. Finally, a model with the minimum likelihood is the most appropriate one. I see this approach to some extend is different with Bayesian factor(BF). Maybe I am wrong in understanding BF. Let me explain problem with mathematics. I have a random variable that follows a distribution $F(\mu,\sigma)$. On the other hand in the first model I assume $\mu=a_0 +a_1X_1+....+a_p X_p$ and in the second model I assume $\sigma= b_0+b_1X_1+....+b_pX_p$ where $p$ is the same in both models. In third model I assume both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ comes from a regression model as above. In total my question is about a method to select the most appropriate model.
