Compare predictive strength of a linear model with logistic model?

I have a 6 independent variables and 2 target variables: One target is continuous, the other is binary. I want to know whether the 6 independents are better at predicting the continuous variable or the binary variable. I've looked at comparing r^2 with a pseudo r^2 for logistic regression, but I know pseudo r^2 is not an ideal measurement here. Is there a better option that would allow me to compare the predictive strengths of these? I'm using R, so any direction on the appropriate package & method to use there would be very much appreciated. Edit 1: For individual predictors, I tried a point-biserial correlation for the binary target. I also tried pearson's correlation for the binary target (1 & 0). Pearson's & Point-Biserial produced the exact same r^2 value, only the Point-Biserial was negative. I'm not sure why...? Edit 2: Should I be looking at some measure of "fit"? If so, which would be comparable across both models?
