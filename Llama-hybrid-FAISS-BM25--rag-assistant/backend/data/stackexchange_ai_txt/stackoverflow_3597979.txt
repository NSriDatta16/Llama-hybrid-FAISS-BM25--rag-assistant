How to setup UIView touch handler without subclassing

How do I capture touch events such as - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event without subclassing a UIView nor using UIViewControllers. What happens is that I have a simple UIView created programmatically and I need to detect basic tap events.
