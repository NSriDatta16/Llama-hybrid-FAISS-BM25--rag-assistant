Adding a UIActivityIndicatorView to a UITableViewController

How is a UIActivityIndicatorView added to a UITableViewController? I have tried adding it in Interface Builder and when I drag and drop it onto the view, it just disappears. I need to show the activityIndicator while the table loads in its data.
