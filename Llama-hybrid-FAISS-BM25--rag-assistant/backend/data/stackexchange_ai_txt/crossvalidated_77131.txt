How to analyze data which might come from a few normal distribution concatenate together in order?

For example, I have a series of values for example like the following: data I don't know the mean, don't know the sd of my data, and am particularly interested in the "sign of the mean" of my data (I can do a t-test but most often it is not significant, and even if it is, it only tells half of the story), and would be better to know if it changes over time. (how ever, I believe the data is not a time series, i.e. consecutive data points are independent of each other). But, I also doubt that my data might have different baseline distributions (assumed normal) at different time stages. So, what is a standard way of analysing such data? You can see the sd of my data is quite big. Do I have to pretend it is a time series and decompose it to see the trend? df This is the graph of cumulative values of the data. Can we tell if it is from one normal distribution, or several normal distributions with different means and variances? If it is possible, what assumptions do I have to make? Compared to this: data Update: I guess that changepoint package in R is good enough > a summary(a) Changepoint type : Change in mean and variance Method of analysis : BinSeg Test Statistic : Normal Type of penalty : SIC with value, 20.61791 Maximum no. of cpts : 5 Changepoint Locations : 10264 19013 > b summary(b) Changepoint type : Change in mean and variance Method of analysis : BinSeg Test Statistic : Normal Type of penalty : SIC with value, 20.61791 Maximum no. of cpts : 5 Changepoint Locations : PELT would give some small intervals thought I had penalty to include the number of change points. > a summary(a) Changepoint type : Change in mean and variance Method of analysis : PELT Test Statistic : Normal Type of penalty : SIC1 with value, 30.92686 Maximum no. of cpts : Inf Changepoint Locations : 10049 18984 18987 > > a summary(a) Changepoint type : Change in mean and variance Method of analysis : PELT Test Statistic : Normal Type of penalty : SIC1 with value, 30.92686 Maximum no. of cpts : Inf Changepoint Locations : 8810 8814 18962
