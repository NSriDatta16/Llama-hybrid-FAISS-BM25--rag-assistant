Although it has some drawbacks and potential problems if you do a lot of cleansing or transforming, I've found you can round trip an input file by re-generating the input file from the star schema(s). Then simply comparing the input file to the output file. It might require some massaging to make them match (one is left padded, the other right padded). Typically, I had a program which used the same layout the ETL used and did a compare, ignoring alignment within a field. Also, the files might have to be sorted - there is a command-line sort I used. If your ETL does a transform incorrectly and you transform out incorrectly, it's still possible that this method doesn't show every problem in the DW, and I wouldn't claim it has complete coverage, but it's a pretty good first whack at a regression unit test for each load.
