The relationship between prediction performance and the degree of association between variables?

I've been reading a paper ( Machine learning identifies candidates for drug repurposing in Alzheimerâ€™s disease ), but having a hard time understanding its core idea. Basically, the researchers Obtained a dataset of postmortem brain tissues that includes the expression values of ~20k genes as features and disease stage (early, intermediate, late) as the target. Applied 80 drugs to cell cultures and recorded the differentially expressed (either upregulated or downregulated vs control) genes for each drug. For each drug, they limited the feature space (all ~20k genes from the brain tissue data) to only the drug associated gene list; then trained and validated "predictors" or "classifiers". Tried different algorithms for the ML work (logistic regression, SVM, boosted random forest, neural network) and decided on logistic regression based on its AUC. Produced empirical p-values for each drug by comparing the AUC of the predictor of the drug and 1000 size-matched gene lists. For example, if ruxolitinib has an empirical p-value of 0.004, and caused the perturbation of 300 genes, then that means the logistic regression model fit by genes expressed after ruxolitinib application predicts the disease stage better than (has a higher AUC than) 996 randomly selected lists of 300 genes. Ranked drugs based on their empirical p-values and claimed that "If a classifier trained on the expression of genes associated with a particular drug is substantially more accurate than equivalent classifiers trained on the expression of any arbitrarily chosen genes, then such a result suggests that the drug-associated genes carry at least some disease-related signal." Now what I don't understand is, how can they go from this line of reasoning to claiming that the pharmacological mechanism of action of high ranking drugs have a higher possibility of overlapping with the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease? How can merely the list of genes perturbed by a certain drug predicting the disease stage better compared to random lists provide evidence for the drug being associated with the disease? From the article We present DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD), a machine learning framework that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. Could it actually be the approach some statistics blogs & textbooks recommend 2 3 when they talk about using predictive statistics ( predictive power score , to be precise) instead of merely testing for correlation?
