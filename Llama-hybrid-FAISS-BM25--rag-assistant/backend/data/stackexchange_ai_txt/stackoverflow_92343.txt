Good point about the header always being first and the footer last! But I might want to move my advertising DIV from along the top, to down the right. The other thing I've heard about is putting the content DIV first, so Google pays you more attention (relevant keywords near the top of the page score higher)...or is that a myth? Doing that would require the sort of CSS trick I'm enquiring about too.
