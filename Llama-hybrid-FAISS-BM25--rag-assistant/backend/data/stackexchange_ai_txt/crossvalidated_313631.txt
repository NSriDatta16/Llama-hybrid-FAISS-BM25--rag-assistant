I think someone already answered your literal question, but let me clear up a potential confusion. Your question is somewhat similar to the following: I have this function $f(x) = \ldots$ and I'm wondering what differential equation it is a solution to? In other words, it certainly has a valid answer (perhaps even a unique one if you impose regularity constraints), but it's a rather strange question to ask, since it was not a differential equation that gave rise to that function in the first place. (On the other hand, given the differential equation, it is natural to ask for its solution, since that's usually why you write the equation!) Here's why: I think you're thinking of probabilistic/statistical models—specifically, generative and discriminative models, based on estimating joint and conditional probabilities from data. The SVM is neither. It's an entirely different kind of model—one that bypasses those and attempts to directly model the final decision boundary, the probabilities be damned. Since it's about finding the shape of the decision boundary, the intuition behind it is geometric (or perhaps we should say optimization-based) rather than probabilistic or statistical. Given that probabilities aren't really considered anywhere along the way, then, it's rather unusual to ask what a corresponding probabilistic model could be, and especially since the entire goal was to avoid having to worry about probabilities. Hence why you don't see people talking about them.
