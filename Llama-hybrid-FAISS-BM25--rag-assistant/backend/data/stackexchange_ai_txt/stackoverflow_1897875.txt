The performance problems caused by C++ operators do not come from the operators and not from the operators implementation. It comes from the syntax, from hidden code being run without you knowing. The best example, is implementing quick sort, on an object which has the operator[] implemented, but internally it's using a linked list. Now instead of O(nlogn) [1] you will get O(n^2logn). The problem with performance is that you cannot know exactly what your code will eventually be. [1] I know that quick sort is actually O(n^2), but it rarely gets to it, the average distribution will give you O(nlogn).
