HElp in understanding difference between EM and MAP estimation methods

Problem 1: The term $p_{\theta}(y_{1:N}|x_{1:N})p_{\theta}(x_{1:N})$ is the joint pdf, also called as the posterior. In EM, the complete data likelihood is the distribution of $x_1,\ldots,x_N,y_1,\ldots, y_N$ for which we write the same formulation as I have written. Then what is the difference between EM and Bayesian approach? Problem 2: What is MAP and how is it different from what I wrote in Eq(2). If I were to estimate the parameters using MAP, then can somebody please show what Eq(2) would become / what will be the changes? Problem 3: In case of ML, how would Eq(2) change? I don't need explanation on the methodology opted by the authors or for chaotic signal, but I want to understand what would be the difference in Eq(2) if $x$ was any kind of a signal (random, non-deterministic) --what pdf would be absent or present for Bayesian, EM and MAP techniques. Thank you.
