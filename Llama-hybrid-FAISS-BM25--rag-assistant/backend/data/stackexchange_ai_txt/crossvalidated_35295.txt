The spectral density is defined for stationary time series. It is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. The periodogram is the Fourier transform of the sample autocorrelation function. The periodogram is discrete while the spectral density is continuous and is usually estimated by a kernel smoothing of the periodogram. The Fast Fourier Transform is a quick way to compute a Fourier transform due to the work of Tukey and Cooley.
