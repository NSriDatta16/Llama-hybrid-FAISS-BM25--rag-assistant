Measure of the coefficients variability for Regularised Regression models

I am working with Regression models. My idea is to measure the variability of the coefficients of some Regression models. I used LOOCV split for the training and testing my dataset. The following are few rows of my coefficients result associated with each independent variable, and since I used LOOCV and my data has 506 rows, I will get 506 models with their coefficients. At this moment I can average the coefficients and have the standard deviation and other variability measures. [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [1,] 0.4833690 -0.2123750 0.10249052 0.008650167 0.05935795 -0.1904433 0.4400553 [2,] 0.4803859 -0.2129833 0.10221035 0.012684383 0.05947693 -0.1926850 0.4415954 [3,] 0.4813841 -0.2148075 0.10466271 0.011856752 0.06002647 -0.1917434 0.4401251 [4,] 0.4812432 -0.2150635 0.10537431 0.013449890 0.05991461 -0.1933659 0.4405225 [5,] 0.4838644 -0.2157872 0.10701178 0.014210714 0.06007054 -0.1939583 0.4376616 [6,] 0.4802185 -0.2143879 0.10450493 0.013349886 0.05983871 -0.1924637 0.4424887 . . . My question is as follows If I want to compare the variability (using standard deviation) of the coefficients of the classical regression methods with Lasso and Ridge and Elastic net Regression, how could that be possible? Because I can not calculate the standard deviation from the glmnet package. Any idea is highly appreciated! I am happy to provide more details if needed.
