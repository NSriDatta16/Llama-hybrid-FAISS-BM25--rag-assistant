Couple of options: You could put the BLOB column in its own tablespace, with its own storage characteristics; you could store the BLOBs in their own table, linked to the other table by an ID column. In either case as you suggested you could define the column as a BFILE which means the actual file is stored externally from the database in a directory. What might be a concern there is that BFILE LOBs do not participate in transactions and are not recoverable with the rest of the database. This is all discussed in the Oracle 10gR2 SQL reference, chapter 2, starting on page 23.
