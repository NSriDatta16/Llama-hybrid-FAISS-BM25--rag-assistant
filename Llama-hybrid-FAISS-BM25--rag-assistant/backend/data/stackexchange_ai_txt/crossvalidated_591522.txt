It would help if you could tell more about the descriptors you used, and label the axes. But what I think we are seeing is that the top scoring cases include many false positives. This is a common problem in classifiers that are designed to classify an minority class. In the PR curve, it shows up as a vertical line segment down from recall=0, precision=1. You need to examine a sample of the high scored negatives, and try to think of some feature engineering that would help classify them better. Given that the rest of the calibration curve looks good, you might succeed. But the risk in such work is always that the available descriptors are simply not predictive enough. Imagine that you had to predict a person's weight, based only on nationality and sex - you could make a model, but it could not be a great model.
