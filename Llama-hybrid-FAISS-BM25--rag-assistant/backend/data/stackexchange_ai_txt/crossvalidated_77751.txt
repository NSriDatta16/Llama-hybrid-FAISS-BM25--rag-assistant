This is an implementation problem since, theoretically, MCMC has no problem with truncated distributions. Let $D$ be the support of your posterior. Just define your log-posterior as $-\infty$ if $\theta\not\in D$ and choose a suitable value on $D$ as an initial point. For example, suppose that $x_1,\dots,x_n \stackrel{ind.}{\sim} \exp(\lambda)$ and that $\lambda\sim Unif(0,10)$. The following code shows how to implement a Metropolis-Hastings for this model using the package 'mcmc'. library(mcmc) set.seed(123) x = rexp(100,1) # The theoretical value of lambda is 1 # logposterior logpost = function(lambda){ if(lambda>0 & lambda
