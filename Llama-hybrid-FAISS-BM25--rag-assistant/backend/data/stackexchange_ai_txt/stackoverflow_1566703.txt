If you want to learn a new language stay away from all fuss and just look into the most essential parts. Having knowledge about previous programming languages helps a lot, espesially if one of those are Java. You don't need to look into XNA for this, all you really do need is to Start Visual Studio, create a new Windows Form, drag over an PictureBox and start playing with the KeyEvents. Your game does not have to be awesome for you to learn the very basics of C# and .NET. And you certainly don't need to dig down in the deep jungle of XNA! Once you have your form up and running with a PictureBox or two and you have conqured the Event-system, take a look at the other fundamental parts of .NET that makes your life easier. Properties, Generics, Data Sources and much much more.
