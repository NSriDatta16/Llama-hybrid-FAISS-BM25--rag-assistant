Web service response encoding issue

I am developing a Web Services based on ASP.Net asmx web service. The server end will response byte[] to client encoded in UTF-8, and client to convert the byte[] to string. My confusion is, the England pound character at server side (I dump just before the Http response is wrote, and the character at server side is correct to be England pound) will be received as ?? from client side. Any ideas what is wrong? I suspect it is encoding issue, but I have no idea how to debug further and any settings (settings from client web service proxy?) which will impact? Here is the header part which I got from Fiddler. HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 16:51:30 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 cache-control: no-cache pragma: no-cache X-Powered-By: ASP.NET X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Cache-Control: private Content-Type: text/xml Content-Length: 22752 xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"
