Consider using a longitudinal proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. You can make the ordinary model longitudinal in multiple ways, including a Markov model and a random effects model. The latter is less likely to fit the needed correlation patterns if you have serial correlation instead of compound symmetry. All this is best done with Bayesian modeling as illustrated here but you can also use frequentist models. R has the richest environment for semiparametric (ordinal) models. See for example the VGAM , ordinal , and mixor package in addition to univariate ordinal models in the rms package's lrm and orm function, the latter for continuous Y, efficiently handling 1000s of distinct Y levels.
