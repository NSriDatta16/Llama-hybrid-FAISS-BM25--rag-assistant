I don't think there is anything built-in to WinForms but there are several third-party controls that allow this functionality. One popular set of controls is the ones from Telerik: http://www.telerik.com/products/winforms/dock.aspx And another one is the controls from Ingragistics: http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/winforms/windockmanager.aspx#Overview Both these are commercial packages and I don't know of any free packages that offer the same.
