I would recommend the following: "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It is freely available as a PDF and a series of video lectures . "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka. It is very well-written, good combination of explanations and code, and the author is responsive. "Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies", by John D. Kelleher, Brian Mac Namee and Aoife D'Arcy For more advanced treatments: "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction" (as mentioned previously). "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning", by David Barber. "Machine Learning", by Tom Mitchell. "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective", by Kevin P. Murphy. "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", by Christopher Bishop.
