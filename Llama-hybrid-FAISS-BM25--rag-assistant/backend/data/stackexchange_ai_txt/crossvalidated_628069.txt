You need to compare the distributions of the corresponding sample means. The sample means are $\overline{X}_{1/2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{1,2},\sigma_{1,2}/\sqrt{N})$ . Therefore, the distribution of the sample means get narrower with increasing sample size N. At some sample size N, the two distributions of the sample meams become distinguishable. If you want to construct a test and a p-value, I suggest looking into a permutation test (or a bit different a bootstrap test). In the permutation test, you draw samples from both distributions and compute the difference of the means of two groups (the difference will on average be zero). At some big sample size you will observe that the original difference of means gets a low p-value. However, if the sample size is not big enough, a small difference in means might stay unnoticed (due to too high p-values).
