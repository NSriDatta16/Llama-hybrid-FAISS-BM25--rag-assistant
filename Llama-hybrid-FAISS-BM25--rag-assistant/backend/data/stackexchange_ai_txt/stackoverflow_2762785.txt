In general, you need the .lib for the linker, and .dll at runtime. The .lib file is called an "import library", which contains the glue that tells the linker the functions you're calling can be found in the associated .dll file. You will probably find that only the .dll file is required at runtime. This is a widely used layout for Win32 DLL projects and is not limited to Winpcap.
