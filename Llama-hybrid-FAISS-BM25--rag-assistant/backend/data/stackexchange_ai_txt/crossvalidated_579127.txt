Simplest thing would be to 'featurize' the history. Represent the time-series part with time series features like from the tsfresh package. A lot of the 'seasonal' features though will require more than 1 year if the products exhibit a yearly seasonal pulse but you could instead do something simple like percentage of total sales that occurred in week 1, 2, 3 ... 52 as a column. Could do other simple measures like a simple mean, number/percentage of 0s etc. Cluster on those along with the product attribute information and drop the time element (will also shrink your dataset significantly). The end goal is to classify the individual products as high selling or low selling. Then I would just sum the sales and put a simple threshold on that to split it up, no need to cluster. ABC analysis is used very frequently for demand segmentation.
