SharePoint 2007 Log Viewer

SharePoint 2007 (WSS or MOSS) logs are not easy to read even on a large screen, has anyone come across a log viewer that is able to: Display SharePoint logs live and historical Filter the events by various parameters Cope with SharePoint's log rotation A subset of the above features would be acceptable, as would a range of tools either WinForms or SharePoint Features. The list below isn't in any particular order other than the order in which they came to my attention. I have posted the log viewers that I found, if you have had any experience with the products upvote/comment in the answers below. Found so far : SPLogViewer - supports loading and filtering one file, does not follow/tail log displays data in a DataGrid. SharePoint ULS Log Parser - one click access to log files, supports filtering by Process Name, Level, Area and Category. Log Viewer Feature - access from Central Administration, select individual log basic filtering on category, event and trace severity, output as HTML in Central Administration. WSS / MOSS Log File Reader - Access to individual log files from Central Administration, standard DataGrid filtering and sorting options. Stefan Gordon's ULS Viewer - Open individual log, does not follow/tail log, displays data in ListView detail. Filter by secerity, process category and free form text. SQL Integration Services - All reporting, sorting and filtering options provided by MSSQL (Blog Post with ETL Package Download), time consuming to setup. LogParser - Familiar interface to IIS Administrators, pleanty of options. Setup takes too long for small installations. SharePoint Log Viewer - WPF, as yet untested. Stonebond SharePoint Log Viewer - Looks great, as yet untested. ULS Deobfuscator - Another WPF reader.
