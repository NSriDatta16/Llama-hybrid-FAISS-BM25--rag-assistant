Per my view, the reason to have js.erb files is to gain access to rails helpers like the something_url routes. I've found, most of the time, that those URLs are already embedded in the tag or something like that, so I have little need for it. Processing everything with .erb also prevents you from caching javascript as aggressively. For those reasons, I think the most appropriate decision is to put javascript in the most unobtrusive place possible: application.js (or other static scripts). Especially with jQuery, that's really as it was intended. By the way, javascript_auto_include is a nice, tidy plugin for organizing your javascript according to the views that are rendered. Rather than stashing everything in application.js , you might consider this. js.erb versus js.rjs One of these two ( .erb ) is really for generating javascript from a template. This is the sort of thing you would include as a tag in the HTML. The other ( .rjs ) is about controlling page content in an AJAX response, and would not be run until such an AJAXy call was made.
