PCA creates a new set of coordinates (the components) that explains most of the variance. It does feature engineering, not feature selection. You can use it undirectly to do the task, but it's more work than required. If you want to do proper feature selection, start with one of the tools in scikit-learn that do feature selection . One of these algorithms should easily give you the 2 variables that explain your data out of three.
