The remark is not referring to continuous-time--continuous-observation Kalman-Bucy filters, but to discrete-time Kalman filters. The confusion seems to be only due to the OP not knowing about the discrete-time version (which in my experience is most commonly meant when 'Kalman filter' is mentioned). See, for example, the Wikipedia article 'Kalman filter' or [1]. In the discrete-time case, the state-space of the nodes is indeed not discrete but $\mathbb{R}^m$ for the measurements and $\mathbb{R}^n$ for the observations. There are however other Bayesian networks with continuous state-space (for the variables) and Gaussian conditional distributions, too [e.g. 2]. The discrete-time linear-Gaussian dynamic-system model can be written as a dynamic Bayesian network as follows. Time-slice $k$ consists of nodes $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$ and there is an edge pointing from $\mathbf{x}_k$ to $\mathbf{y}_k$ . The intertemporal edges are from $\mathbf{x}_k$ to $\mathbf{x}_{k+1}$ . The conditional probability distributions are $\mathbf{y}_k \mid \mathbf{x}_{k+1} \sim \mathrm{N}(\mathbf{A}_k\,\mathbf{x}_k,\mathbf{Q}_k)$ and $\mathbf{y}_{k} \mid \mathbf{x}_k \sim \mathrm{N}(\mathbf{H}_k \, \mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{R}_k)$ where all quantities except $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$ are known matrices. The Kalman filter is then an algorithm for sequentially updating the distributions of $\mathbb{x}_k$ given observed $\mathbb{y}_1,\ldots,\mathbb{y}_k$ in this dynamic Bayesian network. The only probability theory required is computing conditional distributions of (finite-dimensional) multivariate Gaussian distributions. Caveat: There exists also something called 'Continuous-time Bayesian networks'[3] but I'm not aware of any connection between them and the Kalman-Bucy filter's model.
