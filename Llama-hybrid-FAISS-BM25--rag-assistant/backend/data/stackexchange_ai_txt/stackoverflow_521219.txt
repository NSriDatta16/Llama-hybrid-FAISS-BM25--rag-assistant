I've now got a solution to this. I've implemented an ImageContext class, a special Image class, and a Filter class that allows similar functionality to Apple's CoreImage. All three use OpenGL (I gave up trying to get this to work on DirectX due to image quality issues, if someone knows DirectX well contact me, because I'd love to have a Dx version) to render an image(s) to a context and use the filters to apply their effects (as HLGL frag shaders). There's a brief write up here: ImageKit with a screen shot of an example filter and some sample source code.
