It seems to me you should really think about Insertion Sort algorithm. Every time you need to add a new value just put it into the end your current temp array and push the value down the array until you'll find it's place and knowing the current index for this item you'll be able to find all elements than this one. This algorithms has O(n^2) complexity in the average case. You could achieve O(n log n) using binary trees.
