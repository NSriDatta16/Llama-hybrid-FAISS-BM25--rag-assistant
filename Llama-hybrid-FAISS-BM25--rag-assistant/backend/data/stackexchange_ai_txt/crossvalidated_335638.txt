citation for encoding binary inputs to neural net as -1 and 1

I've seen the recommendation that binary inputs to a neural network should be encoded as -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1 in a few places on the internet ( here and here ). Does anyone know of a published peer reviewed citation that supports (or opposes) this recommendation?
