"analysis" (in the context of R users) typically means "statistical analysis" whereas "programming" (esp. for more general-purpose languages) could mean web, frontend, backend, database, visualization, networking, security etc. You can get away with this assumption in R only because it and its programming audience are oriented to statistics and on average have a very high level of education both in general and statistical literacy in particular... but you can't get away with this (since the generalization is not true of) with most other languages: e.g. PHP, JavaScript, SQL, VBA, C#... even MATLAB/Octave users will tend to be knowledgeable about linear algebra and probably vector calculus, but not necessarily of statistics (beyond basics like "what is standard deviation? normal distribution?").
