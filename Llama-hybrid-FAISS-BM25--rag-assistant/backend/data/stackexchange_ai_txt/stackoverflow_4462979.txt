Options I can see if you really can't use your own DB: With newer browsers, you can use the new web storage standards. If your users are willing to work with you (e.g., install a plug-in from a trusted source) and they're not on Linux, there's Google Gears . Some number of people will already have it installed. As everyone's said, you can use cookies. Note that cookies will be limited, both in terms of the size of an individual cookie and in terms of how many cookies you can save for a particular path. This is not likely to be a good user experience, but you could also use bookmarks with really long query strings on them (e.g., the user adds their links, you generate a URL with those links embedded in the query string, and the user bookmarks that resulting URL). Cheating a bit, you could use the Google Docs Spreadsheet API . I say "cheating" because you said the site couldn't have a DB, but maybe I can get away with it if the DB is fully hosted for you and hooked into your users' account rather than yours?
