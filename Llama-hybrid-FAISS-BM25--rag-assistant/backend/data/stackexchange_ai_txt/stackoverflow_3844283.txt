MongoDB or CouchDB or something else?

I know this is another question on this topic but I am a complete beginner in the NoSQL world so I would love some advice. People at SO told me MySQL might be a bad idea for this dataset so I'm asking this. I have lots of data in the following format: TYPE 1 ID1: String String String ... ID2: String String String ... ID3: String String String ... ID4: String String String ... which I am hoping to convert into something like this: TYPE 2 ID1: String ID1: String ID1: String ID1: String ID2: String ID2: String This is the most inefficient way but I need to be able to search by both the key and the value. For instance, my queries would look like this: I might need to know what all strings a given ID contains and then intersect the list with another list obtained for a different ID. I might need to know what all IDs contain a given string I would love to achieve this without transforming Type 1 into Type 2 because of the sheer space requirements but would like to know if either MongoDB or CouchDB or something else (someone suggested NoSQL so started Googling and found these two are very popular) would help me out in this situation. I can a 14 node cluster I can leverage but would love some advice on which one is the right database for this usecase. Any suggestions? A few extra things: The input will mostly be static. I will create new data but will not modify any of the existing data. The ID is 40 bytes in length whereas the strings are about 20 bytes
