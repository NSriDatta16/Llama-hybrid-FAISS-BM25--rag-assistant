Logistic Modeling with Probability

For each predicted value in a logistic model, is there any way of also obtaining a "probability score"? I'm using Python's SKLearn library to create a logistic regression model that either predicts either 1 or 0 and I would like to have another column indicating how "sure" the model is of the particular outcome. The closest that I've come is using a Linear Regression Model instead, which comes out with a number between 0 and 1. Not sure whether this is a good "probability" to use. Also, there are outcomes outside the range. Is there any way to do this or a better method for this type of analysis? Thank you!
