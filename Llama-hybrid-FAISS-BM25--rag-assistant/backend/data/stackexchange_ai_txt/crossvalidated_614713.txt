Question on Calibrated Structured Prediction (Kuleshov, 2015)

I have several questions regarding equation (2) from the paper: Calibrated Structured Prediction (Kuleshov, 2015) . I believe most of my questions stem from not understanding the quantity: $T(x)=\mathbb{E}[y|F(x)]$ defined as "the true probability $y=1$ given that $x$ received a forecast $F(x)$ . Q1: How would you write " $y-T(x)$ has expectation 0 conditioned on $F(x)$ "? $$ \mathbb{E}[y-T(x)|F(x)] =0$$ or $$\mathbb{E}[(y-T(x))|F(x)]=0$$ Q2: Why is this statement true: " $y-T(x)$ has expectation 0 conditioned on $F(x)$ "? And does the validity of this statement depend on having a "good" forecaster, $F(x)$ ? Q3: How is $T$ used to decompose the $l_2$ prediction loss? The authors decompose it into... $$\mathbb{E}[(y-F(x))^2] = \mathbb{E}[(y-T(x))^2]+\mathbb{E}[(T(x)-F(x))^2]$$ But starting from the equation below, I'm not sure where to go... $$\mathbb{E}[(y-F(x))^2] = \mathbb{E}[y^2-2\cdot y \cdot F(x) + F(x)^2]$$ I have tried to work backwards by also expanding the authors' original equation to ... $$\mathbb{E}[y^2-2 \cdot y \cdot T(x) + T(x)^2 + T(x)^2 -2 \cdot F(x) \cdot T(x) + F(x)^2]$$ then setting that equation to the expanded form of $\mathbb{E}[(y-F(x))^2]$ : $$\mathbb{E}[y^2-2 \cdot y \cdot T(x) + 2 \cdot T(x)^2 -2 \cdot F(x) \cdot T(x) + F(x)^2] = \mathbb{E}[y^2-2\cdot y \cdot F(x) + F(x)^2]$$ $$\mathbb{E}[-2 \cdot y \cdot T(x) + 2 \cdot T(x)^2 -2 \cdot F(x) \cdot T(x)] = \mathbb{E}[-2\cdot y \cdot F(x)]$$ $$\mathbb{E}[- y \cdot T(x) + T(x)^2 - F(x) \cdot T(x)] = \mathbb{E}[- y \cdot F(x)]$$ But at this point, I am stuck. I do not see how to leverage " $yâˆ’T(x)$ has expectation 0 conditioned on $F(x)$ " to understand or simplify the equation further. Thank you for reading! Any and all guidance is greatly appreciated.
