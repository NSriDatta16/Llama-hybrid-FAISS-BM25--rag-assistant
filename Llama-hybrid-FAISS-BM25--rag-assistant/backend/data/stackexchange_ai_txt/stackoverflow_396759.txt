Interesting question. There is no such attribute for database, but you can dig for some clues. New databases: use NotesNoteCollection and look for some specific design element (icon, for example) and look for first element in $UpdatedBy field. New copies/from templates: above mentioned method won't work. It will return info from original/template, not current database. In this case, try using Created property of DB and check user footprints after that date - in ACL log (he probably altered ACL immediately after copy), new design elements (probably made new view, folder, agent...) or profile documents.
