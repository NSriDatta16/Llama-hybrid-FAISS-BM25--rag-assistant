What is the structure of Neural Networks for mean and standard deviation?

I am curious whether there is a certain neural network that automatically calculates mean and standard deviation. Suppose there is dataset with one input variable x. There is 6 elements {1,4,5,2,6,2}. I am curious if I form a autoencoder with one bottle neck and one bias, linear of activation function, does this neural network calculate mean and standard deviation automatically?
