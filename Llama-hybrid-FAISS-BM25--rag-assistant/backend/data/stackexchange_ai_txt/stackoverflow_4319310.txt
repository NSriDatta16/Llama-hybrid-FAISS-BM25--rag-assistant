javascript bookmark icon

I have a site which offers a useful bookmark link that contains javascript only as opposed to a link to a web page. eg URL:"javascript:(function(){.....})();" The icon that appears in the bookmarks bar is the default blank paper image. Is there a way of forcing it to have an icon of my choice, eg the favicon.ico of my site, when someone drags the link to their bookmarks bar? (eg like when your bookmark is a standatd url such as URL:"www.mysite.com") Many thanks for you time! jJ
