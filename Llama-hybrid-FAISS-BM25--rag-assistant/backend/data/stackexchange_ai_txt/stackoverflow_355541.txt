As you've observed, GHCi is fairly limited in what it can do --- short functions or expressions are about all that's easy at the command line. For the rest I find myself loading modules. One of the difficulties is that Haskell does not have definition before use so it is often hard to pull a meaningful fragment out of a file. I generally find myself defining small modules and loading and reloading them. The interactive experience is definitely not as nice as one might like.
