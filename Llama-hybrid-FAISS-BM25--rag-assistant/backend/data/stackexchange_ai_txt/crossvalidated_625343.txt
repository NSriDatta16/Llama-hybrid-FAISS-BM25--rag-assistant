Why do we talk about "everybody vs nobody" scenarios in causal inference?

Researcher A and researcher B survey mothers in Germany and ask them: $T =$ Whether they smoked during their pregnancy $Y =$ The birthweight of their baby $\boldsymbol{X} =$ All kinds of things that should be controlled for when estimating a causal effect from $T$ to $Y$ (1) Researcher A reports that “If every pregnant woman in Germany smoked, the average birthweight in Germany would be lower by 200g than if none of them smoked”. Anyone you ask will tell you this is a correct interpretation of the ATE estimate. (2) Researcher B reports that "Smoking during pregnancy causes lower birthweights. On average, 200g lower." Anyone you ask will tell you this is also a correct interpretation of the ATE estimate. However: (3) Since the statement in (1) is about an average, the correct take-away of this statement for a pregnant woman in Berlin debating whether to smoke or not is obviously not that her baby will be exactly 200g lighter if she smokes. (4) But! Even if she understands this, it is still unclear how the statement should influence her decision , because she does not live in a Germany where every pregnant woman will magically follow her lead in smoking or not smoking. If she decides to smoke, the real Germany where she will do so is a very different place from the theoretical Germany in (1), where every pregnant woman smokes and gives everyone a nice dose of second-hand smoke everywhere the go. (5) The statement of researcher B, on the other hand, refers unambiguously to the real-world Germany. The statement in (1) is mathematically correct and comes from the definition $ATE = E[Y(1)] – E[Y(0)]$ . I think the statement in (2) follows from the fact that (under ignorability): $E[Y(1)] – E[Y(0)] = E[Y|T=1, \boldsymbol{X}] - E[Y|T=0, \boldsymbol{X}]$ . Estimates for $E[Y|T=1, \boldsymbol{X}]$ and $E[Y|T=0, \boldsymbol{X}]$ then tell the German woman unambiguously that, controlling for all other relevant factors, the average baby from a smoker is lighter than the average baby from a non-smoker in real-world Germany. Question: why do so many papers talk like Researcher A in interpreting results, when that is just how the math works and not the question anyone was hoping to answer? Disclaimer: I can see that in some studies, the everybody/nobody could be the actual research question. For example, everyone gets free school lunch vs no one gets free school lunch. My question is about using the language of Researcher A when it does not seem to match the research objective. No medical researcher is sitting in their office thinking "Hmmmm... I wonder what would happen if every pregnant woman in the world smoked".
