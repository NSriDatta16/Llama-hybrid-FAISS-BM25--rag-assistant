Structural Equation Models (SEMs) versus Bayesian Networks (BNs)

The terminology here is a mess. "Structural equation" is about as vague as "architectural bridge" and "Bayesian network" is not intrinsically Bayesian . Even better, God-of-causality Judea Pearl says that the two schools of models are almost identical. So, what are the important differences? (Amazing to me, the Wikipedia page for SEMs doesn't even include the word "network" as of this writing.)
