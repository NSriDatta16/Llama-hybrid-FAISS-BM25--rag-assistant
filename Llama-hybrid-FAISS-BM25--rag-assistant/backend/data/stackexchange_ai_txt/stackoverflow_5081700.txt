Based on the information you give in the question, Custom Variables are indeed the method you'd want to proceed with. (There's also the possibility of using the 'User Defined Variables', but their use is discouraged, as the feature is considered deprecated in favor of Custom Variables.) In contrast to Events, Custom Variables don't create their own request to Google Analytics; instead, they define an attribute of the hits (events, pageviews, transactions) that result from the given custom variable scope. Thus, they're the best way to send extra data about something you're already tracking (ie, pageviews.) In that sense, the best usage for you would be to set a page-level custom variable before the _trackPageview call with the name of the person in question, always in the same slot. (Since each bio page would be their own page, setting it at the page-level scope would prevent any variable-overwriting issues, as there would never be any overlap.) In this sense, you can think of a custom variable being something that describes the page/session/visitor, rather than describing a particular interaction (which is what Events are better suited for.)
