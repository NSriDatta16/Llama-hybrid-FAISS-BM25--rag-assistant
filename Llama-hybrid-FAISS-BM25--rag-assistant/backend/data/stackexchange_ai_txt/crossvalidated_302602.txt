Average of columns of feature matrix to get gist of passage in word2vec?

Word2vec gives me a NxK matrix, where N is the number words in the vocabulary, and K is the number of features. Let's say that I have all the words in my vocabulary mapped to features. I have a passage that has 100 words (Let's assume that everyone of those words is in my vocabulary), I can create a 100 X K matrix, the represent features of the passage, would taking an average along columns, which results in 100 X 1 matrix give me a reasonable summary of the passage? My end goals is to be able to compare passages. If my above approach is valid, then finding similarity between passages should be trivial.
