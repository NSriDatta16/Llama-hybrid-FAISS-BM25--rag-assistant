How to resolve Object Manager has been closed error?

I'll appreciate if someone can point me to a tutorial or best practice on how to close JDO connection. I constantly get javax.jdo.JDOUserException: Object Manager has been closed error whenever I include the finally block. My code is below: public static List findAgentEntityByString(String id) { List agententity = new ArrayList (); if (id == null) { return null; } try { Query q = pm.newQuery("select id from " + AgentEntity.class.getName()); agententity = (List ) q.execute(); } catch(Exception ex) { log.warning(ex.getMessage()); } return agententity; } Regards
