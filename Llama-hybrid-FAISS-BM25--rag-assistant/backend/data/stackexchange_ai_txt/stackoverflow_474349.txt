I would say forget learning new technology outside understanding industry concepts and how they're really applied in the real world. The key thing you need to be able to do as an expert witness is explain these concepts in terms that can be easily understood by the layman. You already know this stuff or you wouldn't be the expert witness. You're there because your name and reputation are thought well of and they [prosecution/defence] need your help. I think of it like this: The lawyer/barrister/attorney's job is to sell their vision of the truth and get the jury to buy into their vision [skewed as that vision may or may not be]. Your job is to sell the facts. Either the two are one and the same, or they aren't. Sell the facts to the best of your ability, if you have easily understood examples [by easily understood, I mean by an 8 year old], all the better. Key concepts I would think would be software systems that people will use/exploit to either commit or to cover up a crime: Networking systems: Common protocols, packet tracing etc. Firewall systems and common exploits. Viruses and replication: Worms vs. Trojans etc. Major Operating Systems: Basic concepts and common exploits. Web Applications: How they're structured and how they can be exploited. Common hacking concepts: DoS, OOB, SQL Injection etc. Email concepts: transmission, receipt, tracking, header information. Data storage and recovery concepts and key software. Surveillance Techniques: Packet analysis, key loggers etc. I'm sure there are a few others, but no others immediately spring to mind
