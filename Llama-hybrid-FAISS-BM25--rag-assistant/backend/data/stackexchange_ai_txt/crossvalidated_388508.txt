http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations -> this blog post explains clearly about How the embedding layer is trained in Keras Embedding layer . Hope this helps. Word2Vec is a pre-trained embedding model using a specific architecture. Embedding layer and Word2Vec can be analogous to CNN layer and Imagenet pre-trained models.
