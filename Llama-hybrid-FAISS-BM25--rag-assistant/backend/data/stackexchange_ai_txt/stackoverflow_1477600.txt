In our code, and in all the videos that I've watched, you set it up so that the view takes, as a parameter, the ViewModel. public ThisView(ThisVM vm) { InitializeComponent(); DataContext = vm; } If you need to pass things around from somewhere else, you can use the eventAggregator to subscribe and publish to them. Kind of like this in the spot where you have the DataObject: _EventAggregator.GetEvent ().Subscribe(ReceiveModel, true); And like this where you want to have access to it (probably the VM): _EventAggregator.GetEvent ().Publish(_Model); There are still some synchronous things to deal with, but, if this is what you want, this should get you going.
