It looks like you're trying to fit a linear model on simulated time series data. The variance keeps on increasing continuously and this looks odd. For heteroskedastic data the variance would change but not increase continuously. This appears to be simulating a random walk. A linear model will only be able to give you estimates of the mean. Irrespective of any transformation you apply when trying to scale down the variance when fitting the model, the variance of the residuals would keep increasing. Edited after additional information on the data set: So I'm inferring that each record represents a vehicle's total distance covered from start date. You're trying to estimate the total distance covered in the future months. I would suggest the following changes: Represent each month's data point not as total distance covered, but as incremental distance covered in that month. If you can, add other features such as geographical area (e.g. vehicles delivering supplies in different regions may have to drive further or nearer than other geographical areas), or vehicle type, etc. these may help you obtain a better estimate of distance driven next month. You could also cluster the vehicles as lightly-driven, medium, heavily driven and use that as a categorical variable. Try other features you may find informative and which make sense to the problem you're trying to solve.
