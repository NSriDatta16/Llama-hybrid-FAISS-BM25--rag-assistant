If this was bad, then why is this a feature in the language! It's got a purpose, and you've found it. I often write code exactly as in your example. When you want to initialize a variable, and there's a little calculation that needs doing to work out what that should be, and that involves a couple of variables... then you don't want those variables hanging around for the entire scope of your function, then a little scope to contain the initialization works great. Mini scopes are an easy way to break code into 'paragraphs'. If you split into methods you can make the code harder to navigate when those methods don't get called from anywhere else and have a serial kind of order in which they need to be executed. It's always a balance, but if you think it's going to be easiest to maintain and it actually adds value to a future reader of your code if its all inline, then go for it. There are no hard and fast rules. I get a little fed up sometimes with co-workers who excessively put everything into its own method or class or file, and this becomes a nightmare to navigate. There's a nice balance somewhere!
