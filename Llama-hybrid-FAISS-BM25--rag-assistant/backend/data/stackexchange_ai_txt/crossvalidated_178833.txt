Maximum number of iterations (in function “homals” in R) and transformation nonlinear data to linear data

is there anyone who knows what does "maximal number of iterations" can mean in nonlinear PCA (in "homals" function in R) and how to transform nonlinear data to linear data (in R software or in generally)? Thank you really a lot in advance. PS: I have a really large sample of data (9 variables with millions of observations) and I am not able to run it (for "homals" function - I need nonlinear PCA) in R on the university computer, so maybe with small number of iterations I can run it, but I am not sure if the results will be meaningful. PS2: Regarding to transformation I suppose that after transformation I can use classical PCA, Factor Analysis, etc.
