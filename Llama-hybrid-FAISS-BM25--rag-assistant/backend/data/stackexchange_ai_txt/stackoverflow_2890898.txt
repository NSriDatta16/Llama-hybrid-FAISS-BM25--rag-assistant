Preventing mouse emulation events (i.e. click) from touch events in Mobile Safari / iPhone using Javascript

In doing a single page Javascript app with interactive DOM elements I've found that the " mouseover-mousemove-mousedown-mouseup-click " sequence happens all in a bunch after the " touchstart-touchmove-touchend " sequence of events. I've also found that it is possible to prevent the " mouse*-click " events from happening by doing an " event.preventDefault() " during the touchstart event, but only then, and not during the touchmove and touchend . This is a strange design, because because it is not possible to know during the touchstart yet whether the user intents to drag or swipe or just tap/click on the item. I ended up setting up a "ignore_next_click" flag somewhere tied to a timestamp, but this is obviously not very clean. Does anybody know of a better way of doing this, or are we missing something? Note that while a "click" can be recognized as a " touchstart-touchend " sequence (ie no " touchmove "), there are certain things, such as keyboard input focus, that can only happen during a proper click event.
