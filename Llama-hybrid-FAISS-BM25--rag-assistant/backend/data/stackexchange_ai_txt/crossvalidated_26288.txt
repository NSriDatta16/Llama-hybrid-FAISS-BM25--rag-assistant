Understanding Odds Ratios in Logistic Regression

I'm trying to understand how to interpret log odds ratios in logistic regression. Let's say I have the following output: > mod1 = glm(factor(won) ~ bid, data=mydat, family=binomial(link="logit")) > summary(mod1) Call: glm(formula = factor(won) ~ bid, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = mydat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.5464 -0.6990 -0.6392 -0.5321 2.0124 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.133e+00 1.947e-02 -109.53 So my equation would look like: $$\Pr(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-[-2.13 + 0.002\times(\text{bid})]\right)}$$ From here I calculated probabilities from all bid levels. I have been using this graph to say that at a 1000 bid, the probability of winning is x. At any given bid level, the probability of winning is x. I have a feeling that my interpretation is wrong because I'm not considering that these are log-odds. How should I really be interpreting this plot/these results?
