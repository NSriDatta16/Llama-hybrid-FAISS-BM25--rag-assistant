I had the same problem recently, but the warning wasn't shown on every forward call of the RNN. It turned out that only when I had previously moved a model from the CUDA GPU to the CPU and back to te GPU, a forward call on the model would throw the warning. I resolved it with some workaround code and just left the models on the GPU.
