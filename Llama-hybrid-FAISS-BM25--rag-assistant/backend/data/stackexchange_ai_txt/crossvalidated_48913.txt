The best estimate ? Best is subjective in Bayesian inference. It can be shown that using the mean of $f_t$, as you have, is the best estimate in the expected squared error sense, i.e. it minimizes $E_{f_t}[(p_t - p^*)^2]$. The function $L(p_t, p^*) = (p_t - p^*)^2$ is the squared error loss function . But others can be considered: $L(p_t, p^*) = | p_t - p^* |$, and here $E_{f_t}[ L(p_t, p^*) ]$ is minimized by not the mean of the posterior, but the median of the posterior. In general, the solution to the problem: $$ \arg \min_{p_t} E_{f_t}[ L(p_t, p^*) ] $$ is called the Bayes action. You can choose a Loss that accurate reflects your desires: maybe you want to bias slightly towards 0,1 end points, so you could choose the loss $$ L( p_t, p^*) = \frac{ (p_t - p^*)^2 }{ p_t(1-p_t) }$$ (Perhaps this fits into your rationality (or irrationality ) model better as humans like to bias towards certainty as opposed to uncertainity). The Bayes action for this loss function would require more effort to calculate though. Here is a good manuscript that explains Bayes actions and loss functions quite well. The estimate $\frac{a}{a+b}$ The estimate you proposed actually has a very simple solution. That solution is the maximum likelihood estimator of $p^*$ which is equivilant to choosing a uniform prior (like you have) and choosing the maximum a-posterior estimate (the MAP estimate), defined as the arg max of the posterior. (see page 2 in the paper linked).
