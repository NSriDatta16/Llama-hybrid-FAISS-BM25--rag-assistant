how to deform an ellipse in running time

i first sorry about my english,i´ll try to explain want i want to do i need to draw an ellipse with wpf that represents an aura and it´s "deformations" representing problematic zones in it,in short an ellipse that can be deformed in running time in specific points I'm trying to draw several bezier curves forming an ellipse but it´t very difficult (and i don´t know how) to make points that can be dragged forming convex or hollow zones in that ellipse. ¿i made myselft clear in my spanglish? ¿is there an easy way to do that? Thanks in advance
