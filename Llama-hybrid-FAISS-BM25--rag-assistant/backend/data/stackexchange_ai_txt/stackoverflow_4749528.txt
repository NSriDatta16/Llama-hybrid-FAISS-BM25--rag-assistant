JQuery for scroll menu

I am trying to make a scroll bar ( just like the below example ) http://samples.infragistics.com/2010.3/WebFeatureBrowser/WebDataMenu/Scrolling/WebDataMenuScrolling.aspx Its the 2nd example ( verticle one ) I was thinking of doing this in JQuery. Can anyone point me into the right direction on the steps i need to do to make this work? It should hide the down image as soon as it hits the last record too. Cheers
