Modifying view based on ACL in CakePHP

I want to be able to show or hide certain elements in a view based on ACL. For instance, if a user is looking at my Users/index view, I don't want to show a 'Delete User' element if he doesn't have permission to delete users. If he does have permission to edit users, I do want to show a 'Edit User' link. I can hack this together, but being very new to Cake I'm hoping that there is an elegant solution. The best I've done involves keeping logic in two places, so it's hell to maintain. Thanks!
