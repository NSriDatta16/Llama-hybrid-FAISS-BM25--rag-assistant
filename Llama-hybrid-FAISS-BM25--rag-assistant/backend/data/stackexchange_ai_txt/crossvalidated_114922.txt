A paper by Abelson (1985) titled "A variance explanation paradox: When a little is a lot" , published in Psychological Bulletin , addresses (part of) this issue. In particular, Abelson shows that the proportion of variance shared between a dichotomous and a continuous variable can be surprisingly small, even when intuition would dictate a very large $R^2$ (he uses the example of whether a baseball batter would hit a ball or not, as a function of the batter's batting average--yielding a whopping $R^2 Abelson goes on to explain that even such a tiny $R^2$ can be meaningful, as long as the effect under investigation can make itself felt over time. P.S.: I used this paper a few months ago to respond to a reviewer who was unimpressed with our low $R^2$'s, and it hit the mark--our paper is now in press :) Reference: Abelson, R. P. (1985).
