Online Collaborative Schema Design (leverage google docs?)

I'm looking for an online, collaborative database schema designer. App is for MySQL specifically, but generic DB designer is fine too. It's important that it can handle revisions (history of changes). This looks cool, and I could host it on a server - but doesn't look like it would handle multi-user: http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/ Currently we're doing a lot of design collaboration on google docs/spreadsheets. Has anyone had any success using google spreadsheet for schema design? Even if there were just a gadget for drawing lines/connections, I might give Google Docs a shot.
