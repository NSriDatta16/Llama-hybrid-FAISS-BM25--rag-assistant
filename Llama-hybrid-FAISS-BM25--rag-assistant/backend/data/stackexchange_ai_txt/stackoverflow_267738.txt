Enabling https for Java Webstart

I have a swing application deployed in HTTP Server. Users use the browser to point an URL and install the client using java webstart. Now I need to enable https access to my application deployed on HTTP server. I am using JDK 1.5 as default jdk supported in the jnlp file. For time being I use a self signed certificate to the sign the jars (by default created using Sun's jarsigner, keytool, etc, utils). Solution/steps would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance Ramesh
