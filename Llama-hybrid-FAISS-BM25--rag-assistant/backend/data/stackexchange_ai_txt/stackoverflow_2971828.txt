have you check this link? http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webforms/ReportViewer.aspx To create a Web page that contains the ReportViewer server control 1.Open and build ReportViewer.sln in Visual Studio .NET. 2.Create a new ASP.NET Web application in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 200X. 3.Add a reference to ReportViewer.dll from the ReportViewer solution \bin folder.

The Customize Toolbar dialog box opens. 4.In the Customize Toolbar dialog box, click the .NET Framework Components tab, and then click Browse. 5.Locate ReportViewer.dll in the bin directory of the ReportViewer project folder. Select ReportViewer.dll and click Open. The ReportViewer server control is now added to your Toolbox. 6.From the Toolbox, drag the ReportViewer server control onto the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 WebForm design surface. This creates a new ReportViewer object on your ASP.NET Web Forms page. 7.Set the ReportPath property of the control in the property window. For example, you can set the property to "/SampleReports/Company Sales". 8.Set the ServerUrl property in the property window. For example, you can set the property to http://localhost/reportserver . 9.In addition you can set the Parameters, Toolbar, and Zoom properties of the ReportViewer control.
