It turns out the real answer does not require writing special move functions. Jquery ui sortable can be used as long as the items being sorted have been wrapped in a div of the appropriate size with overflow hidden. Check this jsfiddle for an example. The problem was that I had forced the scaled divs to be close to one another using a negative margin. Then when I started to drag an item it was taking up the wrong amount of space. With the scaled item wrapped in a non-scaled div everything works as expected.
