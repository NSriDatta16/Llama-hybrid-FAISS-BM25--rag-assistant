I'd suggest that you do not invest into technologies/frameworks which are based on integration of browser side ajax capabilities with server side frameworks if you'll need advanced functionality in the browser. What is advanced and what is not is a completely different topic of course, but just to give you a heads up, as you start facing more and more complex UI requirements, you'll discover that the connectivity to back end framework (like JSF) will become more of a problem than a capability. Especially with things like JSF lifecycle, and most of the server side frameworks being based on the idea of an HTTP post (for client-server communication), you'll have issues. An example: you'll be requested to develop a very specific UI widget that has drag and drop capability. If the Ajax-jsf integration framework of your choice does not contain this widget, your problem is born at this point. You'll start looking for ways of injecting data into existing channels, and it will get messy. To avoid further speculation, let me just repeat that if you are sure that your chosen technology setup will give you 90%+ of the capabilities you'll need, that is ok. If you end up developing too much custom stuff, then consider an integration between a powerful client side (javascript or flex or silverlight) layer and a simpler server side layer (resteasy etc) Initial development may not be as fast as the other options, but if you'll need flexibility, this will end up being a much cleaner setup. I'd suggest you take a look at DOJO, and ExtGWT . Cheers Seref
