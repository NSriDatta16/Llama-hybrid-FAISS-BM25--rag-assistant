The term thread is generally used as a description of an operating system concept that has the potential to execute independently of other threads. Whether it does so depends on whether it is stuck waiting for some event (disk or screen I/O, message queue), or if there are enough physical CPUs (hyperthreaded or not) to allow it run in the face of other non-waiting threads. Hyperthreading is a CPU vendor term that means a single core, that can multiplex its attention between two computations. The easy way to think about a hyperthreaded core is as if you had two real CPUs, both slightly slower than what the manufacture says the core can actually do.
