Over a slow connection, it's painful to move the cursor character by character, because you don't get immediate visual feedback, so you always end up moving too much or too little. So what's most effective to me is to use smarter movements and commands, like: fx -- jump to next letter x 5w -- move 5 words forward ci( -- replace what's between the parentheses dap -- delete current paragraph and a long etcetera. I miss those commands all the time when typing in browser's textareas, like now :)
