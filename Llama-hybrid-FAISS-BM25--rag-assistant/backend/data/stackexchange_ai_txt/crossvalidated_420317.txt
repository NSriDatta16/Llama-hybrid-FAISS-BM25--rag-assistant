The short answer is yes, PCA is intended for continuously scaled features. Categorical features which are nominally scaled (e.g., the set of teams in the NFL is a nominally scaled variable) and stored as such would cause this function to give an error. One workaround would be to impose a ranking on a categorical feature that would convert it into an acceptable ordinal scale but that would be an imposition of a rule. Another workaround would be to convert the categorical features into a set of dummy variables or numeric effects as described in the link below. There are those that contend that PCA is invariant to mixtures of numeric variables such as dummy, ordinal and higher scaled features but that has not been my experience. My experience is that you get results with imbalanced latent dimensions which, based on the loadings, are heavily skewed towards the dummy variables. My opinion is that the best solution would be to use correspondence analysis (CA). CA is described as 'PCA for categorical features'. It is well reviewed in the second link below. It may require grouping the continuous variables with a large range of possible values into a smaller set of buckets, depending on the software used.
