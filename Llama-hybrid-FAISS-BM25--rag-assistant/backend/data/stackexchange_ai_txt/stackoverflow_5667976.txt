From what I understand, your goal is to share resources like CSS, JS files across projects. One way to do it would be to use linked files in Visual Studio. We do it extensively in one of our solutions where we share many class files and signing keys acorss projects. Linking files basically involves putting the files in one project in the solution and then linking to them from other projects of the solution. You have to be a little careful though during deployment of projects containing linked files as linking the file does not physically copy the file to the destination project. So even if your project has a css folder, the linked file shown under that folder in VS is not physically there in the directory structure on the disk . If you link classes, the dll for the project that has the linked class file will include the linked class, but for resource files like css, JS and common masterpage, they will not be copied over when you deploy. You can leverage build scripts or some simple batch files to handle those issues. This should solve your problem.
