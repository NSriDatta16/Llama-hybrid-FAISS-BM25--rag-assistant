See magento integration with erp and crm for how to do it. The easiest ERP / CRM systems will be ones that you can set up to pull information from Magento periodically and put it back in over webservices. Open source solutions (where you can monkey with the code) will work out better than closed source solutions, especially ones where you don't have direct database access. As for ease, it depends on how much data will be transferred. Moving orders back to ERP, or moving customers to CRM is not difficult, but keeping everything highly synchronized is another story. If you have other questions, please be more specific and I'll be happy to help. Thanks, Joe
