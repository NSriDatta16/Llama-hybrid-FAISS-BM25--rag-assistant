I have to agree with others on shying away from J2ME development. I have a Motorola RAZR V3xx that I've used for a few years. It is as standard a J2ME-supporting phone as you're likely to get from most carriers. I decided to look into doing some J2ME development for the phone to give myself some helpful utilities. Long story short, there is a reason you pretty much only see games on J2ME phones. Unless you are willing/able to shell out big bucks for signing certificates, you cannot even access the most useful APIs available on the phone. Things like File IO, PIM (contacts, calendar), Bluetooth, etc. are simply blocked unless you get your application signed using a carrier's (AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, etc.) special certificate. And the cost of these certificates can easily exceed hundreds or thousands of dollars. Putting this simply out of the range of your average hobbyist. I could go on, but a couple of sites have covered this topic in much greater detail Here and Here . For me, this pretty much means I will be targeting the Android in the future. The iPhone is also a good place to be targeting. The current state of J2ME on handsets here in the U.S. is just not worth my time for pet projects. Which is disappointing, as most of these phones are capable of doing many useful things otherwise.
