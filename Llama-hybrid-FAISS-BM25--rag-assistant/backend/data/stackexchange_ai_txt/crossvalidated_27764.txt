Using Adaboost with SVM for classification

I know that Adaboost tries to generate a strong classifier using a linear combination of a set of weak classifiers. However, I've read some papers suggesting Adaboost and SVMs work in harmony (even though SVM is a strong classifier) in certain conditions and cases . I'm not able to grasp from an architectural and programming perspective how they work in combination. I've read many papers (maybe the wrong ones) which didn't explain clearly how they work together. Can someone throw some light on how they work in a combination for effective classification? Pointers to some papers / articles / journals would also be appreciated.
