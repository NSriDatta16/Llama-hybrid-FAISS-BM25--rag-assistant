You may want to look at Support Vector Machines . Linear SVMs attempt to find the "best" straight line to separate two populations of points: Nonlinear SVMs allow "curvy" decision boundaries, but then you need to be careful not to overfit to the noise in your dataset. SVMs are implemented in most machine learning tools. Wikipedia has some pointers. We also have an svm tag, earlier questions in the tag may be helpful. (Incidentally, this is not clustering, so looking for this keyword won't help you much.)
