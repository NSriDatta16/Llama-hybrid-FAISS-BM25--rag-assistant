Thanks guys (all) for your reply.. your method is elegant.. this successfully calls the base method, i forgot tell u one morething, DGrid is a sepearate function got its own methods & properties. And i got one more problem here.. DGrid.Headerclik() iself uses 'this' operator to access the methods & properties from its scope.. so on calling the oldHandler() it runs within my local. not exactly in the DGrid scope. (this operator only returns the properies of my page not in the DGrid ) to avoid this i assigned the oldHandler back to the DGrid.Headerclik and calls DGrid.Headerclik () directly.. var oldHandler = DGrid.Headerclik; DGrid.Headerclik = handleInLocal; function handleInLocal(sColumnIdx){ FormColumnWidthJSONArray(); //OldHandler(sColumnIdx) DGrid.Headerclik= OldSCCHandler; DGrid.Headerclik(sColumnIdx) // To Call the actual Column Click handler in DGrid; DGrid.Headerclik= HandleLocal; }
