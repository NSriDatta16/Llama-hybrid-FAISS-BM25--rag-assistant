Why is the p value by average marginal effects different than the p value of the coefficients?

In R, when fitting a logit regression model, why is the p value for variable X different when finding its average marginal effect (AME) (using logitmfx) than when finding variable X's p value by its coefficient (using summary(model))? Please note that by average marginal effects (AME) I mean the average marginal effects across the entire dataset, not the marginal effect at the mean/average of my model. So, in R, I find the AME by logitmfx(model, atmean = FALSE, data = d) For example, say the p value of X's average marginal effect is 0.0033 while the p value of the variable X's coefficient is 0.0030. I understand that this may be due to different hypotheses being tested, but how are they different? I think I'm confused because I don't understand how the AME is different from the coefficient, in the sense that the AME is the effect across the entire dataset, rather than the marginal effect at a certain point. Wouldn't the coefficient then be similar to the AME across the entire dataset since the coefficient is fitted to the entire dataset, not at a certain point? Thank you for your help.
