Can we create confidence intervals around pseudo-R-squared Random Forest based on the forest?

For linear regression it is possible to place confidence intervals around the R-squared, either by formula or bootstrapping. Random Forest models, as regression model, return the "explained variation", or better, "captured variation". However, I have not found a method to estimate confidence intervals around this single value. I am not searching for prediction intervals, but the confidence intervals on the pseudo-R-squared. Is it possible to estimate the confidence intervals of an RF model? Would it be possible to correlate the predicted values for each tree with the explanatory variable of the dataset and extract the 2.5 and 97.5%? See the example below. library(randomForest) library(pdp) set.seed(1) data $x, data$ y) lines(pdplot $x, pdplot$ yhat, col="red", lwd=2) #extract trees predtree $rsq[length(mod$ rsq)] #2.5 and 97.5% for all 500 trees quantile(predrsq, c(.025, .975)) One of the issues becomes that when the node size is in default mode the 2.5 and 97.5% intervals are place higher than the captured variation of the model (overfitting?). Thank you in advance.
