Suppose $\nu_r$ is the invariant measure. The claims made (preceding (5) and (6)) are that if $E_r > E_s$ , then the flow from $r$ to $s$ is $\nu_r P_{rs}$ the flow from $s$ to $r$ is $\nu_s P_{sr} \cdot \exp \left( - \left[ E_r - E_s \right] / kT \right)$ In (5) and (6), the reasoning is that if these two terms are not equal, then the system is not at equilibrium. If one takes $\nu_r = \exp \left( - E_r / kT \right)$ , then the system is at equilibrium, and thus is an invariant measure for the Markov chain constructed. Note that ` equilibrium' here is used synonymously with 'in detailed balance'.
