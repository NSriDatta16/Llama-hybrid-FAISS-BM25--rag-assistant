Actually, that depends on what you want to obtain. If you perform logistic regression only for the predictions, you can use any supervised classification method suited for your data. Another possibility : discriminant analysis ( lda() and qda() from package MASS) r On the other hand, if you need confidence intervals around your predictions or standard errors on your estimates, most classification algorithms ain't going to help you. You could use generalized additive (mixed) models, for which a number of packages are available. I often use the mgcv package of Simon Wood. Generalized additive models allow more flexibility than logistic regression, as you can use splines for modelling your predictors. set.seed(55) require(mgcv) n There's a whole lot more to do : op ... I'd recommend the book of Simon Wood about Generalized Additive Models
