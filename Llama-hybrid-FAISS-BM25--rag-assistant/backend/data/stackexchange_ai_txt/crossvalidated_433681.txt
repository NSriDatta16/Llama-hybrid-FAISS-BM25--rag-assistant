Are Random Forests limited for forecasting/projection purposes

Today a coworker came asking me if we could train a model that will predict some land prices and then use said model to predict on hypothetical data. Let's say, I have a Period feature that goes from 1 to 100, where 1 is the first day of data and 1000 is the last day of data. Then, say the last data point for district A was on day 750. If I then ask my model (assuming it's a Random Forest) to predict a price for district A on day 1000, will it be able to have into consideration that prices will be constantly rising, even though there was no training data for that district on that range of days? What if I ask it to predict a price for day 1200? If the day is out of the training range, it won't be able to project how much the price would have risen, right? Any help to know if I'm on the right way would be appreciated. Thanks !
