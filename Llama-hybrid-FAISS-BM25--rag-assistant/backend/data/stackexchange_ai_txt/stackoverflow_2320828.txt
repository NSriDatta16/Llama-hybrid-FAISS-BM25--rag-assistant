Here are the tools I'm aware of (and just aware): There is CodeNarc that you mentioned. There is also GMetrics . And Grails has a Test Code Coverage Plugin . But nothing ready to be used with Sonar AFAIK. I'm watching SONARPLUGINS-194 about this but there isn't much activity although some work has been reported very recently, maybe be you :)
