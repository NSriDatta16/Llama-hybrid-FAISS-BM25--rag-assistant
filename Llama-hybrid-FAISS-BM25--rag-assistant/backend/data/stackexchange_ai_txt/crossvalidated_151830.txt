What is the best model for time series data with independent and dependent variables

I have two different variables across a time series over a couple thousand time steps. I want to predict the values of the dependent variable (y) based values of the independent variable (x) in the future. I have been using a VAR model in R from the vars package. The problem here seems to be that the VAR model predicts both x and y and treats the future time steps as the independent variable. What is the appropriate model or method to use predict y in the future given x?
