Try this: x The idea is to use a basic structural model for the time series, which handles the missing value fine using a Kalman filter. Then a Kalman smooth is used to estimate each point in the time series, including any omitted. I had to convert your zoo object to a ts object with frequency 4 in order to use StructTS. You may want to change the fitted values back to zoo again.
