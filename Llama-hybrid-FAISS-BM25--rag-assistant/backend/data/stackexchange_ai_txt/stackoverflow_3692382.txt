The above answer is correct; however, it didn't work for me. I tried instead to drag the ToolkitScriptManager into my form, and it was rendered as " . It worked for me then. Note that it was "asp.ToolkitScriptManager", not "ajaxToolkit:ToolkitScriptManager". Perhaps this is a change in the version of the Ajax Control Toolkit I am using?
