How is the data formatted? Are the HTML entities esacaped in the original XML, something like this: &lt;p&gt;A paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; In this case you could just strip the tags with a regular expression. Otherwise, I would suggest following the DTD of the XML file, and stripping all other tags under the assumption that they don't constitute part of the XML markup.
