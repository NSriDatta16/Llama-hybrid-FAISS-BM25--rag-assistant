For that I need three target platforms and I also have to build them on the platforms I want to build them for This is not correct. You need a valid target for the platforms (install the delta-pack in your build-target is enough) you want to build but in the build.properties of PDE you can specify for which platforms you want to build, an example would be configs = win32, win32, x86 & \ win32, win32, x86_64 & \ linux, gtk, x86 & \ linux, gtk, x86_64 & \ macosx, carbon, ppc &\ macosx, cocoa, x86 A build with this configuration would create 6 differents output artifacts. and is it possible to merge all the builds into one single one Although I don't understand what benefit of merging the different builds into one single build would be, this is not supported by PDE build. If you want to merge the build-output into one artifact you could try that for your own, but I doubt that this is possible. You have in your application.ini a reference to the platform-dependent fragment and p2 holds also platform-specific data in the configuration area. In addition your build-artifact (and also the packages for updating) would increase in size (which is from a technical perspective not relevant, but is a major disadvantage from a distribution- or maintaining-perspective).
