What kind of Logistic Regression?

I am not an expert in regression, but I have a problem that I believe should be solved by logistic regression. The problem is rather specific, so I try to describe it using a more tangible example. Say there are five airline carriers, A,..., E, that offer flights to several locations. Let's also assume the following quality of service for the carriers: Q(A) > Q(B) > ... > Q(E), that is, carrier A offers the "best" service during the flight. However, this comes at the cost of a higher price, i.e., P(A) > P(B) > ... > P(E). Therefore, there is a clear trade-off between quality of service and price. Also, to get the general preference of a user, we ask her/him several questions in the form of the following example: "Which carrier would you select to get a flight to New York given the following prices: p(A) = \$1000, P(B) = \$900,..., p(E) = \$650?". Before asking the questions, we let the user know about the quality of service provided by each carrier, so that she/he considers it in their decision making. Once we have enough sample points (say 30), we use them to build a model that can predict user's choice for scenarios that are not in the sample points. To put it concretely, I am looking for a model that can take as input the list of prices, and provide as output the user's preferred carrier. Following are few points that I have figured about the model (which may not be correct): it seems to be a multinomial logistic regression model, where the outcome is one of the five carriers. explanatory variables need not include characteristics of the user, instead they should include attributes of the alternatives (i.e., the price of each carrier). the decision is made by comparing all the alternatives in a scenario, that is, an undesirable alternative in one scenario might be considered desirable in another scenario. I would really appreciate any suggestions.
