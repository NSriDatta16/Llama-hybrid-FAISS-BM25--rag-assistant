Is it possible that the errors are not evenly balanced by level, while the model is correct?

My question is if the outcome of my model can be correct. I have two independent continious variables (x1, x2) and one catagorical independent variable (x3). My dependent variable (y) is continious on a scale from 1 to 100. I have fitted a model mygam1 using bam from mgcv without using variabele x3: mygam1 % group_by(x3) %>% summarize(Vers = round(mean(Verschil1)*100,1)) %>% arrange(desc(Vers)) # The resulting average differences are used as a continous variable in the next fit of mygam2: train_data_incl % dplyr::group_by(x3, my_error) %>% summarize(count = n()) This is done with 5 fold cv. mygam1 and mygam2 are fitted on the same train partition. At the end I have rowbind all 5 parts of predicted outcomes on the valuation data. If I group the errors by x3, I can see the spread of the errors for every level of x3 (see table below). From this table I notice that there is a skew for most levels since for most levels the errors are not evenly balanced between below and above zero (zero is no error where p == y). Is it possible that the errors are not evenly balanced by level, although the model is correct? Thanks a lot!
