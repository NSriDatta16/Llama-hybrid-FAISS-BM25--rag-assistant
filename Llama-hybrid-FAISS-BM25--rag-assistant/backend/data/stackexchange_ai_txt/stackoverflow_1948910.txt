VB (and VBScript / ASP 3) uses banker's rounding (or "round to the nearest even") so: 1.5 rounds to 2 2.5 rounds to 2 3.5 rounds to 3 4.5 rounds to 4 ... etc. I would suggest doing as Jim Schubert suggested and writing your own rounding function to round properly. This page has some good info about rounding across all vb-esque languages: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/196652
