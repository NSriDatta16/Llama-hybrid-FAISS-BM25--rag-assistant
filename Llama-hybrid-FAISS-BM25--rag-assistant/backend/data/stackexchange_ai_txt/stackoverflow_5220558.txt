The first order of business is importing the header file that defines functions exported by ws2_32.dll . You do that by adding the following statement to the top of any source file that you wish to call those functions in: #include Then, you have to tell the linker where it can find the import library for that DLL. There are two ways to do that in Visual Studio, but the simplest way is adding the following line to your source code: #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") You could also add it as a dependency to your linker's "Additional Dependencies" property (find that under your Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input). MSDN also has a getting started guide that walks you through creating a basic Winsock application . Make sure that you've read it before proceeding any further.
