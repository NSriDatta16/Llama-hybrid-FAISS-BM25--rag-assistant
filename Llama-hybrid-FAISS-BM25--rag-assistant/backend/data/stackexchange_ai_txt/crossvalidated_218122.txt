As you have the same information available in your past data as for your future data (both in the form of time series), you could use a number of sequence data/time series based model types to predict your target variable. The core difference is that those models "remember" information between samples, so don't only derive the output on from the $N$ input features of the current input, but also from input they've seen before. Such models range from e.g. Hidden Markov Models to Recurrent Neural Networks - but there are many more suitable model types, with different advantages/disadvantages depending on the details of your problem. PS: have a look at e.g. this answer or this slideset for some more details and further references.
