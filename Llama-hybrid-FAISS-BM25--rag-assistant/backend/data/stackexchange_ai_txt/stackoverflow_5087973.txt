Assuming that the code in the page is static javascript to be executed in the page context on the browser, you can simply copy that fragment in the appropriate place in an HTML body of your JSP. If the fragment needs to be generated dynamically, you'll need to provide more details about what you are trying to do. Based on your comment, my theory is that the javascript is broken, and there's nothing wrong with the way you are embedding the fragment in your JSP. Use "view source" in your browser to see if the fragment above actually appears in the HTML of your page at the place you expect it to appear. If it does, that confirms my theory.
