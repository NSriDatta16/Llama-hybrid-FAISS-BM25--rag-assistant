Knowing the standard deviation of 2 normal distribution

I'm learning linear algebra for data science on some site. There is a quiz and the result I've answered that I linked to the image. I'm curious about why the standard deviation part is wrong? As I calculated, the SD of the purple distribution is 50 (190-140) and the yellow is 40 (200-160). Can anyone explain to my why? Any helpful answer would be very appreciated
