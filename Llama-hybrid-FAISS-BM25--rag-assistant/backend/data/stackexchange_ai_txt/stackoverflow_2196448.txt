Make sure the license compiler (lc.exe) can find the location of your Infragistics assemblies. Also, if you've updated your components anytime recently make sure there aren't multiple copies with different version numbers lying around. Finally make sure that the version your are trying to use is the same version in the licenses.licx file. An easy way to refresh the licenses.licx is it open the form designer, add an Infragistics component and remove it. If for some reason the licenses.licx file doesn't refresh you can try removing the offending entries first then refresh it.
