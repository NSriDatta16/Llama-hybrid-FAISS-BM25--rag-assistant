There are two main approaches to the New Causal Revolution. One is the graphical approach (as in, directed acyclic graphs ), championed by Judea Pearl . The other is the potential outcomes framework , championed by Donald Rubin . For the graphical approach , I recommend these books in this order: The Book of Why , by Pearl and MacKenzie. Prerequisite: introductory statistics. Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer , by Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell. Prerequisites: the full calculus sequence, followed by mathematical statistics . Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference, 2nd Ed. , by Pearl. This book is extremely difficult (I have not read it, though I have skimmed in parts) but has almost everything in there. One recent development not in this book is the maximal ancestor graph approach. Prerequisites: first mathematical statistics, then Bayesian statistics (I would recommend first Bayesian Statistics for Beginners: a step-by-step approach and then Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, 3rd Ed. ; and finally Bayesian networks ). Pearl's book has accompanying homework sets on Pearl's webpage : go to CAUSALITY, then 7. Viewgraphs and homeworks for instructors. Indeed, Pearl's UCLA webpage has errata for all three of the above books. For the potential outcomes framework , the main book appears to be Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction , by Rubin and Imbens. I have not read it; but the prerequisites appear to be mathematical statistics at least - analysis and design of experiments wouldn't hurt, nor would Bayesian statistics (see #3 above for recommendations there). One weakness of this book is that it has no exercises or errata page. The two approaches have different strengths and weaknesses, but as noted by Carlos in his comment, they are theoretically unified via Structural Causal Modeling - addressed in several of the books above.
