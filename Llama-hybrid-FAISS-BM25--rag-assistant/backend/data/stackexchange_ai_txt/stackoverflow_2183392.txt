Pass var through JQuery load

a very simple question I am sure just the brain isn't working this morning. I have the folowing code I am using with JQuery and the Google Maps v3 API. I basically am trying to refresh a map with new search results once it has been dragged to a new location. google.maps.event.addListener( map, 'dragend', function() { var newlatlng = map.getCenter(); $('#venue-list-container').load('/maps/geoMap.php?',{latlon: newlatlng}); }); However I can't find what to use in the parameters after the url to post the newlatlng value (latlon: newlatlng). At the moment it doesn't work
