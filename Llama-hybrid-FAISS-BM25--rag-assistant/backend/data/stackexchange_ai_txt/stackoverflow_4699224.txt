Crystal Reports: Database fields are not appearing

I have a report which is not displaying data. Only one data field in a subreport is appearing. The rest are just blank. I dragged the database fields directly from the Database Fields. The dataset is being filled properly, and Verify Data says the DB is up to date. Thoughts, suggestions?
