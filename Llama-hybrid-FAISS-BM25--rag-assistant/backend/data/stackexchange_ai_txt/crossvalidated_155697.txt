Your matrix representation is already a step in the right direction. I'd recommend taking your separate forecasts and combining them using Hyndman et al.'s (2011) optimal combination approach . You will need exactly the summation matrix you created. One advantage of this combination approach is that it does not matter where your original forecasts come from. In my experience, it does not only yield sum-consistent forecasts, but improves forecast accuracy in your entire hierarchy. This approach is implemented in Hyndman's hts package for R . Hyndman, R. J.; Ahmed, R. A.; Athanasopoulos, G. & Shang, H. L. Optimal combination forecasts for hierarchical time series. Computational Statistics & Data Analysis , 2011, 55, 2579-2589
