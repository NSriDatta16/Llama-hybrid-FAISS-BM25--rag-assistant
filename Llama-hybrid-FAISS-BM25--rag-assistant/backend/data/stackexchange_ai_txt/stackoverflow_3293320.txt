Lapack only has support for dense and banded matrices (no support for general sparse matrices). So unless your sparse matrix is banded (from your description it sounds like it would be a general sparse matrix, usually stored in a compressed row storage scheme), then lapack is not what you want to use. For large sparse matrices, Arpack would be a good place to start.
