How is the counterfactual estimated in Judea Pearls book based on causal inference ? (dowhy)

I have started looking into causal inference, in particular Dowhy package based on Judea Pearls book of why. What i don't understand is how the counterfactual is estimated? My understanding is that DoWhy package (based on judea pearl book) addresses counterfactuals by creating a bayesian graphical model (at very high level) but i don't understand the math of how this is done. Can anybody point me in right direction of how it is estimated? Step 2 in the 4 step process also confuses me. When we say step 2 is 'identification' do we mean that the graphical model tries to write the structure of model we feed it in a probabilistic way? Any light somebody could shed on how counterfactual is created using dowhy/judea pearl way would be great. 4 STEPS: The four Steps of causal inference. Modelling: create a causal graph to encode assumptions a. This is about creating a causal graph that encodes our assumptions that we are bringing in from our domain knowledge and our knowledge about how world works to augment data that we are using Identification: formulate what to estimate a. Here we are going to be taking those assumptions in causal graph and model and using it to formulate what we need to estimate Estimation: compute the estimate a. Given all the realities of the dataset what is the best way to trade off the bias and variance for whatever task weâ€™re trying to do to get a causual estimate of what is the impact of doing one thing vs the other on outcomes we care about Refutation: validate the assumptions a. Lets see if we can refute the estimate i.e. come up with a reason not to trust it
