It sounds like the re-index operation is taking some time - which would be as expected if the data size is large, and the fragmentation is high. It also depends on exactly what that stored procedure does, and how many cores/CPUs you have - and how many SQL Server is allowed to use. Does the app allow you to defer that operation? You'd be able to run it manually yourself through Management Studio - if that doesn't break the application. You could be cheeky, and rename that procedure, and replace it with one of your own that does nothing.... and then rename back, and run. Again, it might break something. Or just keep increasing the timeout until you get past this issue. Some of my re-index jobs on databases generally take hours.... Or contact the vendor if you have support? If you ran that query through Management Studio, it would complete.... doing that would give you the approximate time required to put (temporarily) into the timeout setting.
