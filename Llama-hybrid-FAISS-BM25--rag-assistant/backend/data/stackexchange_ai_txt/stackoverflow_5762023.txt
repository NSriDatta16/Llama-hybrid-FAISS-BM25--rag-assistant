XUL prefwindow size problems

I have a Firefox add-on with a to control the preferences for my add-on. It contains 2 separate tags to provide more info at certain places (see below). I have some JavaScript that I run when the dialog loads to set a CSS max-height and max-width based on the dimensions of the user's screen (I found this necessary because otherwise the dialog would expand horizontally past the edges of the screen just so the one (which has CSS word-wrap: break-word set - Forcing a description widget to wrap ) fits on one line). However, when Firefox (v3.6 and v4.0) displays the prefwindow, it only accounts for the descriptions as if they are one line after setting the max-width and max-height , so there is a scrollbar even though there is room for the dialog to expand vertically (I have overflow: auto set on the topmost vbox just so stuff wouldn't get cut off without a scrollbar). Basically, what I want is for the contents of the tags to wrap so the dialog isn't longer than the user's screen and then for the dialog to resize horizontally also so there isn't a scrollbar. Inline reference links are the tiny "superscript" numbers that appear inside [special name here] and link to a reference at the bottom. *When the inline reference links are invisible, they cannot be seen, but they still take up space on the page. When we are set to show inline reference links when hovering over the containing paragraph, this option can be useful to prevent shifting when the reference links are shown. Here is a screenshot of the prefwindow: https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3JOm.png
