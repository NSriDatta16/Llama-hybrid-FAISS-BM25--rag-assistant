When designing an application (I mainly create web applications, but this does apply to others), I typically create user stories to determine exactly what the end user really needs. These form the typical "business requirements". After the user stories are nailed down, I create flow charts to lay out the paths that people will take when using the app. After that step (which sometimes gets an approval process) I create interface sketches (pen/pencil & graph paper), and begin the layout of the databases. This, and the next step are usually the most time consuming process. The next step is taking the sketches and turn them into cleaned up wireframes. I use OmniGraffle for this step -- it's light years ahead of Visio. After this, you may want to do typical UML diagrams, or other object layouts / functionality organization, but the business people aren't going to care so much about that kind of detail :)
