Taxonomy of regression methods

I am trying to organize regression methods so I know better in which branches to specialize. This is what I have so far and I need your help. First I divide based on the number of input and output variables, and then I divide in linear and non-linear. Then for each of these four branches, I divide in two branches, linear or non-linear, making 8 total branches so far. I am having problems naming the case of: 1 input variable, more than one output variables. Because it has more output variables, I can call it multivariate, but what do I call it for having one input variable? I can't call it simple, because simple means: 1 input variable 1 output variable. Kind Regards
