Regex to capture variables

I am trying to use an HTML form and javascript (i mention this, because some advanced features of regex processing are not available when using it on javascript) to acomplish the following: feed the form some text, and use a regex to look into it and "capture" certain parts of it to be used as variables... i.e. the text is: "abcde email: asdf@gfds.com email: fake@mail.net sdfsdaf..." ... now, my problem is that I cannot think of an elegant way of capturing both emails as the variables e1 and e2, for example. the regex I have so far is something like this: /email: (\b\w+\b)/g but for some reason, this is not giving back the 2 matches... it only gives back asdf@gfds.com > sugestions?
