Ruby Mechanize login not working

Let me set the stage for what I'm trying to accomplish. In a physics class I'm taking, my teacher always likes to brag about how impossible it is to cheat in her class, because all of her assignments are done through WebAssign. The way WebAssign works is this: Everyone gets the same questions, but the numbers used in the question are random variables, so each student has different numbers, thus a different answer. So I've been writing ruby scripts to solve the question's for people by just imputing your specific numbers. I would like to automate this process using mechanize. I've used mechanize plenty of times before, but I'm having trouble logging in to the site. I'll submit the form and it returns the same page I was just on. You can take a look at the site's source code, at http://webassign.net , and I've also tried using the login at http://webassign.net/login.html with no luck either. Let me follow all of this up with some ruby code that doesn't do what I want it to: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' agent = Mechanize.new page = agent.get("http://www.webassign.net/login.html") form = page.forms.last puts "Enter your username" form.WebAssignUsername = gets.chomp puts "Enter your password (Don't worry, we don't save this)" form.WebAssignPassword = gets.chomp form.WebAssignInstitution = "trinityvalley.tx" form.submit #=> Returns original page If anyone really takes an interest in getting this to work, I would be more than happy to send them a working username and password.
