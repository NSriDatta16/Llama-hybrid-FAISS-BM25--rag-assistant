Jeff Rouder has done a lot of work on similar issues where he applied Bayesian hierarchical models for response time data. Analyzing these data with the out-of-the-box multilevel model is difficult to fully justify: such data tend to be skewed, with a clear left cut-off (reaction time), so as assumption of normality that you have to make with the standard multilevel software is dubious. I would also imagine that standardization within subjects kills important information, as the mean and variance within a subject may be linked, which could help identifying the actual distributions you could use to model your RT data.
