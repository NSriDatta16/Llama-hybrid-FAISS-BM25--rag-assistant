Find out how much storage a row is taking up in the database

Is there a way to find out how much space (on disk) a row in my database takes up? I would love to see it for SQL Server CE, but failing that SQL Server 2008 works (I am storing about the same data in both). The reason I ask is that I have a Image column in my SQL Server CE db (it is a varbinary[max] in the SQL 2008 db) and I need to know now many rows I can store before I max out the memory on my device.
