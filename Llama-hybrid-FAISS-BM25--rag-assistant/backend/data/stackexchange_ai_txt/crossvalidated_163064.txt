For logistic regression the rule of thumb isn't 10 total samples per independent variable, it's 10 cases having the lower-frequency outcome. So if you're analyzing a 20%/80% outcome ratio, that rule of thumb suggests 50 total samples per independent variable. And this is only a rule of thumb. Some thumbs are bigger than others. Your intuition about correlated predictors adds a further important consideration. It depends somewhat on what you're trying to accomplish with your regression analysis, for example whether you really want (or even should seek) separate estimates for each predictor, or you are willing to combine information from correlated predictors in some way. Follow the regularization and multicollinearity tags on this site to see ways to deal with correlated predictors. What would be best, of course, would be a pilot study to get preliminary data. Those initial estimates of the relations of the predictors to each other and to outcome would then inform a power analysis for definitive experimental design.
