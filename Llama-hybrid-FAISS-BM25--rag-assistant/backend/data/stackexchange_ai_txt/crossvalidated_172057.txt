I'd say that the answer is that you can't prove that you need to remove outliers and that, in general, you shouldn't remove outliers unless you can show that they are data entry errors or some other form of error. I don't understand exactly what you are doing, but it clearly involves averaging; why not use some form of averaging that is robust to outliers? (median, trimmed mean, Winsorized mean). UPDATE for new edit in question: Given that you want to somehow summarize the data shown in the boxplots, I'm now not only more sure that the arithmetic mean is not appropriate, I'm wondering if any mean is appropriate. I'd say you have work to do before you summarize; you have to figure out what is going on. Why are some cases so narrowly distributed and others not? Why do the medians vary by a factor of about 15? It might be that you want the geometric mean. But it might be that you want no mean at all.
