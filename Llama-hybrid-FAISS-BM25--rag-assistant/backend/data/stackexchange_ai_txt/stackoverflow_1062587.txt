When deleting SMS, they don't get deleted

I connected a GSM/GPRS-modem to my microcontroller and everything works fine. When I want to delete all messages in the ME storage, I should use this command: AT+CMGD=1,4 ->OK The deleteflag '4' indicates that I want to delete all messages and flag '1' is overridden. However, when I check if the storage is empty, I get: AT+CPMS? +CPMS: 8,100,8,100,8,100 Indicating that the memory is still occupied and no message got deleted. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance!
