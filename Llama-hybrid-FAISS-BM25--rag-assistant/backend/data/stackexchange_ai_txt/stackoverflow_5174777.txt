What about var list = new List {1,1,0,0,0}; var percentage = ((double)list.Sum())/list.Count*100; or if you want to get the percentage of a specific element var percentage = ((double)list.Count(i=>i==1))/list.Count*100; EDIT Note BrokenGlass's solution and use the Average extension method for the first case as in var percentage = list.Average() * 100;
