p tags are for paragraphs. p tags often contain additional CSS styling regarding the textual content that goes into them, and this styling can be defined in various places in the css documentation. for example, a p usually has a bit of extra space below it. if you try laying something out with p tags, you'll end up with uneven padding. It is better to use divs if you want to have more control over the content in your page from a programmatic perspective. sticking to divs for all layout concerns will also allow you to use p tags exclusively for paragraphs.
