How sklearn logistic regression computes accuracy, recall etc if we don't provide threshold?

It might be a stupid question, but I just realized that calling score function on logistic regression model shouldn't make any sense - as far as I know in sklearn we cannot specify threshold for model.predict called during evaluation, so we might be using suboptimal threshold and thus accuracy doesn't tell much about the model. I know how to extract probs from model and try different thresholds on my own, but asking if there is any point of using accuracy as a metric in cross-validation etc?? I would use roc_auc instead every time.
