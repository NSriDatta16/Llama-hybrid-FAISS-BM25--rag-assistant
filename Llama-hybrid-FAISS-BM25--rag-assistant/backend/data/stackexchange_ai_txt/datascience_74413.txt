Ideas to check if a given sentence A is the response to a query B

I've a sentence 'A' which is a possible response to one of the x number of questions. I need to compare the response with each sentence to see which question's response sentence 'A' is or not a response at all. Any ideas on how to go about this. Pure nlp based solution will be helpful as there are no existing labelled data for the same.
