predict() - multinomial logistic regression

I come to you today because I face a huge problem that I cannot explain. I have run a multinomial logistic regression (using the mlogit package) on behavioral data. I prepare the data by doing mlogit on my Merge data. which gives me the following: Date Time ActivityX ActivityY Temp Behavior Valley Age Month Year kid Individual Choice 1.F 01/05/2012 00:00:00 80 58 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 TRUE 1.R 01/05/2012 00:00:00 80 58 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 1.M 01/05/2012 00:00:00 80 58 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 1.RUN 01/05/2012 00:00:00 80 58 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 2.F 01/05/2012 00:05:00 90 76 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 TRUE 2.R 01/05/2012 00:05:00 90 76 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 2.M 01/05/2012 00:05:00 90 76 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 2.RUN 01/05/2012 00:05:00 90 76 10 F Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 3.F 01/05/2012 00:10:00 51 47 10 M Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 3.R 01/05/2012 00:10:00 51 47 10 M Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 3.M 01/05/2012 00:10:00 51 47 10 M Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 TRUE 3.RUN 01/05/2012 00:10:00 51 47 10 M Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 4.F 01/05/2012 00:15:00 0 0 10 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 4.R 01/05/2012 00:15:00 0 0 10 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 TRUE 4.M 01/05/2012 00:15:00 0 0 10 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 4.RUN 01/05/2012 00:15:00 0 0 10 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 5.F 01/05/2012 00:20:00 0 0 9 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 5.R 01/05/2012 00:20:00 0 0 9 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 TRUE 5.M 01/05/2012 00:20:00 0 0 9 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE 5.RUN 01/05/2012 00:20:00 0 0 9 R Fuorn 8 5 2012 Y 26 FALSE then I ran my regression : m1 and it gave me significant results : Estimate Std. Error t-value Pr(>|t|) M:(intercept) -4.2153e-01 5.7533e-02 -7.3268 2.358e-13 *** R:(intercept) 6.2325e-01 3.4958e-02 17.8284 those results were in line with what I expected to find in literature so I was quite happy. My next step was to plot my results and here is when I have some trouble. First of all when I plot my original data and compare it with the result of my regression I find some huge differences. For example, when I plot the %of time spend in a behavior (M for moving, F for feeding, R for resting and Run for running, in my regression F is the reference) in function of age, I find that the older an individual gets, the more they will rest and the more they will move, but the estimates I got from my regression shows that they should rest more (when they get older) but move less. So to summarize, my graph on the original data shows the opposite as what I got from the regression. I don't know if it is normal, in the sense that I don't know if I can compare my original data to the result of my regression in a way that my regression shows the probability from switching to a behavior from an other each time my variable grows of one unit. So I wanted to use the predict() function but I don't know how to do that. I was hoping to get some help here.
