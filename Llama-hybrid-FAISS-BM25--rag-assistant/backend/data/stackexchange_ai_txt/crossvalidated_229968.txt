The usage of word "prior" in logistic regression with intercept only

Suppose I am fitting a logistic regression with intercept only, which is equivalent tho using the count to estimate the outcome probability and make prediction. Can I say following? We are using prior only to make the prediction. I think some persons from CV corrected me, that the word prior has close relationship with Bayesian statistics, and the statement is not correct. If it is not accurate, what should I say if we only use the counts to estimate the outcome probability?
