Does the advent of MultiCore architectures affect me as a software developer?

As a software developer dealing mostly with high-level programming languages I'm not sure what I can do to appropriately pay attention to the upcoming omni-presence of multicore computers. I write mostly ordinary and non-demanding applications, nevertheless I think it is important to know if I need to change any programming paradigms or even language to master the future. My question therefore: How to deal with increasing multicore presence in day-by-day hacking?
