Whenever we choose a component during PCA, it is ensured that we find the complete variance of the data on that particular component. If the 2nd component is not orthogonal to the 1st one, then the 2nd component will have some dependence on the 1st one. This means that the variance of the data on the 1st component hasn't been captured completely yet on the 1st component which is a contradiction! So each component needs to be orthogonal to the other components.
