Check if JSP fragment has been set

I came across the following tutorial JSP tricks to make templating easier? for using JSP to create page templates (how have I missed this for so long?!?). However, after doing some searching, I cannot seem to figure out how (or if it is possible) to check if a JSP fragment has been set. Here is an example of what I'm trying to do: I have a template named default.tag . It has 2 JSP attributes defined as follows: Then in the code of the page, I have the element of the page set to . Then later down the page, I have the following: Where I have , I want to be able to check if the heading fragment has been set in order to display it, but if not, then default to the title fragment.
