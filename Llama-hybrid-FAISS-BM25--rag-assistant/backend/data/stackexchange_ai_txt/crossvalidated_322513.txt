Additional insight can be gained by using probabilistic methods. Bayesian Point Machine for example will not only allow you to classify the examples but also provide uncertainty estimates for the predicted classes and the model parameters. If the uncertainty intervals are too broad, you have pretty good evidence that more data is needed. You can also play with dimensionality reduction and see which procedure works the best. E.g. try PCA to reduce feature space. Or LDA, a supervised variant. It may be useful to try to generate some data and see if it helps. This option is viable if there is an underlying process that you believe have generated your data.
