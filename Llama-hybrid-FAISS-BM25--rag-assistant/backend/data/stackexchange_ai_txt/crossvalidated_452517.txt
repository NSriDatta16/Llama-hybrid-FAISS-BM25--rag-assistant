How to interpret data from a PCA?

I'm learning about Principle Component Analysis and have read a couple good papers and a couple good articles one Medium.com. I can functionally perform it with just a little bit of python. However, what I thought I knew just got a little muddier as I attempted to understand the data when it is placed on the new PCA graph. For example let's say we have two variables X and Y, maybe height and weight, and a bunch of samples (individuals measured). On the original graph of these samples, we can see correlation between X and Y or lack thereof. That same correlation is shown, albeit somewhat rotated, so that the most variance is shown along the PC1 axis. Dropping the PC2 access may not cause us to lose much information, so we drop down to a 1-D line, containing our sample points stretched along it. But what does this 1-D line help us see? PC1 axis no longer means anything real, so how does it prove useful when I'm trying to get some insight into the data? I have read that this sort of thing is good for machine learning algorithms, in that it "cleans up" the data in some way, but I'm curious if there is any human readable benefit to doing this. For context, I'm better at understanding the underlying math, but know little about statistics. You may have to explain at a pretty low level.
