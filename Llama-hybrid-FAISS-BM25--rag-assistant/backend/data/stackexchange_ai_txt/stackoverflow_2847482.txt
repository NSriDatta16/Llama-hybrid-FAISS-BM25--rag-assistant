SVN Repository folders don't match my solution folder structure in Visual Studio or folder structure on disk

I have a .NET solution which was badly organised, so I moved some projects around to appropriate folders. In the solution, I simply fixed the paths to the new locations, and everything is working in my working copy. I used AnkhSVN to commit the solution to the repository, which worked out fine as well. However, when I look in the repo explorer, the folders inside are organised in the old way. What do I need to do?
