The second parameter to a jQuery call has to be an element, a document or a jQuery-object. You are sending in a string, so it doesn't fit any set of valid parameters. I'm not sure how jQuery reacts to the invalid parameters, but I think that it simply ignores the string and looks for the selector in the current document instead. Turn the string into elements by sending it to the jQuery function: content = $("#main", $(result)); Note that it turns the string into elements by creating a div element and set the string as innerHTML , so the string has to be an HTML fragment, not a complete HTML document.
