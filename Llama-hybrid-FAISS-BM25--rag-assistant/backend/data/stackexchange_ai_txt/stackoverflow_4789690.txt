As you have mentioned, cookies are an options and so is web storage in the HTML5 spec. There's also the ability to use Flash to store data with the added benefit that this data persists across multiple browsers on the same machine, but the drawback that you'll need a fallback for users who don't have Flash. Personally, keeping the data on the server (identified by the session id or cookie) would be my way to do it, you have control of the data and don't have to worry about losing it when the user clears their cache or switches machines/devices. It's also the most fault-tolerant because it doesn't rely on browser features and/or plugins (other than perhaps cookies). One more thing, if you're looking for an abstraction of client-side data storage that uses all of the above (cookies, flash, web storage) check out Evercookie
