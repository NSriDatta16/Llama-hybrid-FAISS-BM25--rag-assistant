Why does my loss value start at approximately -10,000 and my accuracy not improve?

I'm developing a multi-label classifier using the Keras library, but I am stuck with a relatively low accuracy of about 2% and my loss value per epoch is around -10,000 with little change between epoch. I'm relatively new to Keras but need to use it for my university work, and I am wondering what is going wrong. My model currently looks as follows: model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=X.shape[1:])) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(Dense(3, activation='sigmoid')) sgd = SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True) model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd, metrics=['accuracy']) model.fit(X, y, batch_size=20, epochs=100) In this case, the input_shape[1:] is 4096, a flattened feature array and the multi-label I'm trying to classify has a first value that ranges from 1 - 163, the second value ranges from 1 - 2000, and the third value ranges from 2007 - 2014. The issue that I am having is while running my model I get a result that does not change during each epoch as is shown below: I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I'll include how the features and the labels look below in respective order: [['0.0' ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ..., ' 5.7333' ' 0.0' ' 2.58643'] ['0.0' ' 3.12623' ' 0.0' ..., ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ' 2.93147'] ['0.0' ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ..., ' 7.49419' ' 0.0' ' 1.55746'] ['0.0' ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ..., ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ' 0.3666'] ['0.0' ' 4.67996' ' 0.0' ..., ' 0.0' ' 0.0' ' 0.0']] [['78' '1' '2010'] ['78' '1' '2010'] ['78' '1' '2014'] ['78' '1' '2013'] ['78' '1' '2012']] I'm at a loss of what to try and as I have mentioned, I'm new to Keras and deep learning so any help will be greatly appreciated.
