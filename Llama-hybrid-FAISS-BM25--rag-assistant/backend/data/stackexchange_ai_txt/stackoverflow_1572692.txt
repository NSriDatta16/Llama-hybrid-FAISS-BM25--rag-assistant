By chance are you seeing this with IE8 specifically? We've seen it show this behavior where caching was previously not an issue. Typically it can be cleared up with a couple steps: explicitly telling the browser not to cache via HTTP headers, and also expiring the page immediately. Google the "pragma no-cache" header, there is typically a couple of different lines you need to add to cover all browsers.
