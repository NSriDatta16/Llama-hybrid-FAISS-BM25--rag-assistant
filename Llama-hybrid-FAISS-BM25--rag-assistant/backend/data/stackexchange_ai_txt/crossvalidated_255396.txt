How can I conclude my model performance?

I use cross validation to find a best set of parameters for random forest on my dataset. Then I use the best model to fit my train set and got an average AUC of 0.6883. But I can see the variability of the AUC scores was significant, from 0.5113 to 0.8068. Can I claimed my model performance was 0.8068 (as what it achieved best) and use the corresponding model estimator to fit the test set for prediction?
