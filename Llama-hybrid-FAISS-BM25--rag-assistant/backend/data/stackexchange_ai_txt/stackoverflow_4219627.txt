perl's text::template module ... what is the closest match for php?

I love the Text::Template module for Perl and HTML. It allows me to keep my HTML separate from my logic and I can use Dreamweaver to continually maintain the HTML design. Don't be mislead by the name Text::Template, it is not like Smarty . Text::Template is a more elegant and simpler solution than the Smarty philosophy. I think the TinyButStrong template engine may be the answer to my own question, but I welcome your feedback.
