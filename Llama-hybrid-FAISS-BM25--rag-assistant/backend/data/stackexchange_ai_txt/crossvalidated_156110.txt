The approach termed "Type 1" is already explored in the paper by Blei et al. (2003) http://jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf in ยง7.2. The result is that this approach is valuable in feature selection for the SVM. So "Type 1" is definitely one right way . I have no comments "Type 2" except that it lacks the clarity that "Type 1" has.
