Very good question. But based on what, do you claim "this should be the exact same scenario"? An observation (assuming the last WLOG) with a weight of 2, mathematically, means that the disturbance for that observation carries half of the variance. Suppose some higher being offers you a deal where you could have the opportunity to get an extra observation but both the old last and the new observation would get the regular variance. Would you take this deal? The answer is yes, as there is more information under the new deal. You would do no worse just by taking the average of both x and y over the old last and the new extra. But there is also intra-variability of data between them that carries information (and this is the extra information). Now suppose you take the deal and, by miracle, the new observation happens to coincide with old last in terms of x and y. Then there is no intra-variability extra information in this particular case (or this particular point in the sample space, if you want to be technical). Then the new point estimate would not change. But the new estimator is indeed more accurate and should have a smaller standard error, in the classical statistical sense (i.e. frequencist sense across all the "parallel universes", or sample points, that could have been). Edit: The above attempted answer, trying to explain intuitively why the OLS/GLS formulae would indicate that two observations with regular variance is more informative than a single observation with half of the variance, is flawed. My claim, that you "can do no worse" by taking the average (and throwing away the extra information), is wrong. The informational value of an observation increases with a smaller disturbance variance, but also decreases with a smaller variance on the independent variable. So smoothing over the two observations would indeed halve the disturbance variance but would also make the independent variable less insightful. So, if you throw away the extra intra-variability information (e.g. differences within the Xs and Ys), you would be strictly worse off than the original situation of a single observation with half of the variance. My further attempt to repair this, by utilizing the extra intra-variability information, so far just becomes an alternate way to derive those OLS/WOLS formulae and is no more intuitive than the formulae themselves. I will think about this more later. Sorry.
