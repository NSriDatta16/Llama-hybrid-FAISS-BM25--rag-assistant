A bit of an odd way to approach Cocoa. I would encourage you to step back, learn Objective-C and then write your application with an Objective-C based Cocoa UI layer on top of whatever backing store or model layer you have. In any case, there isn't anything particularly wrong with that code (save for the odd design). The first thing to check is the return value of -initWithWindowNibName:. Is errorWindowControl actually non-nil? If it is nil, then the NIB failed to load. How are you writing the Cocoa application itself? Standard app bundle using Xcode, I hope? Also, you shouldn't be hardcoding the path to /Library/Application Support/. Actually, your application shouldn't use that directory as the only storage location; many users won't have write access to that directory and won't be able to install your app without administrator access.
