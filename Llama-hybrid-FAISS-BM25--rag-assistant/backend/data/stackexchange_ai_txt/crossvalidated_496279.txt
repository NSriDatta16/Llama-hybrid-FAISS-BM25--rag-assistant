Particularly for your question, a way of doing that is converting audios to spectrograms using FFT, then train a convolutional neural network. See a somehow old paper . And if you search spectrogram on GitHub, you can find tons of its applications in audio related problems like human speech recognition. For getting decent predictions, you'll need more sophisticated methods and larger datasets. More generally, recommender systems are now indispensable for popular apps, like YouTube, Spotify, Tweeter, TikTok, Amazon and many more. I personally find that YouTube can fit my taste of music and videos quite well. You can find massive resources about it, from basics to bleeding-edge researches.
