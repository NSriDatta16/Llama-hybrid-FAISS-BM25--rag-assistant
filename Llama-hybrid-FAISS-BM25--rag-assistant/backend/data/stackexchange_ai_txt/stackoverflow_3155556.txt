vb.net how to handle text dragged onto a button to open a new form with the dragged text directly copied to the richtextbox on the new form?

I want to achieve the following: The user drags text from any open window not related to my application ( like firefox or word, for example) onto button1 on form1 in my application. when he/she does that, a new form (called form2 that contains a richtextbox) will open and the dragged text is directly copied (or inserted) into the richtextbox of the new form. button1 has allowdrop set to true. Beyond that I don't know how to proceed. I tried: e.effects = DragDropEffects.Copy But it seems it is not enough. Could you help please? Thanks
