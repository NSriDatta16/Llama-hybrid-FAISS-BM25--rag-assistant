I second the use of a cryptographic hash—taking bits from MD5 is very simple. To make things readable, I hit on the following idea: take a list of words, and use bits of the key to index a list of words. My word list is about 100 000 words, so about 16 bits per word, which for four words gives a 64-bit keyspace. The results are usually quite readable. For example, the cryptographic signature of the preceding paragraph is kamikaze's freshet mansion's expectorating (My word list is tilted toward a larger keyspace; if you want shorter phrases, you have fewer words.) If you have an MD5 library handy, this strategy is very easy to implement—I do it in about 40 lines of Lua.
