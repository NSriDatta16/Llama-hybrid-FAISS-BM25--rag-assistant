If you want something quick and dirty, you can just add a Thread.sleep() call within your while loop. If the database library is something you can't change, then there is really no other easy solution. Polling the database until is ready with a wait period won't kill the performance. while (!dbthread.isReady()) { Thread.sleep(250); } Hardly something that you could call elegant code, but gets the work done. In case you can modify the database code, then using a mutex as proposed in other answers is better.
