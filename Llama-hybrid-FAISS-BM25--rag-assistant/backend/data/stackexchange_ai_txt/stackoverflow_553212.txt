1) If you're using the table as a queue, you're using the wrong tool for the job. Tables are sets of inherently unordered data. This is because 2) Rows can be ordered based on the value of any of their fields. This means that you can "insert" something in the middle by adding the row with a value (typically the ID) that has a value which will precede the other rows in the table. Why are you using a database table to do this? You're clearly looking for a priority queue. If you're doing it because you want the jobs that are being processed to persist if the software fails, consider adding all items, with their priority, to the table, but then taking them out and inserting them into an appropriate priority queue in the software, decoupling your data storage from your scheduling mechanism.
