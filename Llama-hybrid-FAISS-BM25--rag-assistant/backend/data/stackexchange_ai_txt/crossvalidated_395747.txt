Should Principal Component Analysis (PCA) axes always be from 1 to -1?

I see a lot of talks/papers where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scatter plots have axes that go from numbers OTHER than -1 to 1. I thought that for PCA, the data MUST be unit variance transformed and mean-centered, which should always produce axes that vary from -1 to 1. When people show scatter plots that have points at values like -4,3 or 15,-2 does this mean that they did not properly perform the PCA?
