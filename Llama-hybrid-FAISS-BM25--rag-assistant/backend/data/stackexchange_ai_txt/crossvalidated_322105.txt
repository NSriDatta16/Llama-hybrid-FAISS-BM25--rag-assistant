How to overcome outliers on time series data?

How to overcome outliers on time series data? Is there any reference mentioning that to analyze seasonal time series data outliers shouldn't exist? If I use SAS 9.3, the Bartlett statistics showed no seasonal period. If I use JDEMetra+ (without considering any outlier), it showed that there is a seasonal trend but no period. Any suggestion for what I should do next?
