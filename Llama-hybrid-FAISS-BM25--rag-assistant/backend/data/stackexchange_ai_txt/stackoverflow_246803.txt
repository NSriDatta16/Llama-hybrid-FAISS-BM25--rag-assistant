What's the best way to detect that Adobe Acrobat Reader is installed from a browser?

What's the best way to detect that Adobe Acrobat Reader is installed from a web browser? I'm assuming it would have to be done on the client-side (I don't think Adobe adds any user-agent strings). Preferably in JavaScript and in Internet Explorer, although it would be nice if it could also be done in FireFox, Safari, etc...
