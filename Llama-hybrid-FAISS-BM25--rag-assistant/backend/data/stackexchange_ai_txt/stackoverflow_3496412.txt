Embeddable Cross-Platform Web Browser?

I'm wondering if there is a Web Browser that I can embed in my Applications and that is cross-Platform (Windows, OS X, Linux)? I'm undecided about the programming language, but I guess I'll have to go the C++ route (in which case I'd likely choose Qt as a GUI Framework) unless something for .net/mono or Java exists? Doesn't need to be too fancy, but should ideally be free/open source. I know I could just grab the WebKit sources, but these are HUGE, and I wonder if they are really intended for embedding or if there is a browser that is already embeddable? It does not have to be the latest and greatest, although Ogg Theora support would be excellent (or at least some way for me to add it)
