Look here , half way down the page it says: Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast because the row data is on the same page where the index search leads. If a table is large, the clustered index architecture often saves a disk I/O operation when compared to storage organizations that store row data using a different page from the index record. (For example, MyISAM uses one file for data rows and another for index records.) speed sounds like an excellent reason to me .. or am missing your point? The advantage of the clustered index is that it can be accessed (and thus searched through) with fewer io operations than 'normal' indexes. Knowing this you can optimize your DB accesses and thus your application, by placing the clustered index where it will benefit you most.
