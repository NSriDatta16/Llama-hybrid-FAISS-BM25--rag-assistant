This is due to how OpenGL default fixed function pipeline implements lighting: Lighting is evaluated only at the vertices, the resulting colour interpolated over the surface. If your whole table consists of just one large quad, exactly this happens. Solution 1: Subdivide the mesh to a high degree. Solution 2: Replace fixed function lighting with a per-fragment-illumination shader.
