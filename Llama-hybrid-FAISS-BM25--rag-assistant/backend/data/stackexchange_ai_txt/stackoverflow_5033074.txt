After starting the drag action, the motion event won't be dispatched as a normal mouse drag event. During the dragging, a DragSourceDragEvent is fired when the mouse moves. The following example will print "DRAGMOUSEMOVED" when the red area is dragged. Just paste the source below into your constructor. The DragSourceDragEvent has most of the MouseEvent methods, so it should be a good alternative. DragSource.getDefaultDragSource().addDragSourceMotionListener(new DragSourceMotionListener() { @Override public void dragMouseMoved(DragSourceDragEvent dsde) { System.out.println("DRAGMOUSEMOVED"); } });
