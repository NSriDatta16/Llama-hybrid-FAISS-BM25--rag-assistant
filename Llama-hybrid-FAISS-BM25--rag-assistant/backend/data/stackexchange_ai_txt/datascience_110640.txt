If I understand you correctly, you have several univariate time series, that you want to stack into a multi-variate one, but cannot do so because they have different length. I think you might find this guide on masking and padding to be a useful starting point. In your case I think masking is a must have as you will have batches when one or more series needs to be padded. An alternative is to train an imputer model first, to impute missing time series from those that are left.
