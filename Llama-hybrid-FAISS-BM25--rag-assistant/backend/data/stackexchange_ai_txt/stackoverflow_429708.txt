To count the number of rows is also possible (see Pourquoi Litytestdata) but you can also do what you want to do in the when_no_data_found exception block. declare l_selected apex_application_global.vc_arr2; l_county_id org_county_accountable.count_id%type; begin l_selected := apex_util.string_to_table(:p4_select_lst); for i in l_selected.first..l_selected.last loop begin select count_id into l_county_id from org_county_accountable where organization_id = :p4_id and county_id = v_county_id; exception when no_data_found then -- here we have code we only want to execute if there are no dupes already -- if not a duplicate record, proceed... end; end loop; end;
