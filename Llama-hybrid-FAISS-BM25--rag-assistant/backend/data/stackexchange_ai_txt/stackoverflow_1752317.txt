How to get the true URL of a file on the web. (Python)

I notice that sometimes audio files on the internet have a "fake" URL. http://garagaeband.com/3252243 And this will 302 to the real URL: http://garageband.com/michael_jackson4.mp3 My question is...when supplied with the fake URL, how can you get the REAL URL from headers ? Currently, this is my code for reading the headers of a file. I don't know if this code will get me what I want to accomplish. How do I parse out the "real" URL From the response headers? import httplib conn = httplib.HTTPConnection(head) conn.request("HEAD",tail) res = conn.getresponse() This has a 302 redirect: http://www.garageband.com/mp3cat/.UZCMYiqF7Kum/01_No_pierdas_la_fuente_del_gozo.mp3
