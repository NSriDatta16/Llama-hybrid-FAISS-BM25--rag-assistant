You should be able to set the port you call out on when you initialize the socket. I wish i could be less vague, but it depends on what socket implementation you are using. For example ( from the .NET framework ): public: void Bind( EndPoint^ localEP ) Used with the accompanying IPEndpoint class, public: IPEndPoint( IPAddress^ address, int port ) Will allow you to set your bind your socket to any local endpoint you wish. Optionally you may set the port to zero to have it automatically assigned to you. There is also an option to have the IPAddress set to INADDR_ANY, which is discouraged.
