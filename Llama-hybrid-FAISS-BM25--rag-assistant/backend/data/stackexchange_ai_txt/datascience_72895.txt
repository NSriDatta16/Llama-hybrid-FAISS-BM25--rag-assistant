Which ML classifier is appropriate for me if all of my features are categorical?

My dataset contains four features. All of the features are categorical. There are 150 categories in the value of 1st and 2nd features. There are 8 categories in the value of 3rd and 4th feature. I replaced the categories with numeric values and applied Random forest. However, performance is not still up to the mark. What other Machine Learning Classification algorithms I can try?
