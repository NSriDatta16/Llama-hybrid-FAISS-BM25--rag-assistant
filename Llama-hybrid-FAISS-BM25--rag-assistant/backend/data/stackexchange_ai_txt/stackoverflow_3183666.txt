You can use an explicit IP number to connect to a specific machine by embedding that into the URL: http://127.0.0.1/index.html is equivalent to http://localhost/index.html That said, it isn't a good idea to use IP numbers instead of DNS entries. IPs change a lot more often than DNS entries, meaning your script has a greater chance of breaking if you hard-code the address instead of letting it resolve normally.
