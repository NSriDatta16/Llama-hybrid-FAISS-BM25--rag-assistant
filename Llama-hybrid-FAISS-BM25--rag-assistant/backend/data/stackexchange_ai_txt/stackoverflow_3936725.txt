Ok, so this is my new solution. Basically, we just set the IMG element to be a block-level element. img { display:block; } This solution does not introduce any new markup. (You just place the element right after the text in the paragraph / list item.) I believe this to be the most elegant solution, since setting images to be blocks is rather common anyway.
