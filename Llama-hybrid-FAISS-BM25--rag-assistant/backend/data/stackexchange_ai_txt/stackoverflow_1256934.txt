You may already know that the cvv2 is used in an avs/csc check that is done by taking the numerics from the customers address, the numerics from the post/zipcode and the numbers from the cvv2 and comparing them with known values held by the card issuer. The result of the avs/csc check returns a three digit value which lets you know whether the address/cvv2 values match those held on file by the card issuer. The result of this check can then be used to help prevent fraudulent transactions. Therefore a common way to tackle the issue of not being able to store the actual cvv2 code is instead to store the cvv2 result . This way you can be fairly confident that so long as the address hasnt been altered, the card is still valid. The only downside to this approach is that some acquiring banks deem that authorizations performed without a cvv2 check are insecure, and charge a higher interchange rate. You may need to discuss this with your acquirer to explain that only the first authorization is performed with cvv2 check, and subsequent ones are not. All said though, you will find PCI compliance a lot easier if you instead use a service provider that allows you to hold token values rather than actual card numbers. Another issue with recurring payments that I'm not sure if you've considered is the fact that over time cards will expire, be cancelled or re-issued. Visa and MasterCard both have a relatively new service called the Visa Account Updater or MasterCard Automatic Billing Updater to handle this. Its something you'd need to organise with your acquiring bank, or if you go the PSP route it will probably be handled automatically - but worth checking.
