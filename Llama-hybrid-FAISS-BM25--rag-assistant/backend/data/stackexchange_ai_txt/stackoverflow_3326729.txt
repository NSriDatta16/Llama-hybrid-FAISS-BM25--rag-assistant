How to determine statistical significance using T-Test in Excel?

I have two groups of data sets, A and B. I would like to know weither the average value of A significantly differs then B's average. How to do that in Excel 2007? (I know there's a TTEST formula in excel, I also know I don't need to use the paired version of it, what other parameters do I need to set and how to interpert the result?) Thanks, Jon
