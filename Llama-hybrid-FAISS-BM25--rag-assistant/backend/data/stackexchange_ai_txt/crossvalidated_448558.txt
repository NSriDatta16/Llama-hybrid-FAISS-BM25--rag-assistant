Book on decision theory

I am from physics background. I know basics about statistics (upto 'Statistical Inference - Casella'). I came across some articles talking about terms like 'reciever operating characteristics curve', 'True-positive, True-negative, False-positive, and False-negative'. I want to understand those concepts from basics to do some calculations for the present project that I am working. I have read the section on 'Decision Theory' from Introduction chapter of Bishop's book 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning'. I need a little detailed reading. Not so theoretical and small in volume. Which book will be great?
