Xcode 4 -- "no provisioned iOS device is connected" with iPod touch 2

I have two iPod touches. One is 2nd generation running iOS 4.2.1, and the other is 4th generation, running iOS 4.3. I have the same provisioning profile installed on both of them. My app runs just fine on the 4th generation device. With the 2nd generation one, when I look at my device in the organizer, everything looks fine, there is a green dot next to the device, and it shows that the profile is installed. But when I try to run the app, I get the above error. The deployment target for my app is iOS 4.0. As of a week ago, I was using Xcode 3, and everything worked fine. Over the past week, I upgraded to Xcode 4, and also had to update the profile, as the old one expired. I did install the new profile on both devices -- and the above situation ensued. Incidentally, if you are a new developer and you arrived at this question, I suspect your problem is different from mine. This question has been answered in the generic form many times before; several of them are linked from here . I've tried reinstalling the profile and also restarting both my device and computer. No luck.
