Any recommendations on a way to find what aspx files use what CSS class

Any recommendations on a way to find what aspx files use what CSS class. Right now I have one gigantic css files and I would like to break it up into a more organized fashion simply for sake of maintainibility. I was wondering if anything existed that could yield a report such as this css class is used in file1.aspx, file2.aspx, etc... I guess I could write a little script to do this, but if there were any free apps out there already written, that'd be swell.
