Android - how to avoid memory over load using bitmaps?

My application is using bitmaps and every time the user come to the specific activity where it shows an image the second time it stops working. Bitmap bm = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"//Pics/"Image.jpg"); I have tried using things like... BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options(); options.inTempStorage = new byte[16*1024]; Not sure what to set it too. But this doesnt help. Once the user leaves this activity is there not a way to clear the bitmap etc? thanks
