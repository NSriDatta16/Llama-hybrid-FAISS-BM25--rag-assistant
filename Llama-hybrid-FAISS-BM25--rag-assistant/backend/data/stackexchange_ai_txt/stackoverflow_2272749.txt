Remove spacing after paragraph in Word 2007 with VSTO

I am creating and populating a Word 2007 table in C#. When I view the result in Word, each cell has extra vertical space appended after the text. In Word this can be adjusted through the "page layout"/Paragraph/Spacing, where the initial value is 10pt. --------------------------------------------------- | Text... | Text.... | More text... | | | | | How can this be changed using VSTO? I have tried to record a macro, hoping for some answers in the VB code - it didn't seem to respond to the changing of the spacing value. I haven't been able to find anything related in the VSTO documentation on MSDN. Edit: Using a Word template, I can mark the area I'm populating and set the spacing to 0. It is then inherited through my table - thus it works for now. But still, it would be nice to be able to control the spacing from C# and not rely on inheritance in Word.
