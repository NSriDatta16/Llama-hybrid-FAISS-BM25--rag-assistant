How to incorporate keyboard positions on character level embeddings?

I am working with NLP and have character level embeddings . I have embeddings learned from Wikipedia text. Now, I want to learn embeddings from chat data (where misspellings and abbreviations are way more common). Usually, the character n doesn't follow from character b , however, during texting, this can be common because they are close together on the keyboard , and a misspelling occurs. So, my questions is: what are strategies to incorporate character keyboard position information to a traditional character level embedding? Note: it can be assumed that only QWERTY keyboards exist.
