You can calculate them in O(n) (in single pass) by using following recursive formula: An means n-th minute average, Vn - n-th minute price. An = (An-1 * (n - 1) + Vn) / n So you loop and keep previous An . PS : If i understood you correctly you want to find average of prices for every minute, not single average.
