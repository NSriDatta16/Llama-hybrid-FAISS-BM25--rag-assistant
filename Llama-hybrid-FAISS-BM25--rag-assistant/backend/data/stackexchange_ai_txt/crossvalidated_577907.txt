You say you got the comment: In your regression analyses you mix variables that were assessed on 5 point Likert scales with the metric age variable. This approach is not appropriate! ... and then no further reason. I simply do not understand where this comes from, and you should ask for a reason! They might simply mean that using an ordinal variable (Likert) as if numerical is inappropriate, but that should not depend on the further use of a metric variable like age. Maybe see Binomial logistic regression with multiple Likert-scale (ordinal) predictors Is it acceptable to use linear regression to predict a 4 point likert scale from a 7 point likert scale?
