Following the advice of www.Flextras.com's answer , I kept the generated Actionscript classes and had a look. The code inside tags is simply put in the class body as-is. Knowing that, I could dig into the Flex livedocs and came across the following paragraph in the section about class definitions : ActionScript 3.0 allows you to include not only definitions in a class body, but also statements. Statements that are inside a class body, but outside a method definition, are executed exactly once--when the class definition is first encountered and the associated class object is created. So, putting statements inside a tag in an MXML file is equivalent to putting code in a static block in a Java class definition.
