I don't buy it. These OOP zealots seem to have machines that have infinite RAM and amazing performance. Obviously with inifinite RAM you don't have to worry about RAM fragmentation and the performance impacts that has when you continuously create and destroy small helper classes. To paraphrase a quote for the 'Beautiful Code' book - "Every problem in Computer Science can be solved with another level of abstraction" Use a switch if you need it. Compilers are pretty good at generating code for them.
