Drag and drop into a browser application

We have a browser based application written in PHP in which I want to drag-n-drop files from the windows explorer or directly email attachments(this would be very cool). On dropping the files in the browser application, it should save it on a particular folder on the server. Any help on how this can be achieved would be really appreciated.
