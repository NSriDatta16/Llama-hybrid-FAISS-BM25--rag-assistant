Question about bayesian theory with mixed discrete and continuous variables

For Bayes' rule, $P(a|x)=\frac{P(x|a)P(a)}{P(x)}=\frac{P(x|a)P(a)}{P(x|a)P(a)+P(x|a^c)P(a^c)}$, if we have $P(x|a)$ and $P(a)$ are discrete (e.g. both equal to 0.5), and $P(x|a^c)$ is continuous (e.g uniform(0,1)), could I just set $P(x|a^c)=1$? If not, how could calculate $P(a|x)$?
