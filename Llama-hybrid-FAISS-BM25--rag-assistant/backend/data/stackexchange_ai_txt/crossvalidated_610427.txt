How to estimate survival probabilities by assessing covariates in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model?

I'm working through the examples for Cox proportional hazard models provided in http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-proportional-hazards-model , and I am on the last example labeled " Visualizing the estimated distribution of survival times ". When I run the code posted at the bottom (garnered from the link), I get the output shown immediately below which matches the plot provided in the link. All the link says in explanation is " Consider that, we want to assess the impact of the sex on the estimated survival probability. In this case, we construct a new data frame with two rows, one for each value of sex; the other covariates are fixed to their average values (if they are continuous variables) or to their lowest level (if they are discrete variables). For a dummy covariate, the average value is the proportion coded 1 in the data set. This data frame is passed to survfit() via the newdata argument: ". Is there a better, simple, "plain English" way to describe what is being presented in the plot? On the surface, I get "assess the impact of the sex on the estimated survival probability" but that seems incomplete: why all the computational gyrations through multivariate analysis, fixing other covariates to their average values, and identifying/coding dummy (confounding) variables?
