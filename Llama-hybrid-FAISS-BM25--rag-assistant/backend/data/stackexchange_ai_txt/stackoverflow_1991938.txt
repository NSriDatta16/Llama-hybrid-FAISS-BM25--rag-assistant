I haven't tried this (as I'm anti-RDBMS and thus anti-ORM as well), but one solution might be to use OSGi fragments. Create a fragment that contains your domain classes and specify the Hibernate bundle as the host. This fragment should export the packages of your domain classes. Likewise, you can do the same thing for the JDBC driver you want to use. Take the driver classes and turn them in to an OSGi fragment with Hibernate as the host bundle. However, you don't have to export the driver's packages since they are only going to be used by the Hibernate bundle. I suspect fragments weren't supported in full by Felix 9 months ago, but they certainly are now it seems: http://osgithoughts.blogspot.com/2009/09/felix-now-fully-supports-osgi-fragments.html
