Comment blocks around JSON responses

I've noticed that some web applications return AJAX responses with JSON data embedded within a comment block. For example, this would be a sample response: /*{ "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith", "address": { "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street", "city": "New York", "state": "NY", "postalCode": 10021 }, "phoneNumbers": [ "212 555-1234", "646 555-4567" ]} */ What is the benefit of embedding the JSON data in a comment block? Is there some sort of security exploit which is avoided by doing this?
