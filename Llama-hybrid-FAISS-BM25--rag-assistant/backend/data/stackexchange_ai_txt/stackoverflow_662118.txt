Thanks everyone for your suggestions, they were indeed very useful! I ended up using a Naive Bayesian classifier, which I borrowed from here . I started by feeding it with a list of good/bad keywords and then added a "learn" feature by employing user feedback. It turned out to work pretty nice. The full details of my work as in a blog post . Again, your help was very useful, so thank you!
