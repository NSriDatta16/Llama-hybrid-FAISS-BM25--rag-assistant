IMO, if I understood correctly, you are asking for a definition of Composition vs. Aggregation. Aggregation or holding is a collection of entities. Composition has a tighter constraint. Think of average marks awarded to student: when we compute an average, we cannot exclude any item. Composition is similar to this. No item can be missed out. Aggregation on the other hand is more loosely defined. An interesting analogy would be that of a quiver full of arrows and a car. A quiver is an Aggregation of arrows, quiver can exist without arrows; Car is an Composition (Sum of parts). And lets not argue that a car without a wheel is still a car :) As for references: http://www.bletchleypark.net/algorithms/software/oop.html
