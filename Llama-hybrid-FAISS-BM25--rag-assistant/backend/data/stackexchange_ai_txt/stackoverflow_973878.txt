Visual Studio 2010 is making these kinds of scenarios significantly easier with the Asynchronous Agents Library. You can take a look at the walkthroughs in documentation here , but here's some not so pseudo-code: //somewhere stateful, e.g. main unbounded_buffer buff; //thread 1 { //send a message asynchronously to the buffer asend(&buff,stringtype("hello world"); } //thread 2 { //get the message out of the buffer //if this is a UI thread, receive is blocking so use try_receive which isn't stringtype message = receive(&buff) } If I was doing this with today's toolset, I would use a threadsafe queue.
