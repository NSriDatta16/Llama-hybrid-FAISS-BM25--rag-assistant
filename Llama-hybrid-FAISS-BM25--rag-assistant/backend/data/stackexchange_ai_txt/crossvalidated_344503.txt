As some of the comments already have pointed out, there is at least one wrong assumption. Regarding The theory being then that the difference between the real experiment image and the experiment image reconstructed using the reference eigenvectors should highlight the feature we're interested in. The theory is not solid. The PC are a valid basis by which every point of a hyperplane can be described. If you compute the PC (by PCA) on a certain dataset, especially to reduce the dimensionality, you might end up with a minimal set that doesn't reflect the full dimensionality. You might actually want this, otherwise the dimensionality will not be reduced. If you now add a feature, which is in another dimension (e.g. not present in the data you used to evaluate the PC), then there is no general rule what will happen. It might not show a difference at all, it might show a different scaling of the EVs. Consider for example a reduced dimensionality: take a 2D world (a plane), if you have certain points, then you might find the best representation of a basis. If you take other 2D points in the same plane, they're represented differently in that basis. But if you add a point outside that plane -- what is its description in that basis?
