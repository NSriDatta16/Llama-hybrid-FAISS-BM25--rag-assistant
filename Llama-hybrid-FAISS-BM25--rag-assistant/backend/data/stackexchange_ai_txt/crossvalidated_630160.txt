Why do Z-tests use standard error (using the know population standard deviation) and not only standard deviation?

I understand why a T-test uses the standard error, after all we are dealing with the inaccuracy of small samples. $$T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\bar{s} / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE} $$ But why does Z-tests also uses standard error (calculated using the population standard deviation (sigma))? $$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$ I ask this because I thought standardization for normal distributions (not student`s T distribution) was done subtracting the average and dividing by the mean... In this case, the Z-Test formula doesnt make sense to me. That would be the formula for normalization/standardization: $$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma }$$ No? I don ` t get it.
