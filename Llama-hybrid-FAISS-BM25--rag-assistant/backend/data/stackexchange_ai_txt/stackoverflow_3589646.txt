2 part CSS "wallpaper" that resizes to browser

My designer believes this cannot be done, however it seems possible to me. (Although I have limited CSS experience). However, he also said the background couldn't be fixed, and stackoverflow has proved his wrong in the past; so I question his knowledge. JQuery can be used if this cannot be done in pure CSS. The top half will be a gradient that has full flexible to skew left, right, up, down without much distortion. The bottom half is an image that is ideally made for the 1280 x 1024 resolution (as this is the most popular browser display resolution). Then depending on the requirements needed it will sketch and skew to whatever size it needs. Still allowing all of the image to be seen. The ration between the top half and bottom half is always 50% 50% independent of browser resolution. I would also like if both the top and bottom parts are fixed. In a perfect world (one without IE), id like to do this with css3 gradients and multiple backgrounds in 1 DIV. However, because IE9 isnt out yet, I think the best way to approach it would be 2 divs in a DIV container and using a PNG repeating background for the top div. It should be noted I am going to use css3pie.com to allow some CSS3 for IE6-8 (but I dont want to rely on it, unless 100% proven) Is this possible with just CSS? How would you do it? If not possible with just CSS, is there a way I can get JavaScript/JQuery to aid? I am thinking a base of 1280 x 1024 isn't the best idea because it seems to have an odd radio. Edit 1 Oh yeah, I have a WIP too: http://meyers.ipalaces.org/extra/ It looks good in 1280 x 1024...now its just getting the whole resizing of the top DIV to be 50% so the image is 50%. I'd still like ALL of the water to be seen, because I like the look of the rocks at the bottom. However, I am open to alternative ideas that don't accomplish what I want 100%, but come close. Edit 2 How about using the top gradient as the true CSS2 background and then just putting a at the bottom of it to resize? Perhaps that will allow for CSS2 ability. I am reference some work-around techniques here: A list apart Edit 3 I am still looking for results that work on IE6 and also don't cause Internet explorer to lag. I am setting a bounty of 50 to help attract more attention.
