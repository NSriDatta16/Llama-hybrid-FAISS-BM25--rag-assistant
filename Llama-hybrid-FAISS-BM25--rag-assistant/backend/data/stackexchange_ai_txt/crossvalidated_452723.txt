It really depends on what $s$ is. We call $p(s \vert \theta)$ the likelihood . To do Bayesian inference with pen and paper, the likelihood has to have a specific form (in particular, it has to be Gaussian -- well, it doesn't HAVE to be, but it makes things easier than if it weren't). That question you linked to does a good job of explaining the updating when the likelihood is Gaussian. In the case it is not Gaussian, we have to resort to some computational methods, which are not relevant at this time. I'm also going to be a bit pedantic for a moment. $p(s\vert \theta)$ is only a scalar when you know $\theta$ . Since you don't know theta, then $p(s\vert \theta)$ is not a scalar; it is a probability distribution parameterized by $\theta$ . So, your conceptualization of the problem (namely, that $p(s\vert \theta)$ and $p(s)$ are just scalars) is flawed. This is likely where the misunderstanding is stemming from.
