An MDP (markov decision process) or POMDP (partially observable MDP) are two popular mathematical abstractions which are used to describe how an agent interacts with the environment. Almost all games or tasks can be formulated as either an MDP or a POMDP. Therefore, when people develop RL algorithms, they don't design them for a specific game or environment. Instead, RL algorithms are usually designed for a general class of problems (say, MDPs with unknown dynamics). Multiple screens or interfaces, and the controls to move between them doesn't pose any new challenge, because they can be pretty easily added onto the environment in the (PO)MDP framework. So fundamentally, there is nothing that needs to be changed.
