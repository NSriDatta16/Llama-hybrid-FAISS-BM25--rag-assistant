I believe this is called hierarchical classification and has been studied. One approach is to use multi-task learning - i.e. use a decision tree or neural net in order to try and take the hierarchical information into account. For instance if you use a neural network, you could have your outputs be the fine class labels as well as the coarse labels. Then, as in mult-task learning, the latent features that will develop in the hidden layer will benefit both tasks - these features may not develop otherwise. This will only work though if there is some "common information" shared between the fine labels of a coarser class.
