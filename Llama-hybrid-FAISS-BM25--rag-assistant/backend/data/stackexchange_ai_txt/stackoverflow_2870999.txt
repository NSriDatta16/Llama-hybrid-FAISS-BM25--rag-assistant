It depends on your model. Both cases are valid but I'd discorage making a circular relationships like that. Having a hierarchy is more flexible. For example: User->Favorites->Tags (unless you want to tag users as well) User.favorites.find(params[:id]).update_attributes(param[:favorite]) is what you mean I guess (syntax). Whoever calls the URL will perform that action. Dont rely on the fact that that URL is visible to one user only (owner of the favorite). You should have checks in place that the currently logged in user is the only one performing actions on the objects that belong to him.
