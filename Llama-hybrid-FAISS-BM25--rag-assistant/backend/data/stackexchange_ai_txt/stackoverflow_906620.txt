Jstack and Not enough storage is available to process this command

I'm trying to run jstack command on my java application. Application is rather big, running inside jboss AS occupying about 4gb of memory. OS is Windows Server 2003 Standard edition. Every time i get an error "Not enough storage is available to process this command". There is enough ram, 16gb, and disk space. So, any ideas?
