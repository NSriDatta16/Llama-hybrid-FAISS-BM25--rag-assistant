A relatively unknown but very useful nonparametric substitute for two-way ANOVA with replication (must be balanced ANOVA) is the Schierer-Ray-Hare test. It is an extension of the Kruskal-Wallis test. Do it this way: Replace each data observation with its overall rank (lowest number is ranked 1 and tied observations are all given the average rank) Run the two-way ANOVA as usual with the ranks instead of the actual data values. Discard the MS, F, and p value terms in the ANOVA output. Sum SS for SS factors, SS interaction, and SS error. Divide this sum by df total. The result is MS total. The test statistic, H, for each factor and interaction equals its SS / MS total The Excel formula for the p value for each is: CHIDIST(H, df) . The df is the usual df for each factor and interaction. The Excel output provides these df figures. The Schierer-Ray-Hare test is a lot less powerful that regular two-way ANOVA. The p values are usually around twice as large on the SRH test as those generated by two-factor ANOVA.
