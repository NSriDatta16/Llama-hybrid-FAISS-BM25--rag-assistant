What makes the Gaussian kernel so magical for PCA, and also in general?

I was reading about kernel PCA ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) with Gaussian and polynomial kernels. How does the Gaussian kernel separate seemingly any sort of nonlinear data exceptionally well? Please give an intuitive analysis, as well as a mathematically involved one if possible. What is a property of the Gaussian kernel (with ideal $\sigma$) that other kernels don't have? Neural networks, SVMs, and RBF networks come to mind. Why don't we put the norm through, say, a Cauchy PDF and expect the same results?
