CTL vs normal distribition of residuals

Hello, I submitted a study with a linear regression model. My sample size is >1000, so I invoked CTL. The statistics reviewer is requesting that we check assumptions of normal distribution (specifically normal distribution of errors), and if not met, he/she recommends that we switch to logistic regression using one of our binary predictors as the outcome. The residuals of my original model are NOT normally distributed per Shapiro Wilks (see picture). The skewness and kurtosis are 1 and 4.5, respectively. The suggested logistic regression shows no significant predictions. I also tried linear regression with outcome transformed to square root, with minimal "improvement" in skewness and kurtosis (0.8 and 2.5, respectively, but still non-normal per Shapiro Wilks). Can I make an argument to favor my original model - linear regression - despite non-normally distributed errors, by invoking CTL? Any other way to adjust these results? Thank you! Update 1: thank you so much for your suggestions. I have added the requested q-q plot of the residuals for the original model. We did a bootstrap to our original model. In our results, we are planning to report: the observed coefficients either the percentile or the bias-corrected 95% CI can we still report the p values of the bootstrap model? (Audience preference) Is there another diagnostic to run after this? Should this be sufficient to mitigate the concerns of the reviewer regarding violation of normality? Thank you!!
