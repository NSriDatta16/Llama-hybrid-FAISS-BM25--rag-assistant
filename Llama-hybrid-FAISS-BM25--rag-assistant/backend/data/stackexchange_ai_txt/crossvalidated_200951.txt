A little help in confirming an interpretation on an output

How can we interpret the results in the graph below? Does the R command lm() uses Heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrices(HCCM) estimators, or HAC estimators for the inference tests? The residuals vs fitted plot seems to indicate that I'm dealing with homoskedastic case. The scale-location seems to also tell me the same thing. The mean of the residuals also appears to be zero, so no problem with the OLS estimate for the intercept, right? For the normal Q-Q I could find info on the net, and it seems that my residuals are following a normal distribution (heavy-tailed?). Can I also infer that they are independent? Since it follows a normal, then the t-stat. given by R are valid not only asymptotically, but also exactly for this sample size, right? Should I take care of outliers? From some info on an answer on CV, it seems that my Residual vs Leverage is good, since it's close to the axis when far in the right, so it's in between the contour of ellipses with value 0.5. So there doesn't seem to exist a high leverage-high residual observations. True?
