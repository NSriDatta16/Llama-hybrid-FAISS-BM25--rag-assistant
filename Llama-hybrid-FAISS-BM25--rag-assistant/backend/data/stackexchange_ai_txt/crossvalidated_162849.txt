In the ordinary setting where you actually observe the values in your sample the standard approach would be to report a confidence interval on the mean of the distribution. Since we don't know the actual values here and only have upper and lower bounds, a possible alternative might be to construct an interval which "covers" the confidence interval you would have constructed had you known the true values of the observations. If we're willing to assume we have an adequate sample to appeal to the central limit theorem this might look like $$ (\bar{x}_L - z \cdot s / \sqrt{n}, \bar{x}_U + z \cdot s / \sqrt{n}) $$ where $\bar{x}_L$ and $\bar{x}_U$ are the averages of the lower and upper bounds, $n$ is the number of pairs of bounds we have, $s$ the sample standard deviation of the sample comprised of all the endpoints , and $z$ a quantile from the standard normal distribution. It should be possible to show that this interval will contain the "true" interval based on the actual data points, and so have proper coverage probability if the standard interval does.
