Assuming that you want to sum r/g/b channel values in image (and assuming that you can destroy original pixels) - here is my partial solution: Each 10th pixel would calculate average color of 10 neighboring pixels and put this averaged color on image. Then in CPU side sum Pix_Value*10 of each 10th pixel. In this case we get about 10x speed-up compared to summing pixel values only in CPU side.
