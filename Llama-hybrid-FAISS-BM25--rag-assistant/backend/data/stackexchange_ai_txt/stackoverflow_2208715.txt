If he says it's a best practice, I'd ask him to prove that with SQL not C++ sources. Since 99.9% of the SQL code I've ever read (including our code, other organization's code, Microsoft help files, SQL Blogs, etc) does the opposite of what your dev does, I'd say that violating the normal expectation of the developer who will maintain the code is a bad idea. In SQL we expect to see the form WHERE CCY = 'USD' not WHERE 'USD' = CCY Therefore the professsional would also write code in that manner to ensure it is clear to the maintainer.
