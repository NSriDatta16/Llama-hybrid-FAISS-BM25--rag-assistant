Linux GUI development

I have a large GUI project that I'd like to port to Linux. What is the most recommended framework to utilize for GUI programming in Linux? Are Frameworks such as KDE / Gnome usable for this objective Or is better to use something more generic other than X? I feel like if I chose one of Gnome or KDE, I'm closing the market out for a chunk of the Linux market who have chosen one over the other. (Yes I know there is overlap) Is there a better way? Or would I have to create 2 complete GUI apps to have near 100% coverage? It's not necessary to have a cross-platform solution that will also work on Win32.
