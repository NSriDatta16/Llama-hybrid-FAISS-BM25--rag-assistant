Why would I *not* collect code-coverage data in unit tests, in VS2008?

If I'm running a suite of tests, is there a reason I would NOT want to collect code coverage data for the tests? What's the expected cost, in terms of runtime, storage, or anything else? I'm trying to decide if I would ever want to run with code coverage data collection OFF.
