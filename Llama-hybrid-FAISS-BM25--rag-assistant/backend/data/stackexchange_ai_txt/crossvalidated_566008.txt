Class separability and Overlap

I have a dataset for five different classes with 40 features. This dataset is somehow imbalanced with 2 majority & 2 monirity classes, the other somehow average. This is a classification task and were considering every class to have equal prediction priority (i.e. no priority as to correct prediction of one class is more important than the other. Since models created on these dataset do not do well on both classes, I needed a way to analyse or visualize class separability in my dataset, so as to how separate or mixed/overlapped are these classes in my dataset. But I want an idea about the right tool to explore these classes for to observer their separability . Multidimensional scaling or principal component analysis?
