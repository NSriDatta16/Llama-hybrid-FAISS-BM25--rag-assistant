best practices for setting development environment

I use Linux as primary OS. I need some suggestions regarding how should I set up my desktop and development. I do work on mostly .Net and Drupal, but some time on other lamp products and C/C++, Qt. I'm also interested in mobile (android..) and embedded development. Currently I install everything on my main OS, even I use it a little. I use VMs a little (for lamp server). Should I use separate VM for each kind of development (like one for .Net/Mono, another C++, one for mobile and one for db only, one for xyz things etc) Keep primary development environment on main os and move others in VM. main os should be messed up keep things easy to organize (must) performance should be optimal (optimal settings for best performance of components) I'm interested to know how others' are doing.
