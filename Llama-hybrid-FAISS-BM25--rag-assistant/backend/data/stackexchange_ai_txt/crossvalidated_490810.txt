Target Encoder for Logistic regression

I have a data set that has many categorical values, I want to build a linear model using Logistic regression algorithm. One way of handling Categorical variables is to use Target Encoder (among others like OneHotEncodng or LabelEncoding). Is this method suitable for a logistic regression model ? What should we consider while using this type of encoding ?
