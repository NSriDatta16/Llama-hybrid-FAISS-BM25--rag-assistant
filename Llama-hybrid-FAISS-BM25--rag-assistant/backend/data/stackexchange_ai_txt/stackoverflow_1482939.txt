Check out this page on OpenCV Wiki about face detection using Haar-like features . @floppydisk : The same guy posted another project implementing these Haar-like features for face detection. The concept is not hard to understand and you could even implement it by yourself. Perhaps the most difficult part is constructing the cascade of boosted classifiers (but openCV has all of that readily implemented!) Some other methods that can be used in face detection which can be made invariant to affine transformations include: Eigenfaces with SVD/PCA Fourier descriptors Statistical shape models ( this paper in particular)
