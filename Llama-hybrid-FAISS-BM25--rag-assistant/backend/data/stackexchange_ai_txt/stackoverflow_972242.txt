Question about using special variables in functions for jquery UI/Draggables

I always see this in the documentation. $('.selector').draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { ... } }); In the jQuery documentation, what does "event" and "ui" represent and how can I use them? Is there any way to pass the specific .selector object itself into the function? I guess I don't quite understand how this whole thing works without any examples. I appreciate any help!
