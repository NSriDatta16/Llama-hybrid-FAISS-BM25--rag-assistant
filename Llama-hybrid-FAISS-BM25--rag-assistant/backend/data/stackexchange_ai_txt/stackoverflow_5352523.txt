Excel and VBA: Update protected fields on button press

I have an excel document that queries an SQL Database on button press. The document needs to be read-only. Currently, with the fields locked, on button press I receive the following run time error: Run-time error '1004': The cell or chart that you are trying to change is protected and therefore read-only. I've done some searching and I can find some ways to open read-only/password protected files, but not how to apply changes to the protected rows while the file is read-only. This is the code I currently have at the beginning of the module: Sub Update() Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual Dim Cnn As Object Dim rstTmp As Object Dim appExcel As Excel.Application Dim wbkReport As Excel.Workbook Dim wksReport As Excel.Worksheet Set Cnn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") Set rstTmp = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") Cnn.Open "Driver={SQL Server};Server=IPHERE;;UID=NOPE;PWD=ALMOST;DATABASE=DB;Trusted_Connection=No" I'm trying to "reverse engineer" this functionality into a current excel. I have little to no experience with this so I am just jumping headlong into the deep end. If any additional information is needed, I will be happy to add it. Thanks in advance!
