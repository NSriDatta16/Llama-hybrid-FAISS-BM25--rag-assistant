The key identity you need is $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} A^{-1} = - A^{-1}\frac{\partial A}{\partial x} A^{-1} $$ which can be obtained by product-ruling $A^{-1}A = 1$. Now to turn you gradient in a Hessian follow these steps, and don't get discouraged if it gets messy (introducing extra variables should help) product rule apply the "key" identity on $A = (\Sigma^{-1}+\Sigma^{-1}(X-M)\Omega^{-1}(X-M)^T\Sigma^{-1})$, use chain rule
