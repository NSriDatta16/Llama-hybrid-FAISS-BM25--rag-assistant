jQuery UI: Drag and clone from original div, but keep clones

I have a div, which has jQuery UI Draggable applied. What I want to do, is click and drag that, and create a clone that is kept in the dom and not removed when dropped. Think of a deck of cards, my box element is the deck, and I want to pull cards/divs off that deck and have them laying around my page, but they would be clones of the original div. I just want to make sure that you cannot create another clone of one of the cloned divs. I have used the following, which didn't work like I wanted: $(".box").draggable({ axis: 'y', containment: 'html', start: function(event, ui) { $(this).clone().appendTo('body'); } }); I figured out my solution: $(".box-clone").live('mouseover', function() { $(this).draggable({ axis: 'y', containment: 'html' }); }); $(".box").draggable({ axis: 'y', containment: 'html', helper: 'clone' stop: function(event, ui) { $(ui.helper).clone(true).removeClass('box ui-draggable ui-draggable-dragging').addClass('box-clone').appendTo('body'); } });
