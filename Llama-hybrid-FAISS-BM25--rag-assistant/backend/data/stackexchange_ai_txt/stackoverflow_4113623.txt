In addition to a CombinedDomainXYPlot , you can add multiple series to an existing chart, as seen in this example . You can also add another axis to an existing chart, as seen discussed here . Addendum: I am looking for time series plot. The scale should be in minutes. A time series chart is just an XYPlot in which the domain is a DateAxis and the range is a NumberAxis , as seen in the code of the createTimeSeriesChart() factory method. You can use Minute for the domain interval, as discused here .
