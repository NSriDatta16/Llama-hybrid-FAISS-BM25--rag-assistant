Basically history has shown us the most you can buy with copy protection is a little time. Fundamentally since there is data you want someone to see one way, there is a way to get to that data. Since there is a way someone can exploit that way to get to the data. The only thing that any copy protection or encryption for that matter can do is make it very hard to get at something. If someone is motivated enough there is always the brute force way of getting around things. But more importantly, in the computer software space we have tons of tools that let us see how things are working, and once you get the method of how the copy protection works then its a very simple matter to get what you want. The other issue is that copy protection for the most part just frustrates your users who are paying for your software. Take a look at the open source model they don't bother and some folks are making a ton of money encouraging people to copy their software.
