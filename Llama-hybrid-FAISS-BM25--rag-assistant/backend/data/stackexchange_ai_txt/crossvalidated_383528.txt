Comparing different machine learning models for extrapolation

I am trying to fit a non linear regression model on a set of data points which I know is incomplete. When visualizing the data, the relationship looks quite simple between my features and dependent variables (~3 degree polynomial). Within the range of the data, I am finding little out of sample difference between the predictive power of ANN, SVR, Boosted Trees etc. However, should I expect to encounter points outside the range of my sample, which classes of models should I use for better performance? Intuitively it seems that Trees should be avoided entirely? SVR, forcing C to be low might be the best among bad choices? Are there any theoretical insights or best practices for this?
