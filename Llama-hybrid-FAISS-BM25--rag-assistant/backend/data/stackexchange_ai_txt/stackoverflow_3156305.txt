C# in Visual Studio: How to display a list in a DataGridView? Getting weird stuff

Been a while and I've volunteered to teach myself Windows programming at my company. Started writing vbs scripts and suddenly realized how incredibly useful this programming thing is ;-) Anyway, I'm a total newbie at C# AND Visual Studio, I kind of get how it works, you drag and drop interface pieces in the design side then wire them together in the back/program side. I'm trying to write a program that will (ultimately) read in a (very specific kind of) csv file and give the user a friendlier way to edit and sort through it than Excel. Should be simple stuff, and I'm excited about it. I started this morning and, with the help of the internet, got as far as reading in and parsing the CSV (which is actually a TSV, since they use tabs not commas but hey). I've been trying to figure out the best way to display the information, and, for now at least, I'm using a DataGridView. But the data isn't displaying. Instead, I'm seeing a long grid of values with column headers of Length, LongLength, Rank, SyncRoot, IsReadOnly, IsFixedSize, and IsSynchronized. I don't know what any of these mean or where they come from, and unfortunately I don't know how change them either. Maybe somebody can help? Here is my code: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel; using System.Data; using System.Drawing; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.IO; namespace readInCSV { public partial class readInCSV : Form { public readInCSV() { InitializeComponent(); } public List parseCSV(string path) { List parsedData = new List (); try { using (StreamReader readfile = new StreamReader(path)) { string line; string[] row; while ((line = readfile.ReadLine()) != null) { row = line.Split('\t'); parsedData.Add(row); } } } catch (Exception e) { MessageBox.Show(e.Message); } return parsedData; } //PRIVATE METHODS FROM HERE ON DOWN private void btnLoadIn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { int size = -1; DialogResult csvResult = openCSVDialog.ShowDialog(); if (csvResult == DialogResult.OK) { string file = openCSVDialog.FileName; try { string text = File.ReadAllText(file); size = text.Length; } catch (IOException) { } } dgView.Dock = DockStyle.Top; dgView.EditMode = DataGridViewEditMode.EditOnEnter; dgView.AutoGenerateColumns = true; dgView.DataSource = parseCSV(openCSVDialog.FileName); } private void dataGridView1_CellContentClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) { } private void openCSVDialog_FileOk(object sender, CancelEventArgs e) { } } } Thanks in advance!
