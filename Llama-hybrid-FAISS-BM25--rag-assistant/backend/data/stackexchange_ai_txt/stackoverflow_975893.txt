For checking video capabilities on a phone you can try using the WURFL ( wurfl.sf.net ). It is a MASSIVE xml file containing a map of phone browser user-agent to phone capabilities. You could try taking a sample from that to see what the most commonly supported formats are. The API itself isn't the best but for your purposes you can probably just parse out the playback_* properties from the xml.
