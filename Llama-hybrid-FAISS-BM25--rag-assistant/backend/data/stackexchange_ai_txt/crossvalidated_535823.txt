CausalImpact package - results summary inconsistent with the result plots

I'm trying to get some experience with the `CausalImpact` [package][1] in python. I'm using this seemingly simple example: import pandas as pd from causalimpact import CausalImpact # treatment data t = np.array([2.]*180+[4.]*60) t+= np.random.normal(scale=0.15, size=240) # adding some noise # control 1 c1 = np.array([1.]*240) c1 += np.random.normal(scale=0.15, size=240) # adding some noise # control 2 c2 = np.array([3.]*240) c2 += np.random.normal(scale=0.15, size=240) # adding some noise # make into a df df = pd.DataFrame({'treatment':t, 'control1':c1, 'control2':c2}) pre_period = [0,179] post_period = [180, 239] # instantiate and fit/train a model ci = CausalImpact(dead_simple_df, pre_period, post_period) ci.run() Essentially, what the data shows: in the pre-treatment period: the would-be-treated group has an average of 2. one control would have an average of 1, and the other and average of 3. hence, a simple model that's a 50-50 average of the controls would predict the would-be-treated group very well. in the post-treatment period: the treated group see a flat increase of 2 units nothing else changes When I call ci.plot() the plot shows this pre-treatment average of 2 and post-treatment average of 4 very nicely. However, when I call ci.summary(output='report') the summary says the impact is 1. Further: During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. 3 Any idea what might be going on? TIA!
