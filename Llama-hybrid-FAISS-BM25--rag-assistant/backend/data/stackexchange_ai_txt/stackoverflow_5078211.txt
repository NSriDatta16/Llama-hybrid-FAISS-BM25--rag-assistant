Can I choose a custom image for C# Windows Application Drag Drop functions?

I am writing a small project where I would like to make use of drag and drop functionalty to ease some of the operations for the end user. To make the application a little more appealing, I would like to display the object being dragged. I have found some resources with WPF, but I don't know any WPF, so it becomes a bit tough to bite down on that whole subject for this single task. I would like to know how this can be done with "regular" C# Windows Forms. So far, all drag drop tutorials I've found just talk about the drop effects which is just a preset of a few icons. WPF sounds like something I want to learn after this project.
