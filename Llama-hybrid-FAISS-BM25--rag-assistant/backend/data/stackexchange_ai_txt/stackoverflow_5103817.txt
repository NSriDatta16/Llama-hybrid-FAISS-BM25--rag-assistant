Dotfuscator messes up .net cf 2.0 application

I have recently inherited a .net 2.0 compact framework application for which I have previously produced a dotfuscated release package that works and installs fine. The target OS in windows mobile 2003 and above up to 6.5. Having made some bug fixes recently I have come to doing a new release using exaclty the same build project as for the previous one. Now I find the dotfuscated version errors with a .net framework error as follows "The application failed to load required components. If the .net framework is installed on a storage card, please ensure this card is in place and launch the application again. If this fails, a re-installation of the .net compact framework is recommended. Support info: -27147454964 (8000700C)" I have no idea what could be causing this. As far as I am aware the build solution is unchanged since the last release which was fine and changes to the source code for the application consist of nothing more than refreshing a drop down list more often in certain circumstances. The application works fine if I build the installation package without using dotfuscator. I hope someone can help with this as it's got me stumped. I have very little experience with dotfuscator which doesn't help. thanks in advance
