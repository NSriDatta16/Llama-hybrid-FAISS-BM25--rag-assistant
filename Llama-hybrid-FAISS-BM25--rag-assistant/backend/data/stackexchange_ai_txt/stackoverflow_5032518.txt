Gwt RequestFactory: editing a proxy immediately after receiving it

I want to RequestContext.edit(anObject) immediately after I receive it in Receiver.onSuccess, so that I can put it in my client-side database as already editable. Unfortunately, when I do so, RequestFactory complains that a request is already in progress. How can I achieve this? requestContext.findOrganization(id).fire(new Receiver () { public void onSuccess(OrganizationProxy response) { database.put(requestContext.edit(response)); //fails because a request is already in progress } });
