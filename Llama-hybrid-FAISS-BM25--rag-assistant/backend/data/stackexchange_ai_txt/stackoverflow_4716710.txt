//Do I need to call either of the following code to make it do this? newLabel.Visible = true; newLabel.Show(); is unnecessary. newLabel.AutoSize = true; is, most probably, necessary to give it a size. panel1.Container.Add(newLabel); must be replaced by newLabel.Parent = panel1; But, your method should work, unless the drag doesn't work. Found the bug. It must be panel1.Controls.Add(newLabel); or newLabel.Parent = panel1; instead of panel1.Container.Add(newLabel); . Container is something else.
