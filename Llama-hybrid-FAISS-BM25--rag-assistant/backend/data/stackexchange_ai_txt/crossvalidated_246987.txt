Does Jaynes's math hold if one chooses a subjective prior?

If the research question necessitates a more subjective-Bayesian approach to probability, i.e., betting odds, can Jaynes's system still work? I ask this because I've read that one of the axioms for Jaynes's system is that all observers with the same information should choose the same prior.
