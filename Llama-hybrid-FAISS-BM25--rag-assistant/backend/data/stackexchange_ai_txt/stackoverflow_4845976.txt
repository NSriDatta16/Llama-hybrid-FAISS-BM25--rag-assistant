Sounds like you are thinking in a relational DB way. Your User object should either have a UserAddress object as a property (or a collection of them, assuming multiple addresses are allowed - hence the need for the relationship). Your data access implementation should then take care of the updates to the underlying tables (or whatever storage mechanism you are using)
