One way is to redesign your CNN architecture to fit your new data input. However, if you want to use the current model you have, you should: (1) Retraining : Re-train the model with new data set images (2) Reshape new images : You should add a pre-processing layer to convert 28x28x1 images to 32x32x3 images. This could be done by replicating a single channel in other two channels and adding boundaries to your images. This deformation process should be the same on all new input images.
