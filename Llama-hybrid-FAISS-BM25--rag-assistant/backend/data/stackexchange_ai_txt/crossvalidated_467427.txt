I don't know about its history, but logistic function has a property which makes it attractive for machine learning and logistic regression: If you have two normally distributed classes with equal variances, then the posterior probability of an observation to belong to one of these classes is given by the logistic function. First, for any two classes $A$ and $B$ it follows from the Bayesian formula: $$ P(B | x) = \frac{P(x | B) P(B)}{P(x)} = \frac{P(x | B) P(B)}{P(x | A) P(A) + P(x | B) P(B)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{P(x | A)P(A)} {P(x | B)P(B)}}. $$ If $x$ is continuous, so that the classes can be described by their PDFs, $f_A(x)$ and $f_B(x)$ , the fraction $P(x | A) / P(x | B)$ can be expressed as: $$ \frac{P(x | A)} {P(x | B)} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f_A(x) \Delta x}{f_B(x) \Delta x} = \frac{f_A(x)}{f_B(x)}. $$ If the two classes are normally distributed, with equal variances: $$ f_A(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp \left( -\frac{(x - \mu_A)^2} {2 \sigma^2} \right), ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ f_B(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp \left( -\frac{(x - \mu_B)^2} {2 \sigma^2} \right) $$ then the fraction $f_A(x) / f_B(x)$ can be written as: $$ \frac{f_A(x)}{f_B(x)} = \exp \left( - \frac{(x - \mu_A)^2} {2 \sigma^2} + \frac{(x - \mu_B)^2} {2 \sigma^2} \right) = \exp \left( \frac{\mu_B^2 - \mu_A^2} {2 \sigma^2} + \frac{\mu_A - \mu_B} {\sigma^2} x \right), $$ and the whole term $$ \frac{f_A(x)P(A)}{f_B(x)P(B)} = \exp \left( \ln \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} + \frac{\mu_B^2 - \mu_A^2} {2 \sigma^2} + \frac{\mu_A - \mu_B} {\sigma^2} x \right). $$ Denoting $$ \beta_0 = \frac{\mu_A^2 - \mu_B^2} {2 \sigma^2} - \ln \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \text{and} ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \beta_1 = \frac{\mu_B - \mu_A} {\sigma^2} $$ leads to the form commonly used in logistic regression: $$ P(B | x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp \left(-\beta_0 - \beta_1 x \right) }. $$ So, if you have reasons to believe that your classes are normally distributed, with equal variances, the logistic function is likely to be the best model for the class probabilities.
