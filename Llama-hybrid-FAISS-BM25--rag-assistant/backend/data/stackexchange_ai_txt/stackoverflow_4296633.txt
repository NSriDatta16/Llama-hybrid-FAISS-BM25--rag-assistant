well i think you are comparing apples to exotic devil fruits or something. you are adding modules to a cms and exepct the same from a famework. it doesnt work like this. the mvc structure you are talking about (model - view - controller) makes a lot of sense and helps you to keep your code organised and to keep up good class coherency. its a design pattern which has evolved to a de facto standard and has been adopted by almost every framework. zend framework is probably the best way to go for you. its layouting engine and stuff is not as fast as one could wish, but it features execellent modularity. you can even partly overload core classes to suit your needs in your "module". only abstract classes dont work (how should they?), thats why they are almonst never used. if you really really wanna go with a very flexible excellent system and performance is not the most important point for you, you should get going with magento, which takes the modularity and flexibility even to a higher level by adding an xml structure to zend framework that allows you to organice all your pages, manage your dependencies, rewrite your model componenents etc. but be a aware that the more you want the more performance you will loose. my personal fav from the frameworks out there is codeigniter, but i designed my own for my needs...
