After obtaining a minimally sufficient set from a DAG, which variables should I include in the logistic regression model?

I have created a DAG using daggity, and from this DAG, two variables need to be controlled to evaluate the unbiased total effect of the exposure on the outcome. However, I'm confused about whether I should only include the exposure, outcome, and the two variables that appear to be confounders in my logistic regression model? I understand that "the minimally sufficient adjustment set is the list of DAG elements that require adjustment (e.g., using regression, matching, or weighting) in order to accurately estimate the magnitude of the relationship between an exposure and an outcome", in this case, I can "adjust" this two variables (sex and age) by including them in the model in addition with my exposure and outcome? Thanks!
