Most people are using Python or R for data-science, I like Python more because python have enormous amount of libraries for datascience related tasks (for data-analysis, plotting, out of the box machine-learning & deep learning algorithms) and huge open source community to support/help. You can read more about individual language capabilities everything can be done using any of these languages (Python/R/Matlab) it's just the matter of perspective.
