Ramsey's reset test (i.e. Omitted variable bias test) result interpretation

I have the Ramsey's reset test result to find whether my regression has any omitted variable bias. It is based on the logistic regresison model which is a non-linear model . I have the following result and shall I say I do or do not have omitted variable bias and why? > resettest(reg_logit,power = 2,type="fitted", data=DATA) RESET test data: reg_logit RESET = 1.8529, df1 = 1, df2 = 3273, p-value = 0.1735 But when I run this ramsey test without any specification on this same logistic regression, I get the result as follows: > resettest(reg_logit) RESET test data: reg_logit RESET = 19.748, df1 = 2, df2 = 3272, p-value = 2.983e-09
