Termplots in GAMLSS

I am interested in plotting the marginal effects in my GAMLSS model. However, what puzzles me a bit is that when using the term.plot() function from the gamlss package I do get estimates for the baseline category of a factor as well. However, when fitting a GAM model with the package mgcv the baseline category is always set to zero, which is also more intuitive to me. Underneath you can find a worked out example using the rent dataset from the gamlss package. The two factor variables are loc (1 = location below average, 2 = average location, 3 = location above average) and H (0 = no central heating, 1 = central heating) and A (year of construction) as well as Fl (floor space in meters) are modelled as P-Splines. library(mgcv) library(gamlss) r GAMLSS-Output: Family: c("GA", "Gamma") Call: gamlss(formula = R ~ pb(Fl) + pb(A) + H + loc, family = GA, data = rent) Fitting method: RS() ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mu link function: log Mu Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.0851197 0.5692315 5.420 6.70e-08 *** pb(Fl) 0.0103084 0.0004031 25.573 |t|) (Intercept) -1.00196 0.01559 -64.27 GAM-output: Family: Gamma Link function: log Formula: R ~ s(Fl, bs = "ps") + s(A, bs = "ps") + H + loc Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 6.52315 0.02850 228.919 Noe that the estimates are relatively close to another for both methods. Baseline categories are loc1 (below average location) and H0 (no central heating). However, when displaying the marginal effects via termplots, the GAM sets the effect of the baseline categories at zero, whereas the GAMLSS estimates an own effect for the baselines. I tried to reproduce this estimated effect but I am not sure how it is computed and why it is not left at zero? Termplots-GAMLSS: Termplots-GAM I have already searched the literature, but I could not find an explanation of why the term.plot function is not placing the baseline effect at zero. Thank you very much for your answers!
