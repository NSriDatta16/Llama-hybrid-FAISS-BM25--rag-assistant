iPhone UITableView Nested Sections

For the acani iPhone app, I'd like display groups (based on interests) in a UITableView . I'd like to organize the groups taxonomically, e.g.: Sports Bat-and-ball Baseball Softball Cricket Hockey Field Hockey Ice Hockey Roller Hockey Engineering Electrical Engineering Biochemical Engineering How should I arrange this on a UITableView ? I'm thinking that there should be a root UITableView that will have the sections Sports & Engineering, and the cells Bat-and-ball & Hockey will be under the Sports section, and the cells Electrical Engineering & Biochemical Engineering will be under the Engineering section. Then Bat-and-ball should have its own UITableView , which should have cells Baseball, Softball, and Cricket. Does this sound like a good way to arrange the UI? Do you have any sample code or links to Xcode sample code for a UI like this? There's gotta be an Xcode sample project that does something like this. Perhaps the periodic table of elements project or Core Data Books? Thanks! Matt
