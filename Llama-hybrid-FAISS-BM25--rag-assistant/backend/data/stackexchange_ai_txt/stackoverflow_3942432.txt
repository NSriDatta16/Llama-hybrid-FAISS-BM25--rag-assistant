Today, I finally solved this. I was writing an ASP.NET application that included the line: User.IsInRole("DOMAIN\\Administrators"); And this was throwing the following exception: The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed I wasted a little time applying the KB976494 hotfix , which I soon discovered didn't work. During my developer rage I looked in my local "Administrators" account and noticed it listed almost all members by their S-ID, so figured there may have been a domain problem. Then it came to me... I remembered I joined the domain with my personal (non-administrator) account, instead of using the domain administrator account. These were the ultimate steps to fix this issue: Leave your domain (and join an arbitrary workgroup, such as "WORK") Reboot. Join your domain with your "DOMAIN\Administrator" account User.IsInRole() now worked, so out of curiosity I checked this problem, and it was also fixed. This is a great Friday so far!
