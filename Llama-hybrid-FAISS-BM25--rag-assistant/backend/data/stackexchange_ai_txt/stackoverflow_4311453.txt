On the face of it, SQLite doesn't treat newlines any differently than other characters; you can just store the test as-is. The issue, though, is why are you storing large volumes of raw text in SQLite? If you want to search it or organize it somehow, SQLite (nor Core Data) is probably not the best choice without first massaging the text into some other form. Or, alternatively, you'd want to store the raw text on disk then keep some kind of searchable index in the database.
