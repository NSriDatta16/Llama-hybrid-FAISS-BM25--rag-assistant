For me sticking with the Dialog returning the standard dialog responses and then accessing the results via properties is the way to go. Two good reasons from where I sit: Consistency - you're always doing the same thing with a dialog and the very nature of the question suggests that patterns are good (-: Although equally the question is whether this is a good pattern? It allows for return of multiple values from the dialog - ok there's whole new discussion here too but applied pragmatism means that this is what one wants in some circumstances its not always appropriate or desirable to package values up just so that you can pass them back in all in one go. The flow of logic is nice too: if (Dialog == Ok) { // Do Stuff with the entered values } else { // Respond appropriately to the user cancelling the dialog } Its a good question - we're supposed to question stuff like this - but for me the current pattern is a decent one.
