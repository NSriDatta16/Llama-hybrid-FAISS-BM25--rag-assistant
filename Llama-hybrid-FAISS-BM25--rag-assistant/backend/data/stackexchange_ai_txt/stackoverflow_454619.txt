If you are using SQL Server (since you mention T-SQL), you may have some amount of luck by defining a clustered index on the table, which forces a storage ordering on the rows within the table. However, if you do not specify an order by clause, adding or removing joins or where clause conditions may cause that order to change because the optimizer may choose not to use that clustered index.
