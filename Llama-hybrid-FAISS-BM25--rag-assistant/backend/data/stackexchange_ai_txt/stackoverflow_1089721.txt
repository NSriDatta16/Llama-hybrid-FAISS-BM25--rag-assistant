Framework for making a web-application who's content is managed

Is there a system (such as a development framework, Wiki or CMS) that enables you to build rich web applications, but where you can make all the text of the application content-managed? For example, there might be screens that display charts and statistics, and a data entry form, and a form for modifying properties of something. The unique code for each screen will be part of the application. However, content - i.e. paragraphs of 'help' text, headings, navigation - should all be managed. By managed, I mean version controlled, and with an assigned access-level to specify who's allowed to modify the page. Does anyone know of a system like this?
