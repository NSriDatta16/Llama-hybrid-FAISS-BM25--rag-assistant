Support vector machine model in sklearn support adding max iterations parameter which you can change to a higher value. But they don't have epochs parameters nor do they support batch sizes. To go into more depth, support vectors use an exact convex optimization algorithm, not stochastic gradient descent (like Neural nets). They work on the entire dataset at the same time. The algorithm will run for max iterations or till minimum value is achieved and report one single accuracy number. From the question it is not clear why you want to train multiple times using epochs. Comparing with neural networks, the equivalent here will be to just set high max iterations parameter and training once.
