We use: http://source.keyboard-monkeys.org/projects/show/communityid From their website: "Community-ID is an OpenID implementation in PHP which is OpenID 2.0 compliant. Community-ID is build to 100% on Open Source software and is release under the BSD license. Users can keep track of their trusted sites and manage them. The login to C-ID can be username/passowrd or a One Time Password with Yubikey. A user can have multiple profiles like with privat or business contact information. For Community-ID administrators statistics are available to track registration of new users, authorized users per day or the number of trusted sites. Administrators can set the site in maintenance mode or send emails to all registered users. For user data and authentication, admin can choose the default db storage, or to connect to an LDAP server. Current confirmed supported is OpenLDAP. Other LDAP servers should work also fine."
