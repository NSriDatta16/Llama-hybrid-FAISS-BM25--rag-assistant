If you are using Cocoa then I would recommend the (non-apple) framework EyeTunes . Applescript may be your best bet though, either through calling a script directly or the ScriptingBridge framework available for Ruby, Python , and Objective C . For the documentation, look at iTunes script dictionary (drag the iTunes icon onto the Script Editor icon).
