Concerns about the size of odds-ratio estimates in binary logistic regression model

I am creating some binary regressions and am wondering if I should be surprised by the size of the odds ratios. In this particular example, the dependent variable indicates whether a student can meet a specified target in a second language. The explanatory variables are age as a continuous covariate and a measure of literacy in the first language. I am using SPSS to calculate the models, and they seem to be working fine (I have a large dataset of around 40,000 cases and very few empty cells in the data, no warning signs etc.) I have chosen to have 0 as the reference category for both outcome and categorical explanatory variable. As I understand it, the estimates I am seeing below tell me that if the student demonstrates L1 reading at level 4 they are 372 times as likely to be able to demonstrate the required skill in the second language. The pattern of estimates is exactly as I would expect, my issue is with whether I should be concerned at the magnitude of the estimates, or whether this is usual in cases where there is clearly a strong connection between the two variables. Many thanks!
