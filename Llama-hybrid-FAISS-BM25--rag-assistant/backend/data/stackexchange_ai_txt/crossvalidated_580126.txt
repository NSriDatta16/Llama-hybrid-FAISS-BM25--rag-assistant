Best statistical test to compare outcomes of glm's?

For my thesis, I am comparing the differences in habitat selection of little owls between 2005 and 2022. For both years I have little over 100 presence points (value 1) with a buffer of 50 meters around them to account for location errors. I created around a 1000 random pseudo absence points (value 0) with the same buffer. This method is based on literature, for example: Barbet‐Massin, M., Jiguet, F., Albert, C. H., & Thuiller, W. (2012). Selecting pseudo‐absences for species distribution models: how, where and how many?. Methods in ecology and evolution, 3(2), 327-338. Olivier, F., & Wotherspoon, S. J. (2006). Modelling habitat selection using presence-only data: Case study of a colonial hollow nesting bird, the snow petrel. Ecological modelling, 195(3-4), 187-204. Walczak, Ł., Kosiński, Z., & Stachura-Skierczyńska, K. (2013). Factors affecting the occurrence of middle spotted woodpeckers as revealed by forest inventory data. Baltic Forestry, 19(1), 81-88. For all these points I calculated the proportion of each land use type (e.g. for one point: 0.9 category 2, 0.1 category 10 and 0 for all the other categories). I first perform a simple logistic regression in R with function glm() with the "cloglog" link comparing presence/absence with every land use type separately. Then I perform a multiple logistic regression (with the same function) to compare presence/absence with all the land use types that showed a significant result in the first lin reg, to see what is the best model fit. The reason I do this is that when I perform a glm with all the categories at once, it gives the same values (e.g. p-values) for all the different models. I do this for both 2005 and 2022. I want to compare the results of these two years to see if there is a significant difference between the two. I want to compare both the proportions in different land use types and the habitat selection by the little owls. What kind of significant tests could I use for this? And do you think my methods for analysing the habitat selection are correct? This is what my data looks like:
