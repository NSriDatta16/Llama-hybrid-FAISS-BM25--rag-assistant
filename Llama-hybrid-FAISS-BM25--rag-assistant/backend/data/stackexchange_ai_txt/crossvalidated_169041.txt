From the plot, it's not clear how these are "stationary" time series, as the mean values of both clearly change from year to year. Both these time series seem to have significant and correlated overall trends, in this case presumably due to underlying macroeconomic phenomena that affect both dividend and bond yields. The high regression coefficients over long time periods represent the joint responses of both variables to those underlying phenomena, which account for much of the variance in either type of yield over those periods of time. Over shorter time periods where the macroeconomic influences might be relatively constant, you are tending more to examine possible (and presumably weaker) inter-relations between the 2 variables. Proper analysis of time series typically starts with identifying and removing these overall trends and any seasonal (or similar) components before examining the intra-series and inter-series correlations. If you are going to be analyzing econometric time series, draw on the decades of literature and take advantage of well-vetted tools like those provided in R .
