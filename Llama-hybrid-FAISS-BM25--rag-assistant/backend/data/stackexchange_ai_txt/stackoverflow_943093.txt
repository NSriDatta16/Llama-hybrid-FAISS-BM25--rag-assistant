Banning people never works. Much easier to make offensive people's posts invisible to all but the offender. Trolls exhaust enormous amounts of energy trying to get a rise out of people, and its all for nothing since their hard work is perfectly invisible to the rest of us. I've found this technique of starving people of attention is orders of magnitude more successful than banning people outright.
