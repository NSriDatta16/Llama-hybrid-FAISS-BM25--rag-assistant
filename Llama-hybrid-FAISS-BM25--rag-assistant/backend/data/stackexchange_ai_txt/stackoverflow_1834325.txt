What WCF binding is most performant?

I have to get the maximum throughput performance in my WCF service. In one of my tests the service below got only 50k data items per minute using NetTcpBinding. Would a disconnected binding like NetMsmqBinding improve this performance? Service and client uses WCF and run in the same machine. [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.Single, ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple)] public class Storage : IStorage { protected List _data = new List (); public void Insert(int[] data) { lock (_data) { _data.AddRange(data); } } public int[] Get() { lock (_data) { return _data.ToArray(); } } } The code above is a simplified version of the actual code.
