Pattern detection in scatter plot

Below is a scatter plot (capped at $10k) representing the average donation a project receives vs the word count of the funding request essay for all projects represented in the open Donors Choose Data . There is a noticeable pattern, which I tried to characterize by fitting the curve $$ f(x)=\left(\frac{a}{x-b}\right)^2 $$ through manual parameter manipulation. However, I'd like to know other ways to approach modeling or finding patterns/relationships in data that looks like this. Here is the disparity that motivates my search for other methods: In the canonical example for linear regression, the scattered points are deviations from a curve. In this example, that clearly isn't the case, as it seems the points are clustered under some area.
