Flash - time from press

I am working on a little project, what's goal is a working widget system in Flash - by creating a separate class, and loading Flash movies into this, then dragging them around the screen. I ran into a little problem when I was writing the dragging code: I can not found any code what can easily get the time from the function call. To be more precise, I want the container only draggable after 2 seconds of continuous press, and that's what I am trying to detect. Is there any easy solution?
