Your question doesn't include much detail, so I'm going to assume based on your tags that you're using the shark specs to predict a rating based on something like regression. The probability of a shark being in grade E will be based on age, but also the other specs like length, breadth etc. One approach would be to calculate the average of those other traits, and then use your model to work out the probability of the shark being in grade E at a range of ages, while holding the other variables constant at their average. Using this method you could plot probability of being grade E against age, and see if there's a minimum age above which the probability rises above zero.
