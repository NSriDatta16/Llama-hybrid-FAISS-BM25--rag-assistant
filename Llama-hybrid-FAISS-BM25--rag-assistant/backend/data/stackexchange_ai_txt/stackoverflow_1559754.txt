What the best way to get paragraphs in a WPF textblock? (newline chars?)

I have some text which has "\r\n" newline markers. I would like to have the newlines in a WPF textblock. I've tried replacing "\r\n" with "& # 13;" (without the spaces), which worked when I set the Text property in XAML, but doesn't seem to work when setting from the C# code-behind. So...what's the standard way to convert "\r\n" to newlines in a WPF textblock?
