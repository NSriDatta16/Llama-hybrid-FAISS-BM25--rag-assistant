If I want to make a static library in C or C++ I will put my functions prototypes in the .h and the actual functions codes in the .c or .cpp. After that I compiled my .cpp to make a .lib To link my .h to my .lib I write this preprocessor command in the .h #pragma comment (lib, "theNameOfTheLibFile.lib") After that if I include the .h in a program, my program knows where to find the matching library.
