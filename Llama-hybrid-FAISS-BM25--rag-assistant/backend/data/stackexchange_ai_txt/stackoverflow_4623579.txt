Most RoR developer team works on MAC in my experience. Using git or svn for version control. Most use TextMate or Komodo . Special with Komodo Pro you can use it well in teams. A good svn client there is Versions I didn't worked in bigger teams then 5 developers, that isn't large scale I think :) But the framework itself is much easier to handle like most other I have seen. Mostly used in Scrum-Teams but if yo have a good organisation I don't see any disadvantage using RoR in large teams. The code documentation tools are handy, splitting the models, controllers and views up in different sections for team members shouldn't be a big deal and setting up test servers with nightly builts is very easy. We use RoR in linux and windows environments and have very good productive experience made with it. Technical it is as scaleable as other large frameworks, with sql_sessions and mem_cache you can setup easy a server farm to run it for thousands or millions of users. So imho: It is capable for any size of team.
