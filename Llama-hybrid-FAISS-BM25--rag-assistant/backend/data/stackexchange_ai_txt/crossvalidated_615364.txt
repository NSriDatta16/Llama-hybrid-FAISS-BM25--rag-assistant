Invertibility of "sum" of processes

I know that given a moving average process in the form $$X_t= \Theta(B) \varepsilon_t$$ then $X_t$ is invertible if the roots of $\Theta(B)$ are outside the unit circle. But what about something in the form $$X_t= a + \Theta(B) \varepsilon_t ?$$ It seems to me that $X_t -a $ is invertible if the roots of $\Theta(B)$ are outside the unit circle but intuitively nothing guarantees that $X_t$ is invertible too.
