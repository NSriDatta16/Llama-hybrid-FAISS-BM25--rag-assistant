PaO2 is a measure of pulmonary function. We are to assume whatever the outcome is here, it's bad, as very low PaO2 has a higher odds of something . The study team has applied some bad statistical practices here: dividing up a strong predictor into an arbitrary number of percentiles and using odds ratios rather than risk ratios to summarize associations in what we must assume is a prospective study. When fitting a categorical predictor, one category is chosen as a reference. The odds ratio summarizes association by taking the odds of an outcome for any of the other 9 categories versus a reference. Categorical predictors require a reference for dummy variable encoding by default. They have chosen PaO2 range 83-93 as the "reference". When you calculate a predictor matrix, you drop indicators of membership to this group. The interpretation of the intercept is the odds of this "bad" outcome given your PaO2 is 83-93 (whatever the units are). Notice on the plot there is no bar for this category. The odds ratios and their 95% CIs are estimated from logistic regression. "Adjusted" further includes (what we must assume) as possible confounders of association.
