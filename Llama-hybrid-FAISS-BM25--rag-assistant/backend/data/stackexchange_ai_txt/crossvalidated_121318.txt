So after some research into the algorithms, it seems that neither decompose() nor stl() can handle complex, multiple periods (which otherwise make it through to the remainder component). Like most time series analysis questions, it seems Rob Hyndman has authored the answer to this problem in bats() and tbats() in his forecast package, now I have to learn how to use them properly by wading through his paper that he wrote a few years ago on the algorithm.
