How to preserve touch event after new view is added by long press

When I add a new view after detecting user's long press, I get touchesCancelled event. However, I want to preserve the long press event to newly added view. What I want to implement is user touch & hold the screen, then new view added, and user can move touch around in the newly added view without touch up and touch down again. But, when new view is added, I get touch cancel event, so the added view can not receive any touch event even user's touch is moving. I'm using UILongPressGestureRecognizer to detect user's long press. below is log message. MyView touchesBegan x:524 y:854 MyView handleLongPress (LongPress Detected) NewView added MyView touchesCancelled x:526 y:854 and nothing happend... what I'm expecting is... MyView touchesBegan x:524 y:854 MyView handleLongPress (LongPress Detected) NewView added MyView touchesCancelled x:526 y:854 NewView touchBegan NewView touchMoved NewView touchMoved NewView touchMoved NewView touchMoved ... Is there any solution? Thanks in advance.
