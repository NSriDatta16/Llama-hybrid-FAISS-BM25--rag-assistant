Books about statistical inference

I'm currently taking a course "Introduction to Machine Learning" which covers the following topics: linear regression, overfitting, classification problems, parametric & non-parametric models, Bayesian & non Bayesian models, generative classification, neural networks, SVM, boosting & bagging, unsupervised learning. I've asked the course stuff for some reading material about those subjects but I would like to hear some more recommendations about books (or any other material) that give more intuition about the listed topics to start with and also some books that go deeper into the theory of those subjects (affter I'll gain some intuition)? (I guess every subject has many books to cover the theory of course, but any recommendations will be great) Thank you.
