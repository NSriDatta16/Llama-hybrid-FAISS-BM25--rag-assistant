Small N analysis for a field experiment question, and rare events logit

so, I am running a "Field" experiment, meaning, people in a real life situation are subject to certain treatment, and I am trying to measure the effect of said treatment. In this case its an online donation campaign, so donations. I have two mailing lists, approx 2000 people in each arm. as things are advancing I am getting few donations, many factors might be playing to this. So at the moment one arm has approx 30 donations, the other, approx 17. I feel confident that some analysis (which include both donors (1s) and non donors (0s) ) will be fine, specifically maybe using rare events logistic regression... to check the probability of donating for example. I worry more about analysis with the continuous variable for donation (so amount of $ given ) given my current amount of donors. Any ideas what analysis might be good for such a case (if lets say, numbers stay the same, 30 vs 18, total donations 420 dollars vs 220, means 16 vs 11) Any ideas what might be advisable?
