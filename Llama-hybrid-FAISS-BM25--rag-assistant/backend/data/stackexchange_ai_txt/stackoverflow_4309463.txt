I finally figured it out. I think because I was around before XCode managed the provisioning stuff that my old certificate was causing issues with the new distribution certificates. I just erased all my keys, certificates, profiles and started over. In order I did this: 1) Removed all keys 2) Revoked the certificates on both development and distribution 3) Removed all profiles 4) Created a new Cert Request 5) Downloaded and installed both distribution and development certs 6) Created profiles 7) Installed everything. 8) Opened XCode and went to organizer, profiles, and hit refresh to update my team provisioning profile It all finally works. Wow..
