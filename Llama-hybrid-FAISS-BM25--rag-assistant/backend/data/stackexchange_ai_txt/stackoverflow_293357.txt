The exact same error is reported on the HAP home page's discussion, but it looks like no meaningful fixes have been made to the project in a few years. Not encouraging. A quick browse of the source suggests the error might be fixable by commenting out line 92 of HtmlNode.cs: // they sometimes contain, and sometimes they don 't... ElementsFlags.Add("option", HtmlElementFlag.Empty); (Actually no, they always contain label text, although a blank string would also be valid text. A careless author might omit the end-tag, but then that's true of any element.) ADD An equivalent solution is calling HtmlNode.ElementsFlags.Remove("option"); before any use of liberary (without need to modify the liberary source code)
