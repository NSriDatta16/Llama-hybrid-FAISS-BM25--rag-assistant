There are a lot of alternatives. But having SQLite which gives you SQL power combined with no fuss of file based storage, there is no need to look for these alternatives. SQLite is light enough to be used in cell phones and MP3 players, so I don't see how it could be considered an overkill. So unless your application needs something very specific, don't bother. Most alternatives are a lot harder to use and have less performance.
