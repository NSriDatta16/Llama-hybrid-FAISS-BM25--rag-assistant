IMHO, If you want to modify packets you'll need something to talk to the hardware, a driver of some kind. If you do not want to use your own, you should get a 3rd party driver to inter-operate with. For filtering there's libraries like: winpcap or libpcap. Also have a look here: http://www.ntkernel.com/w&p.php?id=7 Another link: http://bittwist.sourceforge.net/ Hope this helps!
