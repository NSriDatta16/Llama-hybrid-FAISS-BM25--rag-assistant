jquery jScrollPane ipad issue

I am pulling my hair out with an scroll issue with iPad/iPhone... I am using the fantastic jScrollPane plugin which works a treat on desktop browsers but on iPad/iPhone the div doesnt scroll (to do with touch events or something?) I have tried all the fixes: http://snipplr.com/view/41051/jscrollpane-ipadiphoneipodios-scoll-support/ (i think old version of jScrollPane so not sure where this fits in) http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/ just didnt work full stop seemingly https://github.com/aFarkas/jScrollPane/commit/553612cb26a390004a9aa63ab0511e2b668bcf8c#diff-1 script/jquery.touchdrag.js: applied and didnt seem to work either Any ideas anyone? My client is impatient :/ A.
