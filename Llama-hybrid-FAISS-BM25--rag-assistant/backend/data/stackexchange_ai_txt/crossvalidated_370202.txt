How to remove the effect of one variable by using linear model residuals

My data set has species with a number of morphological variables, including body mass: species mass skull wing a 10 4 4 b 15 3 5 c 30 2 6 d 40 5 9 But I want to look at a PCA of my data while controlling for body mass. Is it appropriate to conduct regression models of skull ~ body mass & wing ~ body mass and use the residuals of these models in my PCA?
