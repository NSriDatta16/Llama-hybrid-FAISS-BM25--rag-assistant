You can use preg_replace() : $add = 'and'; $variable = 'put returns between paragraphs'; echo preg_replace("~\W\w+\s*$~", ' ' . $add . '\\0', $variable); Prints: put returns between and paragraphs This will ignore trailing whitespaces, something @jensgram's solution doesn't. (eg: it will break if your string is $variable = 'put returns between paragraphs ' . Of course you can use trim() , but why bother to waste more memory and call another function when you can do it with regex ? :-)
