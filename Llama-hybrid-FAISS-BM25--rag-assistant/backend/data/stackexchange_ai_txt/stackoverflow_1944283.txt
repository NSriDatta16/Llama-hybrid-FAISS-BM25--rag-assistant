Directly with app engine I dont think this is possible. My understanding of how AppEngine works (which I admit is fairly limited) indicates that it would be possible to have a series of services that work together to accomplish this. Basically you need a service which is a proxy for your storage system, and one which is a proxy for your build service (both of these cannot be on AppEngine). AppEngine can then monitor these services performing the relevant copy and build metaphors. If the thing being built is in itself an application you could automatically deploy it, and then use the AppEngine service to connect to it and test it. I dont think it would be more effective than having a local CI instance, and it woul, at least in the short term be more complicated to setup and maintain. Again, my current understanding of AppEngine is limited to only what I have used it for with Google Wave and a few other small projects.
