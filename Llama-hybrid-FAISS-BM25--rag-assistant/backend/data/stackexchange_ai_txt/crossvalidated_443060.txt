Calculating the the Probability of a sample

The Automobile Association gave the average price of unleaded petrol in Sweden as 14,63 Swedish Krona (SK) per litre in June 2012. Assume this price is the population mean, and that the population standard deviation is sd = 1 SK. What is the probability that the mean price for a sample of 30 petrol stations is within 0,25 SK of the population mean? This is a Question from our University without any way of solution. The result is:0,8296 My way to solve sd=1 mean =14.63 rnorm2 the solution is in my calculation:0.8174258 How should i solve this kind of excercises?
