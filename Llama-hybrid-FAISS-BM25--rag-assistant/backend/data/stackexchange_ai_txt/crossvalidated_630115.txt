The type of method you are looking for here is annomally/outlier detection. The most basic way that I can think of doing this would be to understand from what statistical distribution your data comes and using this distribution to detect highly unlikely values. From what you described, we can affirm that your data contains only non-negative values and lower values are more likely than higher ones (and that there is an upper bound of one that probably nevers really happens). This could be fitted into the family of exponential distributions . That said, is very important to note that nothing can be affirmed here for sure without seeing the data itself and maybe without more understating of the process that generates this data. It is possible that something as simple as: fitting an exponential distribution on the average of your past data getting a higher bound on the 95% percentile works for you. It is also possible that this approach gets to an upper bound that is much higher (or lower) than what makes sense to your problem. It depends on the data and what you want from it.
