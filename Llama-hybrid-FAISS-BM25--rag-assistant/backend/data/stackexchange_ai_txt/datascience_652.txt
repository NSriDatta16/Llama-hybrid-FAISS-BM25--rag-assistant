Simply, one common approach is to increase the complexity of the model, making it simple, and most probably underfitting at first, and increasing the complexity of the model until early signs of overfitting are witnessed using a resampling technique such as cross validation, bootstrap, etc. You increase the complexity either by adding parameters (number of hidden neurons for artificial neural networks, number of trees in a random forest) or by relaxing the regularization (often named lambda, or C for support vector machines) term in your model.
