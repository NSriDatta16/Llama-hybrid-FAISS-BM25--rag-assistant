Short answer: No, that won't work. Longer answer: If I were new to statistics, I would not try to analyze time series on my own. In fact, even though I did data analysis for 25 years, I would not try to do time series on my own. It is very tricky and very easy to go wrong. If a client came to me with a time series problem, I would not take it on. For one thing, cyclic data are not monotonic. "Monotonic" means constantly increasing or decreasing. For another, when you have two variables that are closely related to time, it is extremely easy to find spurious correlations. For instance, if you plot sales of ice cream and shark attacks over time, you will find a strong correlation. Or the Dow Jones with the number of cell phones. Or all sorts of things. I suggest you either hire a consultant or, if you are at a university, find a colleague in the statistics department who can help you for co-authorship on a paper.
