What is linear separability of classes and how to determine

This question may seem too trivial but my basics are not strong and I shall appreciate help in these concepts. For an n dimensional feature vector and 3 class problem does linear separability need to be checked?, I am familiar with XOR problem which cannot be modeled by neural network since the class is not linearly separable. What exactly do we mean by linearly separable? If the class boundary can be drawn as a curve and we can divide the patterns into 2 classes then can it be called linearly separable? How to decide if the classes are linearly separable? Does linear separability apply to more than 2 class problem? Say for 3 classes, how does one decide? Thank you.
