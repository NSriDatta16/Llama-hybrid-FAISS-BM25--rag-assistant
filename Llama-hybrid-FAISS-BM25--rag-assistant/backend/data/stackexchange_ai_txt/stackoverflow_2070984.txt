Can't you just send the big JSON data with the GET request body, instead of creating the temp resource? Although it's not 100% kosher, i've found it works nicely with firefox and IE and IMO, the querystring is inelegant and usually exposes implementation details that don't belong in the URI. Just make sure to add a cache buster querystring parameter if you need up-to-date data because the server will ignore the data when determining whether it can return a cached response. See here for a discussion of pros and cons of stuffing data in the GET request body.
