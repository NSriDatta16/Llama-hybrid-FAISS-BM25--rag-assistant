While rearranging the order you declare data members inside your struct is fine, it should be emphasized that overriding the default alignment by using #pragma s and such is a bad idea unless you know exactly what you're doing. Depending on your compiler and architecture, attempting to access unaligned data, particularly by storing the address in a pointer and later trying to dereference it, can easily give the dreaded Bus Error or other undefined behavior.
