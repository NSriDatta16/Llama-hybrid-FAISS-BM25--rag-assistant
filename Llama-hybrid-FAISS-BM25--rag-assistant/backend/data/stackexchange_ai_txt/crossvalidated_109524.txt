A logistic regression is a good place to start. However, I would also recommend you look at modeling in the area of loss given default (LGD), since LGD = 1 - recovery rate (RR). You sound like you're trying to model a recovery rate, so a simple transformation of LGD may be one way to attack this. In LGD modeling, it's commonly observed that loss distributions are bi-modal; you tend to lose very little or a lot. So, think about that before getting too far into using a logit. I don't know what kind of data you have/don't have, but if the data doesn't fit a logistic model, be prepared to take another approach. No use in trying to fit data into a poorly spec'd model.
