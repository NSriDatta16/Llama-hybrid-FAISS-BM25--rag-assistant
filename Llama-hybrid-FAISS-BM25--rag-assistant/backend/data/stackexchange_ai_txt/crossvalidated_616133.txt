Standard ANOVA requires a continuous outcome. You don't have that. You are evaluating binary dead/alive event outcomes, with not all individuals necessarily experiencing an event over the period of observation ("right-censored" event times). That calls for some type of survival analysis. With only 3 observation times, however, the continuous-time survival analysis represented by methods like Kaplan-Meier curves don't work so well. "Survival analysis" in this situation can be set up simply as a binomial regression (e.g., logistic regression) that evaluates the probability of death within each time period as a function of the drug treatment.
