What subjects in statistics should I focus on to determine the optimal time to to quit a game of chance while I'm ahead?

I am trying to answer the question: Given a game of chance with a "house edge" E (defined below), what is the maximum "amount ahead" A (defined below) when I should exit the game, if I want to achieve probability P that I will not run out of money if I bring bankroll B (defined below)? E is defined as the average amount lost per bet, as a proportion of the amount of the bet. (e.g. 2% ) B is defined the amount you bring to the game (the maximum you are willing to lose, e.g. $500 ) A is the amount you are ahead of your starting amount, e.g. A=$50 means that you have won $50 , e.g., you started with $500 and now have $550 . P is the probability of not losing all my money ( B ) before getting ahead by A that I am willing to tolerate (e.g. 90% ) I am trying to define function f , such that A = f(P,B,E) For example, in this statement: With a house edge of 2% , and a bankroll of $500 , you should leave when you are $50 ahead, if you want a 90% probability of not running out of money the variables would be: E =0.02, B =500, A =50, P =0.9 for A =f( P , B , E ) NOTE: I'm not sure if this question belongs on this site or on mathematics .
