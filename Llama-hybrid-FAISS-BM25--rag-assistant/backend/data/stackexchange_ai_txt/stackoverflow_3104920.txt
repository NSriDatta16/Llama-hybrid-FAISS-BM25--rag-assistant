A non-floated container will not recognise its contents as having and width or height, causing the container to collapse to its minimum allowed height given any other CSS rules in place. For the paragraph and image to be constrained by the containing list element, you will need to float both the list element and the parent ordered list. Both the ordered list and the list elements will then reduce to the minimum width required to presentationally encapsulate the content. This may result in an overly-thin list. Apply suitable widths to the ordered list and the list items to handle this. Consider clearing any elements immediately below the ordered list in the DOM to ensure they don't slip in to the left or right of the list.
