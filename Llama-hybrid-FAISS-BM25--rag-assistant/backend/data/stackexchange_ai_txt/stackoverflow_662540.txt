Why can't I enter text in Winform hosted in ATL dialog?

I am working on embedding winform controls into an ATL dialog (see here for how I did so far). Now I have encountered a rather strange problem. For some reason, the text fields in my winforms display fine, but I am unable to change the text in them by typing on the keyboard. However, I can copy and paste text from elsewhere into the text field and it is then treated as normal input (event for text change is fired etc.). How do I get the text fields to behave normally and allow text input via keyboard? Any hints?
