I have seen this behavior on one of my sites as well. In my case the issues began just after the hosting provider had moved my site to their new SAN-solution. It turned out that this new storage solution did not support "file system watchers". And without it IIS would never receive any notification of when a file has been updated or not. The workaround they introduced was to move the applications into new application pools with regular intervals. (This gives the symptoms you are describing with updates only being applied at regular intervals.) The only solution I found was to move my sites to a different hosting provider.
