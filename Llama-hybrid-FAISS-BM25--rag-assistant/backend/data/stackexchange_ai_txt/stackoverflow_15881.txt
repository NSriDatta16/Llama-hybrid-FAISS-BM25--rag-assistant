You can't force developers to do something they do not have an incentive of using for; unfortunately wikis, like documentation (well, in fact wikis are documentation) rarely have any "cool" value for developers. Besides, they're already deep into dev work -- could you really bother them with a wiki? That being said, the people who pushed for the wiki (e.g., you) should be primarily responsible for updating it, and you really would have a lot of work cut out for you if you're serious about it. You might also try the ff: It's not very structured you say -- a lot of people get turned off from ill-structured (hard-to-search/browse) wikis. So maybe you can fix that first Maybe you can ask lead developers/project managers to populate it with things that are issues for them: things like code conventions and API design for your particular project Lead by example: religiously document your part of the system. Setting a precedent may encourage others to do the same
