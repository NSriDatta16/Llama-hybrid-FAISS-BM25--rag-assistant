Is it possible to download a binary file from JSP?

I think is it quite possible, but I'm not sure. I don't have the possibility to use servlet directly, so I'm forced to use JSP ( long history, short time, you don't want to hear ) So I think something like the following will do: // PSEUDO-CODE: // source.jsp Download your file MyDocument.doc // file.jsp byte[] data = getBinaryFromSomeWhere(); int start = 0; int end = data.length Don't put too much attention to the code. It only shows the idea. It writes the bynary array to the jsp output stream. Is it possible? Does it sounds reasonable? Is there a JSTL or other thing that already handles that?
