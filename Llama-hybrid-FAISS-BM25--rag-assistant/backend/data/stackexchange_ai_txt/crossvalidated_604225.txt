How to use validation set in the time series while doing a naive forecast?

I need to do a naive time series forecasting as a benchmark. Therefore, I should split my dataset into train, validation, and test sets. If I divide the the dataset into train and test sets, the code will be as follows: library(fpp2) library(forecast) data(ausbeer) train How about if I want to use the data during 2005-2007 as my validation set? Could you please let me know how to compute the model's performance on the validation set? I read this post about sliding/rolling window and expanding window and this page. As I know the tscv is based on expanding window. e When we use a naive forecasting method, how to obtain the performance on the train, validation, and test sets?
