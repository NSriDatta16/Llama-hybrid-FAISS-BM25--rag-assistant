Fama MacBeth vs. Pooled OLS

I have an unbalanced panel of monthly bond returns and would like to regress them on several possible return-drivers. There is cross-sectional correlation in the residuals. In this case, Peterson shows that there are two ways to estimate the model (Peterson (2009): Estimating Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches ): Fama MacBeth (by using the pmg() function in R): In the first step, pmg() runs cross sectional regressions for every single month. In the second step the average over the estimates is taken. The standard deviations of the cross-sectional regression estimates are used to generate the sampling Errors for these estimates. Fama_MacBeth Pooles OLS with standard Errors clustered by time OLS_Pooling My results below are quite different for Pooled OLS and Fama MacBeth. I know that some degree od deviation is normal, but in my case even some positive and negativ signs are different. Dependent variable: ---------------------------- R coefficient mean test groups Pooled OLS Fama MacBeth (1) (2) ------------------------------------------------ Beta.DEF -0.093 0.061* (0.061) (0.034) SIZE -0.131*** -0.043** (0.020) (0.017) MOMENTUM -0.007 0.008 (0.054) (0.014) VOLA -0.257*** -0.022 (0.051) (0.017) Value -0.128*** 0.019*** (0.023) (0.007) Rating 0.180*** -0.013*** (0.015) (0.003) Duration 0.073*** 0.021* (0.017) (0.012) Liquidity 0.004* 0.027*** (0.002) (0.005) Constant -2.386*** -1.432*** (0.140) (0.099) ------------------------------------------------ Observations 335,369 R2 0.378 ================================================ Note: *p Do you have any suggestion how to deal with these results? Any idea what went wrong? Thanks in advance for your help!
