Why is the difference between 2 time series drawn from the same process not White Noise?

I take the difference between 2 time series (each with 200,000 observations) drawn from the same ARMA(2,1) process and find that (at least the first 1000 observations of) this difference looks like White Noise (visually; for what it is worth; see top plot) but the ACF plot and Breusch-Godfrey test suggest it is not White Noise. Shouldn't I expect the difference to be White Noise? If so, where have I made the mistake(s)? library(forecast) library(lmtest) par(mfrow=c(2,1)) set.seed(1000) simA1
