I'll just add an extra answer building on what userOVER9000 suggested, if anybody else are interested. The below is an example of using nauty on Example 2, through the dreadnaut tool. $ ./dreadnaut Dreadnaut version 2.4 (64 bits). > n=8 d g -- Starting a new 8-node digraph 0 : 1 3 4; -- Entering edge data 1 : 0 2 5; 2 : 3 1 6; 3 : 0 2 7; 4 : 0; 5 : 1; 6 : 2; 7 : 3; > cx -- Calling nauty (1 3)(5 7) level 2: 6 orbits; 5 fixed; index 2 (0 1)(2 3)(4 5)(6 7) level 1: 2 orbits; 4 fixed; index 4 2 orbits; grpsize=8; 2 gens; 6 nodes; maxlev=3 tctotal=8; canupdates=1; cpu time = 0.00 seconds > o -- Output "orbits" 0:3; 4:7; Notice it suggests joining nodes 0:3 which are a:d in Example 2 and 4:7 which are e:h . The nauty algorithm is not well documented, but the authors describe it as exponential worst case, n^2 average.
