Should highly correlated features be omitted before applying Lasso?

I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know whether I should omit highly correlated features before using Lasso logistic regression ( L1 ) to do feature selection. In fact, I want to use logistic regression with L1 to do prediction as well as feature selection. However, some of my features are highly correlated e.g., -1 or 0.9. Should I omit them before applying Lasso or let the Lasso decide it? Really, I read in Mr. Raschkaâ€™s book (Python Machine Learning ) that regularization is a very useful method to handle collinearity (high correlation among features). However, this kernel (by referring to Wikipedia ) states that keeping correlated features in the model would adversely affect the feature selection but it doesn't impair the predictions.
