Run time complexity of nearest neighbor

A paper titled, " Efficient Neighbor Searching in Nonlinear Time Series Analysis (1996) " download link mentions that the time complexity for the naive NN approach is $N^2/2$ i.e., $O(N^2/2)$ where $N$ denotes the number of datapoints. I have attached a screenshot from the paper where this complexity is mentioned (second paragraph). However, in textbooks it is mentioned that the complexity of $O(N)$ . I am a bit confused. Can somebody please help, what is the correct answer and why $O(N^2/2)$ is mentioned in the paper.
