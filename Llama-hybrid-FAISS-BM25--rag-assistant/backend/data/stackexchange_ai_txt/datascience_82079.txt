Reducing training data to a smaller subset for neural network regression task

I have a large dataset of several billion inputs of categorical attributes. The neural network performs a regression task. Since I want to train the model, but not always use all of the data, how can I find a representative subset of the data that is representative for the whole dataset, while capturing the dependencies and generalizing to the other data? Currently I found only approaches for classification and ordinal attributes, where they find centroids as representatives, but for categorical data this is not useful.
