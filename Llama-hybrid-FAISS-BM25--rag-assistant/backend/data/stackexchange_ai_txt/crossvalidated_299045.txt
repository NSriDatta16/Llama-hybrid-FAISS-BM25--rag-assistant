Your strategy could lead to overfitting, and I would discourage it. It might reduce your training error (or validation error if you put similar data in the validation set), but the error reduction would be misleading -- all your neural net would need to do to look like it improved is repeat what it has already done, which should be easy. At best you will only reinforce what the net already knows.
