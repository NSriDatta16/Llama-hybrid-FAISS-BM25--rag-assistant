A text file is a text file. By definition it can not have a representation of an image bitmap. You could "persist" image data into a text file e.g. by first Base64 encoding it. You can later decode that data when you read from the file, in order to retrieve your image. For all practical purposes this is still a very strange approach to image file storage. If - specifically - you are required to output UPC Barcodes, then you could perhaps solve this by writing the codes as ASCII patterns: ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ █ ███ █ █ █ ██ ██ █ █ █ ██ █ █ ███ █ ███ M E A N I N G L E S S █ █ U P C █ ███ █ Since you are bringing the file into a report viewer (for which I assume you will be writing some code), then you probably don't need the visual data in the text file at all. All you need to keep in the text file would be The type of Barcode regime to be used The underlying alphanumeric information which is supposed to be represented in the code When you load the file in the viewer you could render a visual barcode using a Barcode Generator
