I think you might be better off creating some sort of "drag handle" to the element underneath, which would always be visible (at least while dragging is enabled). That, or a separate UI control separated from the images which would act as a "joystick" for the draggable image, so that you could move the image without having to manually drag/drop the image itself. Think about it: lets say they drag the item underneath the top item, then drop it; how are they to pick it up again? If this is setup like you explained ( a cut-out hole for a face like you might find at an amusement park ), then the user would not be able to visibly see the element underneath, and as such, it would be impossible for them to interact with that element using the mouse.
