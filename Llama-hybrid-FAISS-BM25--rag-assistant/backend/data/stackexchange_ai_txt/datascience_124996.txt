How to represent output layer if the action size changes dynamically?

I am new to ML and I need to train a chess agent using proximal policy optimization. Board is represented as string and the environment gives a list of valid moves for each step. # Set your environment parameters input_size = 64 # Assuming a flat representation of the chess board as input output_size = len(legal_moves) # Number of legal moves in your chess environment # Initialize the PPO agent agent = PPOAgent(input_size, output_size) At the beginning, there is this initialization of the agent with the number of valid moves at the beginning of the game as output layer size. However, in each time step, valid move size changes and how to represent and/or specify in the implementation?
