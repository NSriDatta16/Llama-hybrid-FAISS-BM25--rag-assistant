How do you organize and keep track of multiple (many) projects

As a contractor, out-sourcer and shareware author,I have about 5-10 projects going on at any one time. Each project has a todo list, requirements need to be communicated to other outsources and employees, status needs to be given to clients, and developer's questions need to be answered. Sometimes it is too much... but then I realize that I'm not very organized and there has to be a better way. What is your better way? How do you keep track of requirements for multiple projects, assign work to multiple developers, obtain and give status for multiple projects to multiple clients? What tools do you use? What processes?
