How does Apache Ivy resolve the variables in artifact patterns provided in the ivysettings.xml file?

If my ivysettings.xml file includes: And my ivy.xml file includes: From when I ran Ivy, I can tell that this resolves to: http://repository.springsource.com/ivy/bundles/external/org.junit/com.springsource.org.junit/4.4.0/com.springsource.org.junit-sources-4.4.0.jar So the resolutions go: [organization] => "org.junit" [module] => "com.springsource.org.junit" [revision] => "4.4.0" [artifact] => "com.springsource.org.junit-sources" [ext] => "jar" I see how ivy resolves the [organisation], [module], and [revision] in the URL pattern (duh), but how does it resolve [artifact] and [ext]? The documentation on the URL resolver seems to be lacking.
