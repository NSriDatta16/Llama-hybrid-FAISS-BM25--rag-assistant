Random forests are robust. They are not impacted by outliers. Gradient boosted trees are great at fitting or over fitting the data. The combination is fast, handles classical or categorical data, and can handle very large data. Random forests of gradient boosted trees easily handle problems of this complexity and size. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1755828
