After looking at it on the link you provided, the faded (dimmed) ones are the style rules that don't have any browser operations linked to them, for example: Click the little arrow next to background: you get a list of rules that Chrome uses to interpret your CSS. On float and height , there is pretty much only one way that can be interpreted and so Chrome doesn't need to add any browser specific styles to make it display as intended. Hope that helps to explain it :) Faded rules are rules that don't need any special attention from the browser :)
