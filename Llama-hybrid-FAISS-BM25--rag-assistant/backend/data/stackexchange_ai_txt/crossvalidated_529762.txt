It usually depends on the lead time. So if you on average can make the necessary changes at that 2 month lag then it is a fine window to use. If you have other constraints which means that 2 months is not enough time to do anything because it takes 5 months to get the products from the supplier then you will want to look at that longer lag for your accuracy.
