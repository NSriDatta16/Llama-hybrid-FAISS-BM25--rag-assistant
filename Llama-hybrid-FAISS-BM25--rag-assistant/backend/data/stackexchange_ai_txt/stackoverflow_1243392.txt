An alternative approach: Use Javascript to split up the Article in several column in the browser. Here I could imagine a full-automated approach could work. Advantages (over the first approach): As Javascript can know, which height the paragraphs actually have in the browser (unlinke PHP), you could find the optimum split more accurately. This can be implemented in the template php-File: you tell the template to include the js-File. So it could be made context-dependent, E.g.: If the left column is collapsed (because there are no modules in it), tell the JavaScript-File to initialize to 3 columns, else 2 columns. However, have in mind that it should rest usable for those who have Javascript disabled.
