Why is the importance of variable used in clustering proportional to its variance? Equation 14.27 ESL

Basically, I don't understand how the variance was derived here: $$ \overline{d}_j = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{i^{'}=1}^N(x_{ij}-x_{i^{'}j})^2 = 2 \cdot var_j $$ That is an equation 14.27 from Elements of Statistical Learning. Excerpt from section 14.3.3: The influence of the jth attribute Xj on object dissimilarity D(xi , xiâ€² ) depends upon its relative contribution to the average object dissimilarity measure over all pairs of observations in the data set $$ \overline{D} = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{i^{'}=1}^N D(x_{i},x_{i^{'}}) = \sum_{i^{'}=1}^N w_j \cdot \overline{d_j} $$ with $$ \overline{d}_j = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{i^{'}=1}^N d(x_{ij},x_{i^{'}j}) $$ Using squared-error distance (d(xij, xi'j)) for each coordinate, equation 14.27 can be found.
