Note: The CI is an interval for a population parameter not a sample estimate. In a nice case like this, the estimates will crop up in the endpoints of your interval. The (ordinary) F distribution for the ratio of estimates that you mention only holds when the parameters are equal. Directly useful for a test but with a CI - while it's still relevant - you need the population parameter in there since that's the thing you need an interval for. For CIs it helps if you can find a pivotal quantity . A pivot is a function of the variables and the parameter whose distribution doesn't depend on the parameter. A simple one exists in this case: Let $X_i$ be iid $\sim\text{Exp}(\beta_X)$ , $i=1,2,...,n_X$ , similarly for $Y_j$ , where here the $\beta$ parameter represents the scale, not the rate; $E(X_i)=\beta_X$ . We have $X_i / \beta_X\sim \text{Exp}(1)$ , so $X_i / \beta_X$ is pivotal for $\beta_X$ . Further, $2X_i/\beta_X \sim \text{Exp}(2)$ which is $\chi^2_2$ . Consequently $q_{X} = 2\sum_i X_i/\beta_{X}$ $\sim$ $\chi^2_{2n_{X}}$ , or $2n_X \bar{X}/\beta_X \sim \chi^2_{2n_X}$ Now consider: $$Q=\frac{q_X}{q_Y}=\frac{2n_X \bar{X}/\beta_X}{2n_Y \bar{Y}/\beta_Y} = \frac{\frac{n_X}{n_Y} \frac{\bar{X}}{\bar{Y}}}{\frac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}}$$ Let $\theta=\frac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}$ and $R =\frac{\bar{X}}{\bar{Y}}$ , and let $m=n_X/n_Y$ , so we have $Q = mR/\theta$ , and then $Q\sim F_{2n_x,2n_y}$ is a pivotal quantity for $\theta$ . Immediately, $P(a where $G$ is the cdf of the $F$ distribution with $2n_x,2n_y$ d.f., which probability we will choose to be $1-\alpha$ in order to attain that coverage (with a continuous pivot we can attain the coverage exactly). We can choose $a$ and $b$ in a variety of ways, but for now let's just take the "symmetric" (i.e. equal-tailed) interval, with $\alpha/2$ in each tail, with $a$ in the left tail of $Q$ and $b$ in its right tail. I will assume this part presents no difficulty. Then we have $P(a\, as the long run (i.e. frequentist) probability under repeated sampling. I am somewhat abusing notation (if I'm repeatedly sampling, I should have my notation talk about a distinct ratio random variable like $R$ for each sample, etc) but I don't want to go far into the weeds here; I'll hand-wave that detail for now. Now if $a\, then $\frac{1}{a}\,>\, \frac{\theta}{mR} \,>\frac{1}{b}$ , or $\frac{mR}{b} . Note that here the endpoints are now the random quantity, not the term in the middle. So given a sample, $\frac{mr}{b} is a $(1-\alpha)$ CI for $\theta$ , where $r = \frac{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}$ is the ratio of sample means, $m$ is the corresponding ratio of sample sizes, $a$ is the $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ quantile of an $F_{2n_x,2n_y}$ distribution and $b$ is the $1-\frac{\alpha}{2}$ quantile of the same distribution. Note that the lower limit of the interval for $Q$ (the $\alpha/2$ quantile of the $F$ distribution) appears on the denominator in the upper limit of the CI for $\theta$ , the ratio of the exponential means.
