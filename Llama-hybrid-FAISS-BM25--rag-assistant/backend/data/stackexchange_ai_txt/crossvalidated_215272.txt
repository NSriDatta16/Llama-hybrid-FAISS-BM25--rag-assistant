Below is my handwritten answer: (typo: pdf) This is my typed answer: $P_{NB}(X)= \left ( _{k}^{k+r-1}\textrm{} \right )(1-p)^{r}p^{k}$ $=\frac{(k+r-1)!}{k!(r-1)!}(1-p)^{\frac{1}{p}*rp}p^{k}$ $=\frac{(k+r-1)(k+r-2)...(k+1)}{(r-1)!}[(1-p)^{\frac{1}{p}}]^{rp}p^{k}$ $\approx \frac{k^{r-1}}{\Gamma (r)}e^{-rp}p^{k}$ The tricks are: 1.You have to use (1-p)^(1/p) is converged to e when p is small. 2.Gamma function(k) = (k+1)! 3.(r+x choose r ) converages to (r+x)(r+x-1)(r+x-2)...r / r! You will easily derive the formula with all the three above plugged in
