PCA with one "known" component

(The title might not be very clear, any recommendation welcome) I have a $1 + n$ dimensional dataset. The first dimension measures a specific concept I am interested in and the $n$ remaining dimensions measure "other stuff". I would like to summarize the $n$ dimensions to 1-3 dimensions, ending up with 2-4 dimensions if I include the first, and ideally the dimensions I end up with should be uncorrelated. In order to keep the resulting data easily interpretable, the first dimension should not be changed. However, the first dimension is highly correlated with some of the dimensions in the set of $n$ dimensions. What can I do to achieve this? I think the following approaches could (maybe potentially at least somewhat) work, but do not understand their pros/cons. Use PCA on the full $1+n$ dataset, but scale the first dimension way higher than the other $n$ to force the first component to be very close to the first dimension Use PCA only on the $n$ dimension, then use a linear model to find the effect of the first dimension, and take the residuals Use a linear model to find the effect of the first dimension on the remaining $n$ ones, then use PCA on the residuals
