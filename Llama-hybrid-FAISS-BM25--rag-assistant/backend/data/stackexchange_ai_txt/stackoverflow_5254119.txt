Looking for a customizable horizontal accordion script using jQuery

Does anyone know of a jQuery script for a horizontal accordion that allows for varied-width panels when collapsed? The site http://www.royalalberthall.com/ has the functionality I'm looking for, but uses Scriptaculous/Prototype. Would prefer to use jQuery. I found a similar, pure JS version, but am unsure how I might change it to get different sized collapsed panels. I set this example up at JSFiddle, so if anyone wants to tinker, please do. Any help or suggestions is much appreciated!
