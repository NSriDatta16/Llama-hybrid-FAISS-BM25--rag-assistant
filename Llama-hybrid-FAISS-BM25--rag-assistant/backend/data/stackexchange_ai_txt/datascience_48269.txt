What does it mean to take the "average" of two decision trees by 'voting'

I have heard, in relation to random forest algorithm, that the algorithm will fit many decision trees and take the average of them by votes. (This is related to bagging as well) I understand what the average means for something example such as $\vec{x}=[1,2,3], \; \bar{x} =2 $ . But I don't know what it would mean if I had two decision trees. Could anyone please provide a simple example / explanation of this averaging process for a couple of decision trees?
