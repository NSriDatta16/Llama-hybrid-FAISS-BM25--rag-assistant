Policy for storing configuration files in SVN

The majority of our C# projects configuration is kept in *.ini files. Mainly these files hold many sections affecting all aspects of programs behaviour. But besides of regular configuration data some of sections are vulnerable like db connection string or server password. We try to keep this sections in following forms: [Database] user=testuser database=testdb password= But when developer is testing application he must fill the config in order to start application. It is quite common that some of the passwords are commited into version control. Because these files are indispensable for application they cannot be included in .svnignore. Probably what I'm looking for is some kind of script (maybe in powershell). That would scan all *.ini files and erase all passwords. The most interesting solution would be adding some external password storage that can be used both to encode and decode passwords in *.ini files.
