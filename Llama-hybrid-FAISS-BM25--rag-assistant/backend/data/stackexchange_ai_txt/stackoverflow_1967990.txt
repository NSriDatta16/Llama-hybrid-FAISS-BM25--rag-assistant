rubyj handling large number of files

I believe File.foreach('input.txt') would read file one line at a time. Could not fine any documentation on that though. Can anyone confirm that? Also I wanted to create a gigantic file to test the difference betwween File.forach and File.open . If the file is really large then File.open should fail and File.foreach should succeed. Anyone knows any nifty *nix trick to create a gigantic file really fast? Update: On further reading I found following different ways to read a file. Not sure which one would try to read all of them at the same time. Will try some cases and will update this post. f = File.open('input.txt') a = f.readlines f = File.open('input.txt') a = f.get f = File.open('input.txt') f.each_line{ |s| puts s}
