Managing Vim plugins

What's the best way to manage Vim plugins? Some plugins use Vimball, but I read somewhere that it was seriously broken, and manually dropping each plugin into ~/.vim/ results in a mess of files that are near impossible to update or organise. Is there a plugin-manager for Vim that functions similarly to Linux package managers? Or can plugins be reorganised into their own directories to make administering them easier?
