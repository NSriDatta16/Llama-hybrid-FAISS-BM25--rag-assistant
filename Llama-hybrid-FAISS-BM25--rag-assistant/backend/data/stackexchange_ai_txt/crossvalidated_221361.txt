Standard deviation of sample mean - unknown equation answered

Does anyone recognize mathematically or statistically what this formula's purpose is. If it is not statistically useful what does dividing a value by a constant and taking a square root mean? For example taking a sum values divided by total number of values equates to average. If I can get the mathematical name of this operation. N in this case being the number of samples in a set. $\sqrt{\sigma^2/N}$ This is relevant to another larger question I posted but felt that this may be useful by itself.
