using lstm or rnn's for time series data is like using a hammer to swat a fly. have you tried time series modeling using classical stat techniques ARCH, ARIMA etc ? the issue of using individual number as inputs (which is what your speedometer is going to give you) means that the states in each lstm / gru cell or unit will have like a 1x1 matrix , meaning 1 parameter. The reason lstm's have been so good with languages is that languages have words / chars and each of them have rich emeddings / encoding schema's that allow the weight matrics inside the lstm cells to have sufficiently large number of params allowing for better generalization. In your case, once u pass single digits of a sequence (i dont know your data so maybe you do have some form of encoding), your model will most likely overfit and perform poorly on real world data. Stat models on the other hand work on generalizing co-effecients for different variables in your system and are, in my view, far better BUT if you do have other features that you can pass and have a rich enough contextual representation of your input data, then nothing comes close to lstm's and even transformers
