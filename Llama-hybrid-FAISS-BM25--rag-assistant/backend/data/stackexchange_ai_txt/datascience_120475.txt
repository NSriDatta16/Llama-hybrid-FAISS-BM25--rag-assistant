Regression with time series data

I want to predict temperature when time (datetime type, hourly data for five months) and humidity is given. Before starting in python, I created a regression model in excel. But instead of predicting temperature, it gives date as an answer. On looking up the internet, I found that one can not do regression with datetime format. So some sources I looked upon have used datetime.toordinal() to convert dates to numerical Gregorian value. But my problem has date and time together. Will this method work with time too? If yes, how does it convert datetime? I need an efficient way to deal with datetime here, since it is vital in predicting the temperature being highly dynamic.
