If your randomization process is exogenous to the relationships you are measuring, your results should be unbiased. If you are interested in click-through rates of the different treatments, you will be considering at the differences in the average rate. The number of items in each bucket will influence your confidence in the average rate you come up with and, by extension, your confidence that this value is different from another treatment. But the number of items in the bucket won't bias the average. In cases where you want to compare the distribution of some qualities between two populations to see if the distributions are different, you can't select on those qualities because the size of the buckets is what you are investigating. It's critical to not select on your dependent variable. But it doesn't sounds like you're doing that here. In fact, if your randomization process is any good, you probably won't have exactly the same number of items in each bucket. And that's fine. :)
