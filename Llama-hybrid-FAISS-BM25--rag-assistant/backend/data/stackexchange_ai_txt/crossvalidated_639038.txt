In general, there are three types of nonparametric scale estimators: Quantile differences (Range/Interquartile range), Bickel-Lehmann dispersion (median absolute deviation, standard deviation, average absolute deviation, any estimators defined using a location estimator to estimate the deviations of all points relative to the location estimate of the sample can be seen in this class), and Bickel-Lehmann spread (besides the estimators proposed in Bickel and Lehmann's landmark paper, the popular Rousseeuwâ€“Croux estimator and Gini's mean difference also can be seen in this class since they are a modification of the pairwise differences). Estimators belong to the class, Bickel-Lehmann spread, are the optimal approach in terms of variance, but their computational cost is often much higher than others. This is because the variance is mainly dependent on the sample size/pseudo sample size and the standard deviation of the underlying distribution, this principle is governed by the Central Limit Theorem (although CLT is about the sample mean, the principle can be extended to other estimators, asymptotic normality). Suppose the sample size is n, the median absolute deviation is essentially estimating the median of all n absolute deviations, so, the pseudosample size, i.e., the acutual size related to the median is also n. The Bickel-Lehmann spread is the location of all n^2 pairwise differences, so the pseudosample size is n^2. The quantile differences (Range/Interquartile range) is just computing two quantiles, so the pseudosample size is 2. Another factor is the distribution of pseudosample. If just considering the sample size, you might conclude that the quantile differences is much much worse than Bickel-Lehmann dispersion and spread, which is indeed not the case, they are just slightly worse. This is because, the distribution of pseudosample is a high kurtosis, monotonic decreasing distribution for pairwise differences, as proven by Hodges and Lehmann in 1954 and further in my paper, Robust estimations for semiparametric models: Moments (Robust estimations for semiparametric models: Moments ( https://zenodo.org/records/8127703 )( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377974264_Robust_estimations_from_distribution_structures_Central_Moments ). As we know, the variance of a location estimator is linearly depending on the standard deviation of the underlying distribution, which is the advantage of quantile differences. However, the linear relation can be dominated by the square relation, so Bickel-Lehmann spread is still better even considering this factor. Bickel, P.J., Lehmann, E.L. (2012).
