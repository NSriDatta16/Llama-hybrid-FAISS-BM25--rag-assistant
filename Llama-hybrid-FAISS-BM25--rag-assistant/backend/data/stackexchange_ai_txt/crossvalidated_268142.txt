How does clogit() (in R) handle incomplete strata?

I am running conditional logistic regression in R using clogit() . I have 314 different strata with 1 case and 1 control in each stratum (628 observations in total). Several predictor variables have missing values, therefore 6 observations are excluded from the analysis. Now I have 622 observations with 310 events. Two strata now contain 0 case and 1 control. I thought such strata would be omitted from the analysis, however it is not the case. 622 residuals are reported. How does clogit handle strata where pairs have one value missing?
