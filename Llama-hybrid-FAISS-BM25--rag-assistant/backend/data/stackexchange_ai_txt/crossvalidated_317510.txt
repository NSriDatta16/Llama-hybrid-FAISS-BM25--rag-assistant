Can k-NN be ensembled?

Decision trees suffer from high variance. Random Forests were suggested as a way of ensembling DT to solve this problem, and were shown to perform well for several problems. k-NN are also high bias classifiers, so in theory the same approach could be used with them. But I haven't heard much about ensembles of k-NN learners. Is there a reason for this? can k-NN be ensembled and if not why?
