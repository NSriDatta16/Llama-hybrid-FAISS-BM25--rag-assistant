Some algorithms, such as SVM or Logistical regression, have possibility to add a weight to certain class, therefore fix the unbalanced issue. This really sounds like a job for Survival analysis, which is especially designed to answer questions like "When machine X fail" or "Which attribute influence the most the failure". You can simply start by plotting the Kaplan-Meier curve and then further stratify it by some attribute. Then you can try Cox regression model - it is useful to see the influence of an attribute on survival - the hazard ratio. But don't forget to verify the assumptions (functional form and proportional hazard). In R the Survival analysis is implemented very well, so don't be affraid. There is simple and short tutorial which might help.
