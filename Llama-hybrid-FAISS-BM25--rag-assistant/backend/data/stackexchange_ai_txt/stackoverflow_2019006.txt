Well, cookies are a standard mechanism of web authentication. Do you have any reason at all why you wouldn't want to use them? Are you sure you're not trying to invent a problem where there isn't any problem? Most serious websites I know of require the browser to accept cookies in order for the user to be authenticated. It's safe to assume that every modern browser supports them. There's an interesting article about cookieless ASP.NET that you should read. EDIT: @o.k.w: By default the session state is kept by ASP.NET in-process (read: in memory). Unless told explicitly by the configuration to store the session in the database (SQL Server is supported out-of-the-box), this won't result in a database hit. The stale session states will get purged from the in-process storage. Unfortunately, with default ASP.NET settings every cookieless request will result in a new session being created. Here's a detailed comparison of available session storage options: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586.aspx .
