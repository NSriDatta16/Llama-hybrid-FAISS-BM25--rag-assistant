Classification when training set contains missing/unknown class labels

I have a set of data points that belong to two classes - class A and class B. I know that a subset of the data points belong to class A. But I have no idea of the classification of the remaining data points. This can arise in various settings. For example, if we ask people to respond with yes if they agree with something, then we cannot tell if those who don't respond do not agree with something or forget to respond. I wonder if it is possible to build/train a classifier using random forest or logistic regression or some other techniques, and how I can approach the problem.
