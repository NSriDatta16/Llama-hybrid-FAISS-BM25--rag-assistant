Have a look at this recent post by Jonathan Snook: http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors You'll see how browsers evaluate expressions and the reasoning behind why certain selectors are inefficient. A relevant quote from the post: CSS gets evaluated from right to left. To determine whether a CSS rule applies to a particular element, it starts from the right of the rule and works it's way left. If you have a rule like body div#content p { color: #003366; } then for every element—as it gets rendered to the page—it'll first ask if it's a paragraph element. If it is, it'll work its way up the DOM and ask if it's a div with an ID of content. If it finds what it's looking for, it'll continue its way up the DOM until it reaches the body. By working right to left, the browser can determine whether a rule applies to this particular element that it is trying to paint to the viewport much faster. To determine which rule is more or less performant, you need to figure out how many nodes need to be evaluated to determine whether a style can be applied to an element.
