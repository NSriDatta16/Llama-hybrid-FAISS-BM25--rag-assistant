Typedef is from a language syntax point of view in the storage class specifier group together with extern and static (*), and thus typedef has the same placement as those. It does not obviously belong to this group, but I guess it was probably where it was least mis-placed. (*) Storage class also includes auto and register , but nobody uses those any more.
