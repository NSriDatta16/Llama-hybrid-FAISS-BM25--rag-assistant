Alternative data standardization procedures before PCA analysis

I'm working with morphometric data including 50 different variables (with very different scales) measured in 180 individuals (these 180 individuals belong to 4 different groups which received different treatments) and I'm trying to analyze these data by PCA in order to identify the variables, or combinaisons of variables, which are the most useful to discriminate these individuals. If I understand things correctly, Z-Score is classically used to standardize data before PCA analysis in order to obtain variables with a mean = 0 and SD = 1 . However, most of my data are not normally distributed . This will thus affect the "quality" of the standardization since Z-Scores are based on the mean and SD of the data. Therefore, I'm trying to use Robust Z-Scores (based on median and MAD) instead of the classical Z-Scores. After standardization by the Robust Z-Scores, all my variables have a median = 0 and a MAD = 0.67 . I'd like to know if the standardization based on Robust Z-Scores (Median & MAD) instead of classical Z-Scores (Mean & SD) is suitable for PCA analysis. Thanks a lot for your precious help !
