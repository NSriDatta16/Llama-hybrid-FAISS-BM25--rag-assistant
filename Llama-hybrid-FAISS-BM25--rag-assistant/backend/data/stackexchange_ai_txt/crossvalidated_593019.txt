I'd suggest using something similar to "Permutation Feature Importance". Assuming you have a metric that you've decided is the best way to determine how accurate your model is, you can calculate a mean decrease in accuracy for each "permuted" feature. For each feature (and only one feature at a time) shuffle the labels and re-train your model and score your test data recording the accuracy. (Could use k-fold cross validation). Repeat the shuffling of labels 10-100x. Perform this for every feature recording the drop in accuracy. Rank the features by their mean decrease in accuracy, the feature with the largest drop in accuracy could be considered the "most informative". Please note, many Random Forest packages do something similar. https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01489
