Beware: I find 'endless scroll' annoying. It messes up the scroll-thumb as an indicator of position, with surprise changes and pauses. At some point it will become unwieldy -- the 'hundreds of posts' scenario you mention -- unless there's even more complexity (discarding items off the top when you're deep, offering random access). But, consider how Google Reader, the example you cite, deals with the problem: you rarely navigate away from the endless-scroll window. Some per-item operations (tagging) happen inline, but most links open in another window to sidestep the issue entirely. If you go off to change settings, then 'return to google reader' your scroll-position returns to the top -- so maybe it's not that big of a deal. (Though notably: when you return, the extent of the list is all the previously-loaded items -- not the original just-top-loaded. More on this below.) I would consider non-modal in-place editing -- the edit box inserts in the scroll area, atop or adjacent to the item being edited. Or, if the one key bit of continuity is you want to send people back to view exactly the item they just edited, make sure the 'return to list' link includes a pointer to the one place the view should auto-roll-to (for example, in the #fragment anchor). Further, if either your code or the browser have effectively cached the hundreds to preceding items (as I noted above Google Reader appears to do), the roll-forward should be instantaneous, with no reloading necessary.
