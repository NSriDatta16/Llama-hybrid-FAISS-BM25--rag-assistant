I believe that some way to organize the components in visible groups on screen could be nice... I have a report DM which have tons of datasets, dataset providers and Rave DataSources (circa 40 components).... If I could create some groups to differentiate which is used in what report. But this in DM designer itself, not on a separate drawing space...
