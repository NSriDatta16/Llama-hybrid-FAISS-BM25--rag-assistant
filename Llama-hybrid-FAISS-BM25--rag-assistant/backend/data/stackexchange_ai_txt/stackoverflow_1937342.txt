Is it worth starting with Python 3, or is it still too poorly supported with ports of modules from previous versions? depends on which modules do you want to use. twisted is a "swiss knife" for the network programming and could be a choice for your project but unfortunately it does not support python3 yet. Are there any great advantages in using Python 3 for my particular project? Would I be better off looking at using other languages instead, such as Erlang? only you can answer your question because only you know your knowledge. Using python3 instead of python2 you get all the advantages of new features the python3 brings with him and the disadvantage that non all libraries support python3 at the moment. note that python2.6 should implements most (if not all) of the features of python3 while it should be compatible with python2.5 but i did not investigated a lot in this way. both python and erlang are candidates for your needs, use what you know best and what you like most. Is there any great advantage in using a relational database within a game server? you get all the advantages and disadvantage of having a ACID storage system.
