simulate click on link in html

Could someone please take a look at his link; its safe but if not comfortable just look at next paragraph. http://blog.isao.net/ When you look at the source page there is a link at the src tag How would I activate this link from vb.net since when you click on it all the html content appears and when I use the webbrowser control to navigate to it, I get the same original html. Any ideas deeply appreciated. I also tried using web1.Document.InvokeScript(url) but this just does not work.
