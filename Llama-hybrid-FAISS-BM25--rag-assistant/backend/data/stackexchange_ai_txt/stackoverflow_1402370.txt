When should I use genetic algorithms as opposed to neural networks?

Is there a rule of thumb (or set of examples) to determine when to use genetic algorithms as opposed to neural networks (and vice-versa) to solve a problem? I know there are cases in which you can have both methods mixed, but I am looking for a high-level comparison between the two methods.
