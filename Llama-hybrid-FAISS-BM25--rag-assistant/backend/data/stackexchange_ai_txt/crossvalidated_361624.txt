Unless they're equal, they are statistically different. Your selection of the threshold for statistical significance is going to determine whether or not it (somewhat arbitrarily in this case of just a single store) is significantly different. Are you actually doing this for many stores, looking at each one individually vs its recent average? @Ramnath Takiar gave several ways you could do the test. You could also just use a simple % or nominal value (if it is +/- $150, or +/- 10%).
