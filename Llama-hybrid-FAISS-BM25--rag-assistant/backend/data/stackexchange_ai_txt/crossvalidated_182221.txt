regression with factors (from factor analysis)

I have n=100 and measures =500. Using dimensionality reduction, I want to contruct latent variables with 500 variables and test each factors in an anova model.What is the nest approach to create latent variables. I was looking at R function factanal which is uses ML approach. My matrix is singular and it gave me an error. I tried removing the variables which are highly correlated , still it doesnt work .Is there any other way to find which variables in my matrices can be made from other variables? When I tried R function principal from package psych , it gives me a warning The determinant of the smoothed correlation was zero. This means the objective function is not defined. Chi square is based upon observed residuals. The determinant of the smoothed correlation was zero. This means the objective function is not defined for the null model either. The Chi square is thus based upon observed correlations. Warning message: In cor.smooth(r) : Matrix was not positive definite, smoothing was done" Can I use the factors from this result for further regression or anova type of analysis . How are these two methods(factanl/principal) different?
