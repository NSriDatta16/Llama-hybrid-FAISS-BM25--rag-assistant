If you are planning to go with imputing values as a pre-processing step, I just want to add that it is better to impute missing values of multiple variables jointly because you will be able to better preserve relationships between those variables. The MICE algorithm should automatically take care of that for you. Here is an example of how MICE works when there are multiple variables with missing values: To make the chained equation approach more concrete, imagine a simple example where we have 3 variables in our dataset: age, income, and gender, and all 3 have at least some missing values. The MAR assumption would imply that the probability of a particular variable being missing depends only on the observed values, and that, for example, whether someone’s income is missing does not depend on their (unobserved) income. In step 1 of the MICE process, each variable would first be imputed using, e.g., mean imputation, temporarily setting any missing value equal to the mean observed value for that variable. Then in step 2 the imputed mean values of age would be set back to missing. In step 3, a linear regression of age predicted by income and gender would be run using all cases where age was observed. In step 4, predictions of the missing age values would be obtained from that regression equation and imputed. At this point, age does not have any missingness. Steps 2–4 would then be repeated for the income variable. The originally missing values of income would be set back to missing and a linear regression of income predicted by age and gender would be run using all cases with income observed; imputations (predictions) would be obtained from that regression equation for the missing income values. Then, steps 2–4 would again be repeated for the variable gender. The originally missing values of gender would be set back to missing and a logistic regression of gender on age and income would be run using all cases with gender observed; predictions from that logistic regression model would be used to impute the missing gender values. This entire process of iterating through the 3 variables would be repeated until convergence; the observed data and the final set of imputed values would then constitute one “complete” data set. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074241/
