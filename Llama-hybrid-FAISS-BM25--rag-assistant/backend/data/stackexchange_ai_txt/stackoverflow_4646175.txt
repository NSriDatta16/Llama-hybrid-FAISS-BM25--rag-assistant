Well, runtime errors are easy to create but compile-time errors a bit trickier. First, do you want to detect a new .NET Framework version or a new compiler version? I do not know of a way to detect difference in runtime version at compile-time. There is, however, a way to trigger an error when compiling with the Visual Studio 2010 compiler (as opposed to the 2008 version). Let's take a look at the C# 2010 breaking changes list at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee855831(VS.100).aspx . The difference in null-coalescing operator behavior with regard to uninitialized local variables seems like a good candidate for this. #pragma warning disable 0219 bool? i; bool? j; // TODO: Update this method for .NET 4 and remove this section. bool? createCompilerErrorOnVS2010 = (i = true) ?? j; #pragma warning restore 0219 The above code will compile with the Visual Studio 2008 compiler but not with the Visual Studio 2010 compiler.
