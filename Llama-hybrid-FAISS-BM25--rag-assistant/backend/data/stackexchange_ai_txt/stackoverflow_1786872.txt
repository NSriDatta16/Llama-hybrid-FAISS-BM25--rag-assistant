The problem I see is that XML is a storage medium, and so is SQL Server. So you're storing data in one medium, and then storing that in another storage medium. Can you not just skip the middle man and create a table? either: key-value pairs like your colleagues suggest or A table with a dozen columns, 1 for each selection on your form. The latter, would permit easy data-binding from sql server to your form.
