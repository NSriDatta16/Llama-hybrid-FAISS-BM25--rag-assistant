Why does the number of filters does not determine the output size in the CNN layer?

The formula to determine the output size is [(Wâˆ’K+2P)/S]+1 . Here the number of filters used is not significant for determining the ouput size, I was wondering why? Is it because Each filter is separately applied to the input to obtain a feature map and the output of the that part is considered as dimension size? Please note: W refers to the input size , K refers to the filter size where as P stands for padding and S stands for stride
