Creating a Magento Sitemap page

I want to create a sitemap page for Magento that will display all the static pages in an orderly fashion. This page is going to be similar to http://www.magentocommerce.com/sitemap/ Has anyone created a Magento Extension or can someone point me in the right direction? Searching for this feature has been a nightmare since all I get are Google SEO results. Edit: I would like to add some of the static pages to the site map. Currently the default sitemap has two options: Categories and Products. I would like a way to set which of my static pages can be added to the site map. Right now what I have done is just created a static page which I populated with links to my pages and products. However, if the client decides to add new products, it would require that page to be edited.
