You could present the actual population size using an axis label on any simple display (e.g. bar chart) of women/men. A quite different plot would just be #women versus #men; the sex ratios would then be different slopes. Provided all values are positive, logarithmic scale might help. On logarithmic scale, lines with the same ratio #women/#men or equivalently the same fraction of women plot as parallel. An audience naive or nervous about logarithmic scale might be encouraged by seeing raw and log scale side by side.
