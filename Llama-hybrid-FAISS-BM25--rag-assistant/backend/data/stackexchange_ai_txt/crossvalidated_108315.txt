Clarification on interpreting Wald's test and Likelihood ratio tests

I am running multinomial logistic regression analysis on my data. The response variable is the number of calves produced each year (0,1, or 2). I am trying to evaluate the influence of the X variables on the odds of producing a calf. My X variables are predation risk (WR; continuous), age of mother (age; categorical or continuous), time (wolf; categorical). First, I have 4 different age classification schemes (i only show 2) - I want to know which one of the age of mother would be "best" to use. I could use it as continuous variable - or as categories based on biological reasoning for senescence in older moose (old ladies don't invest in reproduction as much). So, I thought I would use a likelihood ratio test. library(mlogit) modata.model1 lrtest(modata.model2,modata.model3) Likelihood ratio test Model 1: no.C ~ 1 | age Model 2: no.C ~ 1 | age2 #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) 1 4 -213.22 2 4 -207.57 0 11.309 QUESTION: to interpret this output - there was a significant difference in the loglikelihood when we comparing the continuous age to a categorical age with 2 classes. The loglik is smaller for model 1 and therefore it would be better to use? Or do I have that backwards? Next I was going to use the Walds test to evaluate nested models. To see if the addition of a variable was worth it. modata.model7 Wald test Model 1: no.C ~ 1 | age + WR Model 2: no.C ~ 1 | age + WR + wolf Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) 1 244 2 242 2 0.5828 0.7472 QUESTION: this tells me that there is no significant improvement when there is an additional variable of wolf added?? So, then I can use the smaller model or do I use the one with the smaller Res.DF? In addition to confirming my interpretations of the results I have 2 side questions... 1)to get the null model for mlogit library - is my modata.model1 correct? I want the intercept only model to compare against. 2) Hosmer and Lemshow suggest by getting Wald values to get significance levels for each coefficient - in mlogit, thats the same as using summary(model) and there they provide the t-values with p instead of needing to do an additional Walds test? (NOTE in the below model i use 2 category age class instead of continuous) summary(modata.model8) Call: mlogit(formula = no.C ~ 1 | age2 + WR + wolf, data = modata, na.action = na.omit, reflevel = "1", method = "nr", print.level = 0) Frequencies of alternatives: 1 0 2 0.652 0.244 0.104 nr method 6 iterations, 0h:0m:0s g'(-H)^-1g = 7.4E-06 successive function values within tolerance limits Coefficients : Estimate Std.
