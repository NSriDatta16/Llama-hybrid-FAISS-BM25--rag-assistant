I don't know that you can limit the dragable area with Prototype/Scriptaculous. You can restrict the drop target so it can only be dropped in a specific place, but I'm not aware of a way to force it to stay within a certain boundary. You might could write up something if you can determine the position of the containment element, but that might be more trouble than you are looking for. :)
