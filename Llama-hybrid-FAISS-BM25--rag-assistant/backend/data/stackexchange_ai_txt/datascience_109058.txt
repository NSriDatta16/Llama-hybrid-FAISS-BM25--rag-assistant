Unsupervised Learning is a kind of learning where the model tries to find patterns in data without labels . Supervised Learning is a kind of machine learning whose goal is to learn the relation between features and labels. Hence, unsupervised models do have training data, only not labelled as in the supervised ones. In your particular case the module kNeighborTimeSeries searches for time series neighbours of your training time series. e.g. knn = KNeighborsTimeSeries(n_neighbors=1).fit(time_series) print(knn.kneighbors(return_distance=False))
