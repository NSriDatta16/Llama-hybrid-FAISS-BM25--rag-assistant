About the use of GDP and GDP squared in econometric analysis

I have found many econometric studies on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)* include time-series of 1) GDP, 2) GDP squared, and 3) environmental quality proxy (e.g. CO $_2$ emissions). Environmental quality proxy is the dependent variable, GDP and GDP squared are the explanatory variables. However, aren't GDP and GDP squared dependent on each other? I thought explanatory variables in econometric analysis should be independent of each other. *EKC is a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and economic development: various indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development.
