Training with unlabeled data and the probability of correct classification

Suppose we have two binary classifiers based on deep learning. The second classifier is able to tell me with a probability not very high but better than a random guess (let's say 70%), if the prediction of the first classifier is correct (but not which is the correct label). Therefore, given an unlabeled data set, how could I use the information from the second classifier to retrain the first classifier on the unlabeled data to get a better first classifier?
