Parsing a textfile in C# with skipping some contents

I'm trying to parse a text file that has a heading and the body. In the heading of this file, there are line number references to sections of the body. For example: SECTION_A 256 SECTION_B 344 SECTION_C 556 This means, that SECTION_A starts in line 256. What would be the best way to parse this heading into a dictionary and then when necessary read the sections. Typical scenarios would be: Parse the header and read only section SECTION_B Parse the header and read fist paragraph of each section. The data file is quite large and I definitely don't want to load all of it to the memory and then operate on it. I'd appreciate your suggestions. My environment is VS 2008 and C# 3.5 SP1.
