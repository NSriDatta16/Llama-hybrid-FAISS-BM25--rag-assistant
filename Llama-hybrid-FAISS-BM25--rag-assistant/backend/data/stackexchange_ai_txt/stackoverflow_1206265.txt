looking for some samples to embed media player into html

I am developing some html pages which embed media player (Windows Media Player and Silverlight player, like sl12videoplayer from codeplex http://sl2videoplayer.codeplex.com/ ). I have learned how to embed players into html, by using DIV/OBJECT tags. I have proved it works technically. My question is, I want to find and learn some samples about how to embed player within web page to have a good layout. The scenario I need to develop is some text based news page and I want to embed some players for videos (related to the news). Any reference samples which have elegant and sample layout to recommend? My confusions are like should I use tr/td, use iframe, frameset? How to set the width/height property to display video in an elegant way and extensible enough for the future? thanks in advance, George
