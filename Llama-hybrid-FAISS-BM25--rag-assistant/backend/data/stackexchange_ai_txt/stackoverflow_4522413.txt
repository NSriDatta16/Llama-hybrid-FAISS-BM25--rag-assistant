Unfortunately the question doesn't offer enough details about your app requirements so it's kind of difficult to offer an advise. Anyways, I'm not aware of any other storage solution offering a similar/advanced P2P replication. A couple of questions/comments about your your requirements: what kind of desktop app requires 10000 inserts/second? when you say size what exactly are you referring to? You might want to take a look at: Redis RavenDB Also check some of the other NoSQL-solutions listed on http://nosql.mypopescu.com against your app requirements.
