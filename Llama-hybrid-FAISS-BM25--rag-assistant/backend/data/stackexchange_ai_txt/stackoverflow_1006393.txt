You are perhaps a little confused. JSON and AJAX are not an either-or choice. JSON and XML is a choice. JSON and AJAX are distinct and largely unrelated, although AJAX often uses JSON, it can just easily use XML, HTML or plain text. Or are you referring to the X in AJAX (XML)? If so, the arguments for JSON are basically: JSON has a smaller payload than equivalent XML; and JSON is easier to deal with in Javascript (compare eval'ing a JSON object to walking an XML fragment). Other than that, it's largely personal preference.
