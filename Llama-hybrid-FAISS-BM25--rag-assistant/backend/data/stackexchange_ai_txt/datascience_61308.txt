Are CNNs indeed translation invariant?

I read that in a hidden layer of a convolutional neural network, all neurons share the same weights and bias. As a result, all the neurons detect the same feature and hence ConvNets become invariant to translation. And then I read that in 2003 Simard, Steinkraus and Platt achieved better classification in MNIST classification by artificially expanding the data using translation among other operations. So, my question is are ConvNets really invariant to translation?
