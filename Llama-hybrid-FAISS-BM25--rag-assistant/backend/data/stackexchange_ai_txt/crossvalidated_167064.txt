The most "hard core" Bayesian that I know of is Edwin Jaynes , deceased in 1998. I'd expect further "hard core" Bayesians to be found among his pupils, especially the posthumous co-author of his main work Probability Theory: The Logic of Science , Larry Bretthorst. Other notable historic Bayesians include Harold Jeffreys and and Leonard Savage . While I don't have a complete overview of the field, my impression is that the more recent popularity of Bayesian methods (especially in machine learning) is not due to deep philosophical conviction, but the pragmatic position that Bayesian methods have proved useful in many applications. I think typical for this position is Andrew Gelman .
