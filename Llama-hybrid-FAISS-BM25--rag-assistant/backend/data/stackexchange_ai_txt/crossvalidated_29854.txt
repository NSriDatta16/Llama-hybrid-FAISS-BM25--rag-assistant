For the purpose of answering this question it's useful to define frequentism as "interest the properties of the sampling distribution of functions of the data." Such functions could be point estimators, p-values of test statistics, confidence intervals, Neyman-Pearson test outcomes, or basically anything else you can think of. Frequentism doesn't specify how to construct estimators, p-values, etc., in full generality, although some guidelines exist, e.g., use sufficient statistics if they're available, use pivotal statistics if they're available, etc. From this perspective, prior information isn't incorporated into the model per se , but rather into the function mapping data to the output of the function. The "interest" referred to above is in properties considered important for inference, such as lack of bias, asymptotic consistency, variance, mean squared error, mean absolute error, confidence coverage (especially nominal versus actual), Type I error control, and anything else with obvious or intuitive importance for learning from data. These properties can be assessed (by simulation, if nothing else) whether or not the function incorporates prior information. Particular interest centers on properties that can be known to hold no matter the actual parameter values underlying the data generation process. For example, in the normal i.i.d. model with known variance the data mean is unbiased and asymptotically consistent for the distribution mean no matter what that is. In contrast, a shrinkage estimator (a weighted average of the data mean and a prior guess for the distribution mean) has a lower mean squared error if the distribution mean is close to the prior guess but a higher mean squared error otherwise, although it "inherits" asymptotic consistency from the data mean. So I would say that one can put prior information into the inference method, but it doesn't go into the model. A really nice illustration of the notions I've outlined in the context of confidence intervals for physical properties that are necessarily non-negative is Feldman and Cousins, A Unified Approach to the Classical Statistical Analysis of Small Signals .
