The easiest speedup you're going to get is running the cross-validation in parallel. Personally, I like the caret package in R , which uses foreach as a backend. It makes it very easy to farm the cross-validation and grid search out to multiple cores or multiple machines. Caret can handle many different models, including rbf SVMs: library(caret) library(doMC) registerDoMC() model confusionMatrix(model) Cross-Validated (10 fold) Confusion Matrix (entries are percentages of table totals) Reference Prediction setosa versicolor virginica setosa 32.4 0.0 0.0 versicolor 0.0 30.9 2.0 virginica 0.9 2.4 31.3 Note that the doMC() library is only available on mac and linux, it should be run from the command line, not from a GUI, and it breaks any models from RWeka. It's also easy to use MPI or SNOW clusters as parallel backend, which don't have these issues.
