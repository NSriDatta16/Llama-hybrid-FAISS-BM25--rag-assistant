Enter-key Prevention Javascript Not Working for JSF 1.1 in IE

Notes on environment: JSF 1.1 using Infragistics component library. I'm using the following Javascript to attempt to prevent an 'Enter' keypress from submitting a form. function disableEnterKey(e){ var key; if(window.event) key = window.event.keyCode; else key = e.which; return (key != 13); } Then in the JSP, I have: This seems to work flawlessly in Firefox and Google Chrome. I don't understand why it doesn't work with IE8. I'm stumped. I've tried using a Tomahawk , but that doesn't make a difference. I've tried putting something in the onkeypress handler for the parent and/or the element, but that doesn't seem to help either. And, I've tried using the onkeydown , but haven't seen a difference with that, either. The differential diagnosis that I think I have come up with is that it may have something to do with the Infragistics library. IG does add quite a bit of scripting to pages, but I'm not solid on how to debug Javascript effectively with IE8. This would be no problem to poke through with Firebug on FF, but I'm a bit stumped. Anyone have a similar experience? Know of a fix?
