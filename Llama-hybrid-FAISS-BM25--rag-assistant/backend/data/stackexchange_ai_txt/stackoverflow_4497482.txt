jquery UI draggable with live

this is a draggable sortable example on the jqueryui website, i need to use live() with this (I think) because the elements are created through ajax, does anybody know how to apply the live event to the following? $(function() { $( "#sortable" ).sortable({ revert: true }); $( "#draggable" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: "#sortable", helper: "clone", revert: "invalid" }); $( "ul, li" ).disableSelection(); });
