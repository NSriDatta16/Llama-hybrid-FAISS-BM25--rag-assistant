To answer question 1, the project design needs to established first, including the issues. The statistical design of the study would come afterwards. You have noted a clinical reduction in pulmonary function. I am guessing that your aim is "To determine if pulmonary screening can detect the loss in pulmonary function before it is clinically detectable." This is crucial for guiding the design. Issue 1) You would need to do testing to see if the tests correlate with either no pulmonary effect or an early stage of disease. I suspect this would involve, after establishing a "screening diagnosis of decrease pulmonary function," following up on these patients to determine if they later develop decreased pulmonary function i.e. a later-stage. Issue 2). I suspect that puberty would be partially considered in the pulmonary test reference ranges as the ranges would include age. If age isn't included in the range, then you may need healthy controls to reduce the confounding effect of age and puberty; otherwise the ranges would suffice as control for this specific study. Given this, I can answer your questions: Question 1: You would use an unpaired, two-tailed, t-test, comparing your patients to either the healthy controls or parameters. You need two-tailed as opposed to one-tailed, unless it is 100% impossible that the patients could have an improved clinical function, which cannot be ruled out. You need unpaired, as you are comparing different groups of people. You use a t-test to compare two groups (patients vs controls/parameters). Question 2: For-testing, there is no minimum sample size required. t-tests are designed to be able to work with small samples. However, a large sample size is still helpful as it will result in more power and a greater chance of statistical significance.
