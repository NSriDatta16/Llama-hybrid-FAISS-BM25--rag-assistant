The simplest method would be to use PHP's session storage . session_start(); @$_SESSION['pagecount']++; PHP automatically sends the user a session cookie, and transparently stores the content of $_SESSION in a flat file associated with this cookie. You don't really need to roll your own solution for this problem.
