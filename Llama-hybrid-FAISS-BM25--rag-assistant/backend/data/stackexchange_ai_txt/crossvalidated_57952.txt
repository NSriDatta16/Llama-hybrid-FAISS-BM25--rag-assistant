As far as I know, no such book exists yet as the area is still quite new. The couple of Bayesian nonparametrics books I've seen are basically just a bunch of review papers from various researchers bound together. If you have a Ph.D. in math, applied or not, I'm sure you can get your head around by reading the standard papers. Probably the gentlest yet most thorough introduction to BNP methods is this tutorial by Sam Gershman .
