Segmenting based on the variance of the original series makes no sense to me as the best model should be invariant to scale. Consider a series ..model it and then multiply each value in the time series by 1000 . In terms of mass producing equations that may have both deterministic structure (pulses/level shift/local time trends ) OR either auto-regressive seasonality and arima structure you have to run a computer-based script . Beware of simple auto arima solutions that assume no deterministic structure OR fixed assumptions about same.
