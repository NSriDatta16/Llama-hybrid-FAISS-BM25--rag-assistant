Wanted to add - it's not so important how You organize Your folders/solution, it is important how You organize Your code . So - If Your app won't be properly layered using fancy techniques like dependency inversion, won't be neat and testable - it won't matter if You put stinky code in one or hundred folders. You won't be able to migrate from sql to Azure, from mvc to silverlight.
