Mean of one group vs. the rest of the sample

I have data from a survey with Likert-type questions (Rate how strongly you feel about this issue on a scale from 1 to 10). We know the respondents home town (as well as some other information, such as gender, age, educational level etc.). We found that the average (mean) score on one of the survey questions was a lot bigger for survey takers from one town than for those from other towns. Here is my questions: How do we test whether it is significantly so? Can we test town A vs. all the other towns together? Or do we have to test it vs. each other town? (do a Anova with all towns followed by post-hoc tests?) Any pointers would be much appreciated!
