How do you explain 'co-integration' to determine spurious regression to a fairly new time series student?

I would appreciate it if someone could explain the concept of spurious regression intuitively / without it being too technical. So far the student understands that spurious regression is basically when two processes have no relation with each other, but would still conclude that there is one using statistical significance.
