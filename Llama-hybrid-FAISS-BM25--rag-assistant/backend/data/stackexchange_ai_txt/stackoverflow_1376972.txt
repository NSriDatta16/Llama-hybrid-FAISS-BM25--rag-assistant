That's all there is to it. Retrieval of keys is comparable, but addition is much faster with Dictionaries. I try to use SortedList as much as possible because it allows me to iterate over the keys and value collections. This is not possible with SortedDictionary as far as I know. I'm not sure about this, but as far as I know Dictionaries store data in Tree structures, whereas List store data in linear arrays. That explains why insertion and removal is much faster with dictionaries, since less memory has to be shifted around. It also explains why you can iterate over SortedLists but not SortedDictionary.
