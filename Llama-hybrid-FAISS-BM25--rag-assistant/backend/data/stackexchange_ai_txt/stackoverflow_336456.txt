You can't implement "neural networks" -- you'll end up implementing a specific kind of NN (e.g. perceptron). There are many different kinds of NNs, each more suitable for some specific kind of task, and each kind uses some math (and not only math) concepts that are specifically only to that particular kind. For example, Boltzmann machines use concepts from statistical thermodynamics (founded by Boltzmann). As for your question: without a clear goal, there is no clear (not even "semi-clear") path.
