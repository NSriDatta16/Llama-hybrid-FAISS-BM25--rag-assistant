Logistic Regression - Guesstimating betas

I am beginning an exploration on the topic, and was given the task of 'guesstimating betas 0 and 1' within 90% accuracy. I tried many silly things, like using the data and then using google sheets to give me the linear regression equation of the data and assume that beta0 was the intercept and beta1 was the coefficient of such line. I also was given a graph, and was estimating by the position of half the distance between the zeros and ones in relation to the x axis, calling it beta0 and then how steep the line is and call it beta1, to no success as well. Can anyone point me to any direction at all? guesstimating attempt
