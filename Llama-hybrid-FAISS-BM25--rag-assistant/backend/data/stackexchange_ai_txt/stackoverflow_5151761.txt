are you generating the input html? if so you can use URLEncoder.encode to properly encode the string so the transformer doesn't complain about the syntax. If this is just a random html page, and you have no control over it, then you probably need to use some html parser, such as tagsoup, et. al, to pre-correct it as most html files are not properly formatted.
