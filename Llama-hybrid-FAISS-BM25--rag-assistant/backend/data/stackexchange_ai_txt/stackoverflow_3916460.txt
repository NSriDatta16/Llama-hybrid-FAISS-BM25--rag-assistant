How to display html content using Javascript or jQuery?

Currently I use iFrame to display third party content. For example, my news page displays live website from CNN, MSNBC, Foxnews in single page. Currently, I am just using iFrame to display those sites, but I was wondering if there is a better way to display the contents using Javascript, jQuery or other type of Javascript library? Thanks [edit] Is there a way I can compress the iframe and display it as a thumbnails without converting it to an image. Just shrink everything.
