You should use two-class SVM instead of one-class. One-class classification is usually used to estimating the support of the high-dimensional distribution of the data. It can be used to estimate a decision boundary between two classes (usually one class vs. rest). @cbeleites gives more details about the different situations for classifying two classes. You may want to refer to part 2 in the documentation (pdf) of LibSVM for a quick understanding of the difference in the formulation.
