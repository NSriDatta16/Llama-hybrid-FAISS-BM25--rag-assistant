I open lots of links in new tabs - only to see javascript:void(0). So you annoy me, as well as yourself (because Google will see the same thing). Another reason (also mentioned by others) is that different languages should be separated into different documents. Why? Well, Mixed languages aren't well supported by most IDEs and validators. Embedding CSS and JS into HTML pages (or anything else for that matter) pretty much destroys opportunities to have the embedded language checked for correctness statically. Sometimes, the embedding language as well. (A PHP or ASP document isn't valid HTML.) You don't want syntax errors or inconsistencies to show up only at runtime. Another reason is to have a cleaner separation between the kinds of things you need to specify: HTML for content, CSS for layout, JS usually for more layout and look-and-feel. These don't map one to one: you usually want to apply layout to whole categories of content elements (hence CSS) and look and feel as well (hence jQuery). They may be changed at different times that the content elements are changed (in fact the content is often generated on the fly) and by different people. So it makes sense to keep them in separate documents as well.
