Can you use Bayes' rule twice?

I'm trying to build a classifier, to model the likelihood of an event C, that depends on two other events, X and Y. I know that one can use Bayesian analysis if you have $P(X|C)$ and $P(Y|C)$ However, in my case it is easier to measure $P(C|X)$ and $P(C|Y)$. I played with Bayes' theorem, and got a result, but not sure how valid it is. Bayes: $$ P(C|X,Y)=\frac{P(X,Y|C)P(C)}{P(X,Y)} $$ We assume X and Y are independent $$ =\frac{P(X|C)P(Y|C)P(C)}{P(X)P(Y)} $$ Subsitute Bayes for $P(X|C)$ and $P(Y|C)$ $$ =\frac{\frac{P(C|X)Pr(X)}{P(C)}\frac{P(C|Y)P(Y)}{P(C)}P(C)}{P(X)P(Y)} $$ Eliminate: $$ =\frac{P(C|X)P(C|Y)}{Pr(C)} $$ Is this valid? I know the independence assumption is dangerous, but is this at least as valid as a naive Bayesian classifier?
