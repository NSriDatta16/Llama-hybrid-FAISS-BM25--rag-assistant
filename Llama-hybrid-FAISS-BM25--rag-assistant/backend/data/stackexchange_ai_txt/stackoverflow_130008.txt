There are innumerable community-service organizations with little or no web presence. Pick a service organization -- any one -- Literacy Volunteers, Food Pantries, Home Furnishings Donations, Alcoholics Anonymous -- anything. The grass-roots community organizations benefit the most from involvement; they often need a more dynamic web presence but can't afford it. Look at their current web site. Build them something better. Donate it to them.
