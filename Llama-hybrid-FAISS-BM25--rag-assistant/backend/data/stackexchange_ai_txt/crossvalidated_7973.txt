Incremental one-way ANOVA

Imagine you have a set of four elements (A-D) with some numeric values of a measured property (several observations for each element): A: 26 25 29 21 B: 24 17 16 C: 32 34 29 19 25 27 28 D: 23 29 26 20 14 I have to detect if there are significant differences on the average levels. So I run a one way ANOVA to determine if differences are found. It works fine but, when I get a new sample, I need to execute the ANOVA again for just one new sample. Is there any way to do an "incremental one-way ANOVA" that works without redoing the whole computations ? I have a lot of data and the process is expensive in terms of time and memory consumption.
