Filter list contained in entity returned by jpa/hibernate query

I have a simple jpa entity 'ApplicationForm' with a one to many list in it: @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE, mappedBy="textQuestion") private List questions; The variable Dictionary contained in ApplicationForm is just another plain entity with just the text of the question. The corresponding database table mapped by Dictionary is: 'locale' 'text' 'formId' en my question 123 it mia domanda 123 I was wondering if it's possible with jpa or hibernate, to build a query for retrieving an ApplicationForm entity with a Dictionary for a specific locale, for example 'it' only. That would be easy enough to do with standard sql, but I cannot translate in hql. If not possible, could you suggest an alternative way ? I have tried to manually iterate the Dictionary questions list and remove the not required locale, but is not really elegant, and also I got a jpa/hibernate error. I hope I made myself clear, and code supplied is enough. thanks
