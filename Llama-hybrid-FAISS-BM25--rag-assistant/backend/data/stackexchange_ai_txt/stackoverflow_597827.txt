Multi-touch mouse gestures on EeePC

I have an EeePC 900 running Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex. The touchpad has some simple multi-touch gestures built in - scrolling by dragging with two fingers instead of one for example. How would I detect multi-touch events in an OpenGL/C application? Is the touchpad on the EeePC 900 capable of handling rotational and scaling gestures? The MPX example returns with Only found one master pointer. and the suggested xinput --create-master "ImPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse" isn't recognised by xinput. So is the multi-touch scrolling behaviour built-in at a lower level?
