Let's partition our $N$ elements into two sets with sizes $N_1,N_2$ and sums $S_1,S_2$. The averages will be: $\frac{S_1}{N_1},\frac{S_2}{N_2}$ The average of this will be: $0.5(\frac{S_1}{N_1}+\frac{S_2}{N_2})$ If we assume the sizes are equal then $N_1=N_2=0.5N$ and we get: $0.5(\frac{S_1}{N_1}+\frac{S_2}{N_2})=0.5(\frac{S_1+S_2}{0.5N})=\frac{S_1+S_2}{N}$ Which is exactly the average of the original set. In the general case, as mentioned in ttnphns's comment, this would be true only if you weigh the average by the sizes of the partitions. The proof is similar to the one I gave.
