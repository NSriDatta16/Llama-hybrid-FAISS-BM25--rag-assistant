Nested classes should only be utilized by the parent class ( see this post ). They shouldn't be publicly visible to other classes unless there is a really good reason. Which there isn't. I would suggest refactoring this. Try moving all the API for GamePlay into the GamePlay class. In other words, TouchesBegan() should be called on the GamePlay class, which then calls into the MyPinAnnotations class. No one else should know about MyPinAnnotations class - if they need to, then it is indicative of a design failure.
