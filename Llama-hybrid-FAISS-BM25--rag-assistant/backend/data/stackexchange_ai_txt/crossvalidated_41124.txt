This is one of the main areas of research in Machine Learning and it is known as Feature Selection . In general, the only way to say what the best subset of features is (for input into some predictive model that can combine them), is to try all possible subsets. This is usually impossible, so people try to sample the space of feature subsets by various heuristics (see the article for some typical approaches).
