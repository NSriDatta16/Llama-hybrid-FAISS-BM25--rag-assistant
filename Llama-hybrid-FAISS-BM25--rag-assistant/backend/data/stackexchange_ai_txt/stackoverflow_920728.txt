Correct error-handling practices for the data-layer

What are good things to check for, with respect to error-handling, when you are dealing with the data-access-layer? For example, let's assume I have this function.. Public Function UserExists(ByVal userName As String) As DataTable Dim dt As Object = Nothing Dim arSqlParameters(0) As SqlParameter arSqlParameters(0) = New SqlParameter("@UserName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 50) arSqlParameters(0).value = userName dt = ABC.APP.DAL.DALHelper.ExecuteDatatable(ConnectionString, CommandType.StoredProcedure, "dbo.aspnet_sprGetUserByUsername", arSqlParameters) Return dt End Function This seems like very lazy and unsafe coding. How would you go about ensuring that your code elegantly handles anything unexpected in a situation like this? I'm new to vb.net and the app that I'm working on has no error handling, so I figured this would be the best place to look for advice. Thanks in advance :)
