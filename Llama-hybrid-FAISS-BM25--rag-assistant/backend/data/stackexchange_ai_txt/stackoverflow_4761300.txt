Where to store sensitive information in a Drupal Module?

In a module I'm creating I have some sensitive information I need to store securely: A remote database host, username, and password. It seems that the only storage available is in the Drupal database, which worries me since this means if Drupal is compromised so is this other database. The settings.php file in sites/all/default was my second option, but I'm having trouble writing to it. Various chmod commands in FTP and SSH to 777 and 666 won't open the file to writing. I'm also not sure if the variables I set there are available anywhere else. Are there any other ways to store this information securely?
