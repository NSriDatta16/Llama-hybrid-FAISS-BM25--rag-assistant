It seems that your interest is in qualitative analysis rather than quantitative, because terms such as reliability and validity are from qualitative analysis domain. That's why I'd suggest you to look at texts in psychometrics , for instance Michell, Joel. "Quantitative science and the definition of measurement in psychology." British Journal of Psychology 88.3 (1997): 355-383. . He also has book "Measurement in Psychology" . There's an easier reading book on the measurement in soft subjects: DeVellis, Robert F (2003). Scale Development: Theory and Applications (2nd ed.). He covers validity and reliability, latent variables and such.
