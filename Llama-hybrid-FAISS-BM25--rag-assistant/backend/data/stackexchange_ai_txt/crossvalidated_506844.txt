Probability of averages

I have a random variable $Y$ and I am taking an independent sample of $n$ from this RV. I'll refer to this sample as $Y_n$ , and I define the average of this sample as $\bar{Y}_n$ . The maximum of this sample is similarly $\max(Y_n)$ . Since $Y$ is derived from population data, I'll also define the 95 th percentile of the data source as $Y_{\{0.95\}}$ (not the percentile of the sample ) Assuming by the CLT that $\bar{Y}_n \sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$ , is there a simple way to find $$ P\left(\max(Y_n) > Y_{\{0.95\}} \;|\;\bar{Y}_n > z\right)? $$ That is, what is the probability that the maximum of a sample or size $n$ is greater than the 95 th percentile of the population , given that the average of that sample is higher than a given value. Edit: added some clarification on terms.
