Entity framework linq query Include() multiple children entities

This may be a really elementry question but whats a nice way to include multiple children entities when writing a query that spans THREE levels (or more)? i.e. I have 4 tables: Company , Employee , Employee_Car and Employee_Country Company has a 1:m relationship with Employee. Employee has a 1:m relationship with both Employee_Car and Employee_Country. If i want to write a query that returns the data from all 4 the tables, I am currently writing: Company company = context.Companies .Include("Employee.Employee_Car") .Include("Employee.Employee_Country") .FirstOrDefault(c => c.Id == companyID); There has to be a more elegant way! This is long winded and generates horrendous SQL I am using EF4 with VS 2010
