+1 I'm a little sceptical too. I don't think the average punter sends large amounts of data across Ajax/jQuery and if they are I think they need to refactor a little. So if that is the case then what possible gain could you get from using WCF over normal mvc functionality when you are serializing (maybe) 2 or 3 k of data. I think even 2k is a lot to be sending via Ajax. Using WCF in the code behind would be a good idea but for ajax serilization, dunno about that one.
