I currently use separate directories due to organisational policy (and Junit 3 legacy) but I'm looking to transition to annotations myself now I'm on Junit 4. I wouldn't be overly concerned about developers putting integration tests in your unit test classes - add a rule in your coding standards if necessary. I'm interested to know what sort of other solutions there might be apart from annotations or physically separating the classes..
