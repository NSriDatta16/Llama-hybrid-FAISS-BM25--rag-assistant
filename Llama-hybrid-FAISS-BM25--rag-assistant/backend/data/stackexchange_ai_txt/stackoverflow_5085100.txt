How could I make this procedure more elegant?

I have a servo I'm controlling that is moving an object closer and closer to a sensor, trying to trigger it. I want the distance to start at 15.5. However, in each iteration, I want it to decrease the distance .1, until the sensor triggers. For convenience sake, I'd like to exit the while loop with the variable $currentHeight set to this triggering height, so I've placed the decrement line at the beignning of the loop. But, I've had to hardcode a 15.6 starting point before the while loop so that it will decrement in the first line of the loop to 15.5. That doesn't seem elegant. Any suggestions on how to spruce this up? By the way, this is Tcl for all you old school and obscure programmers. ;) Code: set currrentDistance 15.6 set sensorStatus 4 while {$sensorStatus == 1)} { set currentDistance [expr $currentDistance - .1] moveServo $currentHeight set sensorStatus [watchSensor 2] }
