deep learning for non-image non-NLP tasks?

So far there are many interesting applications for deep learning in computer vision or natural language processing. How is it in other more traditional fields? For example, I have traditional socio-demographic variables plus maybe a lot of lab measurements and want to predict a certain disease. Would this be a deep learning application if I have lots of observations? How would I construct a network here, I think all the fancy layers (convolutional etc.) are not really necessary?! Just make it deep? On my specific data set, I tried some common machine learning algorithms like random forests, gbm etc with mixed results regarding accuracy. I have limited deep learning experience with image recognition.
