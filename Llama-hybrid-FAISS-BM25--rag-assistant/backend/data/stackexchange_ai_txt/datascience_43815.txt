test accuracy of text classification is too less

I have a data set of movies and their subtitles. My task is to classify them based on their ratings - [R, NR, PG, PG-13, G] . I have 13 examples for each class. I preprocessed the subtitles in the following way: I used word puns tokenizer to tokenize subtitles. Removed stop words and punctuation. Performed stemming. Vectorized the subtitles using TF-IDF vectorizer. The accuracy that I am getting using: 1) svm : train accuracy is 1.0 and test accuracy is .17. 2) naive bayes: training accuracy is 0.5 and test accuracy is .23. I have the following questions: 1)Why is my accuracy so low and what can I do to improve the accuracy? 2)Will more training data help? 3)Should I perform feature selection? 4)What other classification algorithms can I use to improve the accuracy?
