How to design a neural network?

For my research project, I am expected to propose a MLP for solving a disease classification problem. Whenever i've done this before, it's been a lot of trial and error/ adding and removing layers etc, to get the best model. But I am expected to supply an overview of my proposed design before I start to implement it. So is there any framework or guide that shows me the best way to design one to suit my specific problem?
