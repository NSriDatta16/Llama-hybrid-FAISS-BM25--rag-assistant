Neural Network backpropagation taking forever

I am constructing a neural network using Sigmoid neurons. My current network is 3 layers of 39 nodes each, using an input of 39 input variables across 10,000 observations. I am calculating loss by summing the loss in each observation. That being said, I have to numerically calculate $39^2*3*10,000$ weight deltas in the network for every iteration of the code using backpropagation, starting from the output neuron and working backwards. This takes a long time. Is there a more efficient way to approach backpropagation?
