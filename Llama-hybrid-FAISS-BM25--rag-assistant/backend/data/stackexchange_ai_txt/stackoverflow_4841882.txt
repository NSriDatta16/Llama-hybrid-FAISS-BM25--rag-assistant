Why emma doesn't give full coverage to finally blocks?

I don't get why emma doesn't give full code coverage to "finally" blocks. I've made a short example program to demonstrate this. When I execute the program it shows: try finally So I don't get why finally is marked as red (not executed) and the "finally" "println" is marked yellow (partially executed). Am I missing something? How to make emma understand that the finally block is covered? Thank you!
