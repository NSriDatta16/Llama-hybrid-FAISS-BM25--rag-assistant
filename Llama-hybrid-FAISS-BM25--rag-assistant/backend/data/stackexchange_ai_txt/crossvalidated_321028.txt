Are you just trying to display the results as a compact letter display? Where, means sharing a letter are not significantly different. If so, this can be accomplished with the multcompLetters function in the multcompView package. But you may want to use the emmeans package for multiple comparisons. Note that Tukey's test controls for the familywise error rate, so further corrections to the p-values are not needed. if(!require(multcompView)){install.packages("multcompView")} if(!require(emmeans)){install.packages("emmeans")} fm1 = aov(breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks) TH = TukeyHSD(fm1, "tension", ordered = TRUE) TH P.value = TH$tension[,4] library(multcompView) multcompLetters(P.value) ### M L H ### "a" "b" "a" library(emmeans) marginal = emmeans(fm1, ~ tension) cld(marginal, Letters=letters) ### tension emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group ### H 21.66667 2.738184 50 16.16686 27.16647 a ### M 26.38889 2.738184 50 20.88908 31.88869 a ### L 36.38889 2.738184 50 30.88908 41.88869 b ### ### Results are averaged over the levels of: wool ### Confidence level used: 0.95 ### P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates ### significance level used: alpha = 0.05
