How to derive the high dimensional image from low dimensional one without having original data (image)?

Hi! I am new to Computer Vision. I am curious as to whether it is possible to decompress a low dimensional image to a high dimensional one if I don't have an original image. What methods are applicable for this purpose? All the information, I came across on the web, is related to image compression (dimensionality reduction using PCA and reconstructing original image). I am interested in the reverse process provided I don't have the original image. I use Python. TIA
