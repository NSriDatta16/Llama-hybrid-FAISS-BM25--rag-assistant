PHP5 static keyword and usage

The static keyword is known to be a free agent. You can declare a method "static" either by writing: protected static function foo() { // lots of self:: code in here } Or: static protected function bar() { // lots of self:: code in here } I just came across code that read: static protected static function foobar() { // lots of self:: code in here } Surely it's a typo from the original author, but why is PHP accepting this as a valid statement? UPDATE The version in question is PHP 5.2.16 . I just confirmed, this is valid too: static static static public static function foobar() { // lots ... }
