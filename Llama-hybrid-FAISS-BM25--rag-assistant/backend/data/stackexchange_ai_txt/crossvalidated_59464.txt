Hilbert-Schmidt norm in the RKHS as you describe has been used in statistics for a while. Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) has been successful in capturing statistical dependences. See Gretton and coworkers' papers: A Gretton, O Bousquet, A Smola, B Schölkopf. Measuring statistical dependence with Hilbert-Schmidt norms.
