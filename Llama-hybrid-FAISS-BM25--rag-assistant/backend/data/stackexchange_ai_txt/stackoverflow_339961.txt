Difference between 2 numbers

I need the perfect algorithm or C# function to calculate the difference (distance) between 2 decimal numbers. For example the difference between: 100 and 25 is 75 100 and -25 is 125 -100 and -115 is 15 -500 and 100 is 600 Is there a C# function or a very elegant algorithm to calculate this or I have to go and handle every case separately with if s. If there is such a function or algorithm, which one is it?
