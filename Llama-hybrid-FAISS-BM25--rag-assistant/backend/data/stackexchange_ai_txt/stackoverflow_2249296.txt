Yes, you've answered your own question. You need to implement the various protocols that are described in the documentation you referenced. You could just use two NSImageView objects and make them editable. Editable NSImageView objects allow drag and drop by default. However, NSImageView doesn't store information about the location of the image in the file system. If you need that information you would need to implement your own view/control.
