JavaScript to gather visitor information/stats

I am looking for a piece of code, or even a list of all browsers' properties JavaScript can access so I can prepare my own stats system. I'm not looking for anything that server-side parser can get (e.g. Agent, referrer, etc.). I am not interested in external solutions like Google Analytics. The reason for this is that I want to run it within company's Intranet and I require it to be internal solution.
