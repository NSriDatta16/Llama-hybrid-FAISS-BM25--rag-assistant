By "Leak", do you mean the instruments Leak tool? That may not "see" the memory consumed by your CG calls as leaks because they are malloced... You are many times better off using ObjectAlloc, and looking at what memory is being held onto there in a short time period (drag across the timeline with option held down to see a small region of time).
