Sharepoint as an Enterprise Content Management (ECM)

I work for a large organization and we have been utilizing SharePoint for document library. Yesterday my boss called me to his office and asked me: "I heard that SharePoint is an ECM! So what can it do for us?". "What kind of problem do you want us to solve utilizing SharePoint?", I replied. "I want to know what it means when they say it is a ECM and how it can help us?", He said. I told him it has Document Management, WorkFlow, Records Management, Search and some other stuff. Anywho, He wants me to put togetter a list of things that SharePoint offers as an ECM.
