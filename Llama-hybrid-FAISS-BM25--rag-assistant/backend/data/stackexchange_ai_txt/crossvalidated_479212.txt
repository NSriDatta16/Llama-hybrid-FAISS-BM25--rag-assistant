This sounds like you want to sample from truncated normal distribution . If you only want to truncate the tails of the distribution (regions with low probability), than the approach suggested by Dave is probably enough. In other cases it might however quickly get inefficient. Better approach was suggested by Christian P. Robert in Robert, C.P. (1995). Simulation of truncated normal variables. Statistics and Computing 5 (2): 121-125. The algorithm is a bit more complicated, so I suggest you check the paper. Alternatively, if you prefer the code here you can find a C++ implementation from R package extraDistr (disclaimer: it's written by me).
