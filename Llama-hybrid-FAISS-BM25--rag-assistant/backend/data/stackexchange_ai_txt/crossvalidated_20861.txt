Identification of confounder in a logistic regression model example in "Applied Logistic Regression"

I am reading Hosmer's Applied Logistic Regression , and I am a bit stuck in chapter 3, when taking about interaction and confounders. In page 77, it states the following: Using the estimated coefficient for LWD in model 1 we estimate the odds ratio as $\exp(1.054)=2.87$. The results shown in Table 3.14 indicate that AGE is not a strong confounder, $\Delta(\hat{\beta})\%=4.2$, but it does interact with LWD, $p=0.076$. I am OK with the $\exp(1.054)=2.87$, but I can't figure out how he calculate the $\Delta(\hat{\beta})\%=4.2$. Can anyone help? Thanks.
