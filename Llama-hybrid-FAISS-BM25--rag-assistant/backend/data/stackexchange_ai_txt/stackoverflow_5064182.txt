You should save it as a file. A Cache is not a storage and you should always expect, that a cache gets cleared even if the timeout has not expired yet. However, you dont need to save the file as (e.g.) "pictoreOfTheDay.jpg". You must have the pictures saved somewhere anyway, so you will only need to save the filename of one is this.
