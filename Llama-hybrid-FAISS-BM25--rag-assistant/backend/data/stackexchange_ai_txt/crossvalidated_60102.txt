My original answer that was accepted by OP assumes a two-sample setting. OP's question deals with a one-sample setting. Hence, @Robert Lew's answer is the correct one in this case. Original answer Your formulas and calculations are correct. R s internal function to compare proportions yields the same result (without continuity correction though): prop.test(x=c(19,15), n=c(34,34), correct=FALSE) 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(19, 15) out of c(34, 34) X-squared = 0.9412, df = 1, p-value = 0.332 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: -0.1183829 0.3536770 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.5588235 0.4411765
