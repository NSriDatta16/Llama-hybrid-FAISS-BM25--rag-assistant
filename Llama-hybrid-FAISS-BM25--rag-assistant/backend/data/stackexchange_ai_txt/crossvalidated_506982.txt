I think this is a slight mis-reading of the place where the quote came from. It is perfectly true that when he was inventing the test which bears his pseudonym Gosset was trying to solve the problem of small samples because that was what he encountered in his work. So he designed them for small samples. That historical fact does not mean they do not work for large samples. In his original paper he outlined the problem In routine work there are two ways of dealing with this difficulty: (1) an experiment may he repeated many times, until such a long series is obtained that the standard deviation is determined once and for all with sufficient accuracy. This value can then be used for subsequent shorter series of similar experiments. and points out There are other experiments, however, which cannot easily be repeated very often; in such cases it is sometimes necessary to judge of the certainty of the results from a very small sample, which itself affords the only indication of the variability. Some chemical, many biological, and most agricultural and large- scale experiments belong to this class, which has hitherto been almost outside the range of statistical inquiry. Gosset himself was working with the brewers, Guinness, and faced the problem that he mentions in that paragraph of being unable to run large-scale repetitions and even if he could have repeated the plots many times there would almost certainly have been drift over time. The quotes are from his 1908 article in Biometrika "The probable error of a mean" which has been widely reprinted.
