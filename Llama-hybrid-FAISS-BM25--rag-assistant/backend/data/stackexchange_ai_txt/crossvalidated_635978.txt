In general, I won't suggest doing something like this for real trade with your money. This field is enormously competitive with companies with huge data and milli-second real-time advantages. For the sake of exposition, I don't think you can apply vanilla MDP to this. You can assume Markov property has some hidden factors, but the entire system's stationarity is ridiculous to assume. Look at Reinforcement Learning methods, and you will find some good techniques to start. Do not do this with your money!
