Expert-model and machine learning hybrid approach

Is there a recommended approach how the results of an rule-based expert system can be combined with an ML model? Let's say you have a text classification problem with 100 classes. For some classes you have only very little training data, but pretty accurate keyword-based rules, while for other classes you have plenty of training data, but only weak rules. The obvious approach would be to combine a rule-based approach with a ML model. As I understand Weak Supervision (e.g. SnorkelAI) only tries to speed up the labelling process, but that wouldn't help if you just don't find many examples for a certain class. So I am wondering how can be the results of an expert-model can be combined with a ML model in an optimal way?
