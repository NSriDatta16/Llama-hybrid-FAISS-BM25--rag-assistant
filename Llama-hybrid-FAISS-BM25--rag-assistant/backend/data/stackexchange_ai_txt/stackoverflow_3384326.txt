These are some well known techniques for scaling such an app. Reduce DB hits Most often the bottle neck will be your DB, so cache recent pages so that you reduce DB activity, perhaps in something like memcached. Design your schema such that it is partition-able. In the simplest case, separate your data into logical partitions, and store each partition in a separate mysql DB. Craigslist, for example, partitions data by city, and in some cases, by section within that. In your case, you could partition by Id quite simply. Manage php sessions Putting ngnx in front of a php website will not work if you use sessions. Load balancing php does have issues as sessions are persisted on local storage. Therefore you need to do session management explicitly. The traditional solution is to use memcached to store and look up some kind of cookie. Don't optimize prematurely. Focus on getting your application out so that the next magnitude of current users gets the optimal experience. Note: Your main potential pain points are discussed here on SO
