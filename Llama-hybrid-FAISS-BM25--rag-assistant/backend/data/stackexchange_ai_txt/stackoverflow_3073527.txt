Is there a way to start an activity from a view? Arguably, the View should tell the Activity that hosts it to start an activity, via a registered callback method. I am not a fan of the code organization you have described here (but, admittedly, based solely on the description). However, if you really want to have the View start the activity, have the View call getContext().startActivity() .
