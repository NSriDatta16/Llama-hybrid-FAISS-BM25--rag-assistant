Just for giggles, I'll add that there are two ways to do this due to the properties of De Morgan's Law . First, meaning "if it is not an iPhone and it is not an iPod" (as posted in the other answer): if((!navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) && (!navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) { // Do something } And second, meaning "if it is not an iPhone or an iPod", which is just a logical negation of the entire current statement: if(!(navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) { // Do something }
