stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight doesn't work in initWithCoder: of UIImageView subclass

I have a UIImageView subclass called ShadowView, which displays a shadow that can be used under anything. ShadowViews are to be loaded from a nib. In initWithCoder:, I have the following code: - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)decoder { self = [super initWithCoder:decoder]; if (self != nil) { UIImage *shadowImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"drop_shadow_4_pix.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:4 topCapHeight:4]; [self setContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleToFill]; [self setImage:shadowImage]; } return self; } When I run the app, though, this image does not appear. But if I change it to ... UIImage *shadowImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"drop_shadow_4_pix.png"]; ... it works fine, but it is stretched wrong. Any ideas as to why this is happening? Edit: it is the same when I load the shadowview programmatically, with initWithFrame: implemented similarly to initWithCoder:. Another Edit: I think I solved the problem. I needed to set the autoresizing masks.
