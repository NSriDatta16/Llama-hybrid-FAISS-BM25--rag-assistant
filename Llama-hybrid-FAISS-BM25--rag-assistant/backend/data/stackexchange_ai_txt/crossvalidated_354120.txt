Exchangeability of random variables $X_1,X_2, \dotsc,X_t$ means that all permutations of the random variables do have the same (multivariate) distribution. That is, let $\pi \colon \{1,2,\dotsc,t\} \mapsto \{1,2,\dotsc,t\}$ be a permutation of the index set. Then $$ (X_{\pi 1}, X_{\pi 2}, \dotsc, X_{\pi t}) \stackrel{D}{=} (X_1, X_2, \dotsc, X_t) $$ for all permutations $\pi$ . This clearly implies (assuming existence) that means and variances are constant, so implies stationarity, but is much stronger than stationarity. For a time series this really rules out typical models of serial correlation, none of those will be exchangeable, since for example $X_1$ must have the same correlation with $X_2$ as with $X_t$ . The only models consistent with exchangeability are equicorrelation models $^\dagger$ : All pairwise correlations must have the same correlation $\rho$ . That include independence models with $\rho=0$ . But, in reality, with only one realization observed of the time series $X_1,X_2, \dotsc,X_t$ , there is no observable difference between an exchangeable model and an independence model (there might be strange counterexamples with $\rho=1$ ). See also Exchangeability and IID random variables and Why are words in a document for bag-of-words model exchangeable but not independent? . $^\dagger$ Assuming correlations exist. Otherwise we can assume all pairwise joints are identical. A multivariate Cauchy distribution can be exchangeable, but without correlations.
