processing large number of files - any library or utility to help?

I'd like to process a large number of files - think video transcoding, like youtube, where you have to transform everything into FLV format or image processing where you create thumbs from large RAW files. Is there any service or library that can help on such processing? I don't mean actual transcoding, but organizing, launching the tasks, monitoring them and handling errors somehow. Ideally on windows but linux could also be fine. Update: I'd like utility/lib to handle such tasks at higher level. Dispatch multiple processes, handle and report any failures somehow, etc. So, in case of transcoding, I'd like such lib/utility to get a list of files to transcode and then it would handle starting the trancoding in multiple threads/processes. You would be able to define what to do on successful completition of the task. And you'd also be able to do this in case of a failure.
