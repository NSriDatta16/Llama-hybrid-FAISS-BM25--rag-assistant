On a linux box I use the ssh-agent and sshfs. You need to setup the sshd to accept connections with key pairs. Then you use ssh-add to add you key to the ssh-agent so you don't have type your password everytime. Be sure to use -t seconds, so the key doesn't stay loaded forever. ssh-add -t 3600 /home/user/.ssh/ssh_dsa After that, sshfs hostname:/ /PathToMountTo/ will mount the server file system on your machine so you have access to it. Personally, I wrote a small bash script that add my key and mount the servers I use the most, so when I start to work I just have to launch the script and type my passphrase.
