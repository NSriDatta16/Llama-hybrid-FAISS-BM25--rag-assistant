There are a few ways that come to mind. The first is to take the difference between the two series and create a "new series" . Analyze that series and empirically identify Pulses,Level Shifts/ Local Time Trends and a possible ARIMA component. The results will/might suggest any identifiable divergence. A second approach is to build a common ARIMA model for both time series and use the CHOW TEST to test for statistically significant parameters.
