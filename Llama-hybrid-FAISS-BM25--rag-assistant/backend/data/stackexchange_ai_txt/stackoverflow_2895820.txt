Jquery getJSON() doesn't work when trying to get data from java server on localhost

The whole day yesterday I've been trying to solve this but it's proven to be very challenging for me. I'm trying to use this JS to get information from a java application I wrote. $(document).ready(function() { $.getJSON('http://localhost/custest?callback=?', function(json) { alert('OK'); $('.result').html(json.description); }); }); The Java application uses httpServer and is very basic. When I access the page ' http://localhost/custest?callback= ?' with Firefox, the browser shows me the server is sending me json data and asks with what to open it with, but when I try it from a webpage using the JS above it doesn't work. The getJSON call is not successful, the alert("ok") doesn't popup at all. If it replace " http://localhost/custest?callback= ?" in the JS with " http://twitter.com/users/usejquery.json?callback= ?" everything works fine. An interesting thing is that if I send malformed JSON from my java server Firebug gives an error and tells me what is missing from the JSON so that means the browser is receiving the JSON data, but when I send it a correct JSON string nothing happens, no errors, not even the alert() opens. I'm adding the headers in case you think these could be relevant. http://localhost/custest?callback=jsonp1274691110349 GET /custest?callback=jsonp1274691110349 HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 200 OK Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: application/json Thanks for your help.
