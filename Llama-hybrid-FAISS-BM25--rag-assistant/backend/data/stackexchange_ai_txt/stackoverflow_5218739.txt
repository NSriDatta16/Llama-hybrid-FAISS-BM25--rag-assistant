How to use integer RowKeys in Azure Table Storage?

I have consecutively numbered entities that I want to persist with the Azure Table Service, however the type of the RowKey column is problematic. The number of the entity should be stored in the RowKey column, so I can query entities fast ( PK = '..' && RowKey = 5 ), get newest entities ( RowKey > 10 ) and query a certain set of entities ( RowKey > 5 && RowKey ). Since RowKey must be a string, lower-than comparisons are problematic ( "100" ). I thought about prepending zeros to the numbers (so that "100" > "011" ), but I can't predict the number of entities (and thus the number of zeros). I know I could just create an integer column, but I would loose the performance advantage of the indexed RowKey column (plus I don't have any other information suitable for RowKey). Did anyone have this problem before?
