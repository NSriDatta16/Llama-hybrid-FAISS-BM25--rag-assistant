C++: How to read dynamic data elegantly into a struct?

Lets say i store headers in some file, but some part of the header is dynamic length, something like this it would look: struct HeaderTest { int someparam; int more; int arrsize; // how big array, read arrsize elements into arr: int arr[arrsize]; // not valid }; Is there some elegant way for reading dynamic data into a struct?
