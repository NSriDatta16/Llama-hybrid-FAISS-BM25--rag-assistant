Are there disadvantages using proportional features instead of absolute values?

I was wondering whether there are disadvantages in using proportional features instead of features with absolute values. For example: I have the following data set, which includes, TV duration, smartphone duration, other activities duration, all measured in minutes. I can either use the durations as given, or I can compute the proportional duration features, which is simply the duration / total duration (sum of all activities duration). So I was wondering what the disadvantages are of using proportional features, instead of them just as they are. PS: I will be using logistic regression and SVM's, but I do not think that really matters for my general question.
