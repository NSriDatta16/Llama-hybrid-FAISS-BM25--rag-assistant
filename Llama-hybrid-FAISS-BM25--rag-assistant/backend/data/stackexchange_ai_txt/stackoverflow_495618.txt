How to normalize a path in PowerShell?

I have two paths: fred\frog and ..\frag I can join them together in PowerShell like this: join-path 'fred\frog' '..\frag' That gives me this: fred\frog\..\frag But I don't want that. I want a normalized path without the double dots, like this: fred\frag How can I get that?
