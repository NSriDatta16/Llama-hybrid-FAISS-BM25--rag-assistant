OK, so I'm going to answer my own question! This solution fixes the Firefox scrolling bug using scrollTo and the code is much more elegant and scalable. It's still not perfect but I have managed to condense the if loop down to this: if ($.url.segment(1) == 'questions.html'||'terms.html') { $('.questions_main_box ul li div').hide(); $('#'+($.url.attr('anchor'))).next().show(); $.scrollTo('#'+($.url.attr('anchor'))); }; Pros: Code is much more elegant/condensed/DRYer URL anchors will now work regardless of what they are called Not dependant on matching question and answer id's Will scale to any number of entries Cons: All divs are hidden before URL parsing is used to reveal any match. This is slightly less efficient than finding a way to test and only hide the necessary divs. That's it! I hope this helps someone with a similar conundrum rattling around in their brain! If anyone can think of a way to improve this code to remove the final con then I'd be really interested to see your solution. Finally thanks to Steven Richards for solving the Firefox bug problem by suggesting the use of scrollTo. A painless and simple solution, I thank you! https://stackoverflow.com/users/96089/steven-richards
