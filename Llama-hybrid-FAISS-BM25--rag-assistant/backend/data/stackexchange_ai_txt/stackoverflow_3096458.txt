As geoffc mentioned correctly, in Active Directory the "Users" under the domain is a container object rather than organizational unit object. This results in a totally different LDAP path which is why you get the error message. Try the following code and post if it fixes your issue: // Replace the "company" and "com" with actual domain values... DirectoryEntry de = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://CN=Users,DC=company,DC=com"); DirectorySearcher deSearch = new DirectorySearcher(); deSearch.SearchRoot = de; // Set your other search params here
