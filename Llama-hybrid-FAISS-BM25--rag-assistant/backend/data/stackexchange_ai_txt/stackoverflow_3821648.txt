TWebBrowser and IE version

When I asked this question I accepted the answere because it made sense and the documentation pointed was right. Testing a machine with IE6 against other one with IE7 with the same compiled executable using TWebBrowser the behaviour was indeed as pointed in the answere. Now I put the answere in doubt again, in a machine with IE8 that same executable is being identified as IE7 by the server. I wrote a simple rails app that pirnts the user agent and it is clear. In the same machine if I access this rails app in IE it prints: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6.5; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.30729) When I access using that executable: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6.5; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.30729) Furthermore, with a little help from my friend Process Monitor I realized that the classid called to instantiate the TWebBrowser is {8856F961-340A-11D0-A96B-00C04FD705A2} wich in windows registry has the name "Microsoft Web Browser" and points to ieframe.dll. Now the things get a little more strange. If I go to system32/ieframe.dll and check the version... 8.0. IÂ´m really confused. The question is: When I use TWebBrowser, wich version of ie will be used, indeed? Thanks.
