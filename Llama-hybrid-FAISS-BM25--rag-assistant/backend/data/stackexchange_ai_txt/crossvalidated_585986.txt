How to calculate values of known factors in factor analysis

I have an 18-scale item - Self-Monitoring score, with 10 items loading into Factor A and 5 items into Factor B based on previously established literature. Given that the two factors are already known, using R, how do I calculate the values of Factor A and B by doing factor rotation on the 2 eigenvector values? I'd like to use the two values as separate DVs in a regression. For example, an average score of the 18 items will be 5, what would the score/value of Factor A vs. B be? I am new to factor analysis and thought that it may belong to Confirmatory Factor Analysis. I am unsure of the steps needed to take to calculate the final score of the two factors drawing from the 15 items. Thank you!
