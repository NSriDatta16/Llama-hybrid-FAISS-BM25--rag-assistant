First things first. Do you have to ability to add new "types" at runtime? The answer to this question could invalidate otherwise solid solutions. If the answer to the question is "no", then go with gargantuan's solution. Have a base table for the common fields, and a separate table for the specific fields. The specific tables have a foreign key to the base table. This way avoids dynamic sql, avoids redundant fields, and gives good query performance. There are other solutions but I would rather not mention them unless the above solution does not fulfill your need.
