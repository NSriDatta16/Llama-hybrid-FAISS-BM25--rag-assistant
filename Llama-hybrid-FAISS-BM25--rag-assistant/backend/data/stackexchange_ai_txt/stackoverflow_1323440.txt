If you mean that each user assigns his own sort order to the widgets, then Eric's answer is correct. Presumably you then have to give the user a way to assign the sort value. But if the number is modest as you say, then you can just give him a screen listing all the widgets, and either let him type in the order number, or display them in order and put up and down buttons beside each, of if you want to be fancy, give him a way to drag and drop. If the order is the same for all users, the question becomes, Where does this order come from? If it's arbitrary, just assign a sequence number as new widgets are created.
