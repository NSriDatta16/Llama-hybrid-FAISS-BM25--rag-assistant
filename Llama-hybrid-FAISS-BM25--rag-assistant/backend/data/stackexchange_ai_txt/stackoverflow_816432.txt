You don't really do bsd 'from scratch'. All of the major projects come with a complete system in a single source repository so you're not grabbing a kernel from here, binutils and compiler from over there and c libraries and standard utilities from somewhere else and X from yet another place. They are generally easier to get all the source for and to rebuild the entire system than your average linux distro, but that's not really customizing anything. You could try to do something nuts, like perhaps trying to get the OpenBSD userland to run on a NetBSD kernel with FreeBSD ports, but you'd be on your own and it certainly wouldn't be 'hardened'.
