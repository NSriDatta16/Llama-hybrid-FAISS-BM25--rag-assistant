Index performance on GUIDs is in general no different from other indexes on a 16-byte field. Where the GUID's are deadly for performance is when you use them as clustering key on a SQL Server table. The SQL Server table is the clustered key and is physically ordered by that key. Since the GUIDs are by nature totally random, this leads to massive index fragmentation very quickly, and thus requires a) constant feed and care and reorganization, but b) still suffers even if you reorganize every night. So really, the best practice would be to avoid GUIDs (even the new "sequential" GUIDs) for your clustering key. For more background info and some excellent write-ups on why GUIDs make very poor clustered keys, see the blog of the "Queen of Indexing", Kimberly Tripp: GUIDs as primary key The clustered index debate continues.... The clustered index debate....again! Her insight is most valuable - read it, internalize it, follow it! You won't regret it. Marc
