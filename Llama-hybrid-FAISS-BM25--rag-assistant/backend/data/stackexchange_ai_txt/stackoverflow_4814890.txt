As Filip said, lock is useful here. Not only should you lock on provider.SetNumber(currentNumber), you also need to lock on any conditional that the setter depends on. lock(someObject) { if(provider.CanPassNumber(false, currentNumber)) { currentNumber++; provider.SetNumber(currentNumber); } } as well as if(condition) { lock(someObject) { provider.SetNumber(numberToSet); } } If condition is reliant on numberToSet, you should take the lock statement around the whole block. Also note that someObject must be the same object.
