i've played pretty hard with the magento api using soap (product create) and I couldn't get it to work with the XMLRPC or SOAP out of the box. What i did was using XAMPP setup a basic Product.Create call using PHP and got it to save the Envelope. Then I took this envelope into .NET and recreated it with an XML/HTTP Post. I couldn't find any Generic Objects that would let me create the structure like the PHP Associative array. The only one that would probably represent it would be an Old HashTable with some of the subkeys containing HashTables as their value in a tree structure.
