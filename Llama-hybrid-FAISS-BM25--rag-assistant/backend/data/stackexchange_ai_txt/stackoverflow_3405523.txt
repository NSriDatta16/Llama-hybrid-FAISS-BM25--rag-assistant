Can I calculate and check java project code coverage through Maven?

Possible Duplicate: How to get Cobertura to fail M2 build for low code coverage I would like to calculate code coverage of my Java code base and fail building process if any package, class, or method has code coverage of 80% or less. Is it possible to achieve with some open source tool? Preferably through a maven2 plugin.
