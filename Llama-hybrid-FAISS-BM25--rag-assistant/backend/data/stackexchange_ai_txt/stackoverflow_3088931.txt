Clustering with bigkmeans from bigmemory package in R?

I recently started experimenting with the biganalytics package for R. I ran into a problem however... I am trying to run bigkmeans with a cluster number of about 2000 e.g clust However, I get the following error: Error in 1:(10 + 2^k) : result would be too long a vector Can someone maybe give me a hint what I am doing wrong here?
