Axiomatized formal foundation of statistics

I'm learning statistics in foreign language. Being aware of possibly different foundations (e.g. frequentists v.s. Bayesian), I hope to acquire one formally axiomatized foundation of statistics. That said, if there are multiple foundations, I'd be glad to learn about them too. By a formally axiomatized foundation, I mean something similar to Kolmogorov's in probability. He started with measure theory, defined random variables, and from there discussed the properties of combinations of random variables. If one has a formally defined random variable, then the discussions that follow can be formal too. Statistics, on the other hand, seems to be in search of the underlying random variable given a set of observed data. What exactly, if any, is the rigorous process that teaches us which random variable to choose based on incoming observed data? Questions Is there any formally axiomatized foundation of statistics? In particular, I'm most interested in the process of "guessing" or "assigning likelihood" for the underlying random variables.
