The most thorough, general, and precise treatment of causality is Judea Pearl 2009, "Causality", 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press. Especially, it makes clear that causality is not really a statistical issue - even unlimited data does not solve it. It introduces a precise language to express qualitative and theoretical knowledge needed for causal inference when something about the data is suboptimal. You will see that failed randomization is just one issue among many. It also subsume all other mathematical frameworks, e.g. those by Imbens, Rubin, and Rosenbaum. I can not overstate how accessible, elegant and powerful his approach is. I strongly recommend it. However, you should read it in a non-linear fashion (chapters 5 and 11 are more accessible, and then you can work backwards through chapters 1, 3, and 7 for understanding the general theory). When you have understand the basics, you can easily look into more recent advancements, for example on when it is possible to "transport" causal findings from one context to another, which is not necessarily possible even with randomization (Pearl, Judea, and Elias Bareinboim 2014, "External validity: From do-calculus to transportability across populations." Statistical Science).
