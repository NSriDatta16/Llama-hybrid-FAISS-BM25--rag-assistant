Ext JS Reordering a drag and drop list

I have followed the tutorial over at http://www.sencha.com/learn/Tutorial:Custom_Drag_and_Drop_Part_1 It is great, however now I need pointers on how to add functionally of being to be able reorder a single list. At the moment when I drop a item on the list it is appended at the end. However I wish to be able to drag a item between two others or to the front then drop it there. Any advice appreciated, thanks.
