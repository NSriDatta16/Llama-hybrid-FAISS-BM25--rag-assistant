hidding a draggable after dropping it (scriptaculous)

probably best if i first just write my code down. i have: '> true) %> after the drop on some "box" the draggable element with name = horse.name stays on it. i want to delete it(the name). i was trying different things. supposedly i will have to write plain javascript(i am not sure if thats the case but) if i do that i have problems with getting the parent element id that i have to insert in js. var mydrag = new Draggable(domid, { ghosting: true }); // then destroy it when you don't need it anymore mydrag.destroy(); how can i get proper domid. sth like this.parentNode.id? i also tried true, :endeffect => "this.hide();") %> without success. so my question is how to remove the element after drag?
