Why is accuracy score suddenly becoming 1 on using XGBoost?

I am developing a music classification system based on a kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset I tried using K means classifier to classify the songs into 4 groups for a number of n_neighbours values , but the best accuracy i was able to obtain was 0.5431363971265426 , then i tried using XGboost for the same task to check if the accuracy score was improving and now its jumping straight to 1 , for both the training and testing split , I am not able to understand how this is possible , could someone kindly throw some light on this. This is the error % for 101 (1 to 101) different values of the n_neighbours parameter.
