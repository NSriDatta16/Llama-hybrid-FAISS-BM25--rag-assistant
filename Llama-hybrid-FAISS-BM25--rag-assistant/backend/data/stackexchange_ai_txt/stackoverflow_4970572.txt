Let's put it this way... it's not which server-side language is better and what not, it is what's available in your company that you can leverage of and make good use of it. When you work in a big corporation, sometimes you cannot just introduce "yet another language"... it doesn't work that way. :) Further, every language has its pros and cons. You can almost argue the pros/cons in both way depending on how biased or open-minded you are. You can choose RoR and all that bleeding age technologies, but if your team members are not comfortable in dealing a brand new language, how exactly are you going to maintain the project in long run? I mean, if your team is familiar with PHP, I don't see anything wrong using that compared to Java, .NET, etc. Your customers don't care the underlying implementation as long as it works.
