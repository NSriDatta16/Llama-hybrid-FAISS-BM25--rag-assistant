The other suggestions didn't work for me either. It started working after I changed the "application-identifier" in the Entitlements.plist to the App Id found in the Provisioning Profile. The default was $(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier) which I changed to "H2GC99UNHN.au.com.mydomain.myappname". The Xcode default: $(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier) would work if those variables resolved correctly. CFBundleIdentifier refers to the "Bundle identifier" in your Info.plist. I never found out where to set the AppIdentifierPrefix which should be something like H2GC99UNHN. To find your App ID in Xcode go to the Window menu, then Organizer. Click on the correct Ad Hoc provisioning profile, the App Identifier is one of the properties. PS: To get the app on my device for testing I am using "Build and Run" in Xcode (I don't know any better). But the run part will fail because I have removed debugging symbols in my Beta configuration. Just let the run part fail and then reopen the app manually. This error makes sense if the signed app is linked to the profile and it's certificate via the app id.
