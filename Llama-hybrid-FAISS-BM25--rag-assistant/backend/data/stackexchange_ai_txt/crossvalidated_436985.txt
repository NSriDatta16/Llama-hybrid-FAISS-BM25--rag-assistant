Predicting coefficients in a regular/polynomial equation using neural networks

Any insights onto how one can predict coefficients in lets say a regular or a polynomial equation using machine-learning/neural networks, i.e., $\alpha x_i + \beta x_i^2 + \gamma x_i^3 = y_i,$ where $i=1,2,3,...N.$ I have training data with inputs x and corresponding y. Coefficients to predict are a, b, c, and d. I am yet to spot valid literature related to the subject via google. Thank you
