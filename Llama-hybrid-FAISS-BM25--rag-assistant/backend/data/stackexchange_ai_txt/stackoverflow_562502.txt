Is it a good use of my time to refactor the literals into constants being that the app is pretty well established and runs well? No, you better leave it like it is. What would be the long-term benefits to doing so? If no one ever touch that code, the benefits are none. What you can do, however is avoid adding new literals. But I would pretty much leave existing the way they are. You could probably refactor them in your free to sleep better. Probably there are some other bugs already that need your attention. Fix those instead. Finally, if you manage you add "refactoring" to your task list, go ahead!!!
