SimpleXML: Selecting Elements Which Have A Certain Attribute Value

In an XML document, I have elements which share the same name, but the value of an attribute defines what type of data it is, and I want to select all of those elements which have a certain value from the document. Do I need to use XPath (and if so, could you suggest the right syntax) or is there a more elegant solution? Here's some example XML: myname yourname myothername And I want to select the contents of all tags children of who's type is me . PS - I'm trying to interface with the Netflix API using PHP - this shouldn't matter for my question, but if you want to suggest a good/better way to do so, I'm all ears.
