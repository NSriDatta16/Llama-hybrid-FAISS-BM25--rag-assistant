How to compute significance between powers of spectrum components (Fourier frequencies) of two EEG signals

We have two EEG signals, and ran standard NeuroDSP Spectral Analyses to compute the power spectral densities of both signals. Moreover, because NeuroDSP uses standard Welchâ€™s spectrogram and averages spectral density, we have coefficients of variation at each frequency for both signals too. The question is how to compute a statistical significance of the difference between two power spectral densities? It seems obvious that such a method must exist, but 3 hours of googling didn't bring anything useful. I found a couple ideas, which don't seem right, here . Maybe I used the wrong keywords.
