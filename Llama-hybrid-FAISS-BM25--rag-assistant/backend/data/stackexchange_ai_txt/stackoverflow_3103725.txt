Setting up Magento and SVN on existing install

I've just taken over a large Magento installation with plenty of customizations. I've never used SVN on a project, but I definitely see the benefit of having it. So far, I've managed to create a repository, but I now need to know the process of taking a copy of the current project and getting the SVN setup correctly. What is the process for doing this? Do I start by checking out a clean copy of Magento? What if there is a version mismatch? And please, details help a lot. I know the benefit of SVN, but have no idea how to actually set it up.
