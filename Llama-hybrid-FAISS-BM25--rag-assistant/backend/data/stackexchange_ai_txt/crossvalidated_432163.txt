After reading Factor Graphs and The Sum-product Algorithm by Kschischang I learned that the variable-to-factor messages are just multiplication because it does not do anything about variable elimination; while the facter in factor-to-variable is like one step of sum-product operation. All variables summed up are eliminated and the message passes hence. The logistic regression has only one step of sum-product(actually no connections between variables) and hence the triplet relations just cannot form.
