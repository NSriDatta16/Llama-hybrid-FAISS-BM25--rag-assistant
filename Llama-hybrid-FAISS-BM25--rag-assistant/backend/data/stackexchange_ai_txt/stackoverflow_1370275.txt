Is there any way to change a class' attributes?

I am using Microsoft REST Stark Kit Preview 2 to explore REST Collection WCF Service. Within the Service.svc.cs class, there are some classes and interfaces being used as base or component classes. For example: public interface ICollectionService where TItem : class { ... [WebHelp(Comment = "Returns the items in the collection in JSON format, along with URI links to each item.")] [WebGet(UriTemplate = "?format=json", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)] ItemInfoList GetItemsInJoson(); ... } [CollectionDataContract(Name = "ItemInfoList", Namespace = "")] public class ItemInfoList : List > where TItem : class ... where ICollectionServices and ItemInfoList are all in Microsoft.ServiceModel.Web.dll in the Preview 2. I would change those item's attributes such as WebHelp's Comment and CollectionDataContract's Name so that I could customize help message and templates for xml node names. The Preview 2's change with embedding those interfaces and classes in its dll makes it difficult to do any customization. So my question is that if there is any way to change a class or interface's attributes or overwrite their existing attributes so that I don't need to get the source codes to make changes?
