Organizing Programming Contest - Howto compile and execute

I am building a web based interface where people can type in simple C code for solving algorithmic programming questions. I am using Ace editor where people can type in code and when the press the run button, the C code is sent to server, compiled and output sent back. How do the accomplish the second part in a secure way. I mean given a C code file, compile it and execute it. I can't trust the code so how do i make sure its not malicious and will not harm my system. Also how to impose memory and time limits. Is there any already existing system open source system available which I can modify to suit my needs? I didn't find anything in my search. Or some pointers on how i should proceed next? edit: Found http://cs.sru.edu/~contest/rocktest/ and trying to understand their code but still looking for better options, preferably in php
