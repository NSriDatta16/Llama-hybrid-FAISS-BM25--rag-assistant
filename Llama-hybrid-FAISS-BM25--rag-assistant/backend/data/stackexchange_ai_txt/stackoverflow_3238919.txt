It means that x is implicitly declared an int. This is not allowed in C++, but in C and to maintain compatibility with C headers or pre-ISO C++ code, a lot of contemporary C++compilers still support this as an option. My GCC 4.4 compiler here groks "const x=3;" when feed -fms-extensions on the command line (the manual says, that it turns on a couple of lamps which are required to understand MFC code) UPDATE: I've checked it with VS-2005, you can have implicit int if you use #pragma warning(disable:4430)
