A servlet-container supports only the servlet API (including JSP, JSTL). An application server supports the whole JavaEE - EJB, JMS, CDI, JTA, the servlet API (including JSP, JSTL), etc. It is possible to run most of the JavaEE technologies on a servlet-container, but you have to install a standalone implementation of the particular technology.
