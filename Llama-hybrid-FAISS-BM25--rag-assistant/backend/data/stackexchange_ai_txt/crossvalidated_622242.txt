Coding error? Why is the treatment not showing as a significant effect with GLM and standard error is so high?

I've been handed off some data to analyze and I'm looking for something simple and straightforward. The main study question is testing the efficacy of 7 herbicides, with one untreated control. The 1 response variable of interest variable is mortality, which con be expressed a number of ways: % mortality, # of dead trees, average % mortality, proportion of dead trees, etc. since I have the raw data of dead/alive for each of the 10 trees per treatment group at 6 sites. Since several treatments killed all the trees, the data is skewed and did not meet the assumptions of ANOVA, so I'm starting with the most simple model using the following, where the live/dead response live=0, dead=1. I'm new to this method of analysis but the output doesn't make sense to me with the data- am I coding something wrong or is there a better approach? fm1 |z|) (Intercept) 2.057e+01 5.607e+03 0.004 0.997 treatment2 6.423e-12 7.929e+03 0.000 1.000 treatment3 3.232e-09 7.929e+03 0.000 1.000 treatment4 -2.141e+01 5.607e+03 -0.004 0.997 treatment5 -1.918e+01 5.607e+03 -0.003 0.997 treatment6 -1.837e+01 5.607e+03 -0.003 0.997 treatment7 -4.113e+01 7.929e+03 -0.005 0.996 treatment8 -4.113e+01 7.929e+03 -0.005 0.996 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 105.850 on 79 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 28.727 on 72 degrees of freedom (480 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 44.727 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 19
