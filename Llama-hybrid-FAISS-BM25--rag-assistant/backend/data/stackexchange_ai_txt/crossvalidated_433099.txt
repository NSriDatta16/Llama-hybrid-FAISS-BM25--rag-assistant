The number of variables for each split declined significantly once increased the number of trees

For my data set, I was running a random forest regression with a grid search over a number of trees and number of variables available for splitting ( mtry ). the optimal model, according to Rsquared was 300 trees with 10 mtry . However, if I increase the number of trees to 1500, Rsquare declines by 0.001, but mtry is now 1. Why would this be the case?
