The leading dot in the domain value .example.com means example.com and its subdomains. Without the leading dot, the cookie is only valid for this specific domain. Note that when setting a cookie, domain values without a leading dot will be prepended with a dot. Only when the domain parameter is not set the user agent assumes the current domain for that cookie. So in this case, if http://example.com/ is requested, only the cookie for .example.com will be sent. But in case of http://foo.example.com/ , both cookies for .example.com and foo.example.com will be sent. And in case of http://bla.foo.example.com , only the cookie for .example.com will be sent.
