Pulcinella is a tool for Propagating Uncertainty through Local Computations based on the general framework af valuation systems proposed by Shenoy and Shafer Pulcinella is freely available for educational and strictly non-commercial use. Pulcinella is written in Common Lisp. It has been tested on Allegro CL on Macintosh, and on Lucid CL, Allegro CL, and CLisp on a Sun. The code is just "pure" common lisp, so it should also run on any other reasonable implementation of common-lisp (well, you know...). To get the latest version, click here. Alternatively, you can get Pulcinella by anonymous ftp from ftp://aass.oru.se/pub/saffiotti . The Pulcinella tar archive includes a few examples, taken from the User's Manual. If you fetch this program, you are expected to send a letter at the address below, stating that you will use Pulcinella for research and non-commercial use only. Also here is some references.
