Is a Residual Network a Feedforward Network?

I am really confused about people comparing feedforward networks to residual networks. This is done in several papers I have read into (just one for example, first line in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06262.pdf ). A feedforward network is just defined as not having cycles. Residual Networks do not have cycles. So ResNet should be a feedforward neural network, right? Is this comparasion just done to compare residual networks to traditional feedforward networks or do I miss something?
