No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) for handling class imbalance

I have a dataset of about 100 records and about 80% of those records belong to one class. The rest belong to another class. I'm building two Bayesian models (logistic regression and multiple linear regression) with the Bambi python library which runs the NUTS algorithm for approximating the posterior distribution of the model parameters. How well does the NUTS algorithm handle class imbalance? I'm curious about this because I'd like to know whether I should be employing some other techniques. Here is a little bit more information about the model. The model I'm building is attempting to predict election outcomes for each county in a specific state. The logistic regression model output a binary value of 0 or 1, representing democrat or republican. The goal is to use a trained model on previous election years to predict out-of-sample election results from a year that was not part of the training dataset.
