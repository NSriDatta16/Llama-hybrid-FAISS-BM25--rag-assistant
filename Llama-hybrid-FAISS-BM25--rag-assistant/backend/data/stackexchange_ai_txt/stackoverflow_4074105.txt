It should be noted that you should NOT rely on requestAction as a common practice. requestAction is an extremely taxing call and should only be used if you cannot organize your code in any other way. Ideally, you'd send the data you need from your controller action to the view rather than calling back up to your controller. function my_action() { ... $this->set('category', $this->getCategory()); }
