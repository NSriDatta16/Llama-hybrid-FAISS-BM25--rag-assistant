Clusters in the form of parallel rectangles

I have a dataset with 3 features and a pile of quite flat rectangles. My task is perform clustering on this dataset using any clustering method but not hierarchical. I have scaled all features and do kmeans with 6 clusters and got bad result. Tried also to do MDS but I havent enough memory. PCA doesnt work too. It seems that I can use only one feature to separate the data. But I wonder if there is some clustering method which can handle this data properly? Data K-means results
