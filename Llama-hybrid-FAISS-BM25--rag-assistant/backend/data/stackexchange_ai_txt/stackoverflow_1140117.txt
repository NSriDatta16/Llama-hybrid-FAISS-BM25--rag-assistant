How to implement a box or gaussian blur on iOS

I want to be able to take an image and blur it relatively quickly (say in 0.1 sec). Image size would almost never be larger than 256 x 256 px. Do I have to loop thru every pixel and average them with neighbors or is there a higher-level way that I could do this? PS : I am aware that multiple box blurs can approximate a gaussian blur.
