As others have remarked, malloc() is returning NULL because your application has run out of memory (or, more precisely, virtual address space). If I understand your description correctly, you're successfully running the same workload twice, but the third time you try, you're out of memory. There are basically two things that could be happening here: You're leaking memory . (I see you say that you're freeing the memory you use, but leaking memory accidentally is awfully easy to do.) You can find information on Visual C++'s built-in features for leak detection here . You're fragmenting memory . As applications have started using a significant portion of the available 32-bit address space, fragmentation has started to become a real problem. Unfortunately, there isn't really a cut-and-dried solution to this problem, but take a look at these SO questions for more information: How to avoid heap fragmentation?
