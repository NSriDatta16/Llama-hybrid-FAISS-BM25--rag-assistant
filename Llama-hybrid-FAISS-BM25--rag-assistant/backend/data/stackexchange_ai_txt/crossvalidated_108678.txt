I do not think Var$(Z)\le $Var$(X)$. Imagine that $X$ is a time series that meanders about values near 100, almost always between 98 and 102. Now imagine that $Z$ meanders between 0 and 100, but is always less than $X$. The variance of $Z$ is clearly going to be larger in such a case than the variance of $X$. This is an example where $X$ and $Z$ are stationary around some constants, but it could easily be extended to a trend stationary example... I am not sure if it would extend to integrated time series... need to think on that.
