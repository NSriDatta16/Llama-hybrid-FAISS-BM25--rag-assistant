If you want to drag the widgets around, you could use Glade to create user interface, and save it in GtkBuilder project, then load it with GTK+ bindings in your programming language. It's pretty easy and you have those tutorials in Glade's website. By the way, Linux is just the kernel of the system, although I think all modern GNU/Linux systems with graphical support are equipped with X. However it still depends on the specific library. Generally GNOME and KDE use GTK+ and Qt respectively.
