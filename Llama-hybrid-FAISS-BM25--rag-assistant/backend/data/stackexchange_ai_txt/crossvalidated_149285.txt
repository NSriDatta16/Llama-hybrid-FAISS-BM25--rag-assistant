Logistic Regresion / SVM / Random Forest Implementation in Matlab

I would like to implement (L2-regularized) Logistic Regression, (L2 regularized) SVM and Random Forest for multiclass classification in Matlab (without using a toolbox or the corresponding functions in Matlab). Does somebody know easy implementable pseudocode or easy Code (in Java, R, Python etc.) which I can use for my implementation in Matlab.
