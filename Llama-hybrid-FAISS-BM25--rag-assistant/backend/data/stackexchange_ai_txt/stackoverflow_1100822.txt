Ignore touches to background (super) view

How should I be handling, or rather NOT handling (ignoring), touches to my background view? It happens to be the view of my View Controller which has subviews (objects) that I DO want to respond to touch events. Setting userInteractionEnabled = NO for the view seems to turn off ALL interaction for the subviews as well. I'm currently testing for if ([[touch view] superview] == self.view) in touchesBegan/Moved/Ended. But I'm trying to eliminate some conditional testing so looking for a better way...
