You can't be sure that they will be better then your classifier, however given the fact that there are multiple examples of neural networks achieving very high accuracy and that companies like Google use and develop them for such purposes, this seems likely. You can google for "Convolutional Neural Network image classification accuracy" , to find multiple tutorials that with toy models easily achieve >80% accuracy with little or no tuning, while state-of-art algorithms can be much better , as the one described in the (randomly chosen) paper by Hasanpour et al. who describe algorithms that achieve >99% accuracy with some datasets. Notice however that this highly depends on the model you choose and the data you are dealing with (you can always find data where state-of-art algorithms will fall).
