There can be no single answer to this question without first deciding: What is the Windows FILETIME actually counting? The Microsoft docs say it counts 100 nanosecond intervals since 1601 UTC, but this is problematic. No form of internationally coordinated time existed prior to the year 1960. The name UTC itself does not occur in any literature prior to 1964. The name UTC as an official designation did not exist until 1970. But it gets worse. The Royal Greenwich Observatory was not established until 1676, so even trying to interpret the FILETIME as GMT has no clear meaning, and it was only around then that pendulum clocks with accurate escapements began to give accuracies of 1 second. If FILETIME is interpreted as mean solar seconds then the number of leap seconds since 1601 is zero, for UT has no leap seconds. If FILETIME is interpreted as if there had been atomic chronometers then the number of leap seconds since 1601 is about -60 (that's negative 60 leap seconds). That is ancient history, what about the era since atomic chronometers? It is no better because national governments have not made the distinction between mean solar seconds and SI seconds. For a decade the ITU-R has been discussing abandoning leap seconds, but they have not achieved international consensus. Part of the reason for that can be seen in the javascript on this page (also see the delta-T link on that page for plots of the ancient history). Because national governments have not made a clear distinction, any attempt to define the count of seconds since 1972 runs the risk of being invalid according to the laws of some jurisdiction. The delegates to ITU-R are aware of this complexity, as are the folks on the POSIX committee. Until the diplomatic issues are worked out, until national governments and international standards make a clear distinction and choice between mean solar and SI seconds, there is little hope that the computer standards can follow suit.
