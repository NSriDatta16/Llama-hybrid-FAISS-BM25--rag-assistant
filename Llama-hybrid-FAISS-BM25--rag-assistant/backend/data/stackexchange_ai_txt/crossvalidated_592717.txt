ROC AUC = 0.69 and PR AUC = 0.007

just a question my data is not balanced and to address the imbalance I am using cost sensitive logistic regression however the results are surprising, ROC AUC = 0.69 and PR AUC = 0.007 does the Pr Auc score indicate that my performance is worse than guess? Is working on a binary classification.
