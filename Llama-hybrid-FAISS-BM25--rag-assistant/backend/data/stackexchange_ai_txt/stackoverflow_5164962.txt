By default Android will retain the fragment objects. In your code you are setting the homeFragment in your onCreate function. That is why it is allways some homeFragment or fl what ever that you set in onCreate . Because whenever you rotate, the onCreate will execute and set your fragment object to the first one So the easy solution for you is check whether savedInstanceState bundle is null or not and set the fragment object @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); if(null == savedInstanceState) { // set you initial fragment object } }
