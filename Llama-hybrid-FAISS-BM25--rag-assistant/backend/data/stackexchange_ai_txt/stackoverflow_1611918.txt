The root cause of this problem is the use of triggers to do anything other than logging or other non-application related tasks. It's pretty widely regarded as very bad practice to use them for data manipulation in this way. Adding to this is the use of the EXCEPTIONS clause to silently trap errors and invoke that update. And using WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL is a tragedy waiting to happen. All terrible PL/SQL programming practices that should never have passed a code review. Refactoring time.
