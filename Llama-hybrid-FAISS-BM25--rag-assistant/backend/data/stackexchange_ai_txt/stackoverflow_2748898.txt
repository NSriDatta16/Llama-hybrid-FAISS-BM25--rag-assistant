How to add a skin engine to asp.net MVC system

I'm implementing a solution in ASP.NET MVC that later can be applied to couple of other fields. To do so it will require to re-brand the UI even though the underlying business logic wont need to change. I'd like to write the code in such a way that will allow other developers to only develop code that will only changes the UI. This is similar to the way that themes can be written against Wordpress Blog software. Can any one suggest how to organize my project to make such feature work?
