Psuedo-"Odds ratio" for multiple columns

I have a dataset with a categorical target ( $y$ ) and multiple categorical features ( $x_1$ , $x_2$ , ..., $x_i$ ). I have been able to successfully use a logistic regression model to calculate an odds ratio for each feature individual. I was wondering what metric is traditionally used for groups of categorical features together. The idea would be that the $x$ values can be split into separate groups, as in Group A ( $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ ), Group B ( $x_4$ , $x_5$ , $x_6$ ), etc. My goal is to find some statistical tool to compare the combined predictive power for the $x_i$ features together within each group. Alternatively, my $y$ values are also available as a continuous variable, so I would be grateful for any suggestions given a continuous $y$ , not just a categorical $y$ . The odds ratio might be the wrong analogy here, and I might be looking for something completely different. Regression might not be the right tool either.
