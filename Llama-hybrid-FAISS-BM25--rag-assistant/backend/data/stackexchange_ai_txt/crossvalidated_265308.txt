Interpreting ARIMA for Interrupted Time Series Analysis

I want to test for efficacy of an intervention. I have pre- and post-intervention data and I used auto.arima to find the best fit for the two data sets. I'm stuck in the actual use of these models now. What do I do with the auto.arima fit? Can I graph it and test for statistically significant differences in the coefficients? If so, how do I graph it? This is what I have right now ( specified from auto.arima ) myPreFit myPostFit
