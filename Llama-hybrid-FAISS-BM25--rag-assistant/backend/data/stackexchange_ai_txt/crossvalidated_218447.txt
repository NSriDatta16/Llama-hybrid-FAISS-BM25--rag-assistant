prediction using PCA in R

I'm calculating a PCA using the prcomp function in R and I have a short question about the prediction capabilities within this object. I'm using the iris data set: # Load data data(iris) head(iris, 3) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa The code is as follows: data(iris) # log transform log.ir When one wants to run a prediction based on this PCA, one can easily run: predict(ir.pca, newdata=tail(log.ir, 2)) The question is, lets say I have a similar data set as iris but MINUS one column. tt Why can't I run the prediction using the set of columns I have? Are there any recommendations on how I should address this problem?
