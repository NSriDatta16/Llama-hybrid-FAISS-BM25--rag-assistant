The answer to your last question is a flat NO. The magnitude of coefficients are in no way a measure of importance. The lasso can be used for logistic regression. You need to study the area more assiduously. The methods you need to study are those that involve "penalized" methods. If you are looking for detection methods that uncover "shadowed" predictors, a term that may be defined somewhere but is not in general use, then you need to be looking for methods that inspect interactions and non-linear structure within the predictor space and the outcome linkage to that space. There is quite a bit of discussion of these issues and methods in Frank Harrell's text "Regression Modeling Strategies". The backward selection strategy will fail to deliver valid results (although it does deliver results). If you looked at a case of 20 random predictors for 100 events you will probably find 2 or 3 that will be selected with a backward selection process. The prevalence of backward selection in the real world reflects not careful statistical thought but rather its easy availability in SAS and SPSS and lack of sophistication of those products' user base. The R user base has a harder time accessing such methods and users that post requests on the mailing lists and SO they generally get advised of the problems involved with backward (or forward) selection methods.
