An easy and somewhat effective algorithm is to use 1/f noise aka "pink noise" to select durations and notes from a scale. This sounds sort of like music and can be a good starting point. A better algorithm is to use "markov chains".. scan some example music and build a table of probabilities. In the simplest case, it would be something like C is 20% likely to follow A. To make this better, look at the sequence of the past few notes, for example "C A B" is 15% likely to be followed by B, and 4% likely to be followed by a Bb, etc. Then, just pick notes using the probabilities of the previously chosen notes. This remarkably simple algorithm generates pretty good results. Markov chains for music generation
