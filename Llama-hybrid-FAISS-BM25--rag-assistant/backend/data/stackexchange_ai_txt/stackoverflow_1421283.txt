If you are programming vba I assume that you are working with Adodb or simply ADO. Therefore in order to delete a table records you can use a command object to do that. Dim cnn as Connection Dim cmd as Command Set cnn=new Connection() cnn.ConnectionString="ConnectionString" cnn.Open() Set cmd=new Command() cmd.ActiveConnection=cnn cmd.CommandText="DELETE FROM MyTable" cmd.Execute() cnn.Close() Updated: In order to use ADO objects you should add a reference to ADODB library
