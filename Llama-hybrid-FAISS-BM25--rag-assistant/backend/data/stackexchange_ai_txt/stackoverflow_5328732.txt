QueryOver combines extension methods and lambda expressions: IList cats = session.QueryOver () .Where(c => c.Name == "Max") .List(); QueryOver is a strongly-typed querying technology built on top of NHibernateâ€™s Criteria API. You can read more info here and here . As far as I know some features in the linq provider are not implemented yet. I would use QueryOver . It allows you to write elegant code and it is fully featured. Something worth reading .
