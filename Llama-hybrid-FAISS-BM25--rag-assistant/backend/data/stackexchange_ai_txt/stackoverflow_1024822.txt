You can occasionally get away with doing arithmetic on the red & blue components simultaneously in a single int: int average(int rgb1, int rgb2) { int rb = (((rgb1 & 0xFF00FF) + (rgb2 & 0xFF00FF)) >> 1) & 0xFF00FF; int g = (((rgb1 & 0xFF00) + (rgb2 & 0xFF00)) >> 1) & 0xFF00; return (rb | g); } because the red and blue components are separated by 8 bits, they don't interfere with each other. I've never seen a significant (more than 5-10%) speedup from this though.
