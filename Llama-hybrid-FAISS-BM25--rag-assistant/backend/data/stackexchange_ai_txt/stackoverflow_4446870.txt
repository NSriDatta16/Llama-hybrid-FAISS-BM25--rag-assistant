See. Put the image in each of the 3 folders with different sizes and resolutions i.e. hdpi, ldpi and mdpi. And you can call the image this way: R.drawable.image_name Dont worry android will take care and on large screen its will open hdpi where as in small screens it will open image from ldpi. When you define, height and width use dp as unit instead of pixels.
