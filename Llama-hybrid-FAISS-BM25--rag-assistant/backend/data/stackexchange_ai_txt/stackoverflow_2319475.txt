Luca, I am going to take a small liberty and rephrase your question for you and then hopefully answer it. So I could be one right or twice wrong.. Hi, I would like to get the value of a an object's property using a string key, similar to var id=model["ModelId"]; . Is this possible? to which would answer: One way is to use the Reflection api. model.GetType().GetProperty("ModelId").GetValue(model,null);
