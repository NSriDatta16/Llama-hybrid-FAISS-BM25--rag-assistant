Copying your object is probably very expensive (given its size). Try storing a pointer to the object instead of the entire thing, or a boost::shared_ptr if you want to make deletion simple. This way, when the data structure reorganizes itself, copying is very fast, since it is just a pointer assignment, instead of whatever was required to copy your huge object.
