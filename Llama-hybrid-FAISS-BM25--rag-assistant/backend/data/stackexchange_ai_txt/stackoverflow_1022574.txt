James, I've done this before. I was digging through my old code, trying to find a sample I could show here, but I can't seem to find it. Old client, code is probably gone, etc... You are on the right track though. Remember, 'has_attachment' is just a method call with a hash for the parameters, so if you treat it as such, you can adjust which hash values are ultimately sent to the method. Edit - Here is a code sample - production = ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'production' has_attachment :content_type => :image, :max_size => 1.megabyte, :resize_to => '800x600>', :thumbnails => { :thumb => '146x146>', :small => '75x75' }, # skip s3 for local development and testing :storage => (production ? :s3 : :file_system), :path_prefix => (production ? 'comment_images' : 'public/comment_images') In the above example, I wanted to store uploads locally while developing, but switch to S3 when in production. So you are very close to where you need to be...
