How about implementing one of the most basic binary classifiers by hand without any libraries, Logistic Regression? Here is the explanation of the Logistic Regression in subtle terms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tByJTacCOc&index=6&list=PLBAGcD3siRDguyYYzhVwZ3tLvOyyG5k6K Here is the description of writing a simplified version of a binary classifier in Python, which will take a few buckets of lines in the vectorized form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERIFzbTdIm0&index=14&list=PLBAGcD3siRDguyYYzhVwZ3tLvOyyG5k6K If you feel uncomfortable with the implementation or confused about something, I'm sure that if you watch the videos in between the two that I provide, you will be able to easily write the algorithm that the video describes. I hope I could help; if you are not happy with the offered solution, I will be around for alternatives. Have fun.
