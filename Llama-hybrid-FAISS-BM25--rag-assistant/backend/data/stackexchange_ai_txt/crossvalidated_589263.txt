Francis Bach's Machine Learning Research blog is an "easy to digest" introduction to some of his research works and related topics ("easy" as in easier than reading the original papers). It contains many excellent in-depth writings about kernel methods, optimization algorithms, linear algebra and highlights how these topics interact with each other as well as their applications in Machine Learning/Statistical Learning Theory.
