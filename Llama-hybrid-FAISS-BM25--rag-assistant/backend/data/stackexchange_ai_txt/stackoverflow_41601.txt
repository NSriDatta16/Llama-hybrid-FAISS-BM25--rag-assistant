User Interface Testing

We are working on a large project with a measure of new/modified GUI functionality. We've found in the past that we often introduced new problems in related code when adding new functionality. We have non-technical users perform testing, but they often miss parts and allow bugs to slip through. Are there any best practices for organizing the UI testing of a WinForms project? Is there any way to automate it?
