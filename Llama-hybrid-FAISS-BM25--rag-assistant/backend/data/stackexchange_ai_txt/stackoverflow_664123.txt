'default' as a variable name

While debugging some code, I came across an array named default . I thought that keywords were not allowed as variable names. #include "stdafx.h" #include int main() { int default = 5; printf("%d\n", default); return 0; } Now the above code compiles without a hitch on VS 2008. Isn't 'default' a keyword? How come it works as a variable name? Side-effects? PS: Infragistics::Win::UltraWinToolbars::ToolbarsCollection has a property with this name!
