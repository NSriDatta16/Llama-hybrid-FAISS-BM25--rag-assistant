Following on from John's answer, to do per subject medians, use tapply : test2 To remove the values at the median you can use, subset(test2,!(rt1==median.rt1 | rt2==median.rt2)) Or some tolerance based test if you are expecting numerical representation error to cause problems with the straight equality test. You can then run the tapply and merge lines again (though maybe subsetting away the original median columns) to calculate new medians, and redo the speed classifications should you want to. Personally I would use a nested ifelse to classify as fast, slow or average though.
