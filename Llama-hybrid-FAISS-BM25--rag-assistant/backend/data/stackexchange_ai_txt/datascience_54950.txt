Include time as a variable in regression model

I am currently working on a regression problem which requires me to predict the costs of a fixed asset. I have used several variables to do so and derived a predicted cost. However, my superior has wanted me to incorporate time as a variable in the regression model which I am at a loss on how to do so. My data set looks something like this which does not resemble a time series dataset. Name Capacity OEM Country Date of valuation MONTH YEAR Cost A1 220 JAPAN JAPAN 1/1/2012 1 2012 300,000,000 A2 220 JAPAN JAPAN 1/1/2012 1 2012 300000000 B1 400 CHINA CHINA 1/3/2013 3 2013 475000000 B2 400 CHINA CHINA 1/3/2013 3 2013 475000000 B3 400 CHINA CHINA 1/3/2013 3 2013 475000000 B4 400 CHINA CHINA 1/3/2013 3 2013 475000000 C1 750 INDIA USA 1/5/2016 5 2016 268000000 C2 750 INDIA USA 1/5/2016 5 2016 268000000 The variables that I have used are capacity, OEM and country. Any help on how to incorporate time to my regression problem is welcomed.
