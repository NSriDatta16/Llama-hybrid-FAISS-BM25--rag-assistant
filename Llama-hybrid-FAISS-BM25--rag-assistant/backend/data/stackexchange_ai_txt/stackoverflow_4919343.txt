choosing a threshold value to compute the similarity between two images in matlab

In order to compute the distance (D) between the query image feature with each image database feature and display (n-similarity images to the user). I try to use the following approach: I choose two threshold values (T1, T2) . For the first one I keep all the distances ( D2 ) which are larger than ( T1 ) in a variable say ( L1 ), and keep all the distances ( D2 ) which are smaller than ( T2 ) in another variable, say ( L2 ). Then, I compute the similarity measure by: S(i) = L2 * average(D3) / (L3^2) Please, how could I choose these thresholds? Is there is any method to compute the threshold value or should I choose it randomly?
