At the time I was writing a network traffic analysis tool using libpcap for the capture and libnids for the stream assembly. I haven't tried reinjecting traffic, but you can use TAP to forward traffic to a user program that will use libnids to assemble the packets, put out streams to a filter code, then take the stream and disassemble them (I'm pretty sure libnids has this capability as well) and reinject them into where you need it to go. If you want python, pynids seems to do what you need, but I have no experience with it.
