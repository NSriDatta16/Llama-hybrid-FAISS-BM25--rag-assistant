Normally when I'm doing something like this, I have two ways of doing this 1 - If my global variables are common to all 3 environments (development, test, production) , then i will store it in config/environments.rb file But lets say my values are changing upon the environment Ex: my development environment SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT is '/development_root/' and testing environment SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT is '/testing_root/' then I will store them inside config/environments/ As per the above example config/environments/development.rb will have SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT = '/development_root/' config/environments/test.rb will have SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT = '/testing_root/' config/environments/production.rb will have SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT = '/production_root/' hope this helps, cheers, sameera
