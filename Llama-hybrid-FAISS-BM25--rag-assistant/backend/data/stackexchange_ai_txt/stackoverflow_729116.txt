Variable value inconsistency on BASH and CSH

May God never give you the bane of working on Solaris. Now, I am trying to run this simple shell script: #!/bin/sh input="a b c" data="123" while read eachline do data="$data$eachline" done On RHEL(BASH) I receive output as expected i.e "123abc", however, on Solaris I receive just "123". After fair bit of googling, I realized that Solaris is forking a process for code inside the while loop and hence the variable's($data) value is not reflected on the outside of while loop. Any hope to make this code compatible on both platforms would be greatly appreciated. And oh yes, using a temp file for redirection would not be a very elegant solution :| .
