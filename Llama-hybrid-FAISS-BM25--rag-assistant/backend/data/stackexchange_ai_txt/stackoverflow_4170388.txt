The default containment is document for the dialog's draggable , you can turn it off though, like this: $(' Dialog ').dialog().parent().draggable("option", { containment: false }); You can test it with your demo code here . We turn it off on the .parent() because the dialog gets wrapped in a parent (that includes the title bar, etc), and that's the element that's draggable.
