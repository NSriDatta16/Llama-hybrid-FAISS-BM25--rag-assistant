Calculate single absolute standardized difference across levels of a categorical treatment variable cobalt::bal.tab

Can I calculate a single absolute standardized difference (ASD) across the levels of my categorical treatment variable? For reporting in a balance table. I performed an inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis to estimate the average treatment effect of provider experience on complications after surgery. I used cobalt::bal.tab (R) to generate my balance table reporting ASD before and after adjustment. The output provides an unadjusted and adjusted difference for each level of each categorical variable. A peer reviewer requests I report one ASD per categorical variable (not one for each level). Is there a way to calculate this by hand or does cobalt::bal.tab provide a solution I have not discovered yet? An example of a section of my output: ('Age' is continuous and 'ASA status' categorical with 4 levels.) Unweighted Population IPTW Population Basic Advanced ASD Basic Advanced ASD n 100 200 200 300 Age 34 (24.3-52.0) 38 (27.0-57.8) 0.22 34.0 (25.0-55.9) 36.2 (27.0-57.0) 0.08 ASA status 1 70 (70) 100 (50) 0.20 120 (60) 150 (50) 0.10 2 20 (20) 80 (40) 0.10 60 (30) 100 (33) 0.03 3 8 (8) 40 (20) 0.12 30 (10) 50 (17) 0.07 4 0 (0) 8 (4) 0.04 0 (0) 9 (3) 0.03 etc... So for 'ASA status' can I calculate a single ASD across the four levels? One unadjusted and one adjusted? Thank you for reading my question :-)
