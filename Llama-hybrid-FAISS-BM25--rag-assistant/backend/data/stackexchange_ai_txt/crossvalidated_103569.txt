Testing for heteroscedasticity with many observations

I used the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity, but I have many observations ($\approx 500,\! 000$) and the Breusch-Pagan test uses $nR^2$ as a test statistic where $n$ is the number of observations. But with the Breusch-Pagan test I will always get heteroscedasticity unless my $R^2$ is almost 0. From the residual graphs there seems to be no heteroscedasticity, but according to the Breusch-pagan test there is. So is there any test that is good to use in the case of many observations?
