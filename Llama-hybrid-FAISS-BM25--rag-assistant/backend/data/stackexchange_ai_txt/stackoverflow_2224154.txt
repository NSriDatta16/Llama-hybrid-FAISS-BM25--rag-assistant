find unused images, css rules, js script blocks

We have a fairly large asp.net website. The images, css and javascripts are property organized in the website project but as we are changing the look and feel of the website, I would like to know if there is a tool/add-in that will help me identify which images are not being used in the website. I would like to find the same thing with css and javascript as well. I have looked at dustme firefox extension but that only does css.
