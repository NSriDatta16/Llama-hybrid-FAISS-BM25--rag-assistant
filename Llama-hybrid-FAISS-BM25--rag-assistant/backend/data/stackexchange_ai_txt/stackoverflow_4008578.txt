first, you may want to declare your instance as: static DataCache _instance = new DataCache(); this way (not the only one for sure), you know _instance is generated thread safe. There is much coverage on the topic for thread safe singletons, but this seems one of the simplest solutions. The second thing may be you want to try using is a structure like Lock (_lockObject) { ... } for both reads and writes. This will make your reads and writes safe from different threads. Finally, but this is pure speculation, you can try by creating a separate object for your COM calls that resides in a STA and accesses your library. Good luck!
