How can I test my trained model on a completely new dataset?

Preface I have an annotated text dataset on hate speech. Simply put, the dataset consists of a column called text which includes a piece of text, and a column called label which can be either 0 (non-hateful) or 1 (hateful). Let's call this dataset Dataset A . I am using this dataset to train a very simple classifier using Logistic Regression. Code: dataset_1_df = pd.read_csv(d_1_path, sep='\t') text = dataset_1_df.text X = text y = dataset_1_df['label'].astype(int) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42, test_size=0.1) clf = Pipeline([ ('vect', CountVectorizer(max_features=10000, ngram_range=(1, 2))), ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer(norm='l2')), ('clf', LogisticRegression()), ]) clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train) y_preds = clf.predict(X_test) This classifier works fine. I can produce a classification report like this: report = classification_report(y_test, y_preds) print(report) Which outputs: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.87 0.70 0.78 410 1 0.94 0.98 0.96 2069 accuracy 0.93 2479 macro avg 0.91 0.84 0.87 2479 weighted avg 0.93 0.93 0.93 2479 And I can now make predictions like this: print(clf.predict(['I hate you'])) print(clf.predict_proba(['I hate you'])) Which outputs: [1] [[0.0749381 0.9250619]] My Question I have another dataset, let's call this Dataset B , independent to Dataset A . Dataset B is also an annotated text dataset on hate speech with the same columns. What I want to do is to test the model I trained using Dataset A on Dataset B . I.e., I want to produce a classification report on my model's performance on Dataset B . Can I do that? If yes, how? Clarification: I do not want to retrain my model using Dataset B . I want to see how good its performance is on the new dataset. Similar Questions There is this question that looks similar based on the title but does not ask what I'm asking. There's is also this question which asks how to make predictions. However, I know how to make predictions, what I want to do is to test my trained model on a totally new dataset.
