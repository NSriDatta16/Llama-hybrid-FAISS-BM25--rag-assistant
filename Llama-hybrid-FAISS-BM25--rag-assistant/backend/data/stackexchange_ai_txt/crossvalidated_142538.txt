The Neural Network will handle this on its own. Depending on the number of instances of the contradictory data the Neural Network will iterate over the values and the eta will change the weights in the direction represented in the data. The net effect will be the majority of instances of the data will have the heaviest impact on the Neural Networks neurons. Just leave them in, and you will get the "most probable" solution.
