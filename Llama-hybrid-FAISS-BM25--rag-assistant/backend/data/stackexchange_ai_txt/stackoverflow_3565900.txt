I don't know too much about draggable, but there seems to be some strange behavior when cloning a draggable element with true . Perhaps you don't want all the data cloned if some of it should be specific to that element. In this simple example, when you clone(true) one and try to drag the clone, the original is dragged. http://jsfiddle.net/ZmcHd/ Perhaps it is better to just reapply the draggable() . clonedrow = $("#row1").clone().draggable(); http://jsfiddle.net/ZmcHd/1/ If there are other settings that you need, then I'd store them in a variable in order to prevent duplication. var settings = { // some settings } clonedrow = $("#row1").clone().draggable(settings);
