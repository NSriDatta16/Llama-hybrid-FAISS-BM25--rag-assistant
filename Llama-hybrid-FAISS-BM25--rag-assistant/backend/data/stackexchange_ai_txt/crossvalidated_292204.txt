We've got some heavy-duty mathematicians answering this question. I've never seen a diagram like you depict here, with the values for predictors X1 and X2 and the 'decision boundary' line separating the predicted positives from the predicted negatives. (or is it a map of predicted vs. actual outcomes?) But it is useful---as long as you have only two predictors of interest that you want to map. It appears that the magenta line separates the predicted positives from the predicted negatives, whereas the dark blue line includes all the positives. This is usually the case in logistic regression: the model will correctly predict the outcome for less than 100% of the cases (and will predict some false positives and/or false negatives). It's possible to run logistic regression and have the procedure produce the function h(x) for each individual case in the dataset. This will produce a propensity score for each subject, from 0 to 1, that gives the predicted likelihood or probability of the positive outcome for each subject based on that subject's predictor variables, based on the logistic regression model using all subjects. Those at the propensity score cutoff of 0.5 or above are predicted to have the outcome, and those below 0.5 are predicted to not have the outcome. But you can adjust this cutoff level as you see fit, for example to make a diagnostic prediction model of some outcome based on all the input variables that are entered in your logistic regression analysis. You can set the cutoff at 0.3 for example. You can then do a 2X2 table of predicted-vs-actual outcomes, and determine your sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate and false negative rate of the model based on this cutoff level. This provides more information and also frees you from the limit of 2 variables used in your graph. You can use as many predictors as you can reasonably fit in the model and still make a 2X2 table of actual-vs-predicted outcome. Since logistic regression uses categorical (yes-no) outcomes, each cell in the 2X2 table is simply a count of the subjects that meet the row and column criteria. In the graph you provide, it probably assumes a cutoff of 0.5. This is the common default for software. If you adjusted it higher (to 0.65 for example), it might include all the O's inside the line but you would also have some false positives (X's that it thinks should be O's) that would be predicted by the model to have the outcome of interest. (or adjust the cutoff score lower and have more false negatives). I hope this helps.
