Why is my XSLT fragment causing an error?

I am trying to use the below code to check if my variable contains the word NOT_INTERFACED. So I am using the ends-with function. But if it does I want to print the remaining word minus NOT_INTERFACED. But I am getting an error, my java program is calling this template however I get an exception ends-with not found. Am I doing something wrong syntax wise ? and the error is COULD NOT FIND FUNCTION ENDS WITH. LOCATION: unknown java.lang.NullPointerException
