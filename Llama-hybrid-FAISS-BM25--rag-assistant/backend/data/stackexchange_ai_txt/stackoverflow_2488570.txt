The intention of the Universal Type Identifier (UTI) system is to prevent this otherwise impossible-to-solve-elegantly problem. If the three file types don't have distinguishing UTIs (and filename extensions), you're probably out of luck. If this is a problem you see coming and still have control of the files' generation, give them unique UTIs and declare those UTIs in your app's Info.plist.
