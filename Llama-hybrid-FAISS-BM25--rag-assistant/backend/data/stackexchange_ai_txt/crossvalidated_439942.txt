Importance function random forest to create a logistic regression

I have created a random forest function, the dependent variable is a binary variable (either 1 or 0). When I do the importance of my random forest, it gave me the %IncMSE. Regarding it is logistic regression, is it normal that it does not give me the error rate? Thank you for your help,
