Any decent static analysis tool should have this functionality (as well as all the other stuff that such tools do). Wikipedia has a good list of such tools. Another group of tools that may be worth checking out are coverage tools. The call graph generated by the coverage tool will contain only the calls that actually take place during a run of the program. Initially this may be more helpful to you than a full call graph. I'm unable to make any suggestions on this for Windows, but for linux projects I highly recommend gcov and lcov .
