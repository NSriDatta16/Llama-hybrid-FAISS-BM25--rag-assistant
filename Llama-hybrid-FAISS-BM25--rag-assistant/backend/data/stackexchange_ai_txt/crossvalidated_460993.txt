Probability density vs probability in Bayesian statistics

I have started learning Bayesian statistics recently, but I am confused about probability densities and probability. I do know they are different, and I can usually identify both, but in one problem, I am confused if I am calculating a probability density or probability. Here is the description: I have a variable, $m \sim N(\frac{a+b}2, 1)$ The prior distribution for $a$ and $b$ are as follows- both $a$ and $b$ are uniformly distributed over $[-1,1]$ . I wanted to calculate, $P(0 \leq b \leq 1 |0 \leq a \leq 1, m=0)$ . If I calculate this, will I have a probability density or probability? If it is a probability density, can its value exceed 1? Especially, if I find that the value of the expression is greater than $0.5$ , does that mean that given the conditions, the probability of getting a positive $b$ is greater than $0.5$ ? And that the probability of $b$ being less than $0$ is less than $0.5$ ?
