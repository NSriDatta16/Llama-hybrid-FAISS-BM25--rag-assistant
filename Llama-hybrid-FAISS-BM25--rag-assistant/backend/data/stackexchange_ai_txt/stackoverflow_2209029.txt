jQuery Sortable() with original position placeholder?

Is there any way to have a jQuery sortable list show a placeholder for where the initial item was when you drag one out to sort? i.e. when a user goes to move one of the LIs in my list, I want a rectangle outline to show where the one they're dragging came from.
