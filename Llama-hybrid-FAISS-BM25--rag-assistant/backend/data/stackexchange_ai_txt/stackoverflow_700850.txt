eclipse indexer problem with cmake project

I've created the eclipse project with cmake. I use vtk with qt. Dir structure is as follows: parent_dir: source - source.h, source.cpp build - this is where the .project resides I've fired up the eclipse with workspace dir /path/parent . I have followed the instructions described in http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Eclipse_CDT4_Generator . Everything builds fine, but navigation is not working. That is, the eclipse gives me the warning that the source.h is not indexed yet. Furthermore, autocompletion doesn't work with qt and vtk related classes. I had checked with Project|Properties, where the qt and vtk includes are included. What am I doing wrong? I would really like to have autocompletion nd navigation in eclipse working with my project. I'm using eclipse ganymede on ubuntu 8.04 64-bit. thx in advance
