In regular multiple regression $\hat{V}=I\hat{\sigma}^2$ where $I$ is the identity matrix, since $(X^TVX)^{-1}=(X^TI\hat{\sigma}^2X)^{-1}=\hat{\sigma}^2(X^TIX)^{-1}=\hat{\sigma}^2(X^TX)^{-1}$. So the $\hat{V}$ matrix is there, it's just that you can't see it since it's essentially $\sigma^2$ times the identity matrix. Without the $\hat{V}$, you will not get proper estimates of the variables of each $\hat{\beta}$. A binomial model is used in logistic regression because the outcomes in both a binomial model with $n=1$ is either zero or 1 as is each error term associated with each observation in a logistic regression.
