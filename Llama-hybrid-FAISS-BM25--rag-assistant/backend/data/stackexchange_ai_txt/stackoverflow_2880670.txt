Can I add Boost source+header files to my own (Open Source) project?

Is it allowed by the Boost License to just add the source code of the stuff I need to my project (accompanied by the license of course?). I couldn't find any "descriptive" confirmation. I would have seperate Include/boost and Source/boost directories for easy access. PS: Seeing as boost::filesystem is going into C++0x TR2, and lambda, regex and whatnot are already in c++0x TR1, I don't see any reason to be juggling with C functions like realpath, getcwd and the like. They don't work well anyways... UPDATE: I'm adding the required files "one-by-one" folder by folder, but the amount is gigantic. Maybe it's better to include the full boost dist....
