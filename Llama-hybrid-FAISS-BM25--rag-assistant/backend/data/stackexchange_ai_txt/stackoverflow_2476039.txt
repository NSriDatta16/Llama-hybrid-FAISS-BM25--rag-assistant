how to prevent download popup when we click on jnlp link from browser because that jnlp is already downloaded and available in my local as shorcut

i have an requirement of opening Swing application through jnlp link from browser. once click on jnlp link my application will download and installed in our local system, but again if i go to my browser and click on jnlp link , then also it will ask for download again . so my problem is if any user clicks again it should not ask for download because it was already installed in my local system. please do needful , very urgent regards, Narasimha
