Detecting Bimodal Distribution

I have histograms of audio signals where they have bimodal "normal" distribution. What I want to do is to detect these subpopulations inorder to have a threshold, this is meant to divide the values into background noise and speech, the background noise and speech as each is meant to have its normal distribution. This is a preprocessing step so it can be used to make later decisions based on it. Here is my time series of energy value (in DB) and below its corresponding histogram I am thinking of implementing a K-Means clustering algorithm to detect distributions. Now my question is: Is this the correct solution? Choosing bad initial means is worrying me that the algorithm will fail to cluster correctly. What are other solutions to separate the two distributions, I have looked at GMM, but am not sure how it helps. if K-Means is somehow appropriate for solving such a problem how should I select the initial means, or does it depend mostly on the data ? Note that I am new to this field so I hope to correct me if I made any horrible mistakes
