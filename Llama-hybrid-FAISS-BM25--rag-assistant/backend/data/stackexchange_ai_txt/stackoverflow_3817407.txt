I would do this: In your code behind or ViewModel (if your using MVVM) create a new dependency property called AverageSalary. Then change Salary on the employee to also be a dependency property. In the code behind you can then listen to when the Employee.Salary changes. (see this link for details on that ) And when it changes recompute the average like listed above then assign it to the AverageSalary dependency property you created. Then just bind your UI to the AverageSalary property and it should update as the employee's salaries change.
