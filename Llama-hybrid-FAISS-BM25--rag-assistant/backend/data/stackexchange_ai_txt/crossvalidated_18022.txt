Look at it from a gambling perspective. Let's say we know that on average people who wear workboots to work will have 1.5 injuries on the job, and people wear loafers will have .05 injuries on average. Or, maybe the chances of an injury for a person wearing workboots is .85, and the chances of injury to a person wearing loafers is .1. If I randomly select a person from the population, and tell you the person is wearing workboots, and offer you an even money bet on whether or not they had a workplace injury last year, would you take the bet? Well, you'd take the bet if you were to be able to bet on the side that they had an injury.. 85% of the time you'll win, and you're getting even money. The point is, knowing that piece of information gives us information about whether or not they are likely to experience an injury at work.. The shoes have nothing to do with it, in fact, the workboots prevent injury.. But the confounding variable here is the type of job that goes along with the workboots.. And maybe other things like the person possibly being more reckless.
