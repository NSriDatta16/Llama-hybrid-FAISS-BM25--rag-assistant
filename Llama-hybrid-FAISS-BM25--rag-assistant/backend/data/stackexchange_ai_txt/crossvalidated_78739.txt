Measure of absolute goodness-of-fit and good reference measure for cross validation in ordinal regression

I am following up the question I asked here with a more general one, as the reason why I am seeking to calculate the accuracy of my ordinal regression models is to use it as a measure of absolute goodness of fit as well as a reference measure in order to perform cross validation with my dataset. In addition, I came across this discussion for the specific case of logistic regression, and the answer which seems to indicate that the examination of accuracy and deviance can give contradictory information. 1/ What would be a good reference measure to use for cross validation of an ordinal regression model? (For example with linear regression we would use the MSE but for GLMs it doesnt make sense?) 2/ If different from the above, what would be a good absolute goodness of fit measure - one which would be consistent with the relative goodness-of-fit I can determine by looking at deviance?
