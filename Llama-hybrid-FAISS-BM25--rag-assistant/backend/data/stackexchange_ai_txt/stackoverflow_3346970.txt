Starting with Android: Java or Python (SL4A)

I just ordered an Android smartphone and want to start playing around with creating my own applications. Now the question is which language to use, the native Java or Python using SL4A (former ASE). I tend to Python, as I know it much better than Java, but I'm wondering what I would be missing using a "second class" language on Android. On the SL4A website it is also stated to be alpha quality software, which is not exactly encouraging. I'm also not quite sure what the limitations of the scripting environment are and if they would be problematic.
