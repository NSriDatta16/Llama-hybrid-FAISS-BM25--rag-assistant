Looking for information on a Sentiment Analysis algorithm / tool for .NET

I need to use/purchase some sort of tool for doing Sentiment Analysis to determine positive or negative connotation in text content. There are some terrific threads on this topic which I have read and listed below: Algorithm to determine how positive or negative a statement/text is NLP: Qualitatively "positive" vs "negative" sentence Algorithm to determine how positive or negative a statement/text is (same name different thread) The problem is each one gives a great description of the algorithm, but alludes to the complexity of doing the job from scratch and offers links to the algorithm explanations. I need a .NET (VB.NET or C#) solution either in the form of a toolkit, API, .dll, etc. I have seen links to JAVA solutions but none really in my searches for .NET solutions. My fallback plan is to create dictionaries of words with weights and go that route, but I would prefer something a bit more robust. Does anyone have any information on a Sentiment Analysis solution specifically for .NET? Thanks!
