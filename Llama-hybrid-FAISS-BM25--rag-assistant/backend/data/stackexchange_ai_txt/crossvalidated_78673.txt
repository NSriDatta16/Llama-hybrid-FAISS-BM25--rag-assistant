How to deal with unbalanced group sizes in mixed design analysis?

I have 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design with two between subject factors (sex, organizer) and one within subjects factor (task). The group sizes of the 'sex'-factor is unequal. When I perform a factorial repeated measures ANOVA, I get the following warning message: Warning: Data is unbalanced (unequal N per group). Make sure you specified a well-considered value for the type argument to ezANOVA(). I used the following model in R: model I used type = 3 for the Anova because, as I understood, it is suited for unbalanced group sizes. I have the following questions: Do I need to code contrasts when all my factors have only two levels? Did I use the right type of Anova? Are there other ways to do this analysis?
