One possible model it one of a "rounded" or "censored" variable : let $y_1,\ldots y_{10}$ being your 10 observed values. One could suppose that there is a latent variable $Z$ representing the "real" price, which you do not fully know. However, you can write $Y_i=y_j\Rightarrow{}y_{j-1}\leq{}Z_i\leq{}y_{j+1}$ (with $y_0=-\infty, y_{11}=+\infty$, if you forgive this abuse of notation). If you are willing to risk a statement about the distribution of Z in each of these intervals, a Bayesian regression becomes trivial ; a maximum likelihood estimation needs a bit more work (but not much, as far as I can tell). Analogues of this problem are treated by Gelman & Hill (2007).
