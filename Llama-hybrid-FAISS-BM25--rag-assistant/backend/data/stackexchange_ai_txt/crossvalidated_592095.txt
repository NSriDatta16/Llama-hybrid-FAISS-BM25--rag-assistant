Differece in Difference (pooled cross section) for donation data

I am trying to estimate the effect of a policy that "should" have affected charitable behaviour within the US. To test this, I have data on daily donations for an NGO from all donors (global) from 2017 to end 2020. The policy in particular affected people from the US from march 2020 onwards. So ideally, I envision setting up a regression at the individual level, and have a treatment variable for people in the US after March 2020.I want to include dummies for specific donation appeals (end of year campaigns), as its important I control for that. Maybe I should include a dummy for US to control for difference in donation amounts between U.S donors vs donors of other nationalities. Ideally I add month fixed effects, to control for seasonality of giving, and country fixed effects, to control for differences in donation behaviour at the country level (culture etc). I guess I would like to check two things.. did the policy (treatment) affect the amount donated, and also, did it affect the number of donors, so one could think of this as the intensive or extensive margin, so in one I check average donation amount and in the other a dichotomous variable of donated/not donated ' although I am not sure about this last part, whilst also not being quite sure how to control for the campaigns (I have the data and created a dummies, just not 100% how to include them in the diff and diff model)
