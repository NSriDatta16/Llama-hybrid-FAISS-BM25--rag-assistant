Is the Moving Average of ARMA the same of Moving Average of Stock Market?

I'm studying time series prediction and I have some questions. Is the Moving Averages movel studied the methods of the ARMA family has the same concept as the methods studied in Moving Averages technical analysis stock trading? Is there any place where I can find implementations in .Net or Java of time series forecasting with Auto-Regressive AR(p) , Moving Average MA(q) , ARMA(p, q) and ARIMA (p, d, q) ?
