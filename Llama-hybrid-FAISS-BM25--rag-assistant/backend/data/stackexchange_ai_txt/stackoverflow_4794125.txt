here is a working example in php. This asks for and returns an FX quote. My data request is in the URL yours is in the post-fields though so you need to adjust. It looks as though you have spaces in the data you are passing "x| ME" i suspect it will not like that. $ch = curl_init(); // initialise CURL // set URL and other appropriate options curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $curl_opt_string ); // this contains the URL and the request curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false); // no header curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "93.129.141.79"); // where to send the data back to / outgoing network curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"); // tell it what the agent is curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); // want the data back as a post curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // return as a string rather than to the screen $output = curl_exec($ch); // varu=iable to return it to curl_close($ch); // close cURL resource, and free up system resources $subject = $output; // get the data I constructed my output sting as follows $curl_opt_string = "http://msxml.rexefore.com/index.php?username=MiJoee4r65&password=L8e44Y&instrument=245.20." . $lhsrhs . "LITE&fields=D4,D6";
