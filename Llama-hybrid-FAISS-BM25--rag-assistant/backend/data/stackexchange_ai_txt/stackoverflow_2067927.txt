How to parse a text file?

Basically I need someone to help me or show me the code that will allow me to read a name and a price from a file i have called c1.txt. This is what i already have. TextReader c1 = new StreamReader("c1.txt"); if (cse == "c1") { string compc1; compc1 = c1.ReadLine(); Console.WriteLine(compc1); Console.WriteLine(); compcase = compc1; compcasecost = 89.99; } also how to select a line to read from a text document would be great.
