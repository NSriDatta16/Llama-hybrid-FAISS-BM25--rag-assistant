MLPClassifier and DNNClassifier are both implementations of the simplest feed-forward neural network. So in principle, they are the same. Tensorflow is a deep learning library. scikit-learn is a more traditional machine learning library. scikit-learn have very limited coverage for deep learning, only MLPClassifier and MLPregressor, which are the basic of basics. The devs of scikit-learn focus on a more traditional area of machine learning and made a deliberate choice to not expand too much into the deep learning area. Tensorflow, on the other hand, is dedicated to deep learning. You can compose much very complex deep learning model with it. And GPU support is a big big deal in deep learning, we really need that 1000x speed up to get any meaningful work done in deep learning. You can play with toy data using MLPClassifier but nothing more. That being said, the scikit-learn source code and documentation are so accessible. It is amazing for learning. I highly recommend you work through the MLPClassifier source code if you just started learning deep learning.
