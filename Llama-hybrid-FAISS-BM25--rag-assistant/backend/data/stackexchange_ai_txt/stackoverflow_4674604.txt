Translate custom module admin panel in magento backend

Greetings! I am trying to create a module for a client that can be translated into many languages. I have created CSV files to translate the frontend, but I cannot find a way to translate my options in the configuration page of the backend. I assume it has something to do with my system.xml file but I cannot find a solution. Anyone have any ideas, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance
