How is your table organized? what clustered index you have and what non-clustered indexes you have? And what exactly are the 3 conditions? A DELETE behaves much like a SELECT in that it needs to find the rows that qualify for deletion. To do so, it will use the same techniques a SELECT would, and if your condition_1, condition_2 and condition_3 don't have a covering index, they will trigger a table scan which is going to be timed by the size of data (380M).
