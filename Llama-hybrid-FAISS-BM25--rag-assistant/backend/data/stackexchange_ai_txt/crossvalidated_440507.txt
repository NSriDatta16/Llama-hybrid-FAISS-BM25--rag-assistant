Yes, indeed this is the separation problem that you have in logistic regression. You may find more information in this link . If your motivation to use a GEE is to get coefficients with a marginal interpretation , and you also want to account for the separation problem, then you could use the GLMMadaptive package. With regard to the marginal coefficients have a look here , and with regard to the separation problem GLMMadaptive implements a penalized likelihood approach; an example can be found here .
