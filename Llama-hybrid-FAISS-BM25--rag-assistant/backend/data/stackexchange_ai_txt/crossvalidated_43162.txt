If you don't know anything about t-stats and p-values then you really need the help of a professional statitician on this project, or take some stats courses (what you are asking is beyond the intro courses) until you have enough knowledge to do this. Along the way as you are learning (or discussing with a consultant), least squares regression with bounds on the slopes is just a case of quadradic programming and many stats and math programs have routines for doing quadradic programming. If you want to do this (assuming "this" is well defined) using Bayesian methods then it is pretty straight forward, just choose priors that limit your parameters to the range desired (uniform or beta priors, possibly discrete priors). You may also want to look at model averaging or Bayesian model averaging, these can give answers of the probability of an x variable being a predictor of the y variable. We need to understand the problem better (and you need to understand the statistical modeling better) in order to give more specific advice.
