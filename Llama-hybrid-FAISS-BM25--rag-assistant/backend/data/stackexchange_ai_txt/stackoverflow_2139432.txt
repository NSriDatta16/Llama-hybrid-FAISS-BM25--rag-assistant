Alright, I think I've found the solution, but maybe someone will suggest something better... I made the timer (tested it with 10ms interval), which gets the "Bytes Received/sec" PerformanceCounter value and adds it to a global "temporary" variable and also increments the sum counter (if there is any lag). Then I made second timer with 1s interval, which gets the sum of values (from temporary sum), divides it by the counter and adds to the overall amount (also global). Then it resets the temporary sum and the counter. I'm just not sure if it is right method, because I don't know, how the variables of "Bytes Received/sec" PerformanceCounter are varying during the one second. Maybe I should make some kind of histograph and get the average value? For now, downloading 8.6MB file gave me 9.2MB overall amount - is it possible the other processes would generate that amount of net activity in less than 20 seconds?
