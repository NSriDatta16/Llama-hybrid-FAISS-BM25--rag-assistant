First, your data seems to be count data, so rather than auto arima , you should use e.g. tscount . Second, you have huge gaps of missing data, which makes it unlikely that any time series model will succeed in obtaining some pattern. Third, if you nevertheless want to try it, you should not impute the missing data with 0 but rather with a count near the average. It would of course be helpful to get more information about your data, but without that, I would first try proper imputation, aggregate the imputed data monthly, and then apply a time series model to this monthly time series, probably with seasonality.
