Output of metafor for incidence rates

I need to clarify something and am hoping Wolfgang or someone else with expertise in the metafor R package could help. I want to know what the output of the rma model (with a moderator in is for a meta-analysis of incidence rates) i.e. data_outcomes gets the output: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 21; tau^2 estimator: REML) logLik deviance AIC BIC AICc 40.1901 -80.3802 -74.3802 -71.5469 -72.7802 tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0.0000 (SE = 0.0001) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.0047 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 3.83% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 1.04 R^2 (amount of heterogeneity accounted for): 57.62% Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 19) = 13.0130, p-val = 0.8379 Test of Moderators (coefficient(s) 2): QM(df = 1) = 0.5839, p-val = 0.4448 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub intrcpt 0.1361 0.0055 2.0449 0.0409 0.0005 0.0222 * medicine1_good 0.0947 0.0103 0.7641 0.4448 -0.0124 0.0281 What is the estimate for the moderator/covariate expressed as?
