Median for forecasting in time series

I have a time series about demand of a product with many zeros. I was reading the forecasting book by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos [1] (section 2.3), which mentioned the average method for forecasting time series. I was wondering if is it possible to use a median method for forecasting time series? [1] Hyndman, R.J. and Athanasopoulos, G. (2013) Forecasting: principles and practice. OTexts: Melbourne, Australia. Section 2/3. https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/3 Accessed on August 18 2016.
