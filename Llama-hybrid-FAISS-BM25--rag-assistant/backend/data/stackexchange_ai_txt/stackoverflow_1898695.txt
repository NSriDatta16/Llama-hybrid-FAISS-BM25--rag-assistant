SecurityExceptions using the HTML Helpers in third-party libraries

Can someone explain this paragraph on page 258(Pro ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Chapter 6: Using the HTML Helpers)? If you're writing a third-party library(as opposed to a web application) that uses the HTML helpers, never call the overloads that accept anonymous objects. Always call the overloads that accept dictionaries. Otherwise, web application authors that consume your library are likely to experience SecurityExceptions.
