Determine locations mentioned in shortish (500 to 1000 words) piece of text using PHP

I'd like to find a way to take a piece of user supplied text and determine what addresses on the map are mentioned within the text. I'd be happy to use a free web service if it exists or use a script which will not consume too many resources. One way I can imagine doing this is taking a gigantic database of addressing and searching for each of them individually in the text, but this does not seem efficient. Is there a better algorithm or technique one can suggest? My basic idea is to take the location information and turn it into markers on a Google Map. If it is too difficult or CPU intensive to determine the locations automatically, I could require users to add information in a location field if necessary but I would prefer not to do this as some of the users are going to be quite young students. This needs to be done in PHP as that is the scripting language available on my school hosted server. Note this whole set-up will happen within the context of a Drupal node, and I plan on using a filter to collect the necessary location information from the individual node, so this parsing would only happen once (when the new text enters the database).
