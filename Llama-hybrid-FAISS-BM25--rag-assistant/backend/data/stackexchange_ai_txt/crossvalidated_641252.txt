The usual rule of thumb with logistic regression is that you can include one IV for every 10 cases in the less common case. For you, that's six people, so this rule would say "One IV at most". The problem here is not your method, but the data. You haven't got enough. Overfitting happens when you try to fit models to data like this. From my small amount of research, modified Poisson is a robust method, intended to deal with problems such as clustered data. That's not your issue. Exact logistic may help, but I think only by making your results less significant and your CIs wider. This may not seem like help, but it is, in that, when you have overfitting, your p values are likely to be too small and your CIs too narrow. See King and Ryan (2002) A Preliminary Investigation of Maximum Likelihood Regression vs. Exact Logistic Regression, particularly the section on the ESR data. I am not a Bayesian, but my guess on that is that the results of a regression with so little data ought to have very little effect on your priors (whatever they are).
