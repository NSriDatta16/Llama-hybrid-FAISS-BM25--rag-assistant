The % is a wildcard used in a LIKE clause in a SQL WHERE statement. So if the value of company is 'ABC', LIKE '%ABC%' will match any value that contains 'ABC' either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end; LIKE 'ABC%' will match all values beginning with 'ABC' and LIKE '%ABC' will match all values ending in 'ABC' And you should be escaping your $_POST fields before embedding them in SQL statements
