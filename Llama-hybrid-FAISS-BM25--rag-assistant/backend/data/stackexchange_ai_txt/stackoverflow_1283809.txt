In the case of the SQL Server provider, and if you are using a stored procedure, you can use the SqlCommandBuilder.DeriveParameters method . For other cases, I've always found that the best way, if your commands are at least constant, is to use the Designer support in Visual Studio. Either create a strongly-typed DataSet and add a query, or do it the old fashioned way and drag a SqlConnection and SqlCommand onto a design surface. In either case, when you configure the CommandText to be a statement with parameters, the Designer will ask you if you want the Parameters collection filled in. The result is that it will have generated the code to create a SqlCommand with the parameters collection already created. All you'll need to do is set the parameter values, and you're all set.
