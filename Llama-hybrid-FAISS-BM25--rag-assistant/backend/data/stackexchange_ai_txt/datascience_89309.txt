I want to know where Regression analysis is most used at Regression analysis is used for analyzing the relationship between some independent variables and a dependent variable. In particular it can be used for predicting/forecasting the dependent variable. In Machine Learning a regression task is a supervised task where the target (dependent variable) is numerical (as opposed to classification). It's used in a huge range of applications. what's its competitor methods There's no competitor since it's a whole domain: any method which does the same thing is a regression method so it's part of regression analysis. how least square method relates to regression analysis. Least Squares Regression is a specific method which can be used in regression analysis. Its most common use is with linear regression, which is a specific case of regression for a linear function (it's one of the most simple forms of regression).
