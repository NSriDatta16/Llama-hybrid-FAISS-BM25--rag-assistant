I have upvoted Sycorax's answer as useful. Nevertheless, I think there is a serious issue with the question: sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.score returns the mean accuracy , not AUC-ROC. If we used LR.predict_proba(df_1)[:,1] to get the predicted probabilistic estimates AUC-ROC values both in the training and testing sets would be higher for the "perfect" logistic regresssion model than XGBoost. For example, in the testing set, XGBoost's AUC-ROC is: 0.9071 and the AUC-ROC score from the logistic regression is: 0.9167.
