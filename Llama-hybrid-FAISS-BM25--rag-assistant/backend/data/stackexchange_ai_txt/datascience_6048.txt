Should I use a decision tree or logistic regression for classification?

I am working on a classification problem. I have a dataset containing equal numbers of categorical variables and continuous variables. How do I decide which technique to use, between a decision tree and logistic regression? Is it right to assume that logistic regression will be more suitable for continuous variables and that decision trees will be more suitable for both continuous and categorical variables?
