I'll offer a slightly different perspective. While you can help many needy humans -- e.g. individual refugees, poor people, sick people, war-torn people -- to help humanity it's necessary to address root causes : i.e. why are there so many refugees, persistent poverty, persistent (preventable) illness, and chronic violence. The root causes of so many of these are in the domain of the social sciences. So far, data science has only contributed to root cause analysis when it operates within a solid research program, integrating with other types of research and findings. (This research may or may not take place in an academic environment, or maybe in a mixture of environments.) It also places premium value on domain knowledge on the part of the data scientists involved. A related theme is to empower "change agents" (a.k.a. social entrepreneurs) with data science and related services. Nearly all of them are under-resourced and often face severe or menacing opposition. To do this, you will need to make partnerships with some of them to understand their needs and their world.
