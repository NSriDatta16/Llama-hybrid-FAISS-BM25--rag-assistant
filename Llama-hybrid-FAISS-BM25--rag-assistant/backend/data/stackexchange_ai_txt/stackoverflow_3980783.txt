Unfortunately there is no object model for stuff you render into a canvas. You would need to keep track of everything you've drawn and fire separate events when you detect clicks, mouseup, mousedown, drags. It would mean creating a wrapper for all the context methods, storing the lines/images and their attributes into a COM (Canvas Object Model :) and firing events for each of the lines/images I haven't seen anything out there that does it. This can be a lot of work, I've resorted to writing custom code everytime I need to add interactivity to a Canvas
