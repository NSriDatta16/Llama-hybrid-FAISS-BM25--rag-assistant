I must admit upfront that I don't have production experience of Magento, but I have spent some time poking around their code. The block structure is defined in XML, and so you may not need to actually extend the Cart Controller. The Layout XML files can be found (on a default install) at app/design/frontend/default/default/layout. In here you will find checkout.xml which sets up the block structure for the checkout page.
