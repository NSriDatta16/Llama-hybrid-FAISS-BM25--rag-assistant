First of all, there is a small mistake in the formula. Here, $p=k$ necessarily, in order that you can write the the matrix product $X^{T}\hat{B}$ Then, if you pay attention, in the way you wrote it, $Y$ will indeed be a n-dimensional vector. Having said that, it is true that in general, in the least square regression problem, generally the input does not have the same dimension as the output.
