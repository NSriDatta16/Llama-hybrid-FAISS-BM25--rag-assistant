Parent Child Relationships with Fluent NHibernate?

I would like to create a cascading tree/list of N number of children for a given parent, where a child can also become a parent. Given the following data structure: CountryType=1; ColorType=3; StateType=5 6,7,8 = {Can, US, Mex} 10, 11, 12 = {Red, White, Blue} 20,21,22= {California, Florida, Alberta} TreeID ListTypeID ParentTreeID ListItemID 1 1 Null 6 (Canada is a Country) 2 1 Null 7 (US is a Country) 3 1 Null 8 (Mexico is a Country) 4 3 3 10 (Mexico has Red) 5 3 3 11 (Mexico has White) 6 5 1 22 (Alberta is in Canada) 7 5 7 20 (California is in US) 8 5 7 21 (Florida is in US) 9 3 6 10 (Alberta is Red) 10 3 6 12 (Alberta is Blue) 11 3 2 10 (US is Red) 12 3 2 11 (Us is Blue) How would this be represented in Fluent NHibernate classes? Some direction would be appreciated. Thanks.
