I think this is reasonable. But you introduce a lot of new variables on the table by assuming completely independent variables for hour 1 and hour 2, and march and april, while it is reasonable to expect they are close. To reduce that effect, you can use seasonal / cyclic splines, or, a bit more advanced, gaussian processes. Both terms are googleable. I would start with the cyclic splines. Gaussian processes are what's used for the famous cover of Bayesian Data Analysis . The use of p-values to decide on the influence is questionable. In general, but specifically here as well, because of the loose model specification in the sense above. If, for example, a specific variable is not significant, that says more about the number of observations you have than about the effect size. I advice to use rstanarm or some other bayesian regression package and report and use full posterior densities. Or, if you prefer, at least report point estimates and confidence intervals. It is a bad idea to just remove a coefficient that has plausible large effect sizes, but is hard to estimate, making it "not significant".
