How to calculate performance metrics when my model returns an interval?

I'm doing time series forecasting using Prophet. My forecasting model returns not only a prediction y_hat , but also an uncertainty interval y_hat_lower and y_hat_upper . I wanted to calculate some metrics, like RMSE, MAE, etc. to evaluate the model's performance but don't know how to incorporate the interval in the calculation. Should I be trying to do that? Normally, how do people evaluate these kinds of predictions?
