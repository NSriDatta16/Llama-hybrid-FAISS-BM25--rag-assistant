This code honestly hurts my eyes. Here is how a generic one should look like. You may find it useful. Error Error Unfortunately an unexpected error has occurred. Below you can find the error details. Details Timestamp: Action: Exception: Message: Status code: User agent: The @page isErrorPage is by the way only useful if you want to have the ${exception} (i.e. request.getAttribute("exception") available in the JSP. In this particular case you don't need it. And indeed, do not forward in the catch block at all. Just let it go. It will be dealt by the error page then. } catch (MyException ex) { log.error(ex.getMessage(), uivex); throw ex; // Or throw new ServletException(ex.getMessage(), ex); }
