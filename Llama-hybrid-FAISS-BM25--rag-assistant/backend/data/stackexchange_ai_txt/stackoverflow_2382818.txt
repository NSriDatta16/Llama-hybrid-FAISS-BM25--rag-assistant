I've never used it, but there is a jQuery clipboard plugin that could suit your needs. It sounds like it would copy something to the clipboard, but should work cross-browser. The code would be something like $.clipboard($('#tableContainer').html()); Edit: I just noticed that this solution would require non-IE browsers to have Flash installed, which is inconvenient as best and makes it unusable at worst. The only way I could think to do this without having the browser access the clip board would be to display a hidden textarea control with the results of this call: $('#tableContainer').html() and then allow the user to select all the text and copy it. It would work, but not be as elegant as the plugin solution.
