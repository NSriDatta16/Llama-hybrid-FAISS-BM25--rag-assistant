"Building a Text Editor in 15 Minutes" reference example not working

I am trying to work on NSDocument, so I tried the Building a Text Editor in 15 Minutes example in the Text System Overview reference. I did some changes to code which was suggested, such as used property and synthesize in place of declaring and defining accessor methods. I followed each step written in the reference but could not implement step 5: If it is not already open, double-click MyDocument.xib to open the document window in Interface Builder. From Xcode, drag the MyDocument.h file icon onto the document window of MyDocument.xib. This step informs the MyDocument.xib file that the MyDocument object interface now has an outlet variable named textView. When I compiled, it gave me following warnings in subclass of NSDocument: myDocument may not respond to setString MyDocument window did not appear and this message in console appeared each time I tried to execute it: -[MyDocument string]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x215970 Can anyone suggest me where I may be wrong? I am trying to run it on Snow Leopard... to check the code you can also download it from here .
