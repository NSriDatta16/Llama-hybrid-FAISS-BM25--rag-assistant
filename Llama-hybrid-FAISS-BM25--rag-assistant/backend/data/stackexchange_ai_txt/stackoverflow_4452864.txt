The absolute best way you could improve your code is to stop using stroke and use something that leverages the power of the language you're using. Boost has a tokenizer and other libraries that might actually meet your needs better (like regex). The stroke in stroke isn't the fun kind; it's the kind you get in your brain. Terrible, terrible function that's design dates back to the dark ages of programming. It's got severe and permanent issues that render it not just obsolete, but dangerous...as you are seeing here. Stop trying to build things by tyeing rocks and sticks together. Come into the modern age where we've got forges and robotics. Save your brain!
