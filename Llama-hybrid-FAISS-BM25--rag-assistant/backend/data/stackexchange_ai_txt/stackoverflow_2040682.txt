During Eclipse start-up it loads modules and plugins so it is true. Also using too many plugins will increase the RAM need of the IDE. That may be the cause. There is an Early Startup feature which allows plugins to load once Workbench is started: Description: This extension point is used to register plugins that want to be activated on startup. The class given as the attribute on the startup element must implement the interface org.eclipse.ui.IStartup. Once the workbench is started, the method earlyStartup() will be called from a separate thread. ... Note that this form is deprecated and should no longer be used. Its functioning relies on the availability of the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in and the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.registry fragment. Plugins that provide an extension to this extension point are listed in the workbench preferences and the user may disable any plugin from early startup.
