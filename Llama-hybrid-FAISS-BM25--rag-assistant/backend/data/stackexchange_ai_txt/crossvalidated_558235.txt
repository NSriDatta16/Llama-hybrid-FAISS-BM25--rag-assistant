Statistically significant when there are many different samples

Let's say that I have a hundred medicines on the shelf and I want to check which one is the most effective for a certain disease. There were 10,000 patients. I divided them into 100 random groups and gave each group a different drug. The average outcome of one drug (no matter how we define the outcome, the main point is that it reflects efficacy) is significance level of 1%. Would that indicate anything about the drug, or is it just static noise?
