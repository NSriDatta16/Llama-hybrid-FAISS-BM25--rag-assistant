Just a small comment about a slight difference between CVS ans SVN tags that can cause some problems in migration (at least it caused misunderstanding in my group). In CVS a tag is a sort of temporal snapshot of your development; you normally develop in your HEAD and when you reach a sort of stable situation that you want to save for later reference, you just do a tag. If you checkout a tag version from a CVS repository, it cannot be modified or, to say it better, it can be modified on your local copy, but you cannot commit back the changes. In some way CVS automatically protect its tags from accidental changes The copy in SVN is just, well, a copy of the trunk in another path .. if you checkout your code from a tag path in your repository, you still will be able to change it and commit it back; this is normally something you don't want to do, at least if you consider tags as fixed snapshot of your development that are not supposed to change. This is why it is possible, with a specific hook script, to force a tag directory to be read-only (and in my opinion should be really encouraged). Hope it can be helpful in discussing differences between SVN and CVS (and please apologize for my english).
