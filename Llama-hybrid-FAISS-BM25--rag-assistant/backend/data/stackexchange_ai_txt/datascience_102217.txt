Neural network with variable number of inputs

I have the following problem: I have a set of time-stamped articles and labels for particular instants of time. I want to train a neural network to learn which articles to take in as input (according to the time frame, e.g., only consider articles that came My specific use case is: I have a set of news articles, each represented by a vector. For each of these, I also have a time stamp. The label (i.e., whether the stock price falls or rises) is known to me for certain time instants. Let's say I want to look at t=3,5,8. Then at t=3, I will want to look at articles published before that in a certain time frame of h hours. Instead of me deciding the h, I like the model to be able to learn this value using the three examples I gave it and then use this value to predict labels for some new data (i.e., news articles) I was thinking of creating the most extensive set of inputs and letting the model assign weights to each input in this set. A small or 0 weight would automatically mean that the network is not worried about these inputs. Is there a better way to approach this? Are there any related resources?
