Underlying explanation of Neural-Network basedtime-series future-value prediction

I have confusion related to Feed Forward Neural Network. I train my network for time-series prediction, and it is working great and as expected. I know how NNs train and to predict i.e. there is neuron's weights and biases training that takes place. But I am still unable to fathom the underlying behaviour of the network in time series. For example, given a single data point, how does my network know that it has to predict up or down in the next point? For example, if the input value is (let's say) 10.5 , how does my network knows to predict 10.6 and not 10.4 . How given a single data point, the network is predicting the next point accurately? The following is the summary of my FNN. Please note that I have one input feature and one output value;
