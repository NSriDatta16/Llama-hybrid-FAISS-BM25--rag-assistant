The next step you need to take is to find out how long the different parts of your PHP code are taking to execute. Then narrow down the scope of what you're timing as you find the parts that are taking the most time. Eventually you will reach particular operations, like a MySQL query or an HTTP retrieval, that are taking unusually large or variable amounts of time. Then you know what's actually going on with your script.
