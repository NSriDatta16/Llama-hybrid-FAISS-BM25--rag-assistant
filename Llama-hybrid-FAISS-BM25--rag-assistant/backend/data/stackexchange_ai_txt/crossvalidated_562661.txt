How can sampling methods change the probabilities in imbalanced classification?

I just wondered how sampling methods work in imbalanced cases. So, I used imbalanced dataset(almost, 99:1) and logistic regression for Binary Classification. And the results are as below. Now, I have some questions about that. Why $Pr(Y=1)$ are can be different in the same independent values? As a result, Model(origin) can say "2nd data's class is 1 with 1.5% chance" and Model(using STOMETomek) can say "2nd data's class is 1 with 70% chance". Am I right?
