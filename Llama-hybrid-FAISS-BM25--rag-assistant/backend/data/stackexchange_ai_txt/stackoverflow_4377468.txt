Get LogLevel for current class/bean

I am using the following approach when logging from my class: import org.apache.commons.logging.Log; import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory; ... private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(MyClass.class); ... log.debug("..."); It has come to my attention that all log statements are always executed no matter what loglevel is applied. I do not want to have debug-related statements executed when I do not need it (performance is an issue here). So I am looking for something like this: if (LogLevel == debug) { log.debug("..."); ... } How can I obtain the current LogLevel being used for that class?
