Windows WF 3.5 How to drop activity on Custom Composite Activity in Workflow

I have a custom activity which is a composite of several activities. There are some activities on the composite where I would like users of the custom activity to be able to drop more activities at design time on the Worfkflow surface. Custom Composite activities don't allow drag-drop actions out-of-the box, but I have tried using a custom designer and overridden OnDragDrop etc. and that did not work either. Code samples/snippets in any answers would be most helpful...
