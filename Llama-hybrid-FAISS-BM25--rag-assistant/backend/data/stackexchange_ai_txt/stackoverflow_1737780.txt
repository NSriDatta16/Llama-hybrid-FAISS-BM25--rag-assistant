If you are running your XBAP under partial trust, you are only allowed to write to the IsolatedStorage on the client machine. And it's just 512 KB, which you would probably want to use in a more valuable way (than for logging), like for storing user's preferences. You are not allowed to do any Remoting stuff as well under partial trust, so you can't use log4net RemotingAppender. Finally, under partial trust XBAP you have WebPermission to talk to the server of your app origin only . I would recommend using a WCF service, like described in this article . We use similar configuration in my current project and it works fine. Then, basically, on the WCF server side you can do logging to any place appropriate: file, database, etc. You may also want to keep your log4net logging code and try to use one of the wcf log appenders available on the internets ( this or this ).
