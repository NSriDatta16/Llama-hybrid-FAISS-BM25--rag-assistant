Does Sqlite on the Iphone reorder database rows when I delete a row?

I'm quite new to iphone programming. I would like some information with you. Here is the structure of my database: ID_song : auto-int (primary key) txt_song : text When we do delete some data from a table view, and when the data is deleted from the SQLite database, let's say I have only 3 songs in my database id_song:1 txt_song:Song_A id_song:2 txt_song:Song_B After deleting the rows, does the data in the table looks like: id_song:1 txt_song:Song_A id_song:3 txt_song:Song_C or id_song:1 txt_song:Song_A id_song:2 txt_song:Song_C I mean, does sqlite reorganise the index?
