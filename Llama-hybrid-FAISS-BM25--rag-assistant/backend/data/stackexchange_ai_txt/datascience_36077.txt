predict future sale from past 3 month data

I have the 3-month sale(branch wise) and I want to predict next month sale. There are huge differences between total sale in between months. The simple average of the month's to predict next month sale is not valuable. delta(change sale in the month) between months is important and take into account. Any help, tips, pointers, recommendations, or directions would be extremely helpful and I would be eternally grateful!
