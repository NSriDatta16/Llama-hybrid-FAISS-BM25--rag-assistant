Indexing / random access to 7zip .7z archives

Tools exist to provide random access to gzip and bzip2 archives: gzip zran.c from the ghostscript source code bzip2 seek-bzip by James Taylor I'm looking for any similar solution for 7zip (The goal is to utilize the sometimes gigantic Wikipedia dump files offline without keeping decompressed copies around)
