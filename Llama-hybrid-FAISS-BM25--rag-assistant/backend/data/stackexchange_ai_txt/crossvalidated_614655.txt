entries into machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence for social scientists

As far as CrossValidated allows users to ask for reference, does anyone know (top-notch, authoritative) books , resources, or references about ML, DL, or AI for social scientists? If there are still " The Two Cultures: statistics vs. machine learning? ", perhaps reflected in StackExchange Cross-Valited and Data Science ; where to begin learning the ML culture starting from the perspective of statistics/social science? I am not asking specifically for Resources on Explainable AI but this may be relevant. You may know if you are more familiar with the fields than I.
