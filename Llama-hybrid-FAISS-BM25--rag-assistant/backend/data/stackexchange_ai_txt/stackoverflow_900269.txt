Wheres the bottleneck?

I have two test computers networked together. One has a gigabit Ethernet, the other a 10 megabit. Theoretically, data transferred between the two should reach about 1 megabytes p/s. Now I'm using a PHP script to read data from one host to another using fread. Both reading file and file to be read are chmod 777. Both computers are running wampserver and both have zonealarm and avast installed and running. Zonealarm is configured to recognise both computers as trusted parts of the network. Using the time() function to work out the time it takes for the script to read a file on the other comp. The file im reading is 10 megabytes. It should take just over 10 seconds. Yet it takes around 30 seconds. Average 300kbs. So where is the bottleneck in my setup? One comp is Vista, other is XP if that matters.
