For $x$ under $A$ , calculate the sample mean, $\hat\mu_A$ , as the simple average of the corresponding data points: $\hat\mu_A=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t\in A}x_t$ . Calculate the corresponding standard error $\widehat{s.e.}(\mu_A)$ using some autocorrelation-robust estimator, e.g. Andrews or Newey-West . This is a nonparametric approach, just as you have asked. For $x$ under $B$ , do the same. You now have the necessary ingredients for a two-sample $t$ -test with $H_0\colon \ \mu_A=\mu_B$ against $H_1\colon \ \mu_A\neq\mu_B$ . (I am not sure why you mentioned rank-sum tests which do not seem to address the precise hypothesis -- that of equality of means -- that you have specified.) A good, detailed and very accessible discussion of the general topic can be found in Giles "F-tests Based on the HC or HAC Covariance Matrix Estimators" .
