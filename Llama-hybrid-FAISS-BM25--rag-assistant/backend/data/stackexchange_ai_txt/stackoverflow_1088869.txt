Determine # of pages from Total and PerPage values

What is the most elegant way (in C#) of determining how many pages of data you have given: a.) Total Records b.) Records Per page. Currently what I have is working, but it's using if/else to check if the value is than the total (1 page) or more, and then has to truncate the decimal place, perform a mod operation and add 1 more if there was a trailing decimal. I'm sure there's a Math function that does alot of this for me and isn't so ugly. Thanks.
