None of those interpretations are quite right. I think you have to connect a few concepts first. (Numbering ideas here that don't really relate to your own numbers there). Conditional logistic regression only differs from "ordinary" logistic regression in that the analysis is based on matches sets, so in interpreting the effects you must state what you are controlling for, or the matching in some regard. For instance, if this were a twin's analysis, you would say something like "Smoking was associated with a 2-fold difference in the odds of psychiatric disorder among twins ". The (exponentiated) coefficient for an interaction (or product) term in a logistic regression is not an odds ratio , it is a ratio of odds ratios or an odds ratio ratio (ORR). The point is that you never observe a "difference" or "increase" in the product term without a difference in the lower level terms... so the standard interpretation doesn't apply. In a logistic regression model, the interpretation of an (exponentiated) coefficient term for an interaction (say between X and W) is like the following. "For a unit difference in W, the ratio of odds ratio of Y and X is $\exp(\gamma)$ ".
