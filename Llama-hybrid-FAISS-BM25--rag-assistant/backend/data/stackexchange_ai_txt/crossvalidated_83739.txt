But do Bayesians theoretically acknowledge that there is one true fixed parameter value out in the 'real world?' In my opinion, the answer is yes. There is an unknown value $\theta_0$ of the parameter and the prior distribution describes our knowledge/uncertainty about it. In the Bayesian mathematical modelling, $\theta_0$ is considered as the realization of a random variable following the prior distribution.
