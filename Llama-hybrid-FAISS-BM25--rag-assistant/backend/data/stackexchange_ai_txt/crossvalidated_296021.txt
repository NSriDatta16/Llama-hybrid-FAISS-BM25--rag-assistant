In the paper presenting the missForest package (see Ref below), it is mentioned in the abstract that: "By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme." ...followed by:"Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set." If I understand this right, the OOBerror represent the error accross multiple imputations (so it would include the error of imputed vs observed for individual trees AND the error across different trees ?). Still, I am not an expert and I think that previous answers for your questions provide a safe way to address your question (by using multiple missForest runs). Depending on the exact meaning of what the authors said in the abstract, I think you should obtain, accross your multiple missForest runs, an error close to the OOBerror of a single run ?
