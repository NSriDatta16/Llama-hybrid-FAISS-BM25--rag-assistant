That means, 1 out of 5 hits should be critical. The problem is I got very bad real life results - sometimes players get 3 crits in 5 hits, sometimes none in 15 hits. What you need is a shuffle bag . It solves the problem of true random being too random for games. The algorithm is about like this: You put 1 critical and 4 non-critical hits in a bag. Then you randomize their order in the bag and pick them out one at a time. When the bag is empty, you fill it again with the same values and randomize it. That way you will get in average 1 critical hit per 5 hits, and at most 2 critical and 8 non-critical hits in a row. Increase the number of items in the bag for more randomness. Here is an example of an implementation (in Java) and its test cases that I wrote some time ago.
