How is the CountPerTimeInterval32 performance counter type used to measure the average rate of events per minute?

I need to measure the rate an application event which is occuring with a frequence bellow once per sec. Can this be achieved using the CountPerTimeInterval32 counter type and if so how? If not, what is the best type of performance counter to use to measure infrequently occuring events?
