Is it ok not to have a button for a search box?

I was wondering if it was ever ok not to have a submit button (Ok, Go or Search for example) near a search box in Web pages. I know that hitting enter is much faster and that it will perform the search. However, is it an accepted convention for the average non tech savvy user or only for the tech community? For example, the search box here at stackoverflow doesn't have a submit button, but I don't think anyone is complaining (and I sure don't). On the other hand, someone suggested using Google as an example: would people notice if the buttons were removed? I just started reading Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug and he mentions that every search box should have something that tells me I can click on it to launch the search. Your thoughts?
