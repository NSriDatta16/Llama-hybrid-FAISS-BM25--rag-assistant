Effecient way to decompose multiple time series in a data frame and compare the fit of additive and multiplicative models?

I have a data frame in R that contains time series data of 7 variables that were taken on several hundred different individuals. I want to know if it would be more appropriate to use an additive model or a multiplicative model for each variable. To give an example, the data is structured something like this: set.seed(123) ID = factor(letters[seq(15)]) Time = c(1000,1200,1234,980,1300,1020,1180,1908,1303, 1045,1373,1111,1097,1167,1423) df What is an effective way to decompose the data for each variable/ID combination, fit each with an additive model and a multiplicative model, and compare the fits?
