Making human readable representations of an Integer

Here's a coding problem for those that like this kind of thing. Let's see your implementations (in your language of choice, of course) of a function which returns a human readable String representation of a specified Integer. For example: humanReadable(1) returns "one". humanReadable(53) returns "fifty-three". humanReadable(723603) returns "seven hundred and twenty-three thousand, six hundred and three". humanReadable(1456376562) returns "one billion, four hundred and fifty-six million, three hundred and seventy-six thousand, five hundred and sixty-two". Bonus points for particularly clever/elegant solutions! It might seem like a pointless exercise, but there are number of real world applications for this kind of algorithm (although supporting numbers as high as a billion may be overkill :-)
