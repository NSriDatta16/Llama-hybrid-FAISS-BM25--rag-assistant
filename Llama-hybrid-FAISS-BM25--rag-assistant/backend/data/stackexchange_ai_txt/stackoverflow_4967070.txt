The latest 5th edition of the OpenGL SuperBible does focus only on the core profile. Unfortunately it includes it's own gltools library so most of the start of the book is really more teaching that toolkit rather than the core profile itself, of course it covers the basic overall layout of a modern opengl program and does seem to fill in the harder stuff later. As you progress though it seems you reimplement the crutch library. The OpenGL Programming Guide (The Red Book) 7th edition, unfortunately seems to be rather dated. They have marked everything that is in the compatibility profile rather than the core, but thats about it. There is an 8th edition being released in December 2012 that is apparently a rewrite teaching modern approaches. Realistically it would be best to learn the specific areas on the compatibility profile/OpenGL 2.1 then combine them all together into something that is core profile. Doing it all at once is just too much at once. First learn Vertex Buffer Objects (and ditch glBegin/glEnd and anything that goes in between). Learn manual Matrix operations and stack, or an appropriate library (ditch glPushMatrix/glTranslate/glRotate/glOrthagonal/gluLookAt/glFrustum, you may need to use some compatibility stuff to bind your manually processed marices at this stage but you can ditch them with the shader next step) Learn Vertex & Fragment shaders Learn how to set the OpenGL context to 3.1+ (Dependant on your windowing system).
