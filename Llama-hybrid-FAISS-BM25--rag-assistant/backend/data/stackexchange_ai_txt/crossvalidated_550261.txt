Categorizing an ordinal or continuous variable will lead to an invalid uninterpretable analysis that is also inefficient---a triple loss. If time is irrelevant, i.e., if the event you are studying is assessed over a very short time period, then use binary logistic regression to predict it from the quantitative variable, expanding the quantitative variable so as to not assume linearity in its effect on the log odds. To do this consider a quadratic polynomial or a regression spline. The choice will depend on subject matter knowledge and knowledge of the distribution of the potential predictor variable.
