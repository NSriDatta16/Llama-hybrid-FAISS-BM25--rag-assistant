You can pass dimensions to window.open() for this: Edited for updated question : notice the [rel|= changed to [rel= . $(document).ready(function() { $('a[rel|=external]').click(function(){ window.open(this.href); return false; }); $('a[rel=external-new-window]').click(function(){ window.open(this.href, "myWindowName", "width=800, height=600"); return false; }); });â€‹ You can test it here , the dimensions being different from the tab is the key here. Keep this in mind though, it may still open in a tab , there are plenty of browser options, extensions and plugins specifically to prevent popup windows. Also, from the user point of view, too many popup windows will encourage me to hunt you down and stab you in the eye with a salad fork and/or pop-up a window and throw you out of it, so please use this sparingly.
