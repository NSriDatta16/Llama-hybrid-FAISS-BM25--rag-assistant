Sample size for designing a study which creates a classifier

I have to plan a study in which I will have to create a classifier. The output variable is a binary with an estimated proportion of value 1 in the overall population of interest to be 0.10 (and then the proportion of value 0 is 0.90). So its an unbalanced sample. I will have less than 40 features to add in the classifier and I will try several algorithms as SVM, Random Forest, CART, logistic regression, adaboost,... How can I calculate the smaller number of observations needed to maximize my classifier performance?
