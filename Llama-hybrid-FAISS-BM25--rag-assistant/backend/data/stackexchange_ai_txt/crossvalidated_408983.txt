I will work with an example using the Verbal Aggression dataset, largely borrowing off this paper: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v039i12 library(lme4) VA.dat I prepare the data to regress the binary response on gender and permit the gender effect to be different by person: VA.dat $M Gender == "M") + 0 VA.dat $F Gender == "F") + 0 VA.dat $rbin r2 == "Y") + 0 Look at data frame to confirm gender is person level: table(aggregate(M ~ id, VA.dat, mean)$M) # # 0 1 # 243 73 The mean of the male indicator by person is either 1 or 0, so gender values are constant within id . Regression: summary(fit I have an intercept representing Male and the Fem difference from it. Note the use of the || before id in the random effect specification. It stops the gender slopes from being correlated and forces a simpler interpretation of the random slopes. With a | , each id would have a value on both male and female slopes, which can be confusing to deal with. On average, male responses are higher than female responses. However, the random intercept variance of female respondents is slightly larger than the random intercept variance of male respondents. To look at the random slopes: head(ranef(fit)$id) # M F # 1 -0.1153768 0.000000000 # 2 -0.3926609 0.000000000 # 3 0.0000000 -0.041122748 # 4 0.0000000 0.101123911 # 5 0.0000000 -0.041122748 # 6 0.0000000 -0.005561083 The first two persons are male and the gender effects for them are more negative than the overall gender effect, $0.514 - 0.115; 0.514 - 0.393$ . The next four persons are female, and the gender effect for the first two are: $0.514 - 0.049 - 0.041; 0.514 - 0.049 + 0.101$ . So clearly, one does not need variability within the grouping factor to permit the effect of a variable to vary across persons. The reason for the confusion is older model formulations which separate the data in level 1 dataset and level 2 datasets. With lme4, and more recent model formulations, there is no need for such formulation. Douglas Bates covers details here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/Theory.pdf
