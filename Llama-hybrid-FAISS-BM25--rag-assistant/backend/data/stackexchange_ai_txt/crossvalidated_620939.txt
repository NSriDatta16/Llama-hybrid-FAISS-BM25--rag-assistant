Odds Ratio or 2 Prop Z Test

We would like to conduct an AB Test between 2 groups of people and the apps that people have to see which ones over or underindex. Which is more appropriate odds ratio or 2 proportional z test and why? However my concern with the odds ratio is that it would be alot harder to explain odds to a stakeholder than it would be for regular probability.
