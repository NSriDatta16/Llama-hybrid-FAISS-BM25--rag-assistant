Using Mechanize with Google Docs

I'm trying to use Mechanize login to Google Docs so that I can scrape something (not possible from the API) but I keep seem to keep getting a 404 when trying to follow the meta redirect: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' USERNAME = "..." PASSWORD = "..." LOGIN_URL = "https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?hl=en&continue=http://docs.google.com/" agent = Mechanize.new login_page = agent.get(LOGIN_URL) login_form = login_page.forms.first login_form.Email = USERNAME login_form.Passwd = PASSWORD login_response_page = agent.submit(login_form) redirect = login_response_page.meta[0].uri.to_s puts "redirect: #{redirect}" followed_page = agent.get(redirect) # throws a HTTPNotFound exception pp followed_page Can anyone see why this isn't working?
