Since this question was asked, I've updated the official py2exe tutorial to include substantially more information about bundling the Microsoft C runtime DLL. http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step5 If anyone reading this question knows about things which they think are missing from the official tutorial, can I encourage them to add that knowledge to the official tutorial, which is a wiki.
