All you need to do is add another variable called an interaction term, which is the product between union and black, called, e.g. union*black , and if its regression coefficient value is positive and it's significant (p-value $\beta_0 + \beta_{black} + \beta_{union*black}$ , whereas the average loq(wage) for non-union blacks will simply be $\beta_0 + \beta_{black}$ .
