PCA computes the eigenvectors of the Covaraince matrix. The Covariance matrix uses an implicit centering of data. So it does not really matter whether you center your training data or not. The resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues will be the same. This means you don't really have to center your test data. The projections that you obtain would only be in a different(tranlated by the mean) co-ordinate system if you center the test data.
