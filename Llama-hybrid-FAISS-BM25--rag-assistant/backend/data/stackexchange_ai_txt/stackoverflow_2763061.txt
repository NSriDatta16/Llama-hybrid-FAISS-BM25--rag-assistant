I guess it indicates that nested type can be confused with static variable because they both will appear in intellisense (auto complete) after the ".". Even if you see BCL (Base Class Library) of .NET, all the enums, even if they are only used in one class, they are not nested, reason is, when you want to compare or instantiate, the class names + "." + enum names will be confusing as shown below, also Microsoft is right that it will confuse people. -- Example class RootClass { enum NestedEnum { StaticItem = 0 } static string NestedString = ""; } RootClass.NestedEnum One is a type and other is variable, most MS Code Analyzer warnings are for better design, however it has an big exception for @George, if you dont like it, dont use it, just go ahead and disable the warnings. You can certainly use big class names instead of namespaces, its simply your choice. But good programming skills is about how others percieve your code rather then what you like !!! And namespaces are there to organize and by organizing we type less, thats what all about doing more work with less efforts. But if you like big names to type, no one is stopping you.
