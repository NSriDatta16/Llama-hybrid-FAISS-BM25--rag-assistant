Another dumber theory: well, of course throughput increases as load increases, at least until you hit capacity. If you can handle 100 queries per second on average, and you send 10 per second on average, throughput 10 queries per second. If you increase load to 100qps on average, throughput is (nearly) 100qps. It gets worse after that of course. Are you not near capacity? Sorry if this is something you've surely ruled out.
