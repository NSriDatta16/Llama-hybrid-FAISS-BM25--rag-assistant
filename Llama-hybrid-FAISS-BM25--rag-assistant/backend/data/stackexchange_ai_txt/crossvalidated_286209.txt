Logistic regression: change in the ratio by a percentage

In this article in the section of "Logistic regression with multiple predictor variables and no interaction terms" is stated: This fitted model says that, holding math and reading at a fixed value, the odds of getting into an honors class for females (female = 1)over the odds of getting into an honors class for males (female = 0) is exp(.979948) = 2.66. In terms of percent change, we can say that the odds for females are 166% higher than the odds for males. How was the value of 166% calculated? It seems that the author just subtracted 1 from 2.66 and multiplied by 100% but according to which formula?
