Weight and height are also continuous, even if in practice they can only be measured as units of grams (g) or millimeters (mm). It's more related to the nature of the variable, not as much to the particular data. In my opinion, data storage could be understood as continuous (two files are quite unlikely to have the same size, and bits or bytes are quite small). For comparison, I would treat the number of files in folders as discrete.
