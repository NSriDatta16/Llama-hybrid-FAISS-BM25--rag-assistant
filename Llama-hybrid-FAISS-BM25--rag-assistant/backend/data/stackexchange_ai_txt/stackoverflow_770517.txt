Representing application navigation

I have a complex application with many pages. Each page can have many possible routes to other pages: 'A' can go to 'B' or 'C', 'B' can go to 'A' but not 'C'. etc. Rather than embed this "where to go to next" logic in each page (horror!) I of course want to encapsulate it in a main point of control. 'A' doesn't need to know about 'B' or 'C'. Even better, I'd like to reduce the problem to a matter of configuration. This isn't a language/framework specific question -- it's a matter of how best (simple, pragmatic) to represent and interpret Workflow logic. Has anyone had experience representing a complex flow between points in an application as a configurable setting?
