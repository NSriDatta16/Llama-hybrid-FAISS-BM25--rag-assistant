Intuitition behind Average Absolute Odds fairness

While reading a FairML paper, I saw that they use Average Absolute Odds, whose math definition will be: $\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP + TN}} $ $\text{Average Absolute Odds} = |TPR_j - FPR_j| + |TPR_i - FPR_i|$ Where $j$ and $i$ are the protected group and the reference group. What will be the social intuition behind this metricc? Why is this metric relevant for FairML?
