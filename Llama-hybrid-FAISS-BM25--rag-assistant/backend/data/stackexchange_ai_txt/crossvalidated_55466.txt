Ordinal logistic regression with age at death as the response and exercise regime as the predictor would save you having to code the age-ranges as a continuous variable - probably not a good idea with only five categories. Plotting Kaplan-Meier survival curves & carrying out the log-rank test (an instance of survival analysis) would allow you to account for people who dropped out of the study (there must surely be some if you recruited them at 30 years old) or who are still alive.
