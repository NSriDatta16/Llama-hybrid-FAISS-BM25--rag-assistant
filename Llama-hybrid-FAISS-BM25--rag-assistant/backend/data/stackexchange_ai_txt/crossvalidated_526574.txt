It's not clear to me what model do you use, like linear model or other ML model. If you use Linear model check the fitted values vs residuals and check about a trend in the plot. The data should be homoscedastic if the model works well. Check the qq plot to qualify the normality assumption. A good plot has a straight line. Check also the leverage and cook's distance for outliers. In order to improve better your model you could use box cox transformation. Other model that can be used is generalised linear models (GLM) or generally a Machine Learning task, like Deep Learning.
