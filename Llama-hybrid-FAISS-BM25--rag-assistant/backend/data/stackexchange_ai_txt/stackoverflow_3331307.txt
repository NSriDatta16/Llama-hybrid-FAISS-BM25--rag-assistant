This has come up at work many times and I ended up creating some styling for a 2-column table which hides borders. Technically , this is tabular data, but a table with only 2 rows and 2 columns is pretty lame considering the amount of markup needed to achieve it within spec. I've often regretted creating the class, as now everyone uses it far too much and I have to constantly be on the lookout for it in our code reviews. If you don't anticipate that problem, it's a semantically-correct solution, and slightly more elegant than the hoops you'll jump through with DL's, spans, etc.
