Neural Network not learning

I am trying to build a simple feedfoward neural network with three layers for an autonomous car control. The network takes image frame inputs from a live video stream, and gives steering value as output ranging from 0 to 1000. The inner layer has 38400 units and output layer 1000 units. My training dataset is 2592 large and the problem I am having is finding the right number of neurons in the hidden layer. I have followed some rules of thumb that I found online , like The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be between the input and output layer The training dataset should be at least twice as large as the number of neurons in the hidden layer. That gave me a boundary of 1000 and 1296 neurons. I’ve tried different architectures of networks within this range but the best accuracy I’ve got is not more than 2%, with a single epoch. I don’t know what’s going wrong. What should I do ? I will appreciate any help I get.
