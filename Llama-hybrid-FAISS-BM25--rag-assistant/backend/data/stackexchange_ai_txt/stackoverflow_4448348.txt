OpenMP debug newbie questions

I am starting to learn OpenMP, running examples (with gcc 4.3) from https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/exercise.html in a cluster. All the examples work fine, but I have some questions: How do I know in which nodes (or cores of each node) have the different threads been "run"? Case of nodes, what is the average transfer time in microsecs or nanosecs for sending the info and getting it back? What are the best tools for debugging OpenMP programs? Best advices for speeding up real programs?
