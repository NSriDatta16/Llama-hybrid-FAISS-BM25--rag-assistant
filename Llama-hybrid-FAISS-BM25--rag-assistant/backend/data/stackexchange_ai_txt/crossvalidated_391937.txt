If you have two predictors in a regression model and want to test whether or not they have equivalent effects, i.e. that $\beta_1 = \beta_2$ in $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \varepsilon$$ Then form a new predictor, $Z = X_1 + X_2$ , and compare the model with $X_1, X_2$ as predictors to the one using only $Z$ . If the larger model is not significantly better you don't have evidence that the coefficients are different. I described this in terms of continuous predictors, and for linear regression, but you can imagine an analogous approach for categorical variables and for GLMs like logistic regression.
