How do I include new features that did not exist before into an existing model?

I have a binary classification model predicting sports result with features covering 10 years worth of matches. However, how would I feed new tracking data that is only limited to the last 3 years. Would I assign a NaN or zero value for matches that do not have this data? Will it likely create overfitting problems? I'm only using XGBoost now.
