Write logistic model as log(p/(1-p))= g(x1,x2,...) where g(.) is liner function of Xs' coefficients and p is the sigmoid function. The difference of coefficients between machine learning (ML) and statistics are the calculation process. ML use gradient based approach and statistics use mathematical equation solving methods. They have different properties such that different result. For multicollinearity, ML focus on precisely prediction rather than the estimation of coefficient, there is rare discussion for multicollinearity in this fild. And multicollinearity is an important issue in statistics field, not only logistic regression but also many statistical model have many discussion for multicollinearity detection, so statistics approach can conclude more reasonable coefficient by its theoretical properties rather than ML approach. As my experience, if you need meaningful coefficients to represent some importance or effect, please choose statistical version because there are some good properties to support. If you need more precise prediction, you can choose many classification model rather than ML logistical model unless you really need know the relative importance between x's using coefficient when you encounter big data.
