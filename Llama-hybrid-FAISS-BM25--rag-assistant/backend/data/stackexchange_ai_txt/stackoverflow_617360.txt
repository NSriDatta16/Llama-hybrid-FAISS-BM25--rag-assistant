Export Orders from Magento for shipment

I am working on an online store on the Magento platform and have hit a major roadblock: For some reason I cannot figure out how to export current orders (with shipping information/shipment type/etc). Does anyone have any suggestions? This seems as if it should be one of the most basic things for a system like this to do, but I have not been able to find out how.
