Both packages, alabama and Rsolnp, contain "[i]mplementations of the augmented lagrange multiplier method for general nonlinear optimization" --- as the optimization task view says --- and are quite reliable and robust. The can handle equality and inequality constraints defined as (nonlinear) functions again. I have worked with both packages. Sometimes, constraints are a bit easier to formulate with Rsolnp, whereas alabama appears to be a bit faster at times. There is also the package Rdonlp2 that relies on an external and in the optimization community well-known software library. Unfortunately, its license status is a bit uncertain at the moment.
