In general, a sort algorithm is "deterministic" if it consistently sorts the elements in the exact same order every time. Given a set of records to sort on id (asc): 1 Censu 11 Marju 4 Cikku 11 Lonzu then a sorting algorithm could return both Censu, Cikk, Marju, Lonzu, or Censu, Cikku, Lonzu, Marju, as correct sortings. A deterministic sort is one which always returns the same ordering. This needn't always be the case. In the case of quicksort, one can get faster average performance if pivots are chosen randomly (ideally you would choose the median, but this can be costly). However, this comes at a cost: your search is no longer deterministic.
