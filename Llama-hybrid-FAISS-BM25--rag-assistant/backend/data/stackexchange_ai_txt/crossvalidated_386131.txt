There's good research showing that a strong predictor of whether borrowers will repay their loans is whether they use felt to protect their floors from being scratched by furniture legs. This "felt" variable will be a distinct aid to a predictive model where the outcome is repay vs. default. However, if lenders want to gain greater leverage over this outcome, they will be remiss in thinking they can do so by distributing felt as widely as they can. "How likely is this borrower to repay?" is a prediction problem; "How can I influence the result?" is a causal inference problem.
