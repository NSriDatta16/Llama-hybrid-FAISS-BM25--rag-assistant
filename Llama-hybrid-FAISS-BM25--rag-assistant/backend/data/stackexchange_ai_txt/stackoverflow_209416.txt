In a WPF ListView how can I prevent auto scrolling?

I have a WPF ListView which currently scrolls everytime I click on an item which is only partially visible. How can I keep the control from scrolling that item into view (instead simply selecting the partially visible one)? This behavior is very annoying when doing a drag from this control. Thanks. Added: I am looking for a solution to keep the control itself from scrolling when contents are clicked that the control believes are not fully visible. Often this is by a few pixels and the scroll is not necessary.
