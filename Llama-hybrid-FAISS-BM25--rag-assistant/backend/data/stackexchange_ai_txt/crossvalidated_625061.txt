Do all nodes have to be stored / indexed in a GNN?

Apologies in advance for what maybe a really silly question :( I am trying to construct a Graph Neural Network, in which I would like to learn representations for certain nodes, but not others. To be concrete I have a dataset of URLs which contain the title of the page, and the domain on which that URL title appeared so simply my dataset is a tuple (title, domain) and I would like learn node embeddings for all of my domains . Now I understand that this could be done without a graph, but the above is just the first step of a larger model. So the issue I am trying to work through is how do I avoid creating an explicit node in my graph for each title feature. In a normal model I would say build an embedding for each character or word in my title feature - which means I do not need to index each individual title.
