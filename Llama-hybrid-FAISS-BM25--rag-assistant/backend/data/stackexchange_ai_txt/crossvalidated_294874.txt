The short answer is that what I am trying to do is inherently non-linear and poorly handled by much of the tools for bayesian state-space models. That said there is some interesting work on multi-regression models but it seems to have been largely abandoned. This type of model can be handled quite easily (for dimensional problems) using MCMC though.
