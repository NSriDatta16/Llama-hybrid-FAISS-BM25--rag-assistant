Why does a time series have to be stationary?

Would like to understand primary reasons for making a data stationary? I understand that a stationary time series is one whose mean and variance is constant over time. Can someone please explain why we have to make sure our data set is stationary before we can run different ARIMA or ARMA models on it? Does this also apply to normal regression models where autocorrelation and/or time is not a factor?
