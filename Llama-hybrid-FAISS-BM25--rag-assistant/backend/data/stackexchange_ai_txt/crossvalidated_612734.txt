Clarification on variable importance (i.e., impurity mode) for Ranger random forest regression model

Ranger documentation states that if the importance mode is set to 'Impurity', then the estimated measure is '...the variance of the responses for regression..." Could someone expand on this or provide a relevant publication? As a starting point for an answer, I'm assuming it is something like the the sum of all the differences in response variance between nodes pre/post split where the feature of interest is used...maybe normalized by the number of trees?
