One way to think about logistic regression is as a threshold response model. In these models, you have a binary dependent variable, $Y$, which is influenced by the values of a vector of independent variables $X$. The dependent variable $Y$ can only take on the values 0 and 1, so you can't model the dependence of $Y$ on $X$ with a typical linear regression equation like $Y_i=X_i\beta+\epsilon_i$. But we really, really like linear equations. Or, at least, I do. To model this situation, we introduce an unobservable, latent variable $Y^*$, and we say that $Y$ goes from equaling 0 to equaling 1 when $Y^*$ crosses a threshold: \begin{align} Y^*_i &= X_i \beta + \epsilon_i\\ &\\ Y_i &= 0 \;\textrm{if}\; Y_i^* 0 \end{align} As I have written it, the threshold is at 0. This is an illusion, however. Generally, the model includes an intercept (i.e. one of the columns of $X$ is a column of 1s). This allows the threshold to be anything. To motivate this model, think of killing bugs with a nerve-toxin pesticide. $Y^*$ is how many nerve cells are killed, and $X$ includes the dose of pesticide delivered to some bug. $Y$ is then 1 if the insect dies and 0 if it lives. That is, if enough nerve cells are killed (and $Y^*$ crosses the threshold), then the bug dies. This is not actually how neurotoxic pesticide work, by the way, but it's fun to pretend. So, you get a linear regression equation you can't see and a binary outcome you can see. The parameters, $\beta$ are usually estimated via maximum likelihood. If $\epsilon$ is distributed with symmetric distribution function $F$, then $P\{Y_i=1\}=F(X_i\beta)$. Just as you say, you can use any symmetric distribution function you want. Actually, you can use an asymmetric distribution function if you like, it just makes the algebra a tiny bit harder, as $P\{Y_i=1\}=1-F(-X_i\beta)$. Now, the distribution function you pick for $\epsilon$ affects your estimation results. The two most common choices for $F$ are normal (yielding the probit model) and logistic (yielding the logit model). These two distributions are so similar that there are rarely important differences in the results between them. Since logit has a very convenient closed form for both cdf and density functions, it's usually easier to use it rather than probit. Again, just as you say, you could pick any distribution function for $F$ and which one you pick will affect your results.
