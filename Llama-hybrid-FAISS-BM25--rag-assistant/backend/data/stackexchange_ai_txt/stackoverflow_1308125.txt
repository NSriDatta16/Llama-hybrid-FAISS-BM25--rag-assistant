Not receiving Drag events on an adorned element

I'm creating a drag and drop behavior, and the goal is to drag an item onto my grid, where a set of adorned elements representing the available actions will be available for the user to drop the element on. My problem is once I add the adorned element(s) to the AdornerLayer, I don't receive any Drag events. I need to get those events to both change UI and set some underlying properties. I've set AllowDrop=true on the AdornerLayer, the adorned element, my button inside the DataTemplate inside the ContentPresenter, and on the ContentPresenter itself, but still don't get any events.
