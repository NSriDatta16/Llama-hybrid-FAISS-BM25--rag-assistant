The decision to either include or use a function is not always a simple one. In general: if you reuse code in a lot of places you should probably make it a function. Among other reasons a function has it's own variable scope which makes programming neater and more reliable. If your code occurs only once, is seldom used or when the code to be loaded is not always the same code then including it may be better. In neither case is the speed of loading an issue. The time difference is in 99.99% of all cases insignificant. The decision whether to use a function or an include should be made on the basis of code organization : what is easier to understand for someone maintaining the code. In practice you akways use a function or an object to organize your code, unless there is a very compelling reason not to.
