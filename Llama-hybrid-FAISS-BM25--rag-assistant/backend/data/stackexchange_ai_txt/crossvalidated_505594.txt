How to analyze rating data? Independent variable: two groups. Dependent variable: *strongly disagree* to *strongly agree*

I have two independent groups of people. They were asked to select one out of five answers from a question. The five options are strongly disagree , disagree , neutral , agree and strongly agree . I wanted to know if the their opinions for this question is different or not. What I have done is numerate then as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Then I used student t-test to test if their average scores are significantly different. Is this OK to use Student's t-test? I understand that the data is not normal. I did it for the simplicity of interpretation. Which would be a better model than Student's t-test? --- Update --- Is a Multinomial model good here?
