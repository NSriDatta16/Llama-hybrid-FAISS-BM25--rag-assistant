What you can do is store what is visited and at what date(timestamp) and you would do this for each and every time the something is visited. When you want to retrieve what was visitied, you would chose the ones within a range of dates(timestamp) and add them together. OR Each of your links will have their own respective row for every day they are visited. If they are visited more than once in one day then it will add +1 to the already existing value. You could use the second example and do weekly storage instead of daily if your weeks are something like sunday-saturday and not 7 days before today. So replace the words day with the word week thus having smaller amounts of data storage. I see that you want to avoid huge data stores but to the extent that you want this to work I don't see much better than this.You could use the second example and do weekly storage instead of daily if your weeks are something like sunday-saturday and not 7 days before today. Here is a possibility for regis server after looking at some documentation. SET link_id|date => "visit_count" This stores the link_id or whatever you call it along with the date seperated by | or what ever character you want to use. In that key-value you store the visit_count . Say that you want to add a hit to that link on this date. You would GET link_id|date and then add +1 to the visit_count it returns and then store it back the way I shown above. If you want to get the amount of hits for a specific date then you may with the GET link_id|date again. You would just use ruby-on-rails to replace link_id , date and visit_count with the appropriate values. Hope this helps you out.
