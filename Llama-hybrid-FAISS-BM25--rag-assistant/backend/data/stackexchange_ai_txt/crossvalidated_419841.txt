My two cents: I would frame this as a classification problem where target label is 'died/survived'. Features are demographics, physical and transportation method. Assuming I have enough good data, and that indeed data explains survival chances. I would go and ask the 'what if' transportation feature had this value or another. (Technically by getting fitted classifier prediction for each possible transportation feature value). I would also prefer predict probability classification algorithm(Logistic regression for example). This will help me make better decisions on which transportation method is better(by looking at the uplift in predicted survival probability).
