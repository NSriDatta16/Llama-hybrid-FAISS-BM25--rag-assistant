How to create a dynamic menu in Symfony

While I do find that the PHP Symfony framework is wonderful for many things, I am finding it difficult to create easily scalable dynamic menus for a website. I am wondering how other Symfony developers out there have dealt with this issue. I will give a simple example as to what I am asking. If go to www.fool.com you will see that they have a typical menu setup. A list of categories with one of them being the active one that is in some way highlighted with CSS. What would be a good way to make this dynamically created in a Symfony project. Passing variables of some sort from module to module. I have not yet found an elegant solution.
