How to find initial feasible point for the dual problem of SVMs (Support Vector Machines)?

Problem Is there a systematic way of finding an initial feasible point for the dual problem of an SVM? Context I'm writing an implementation of Support Vector Machines for Binary Classification in R. I've coded everything I need for an SVM, I have the objective function as a function of a vector $\lambda$ which outputs $$ \frac{\widetilde{\lambda}^\top K \widetilde{\lambda}}{4} - \langle \lambda, 1\rangle $$ where $\widetilde{\lambda}:= (y_1\lambda_1, \ldots, y_n \lambda_n)^\top$ is the element-wise multiplication between the vector of labels $y=(y_1, \ldots, y_n)^\top$ and the input vector $\lambda$ . I've also taken the constraints $$ \sum_{i=1}^n y_i\lambda_i = 0\qquad \text{and}\qquad 0\leq \lambda_i\leq 1 $$ and re-written them into the form $$ U\lambda -c\geq 0 $$ where $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots &\ddots\\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\ -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots &\ddots &\vdots\\ 0 & 0 & \cdots& -1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & \cdots & y_n \\ -y_1 & -y_2 & \cdots & -y_n \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1 \\ \lambda_2 \\ \vdots\\ \lambda_n \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \geq 0 $$ So that I can finally use the function constrOptim() by providing constrains and objective function. The only thing left is to find an initial feasible point. I tried a vector of all zeros, a vector of all ones. Then I created a function sampling random numbers from random intervals in order to generate random points, which I then test for feasibility. Yet, this function never terminates. Is there a simple way to find one? Maybe from the primal?
