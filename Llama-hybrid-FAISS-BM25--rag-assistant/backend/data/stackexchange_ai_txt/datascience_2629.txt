What is "data science"?

In recent years, the term "data" seems to have become a term widely used without specific definition. Everyone seems to use the phrase. Even people as technology-impaired as my grandparents use the term and seem to understand words like "data breach." But I don't understand what makes "data science" a new discipline. Data has been the foundation of science for centuries. Without data, there would be no Mendel, no Schr√∂dinger, etc. You can't have science without interpreting and analyzing data. But clearly it means something. Everyone is talking about it. So what exactly do people mean by data when they use terms like "big data" and why has this become a discipline in itself? Also, if it is an emerging discipline, where can I find more serious/in-depth information so I can better educate myself? Thanks!
