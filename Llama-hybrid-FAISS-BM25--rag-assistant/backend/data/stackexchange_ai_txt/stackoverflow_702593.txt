Technically, ANSI should be the same as US-ASCII. It refers to the ANSI X3.4 standard, which is simply the ANSI organisation's ratified version of ASCII. Use of the top-bit-set characters is not defined in ASCII/ANSI as it is a 7-bit character set. However years of misuse of the term by the DOS and subsequently Windows community has left its practical meaning as “the system codepage of whatever machine is being used”. The system codepage is also sometimes known as ‘mbcs’, since on East Asian systems that can be a multiple-byte-per-character encoding. Some code pages can even use top-bit-clear bytes as trailing bytes in a multibyte sequence, so it's not even strict compatible with plain ASCII... but even then, it's still called “ANSI”. On US and Western European default settings, “ANSI” maps to Windows code page 1252. This is not the same as ISO-8859-1 (although it is quite similar). On other machines it could be anything else at all. This makes “ANSI” utterly useless as an external encoding identifier.
