The things you have defined in your classes are fields not properties, so they won't be listed by the GetProperties() method. Try changing them to (for example): public int ItemId { get; set; } Assuming you are on .NET 3.0 or higher, otherwise: private int _itemId; public int ItemId { get { return _itemId; } set { _itemId = value; } } I question what it is you are trying to do though? Inheritance may be an option to make it more elegant - factoring out the shared properties into a base class. But if there is only these two properties, what is wrong with the code that just directly copies the values?
