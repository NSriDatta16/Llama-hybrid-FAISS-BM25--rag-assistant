The problelm is the pages you can press back to have been cached. You can instruct your browser to ALWAYS fetch the pages from the server every time. You will need to generate all of the following headers: Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: max-age=1 Expires: Tue, 1 May 1985 01:10:00 GMT The problem is not all browsers support all options so you have to include all of these headers to ensure all browsers don't cache your pages. The other reason for needing all of these headers, is that in some cases even if the web browser is respecting the expires headers, there can be a misconfigured proxy server between you and the user that is still caching the pages. In ASP you probably want to do something like this: public void Page_Load() { Response.ExpiresAbsolute = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1d); Response.Expires = -1500; Response.CacheControl = "no-cache"; Response.Cache.SetETag(randomString); }
