Consider revising your data model. I would remove the name and code column from the Component table and add the Identity column from the context table, renaming it in both tables as ContextIdentity. As your model is now. there are 2 valid links between the tables, this causes unnessessary use of storage and validaion checking. I suspect that it is using the code field since this is the shortest, and therefore most efficient.
