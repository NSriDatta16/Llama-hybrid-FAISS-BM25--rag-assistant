If you want to really and truly fix it, then you would need to Detect when your process is running elevated Spawn a non-elevated helper process which registers as the drop target Pass the dropped data through IPC to the elevated process, using a method that's safe to use across privilege boundaries (i.e. no active objects which carry code) This is a LOT of extra work when the workaround could be as simple as dropping from another elevated app (to get an elevated Explorer, just call up the File->Open dialog of any elevated app), but has the advantage that drag-and-drop will work properly if any of your customers ever run the app elevated.
