You wrote you want to use sklearn anyway, did you take a look at the sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures class? This should solve the first part of your problem. For the other part, why not actually try and measure? Run e.g. LassoCV on the polynomial dataset and check if holding out very correlated features changes performance? Embedding this information sounds rather complicated, I'd go for the simpler approach of either removing correlated features beforehand or running a PCA on it. And see how things change.
