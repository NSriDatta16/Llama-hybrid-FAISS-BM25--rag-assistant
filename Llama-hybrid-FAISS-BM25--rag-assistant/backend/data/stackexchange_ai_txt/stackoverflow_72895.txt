Is Async Messaging (In particular pub/sub style messaging) viable as a domain service architecture or only in an SOA-focused environment?

I have been researching asynchronous messaging, and I like the way it elegantly deals with some problems within certain domains and how it makes domain concepts more explicit. But is it a viable pattern for general domain-driven development (at least in the service/application/controller layer), or is the design overhead such that it should be restricted to SOA-based scenarios, like remote services and distributed processing?
