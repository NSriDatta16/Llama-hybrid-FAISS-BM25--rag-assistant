'Undoing' a square root transformation for linear regression

I have a time series that I'd like to perform regression on. It's not linear, or homoscedastic. After applying a square root transformation to the dependent variable, which made the graph linear. I applied the sklearn LinearRegression model, and checked the distribution of the residuals, which are normally distributed. Additionally, I checked for homoscedascity, and found that to be the case. My question is, is it valid for me to just square the values of the regression line, and plot it against the graph of my original values to undo the transformation? Can I do the same with standard error lines? (Edit: typos)
