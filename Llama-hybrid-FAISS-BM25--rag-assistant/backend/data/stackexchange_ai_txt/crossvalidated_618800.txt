A side-by-side plot of the density distribution, or histograms will give any person sufficient insights into the differences. When you do this, then make sure you have The same scale for the different plots. For example, in your QQ-plots you have different scales on the vertical axis which makes it difficult to compare the distributions. The job 3 has a much bigger tail for the older ages, and this is not clear because the scale reaches up to 150 years old, whereas the second plot reaches up to 90 years old. In your plot this is not directly clear because the 80 years in your middle panel is higher than the 100 years in your right panel. The histogram in terms of frequency instead of absolute numbers. Currently your histograms are difficult to compare because there are many more in job 3 than the others. If you normalize them such that they are more or less the same level, then it is easier to see the relative differences between the different jobs. Also, you seem to have plotted a bar chart instead of a histogram and there are several wider and smaller gaps between the bars. The reason for this is not very clear. Is there a meaning behind it? You could compare some parameters like a mean or median. This makes sense if, These means or other population descriptions have a special meaning. E.g. a cruiseschip operator might be interested in the average amount of food consumed by the tourists and not so much the exact distribution. We wish to compare large amounts of distributions like in a table, and comparing the entire distribution becomes too cluttered. A summary that expresses the essence of the distribution might work as well.
