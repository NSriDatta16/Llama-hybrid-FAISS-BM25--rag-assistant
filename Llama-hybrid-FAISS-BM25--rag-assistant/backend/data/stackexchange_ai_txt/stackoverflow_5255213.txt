I just ran the following code and ignoring the first initial compile I average about 3.3 seconds for GetResponse() and 0.2 more seconds for Load() . Are you on a fast connection? Are you sure this is where the bottleneck is? Option Explicit On Option Strict On Imports System.Net Public Class Form1 Private Const REQUESTURL As String = "http://www.MCServerList.net/?page=" Private chunkId As Int32 = 1 Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load Dim ST As New System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch() ST.Start() Dim req = WebRequest.Create(REQUESTURL & chunkId) Dim res = req.GetResponse() Trace.WriteLine(String.Format("GetResponse() : {0}", ST.Elapsed)) Using Stream As System.IO.Stream = res.GetResponseStream() Dim X As New HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument() X.Load(Stream) End Using Trace.WriteLine(String.Format("Load() : {0}", ST.Elapsed)) ST.Stop() End Sub End Class
