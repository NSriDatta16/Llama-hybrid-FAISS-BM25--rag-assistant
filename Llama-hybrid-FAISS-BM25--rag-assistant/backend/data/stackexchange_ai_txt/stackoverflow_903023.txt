A noble cause, best of luck. All good points above as well. I would only add: Agile is about the principles, not the process. See the Agile Manifesto . Changing corporate behavior is the goal, not altering a proven process to "work with" a broken organization, so emphasize the principles behind each practice. And then don't change the practices . If the principles don't apply, then drop the practice(s) that reflect the principle. Changing the practice compromises the principle and defeats its purpose. The end result of such "adaptations" is most likely the same flawed process already being used , now wrapped in agile terminology but lacking the principles that make it work. Process Documentation is Anti-Agile "Process documentation with sign off and structured steps will help other teams track the project" I'd have to say a big fat NO to this. Documentation will take the agile right out of the process (not to mention the life and energy out of the developers). If you want to help other teams track the project, publish the iteration schedule and velocity on the intranet. Please do not waste the developers' time - and the customers' money - writing process documentation, especially for the alleged benefit of other people who are not stakeholders and have no risk . And of course, no MBA candidate can escape a programmer thread without at least one Dilbert reference: (source: dilbert.com )
