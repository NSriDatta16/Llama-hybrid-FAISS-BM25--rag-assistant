Interpreting beta coefficients in a regression model when fixing covariates

Suppose I am interested in studying the effect of pizza on mortality across a number of countries. y = Death [1/0] x1 = Pizza [1/0] x2 = Country [Italy/Germany/France] In a logistic regression model, Country gets one-hot encoded so the model is: y = b0 + b1 * Pizza + b2 * Italy + b3 * Germany + b4 * France I'm interested to know how OddsRatio(b1) changes in Italy (vs. Germany and France). How should I proceed? Do I subset data to only Italy and rerun the LR model? e.g. If I'm interested in Italy only, the model evaluates to y = b0 + b1 * Pizza + b2* Italy but this only provides the odds of death in Italy.
