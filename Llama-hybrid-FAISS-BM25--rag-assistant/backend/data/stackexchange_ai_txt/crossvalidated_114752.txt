Forecast accuracy calculation

We are using STL (R implementation) for forecasting time series data. Every day we run daily forecasts. We would like to compare forecast values with real values and identify average deviation. For example, we ran forecast for tomorrow and got forecast points, we would like to compare these forecasts points with real data we will obtain tomorrow. I am aware that forecasts values and real data may not match most of the times, that is one of the reason we would like to keep track of how much accurate we are each day. Now we are trying identify what is the best approach to solve this problem? any help pointers would be appreciated. I looked at Measuring forecast accuracy question , but it seems it is related to comparing models rather than calculating accuracy with real values. I looked at accuracy function implementation in R , but confused with two questions: 1) Will it work on real data vs forecast data, because most of the tutorial saying as "test data" vs "forecast data" 2) It seems out put of accuracy function is array of values rather than % of deviation.
