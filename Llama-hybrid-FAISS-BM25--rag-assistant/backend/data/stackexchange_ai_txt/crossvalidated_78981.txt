You may try also a more recent method: A. Kalogeratos and A.Likas, Dip-means: an incremental clustering method for estimating the number of clusters , NIPS 2012. The idea is to use statistical hypothesis testing for unimodality on vectors containing the similarity/distance between one point and the rest of the points of the set. The testing is done using Hartigan-Hartigan dip test , Ann. Statist. 13(1):70-84. The method starts with all the dataset as one cluster and incrementally splits it as long as the unimodality hypothesis is rejected (i.e. more than one clusters is present). So this method would indicate whether there are more than one clusters in data (your question), but it may provide also the final clustering. Here you can find some code in Matlab .
