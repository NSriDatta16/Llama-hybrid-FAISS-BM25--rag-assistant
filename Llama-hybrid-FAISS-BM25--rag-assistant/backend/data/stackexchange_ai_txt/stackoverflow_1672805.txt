There are several bug tickets in the Java bug database which seem to relate to this e.g. Tooltip issue when using dual monitor (dual head) configuration. JToolTip in JApplet will place tooltip in wrong monitor Problem with Action button tooltips with some multiple monitor configurations On is closed as duplicate of another, one claims to be fixed and another has fix-understood set. One workaround posted by some user is frame.pack(); frame.setLocation(location); frame.setLocation(new Point(0, 0)); frame.setLocation(location); kieron.wilkinson The reason this works is that setLocation() eventually calles Component.reshape() which in turn calls a method called Component.notifyNewBounds(boolean resized, boolean moved) , which transverses the component hierarchy setting each components bounds. By default this is done "lazyily" but they are not set before the window is moved. The above code forces them to be set. This is also why the tooltips start working properly after dragging the window from one screen to another.
