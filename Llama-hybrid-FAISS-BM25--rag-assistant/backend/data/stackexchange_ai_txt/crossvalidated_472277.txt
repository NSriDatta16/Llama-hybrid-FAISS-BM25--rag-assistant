Calculate average for 5 star review system based on average and quantity of reviews

I also asked this on math.stackexchange.com but they said should better ask my question in this section. I have a review system and I stumble over the fact that I want to make a fair ranking and not just the average. The average is allready calculated but when you are sorting on this average the results are not fair. EXAMPLE: Company A has an average score of 4.8 based on 5 reviews. Company B has an average score of 4.7 based on 43 reviews. If you rank on average score Company A is above Company B in ranking but it ain't fair because it is a lot harder to get a 4.7 based on 43 reviews. I want to create a number that is based on the average review score and the number of reviews that are submitted. Maybe I am wrong here for asking this question but what is the best formula to create such an average and wich values do I need for creating this? I am developing in PHP if this should be important for you to know. I allready found something like this based on the bayesian average, is this Something that I should use? $avg_num_votes = 3.852941176470588; // Average number of reviews that are written for all company's on the website $ avg_rating = 4.822222222; // Average rating for all company's that are on the website that have a review $this_num_votes = 1; // Number of reviews that are written for this company $ this_rating = 5; // Average rating of this company $bayesian_rating = ( ($ avg_num_votes * $avg_rating) + ($ this_num_votes * $this_rating) ) / ($ avg_num_votes + $this_num_votes); echo $bayesian_rating; If anyone could help me out that would be great.
