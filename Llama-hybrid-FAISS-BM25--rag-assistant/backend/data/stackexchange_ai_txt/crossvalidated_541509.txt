A/B test to validate revenue uptick

This is a question regarding an A/B Test that we are running in my department. We are doing dynamic pricing of a product using Machine learning and doing an A/B test to compare with the current mode of rule based/static pricing. The hope is that the dynamic pricing using Machine learning will product an uptick in Revenue. Control - will sell the Product at fixed set of price points (Mostly Rule based slab pricing) Test - Will sell the same product at dynamic Price (Dynamic Pricing using Machine Learning) A sample of how the products could be sold is below. Which test would be apt to check if our solution (Test) indeed provided revenue improvement or not?
