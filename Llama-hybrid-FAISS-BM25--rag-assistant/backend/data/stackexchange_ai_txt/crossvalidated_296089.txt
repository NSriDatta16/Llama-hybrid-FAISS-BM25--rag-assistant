First of all, you are talking about multinomial regression, not logistic regression . Second, neither logistic regression nor multinomial regression are classifiers . Logistic regression and multinomial regression both predict probabilities of belonging to some class. To make a classifier of them you need a decision rule (if probability is greater then some value , classify this as some class ). It is up to you to define the decision rule. You are free to decide that if the probability of belonging to any class is not greater then some value , neither of the categories can be chosen.
