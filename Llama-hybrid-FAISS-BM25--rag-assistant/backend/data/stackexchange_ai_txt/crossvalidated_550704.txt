You're on the right path! You can make the calculations more manageable by introducing some notation here. Let me start with a small comment, that may or may not make sense yet: You can think of the defining equation $$ X_t = \phi \, X_{t-1} + \mu + Z_t$$ as simply the formula for a plain old simple linear regression of the series $X_{t}$ as a function of $X_{t-1}$ . That means, to get the least square estimators or $\mu, \phi$ , all you have to do is remember them for linear regression! Ok, let's get into actually calculating this: As you've found out yourself, the sum of least squares that you're trying to minimise is $$ E = \frac{1}{2\,n}\sum_{t=2}^n (X_t - \phi \, X_{t-1} - \mu )^2$$ so the partial derivatives are $$ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \mu} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=2}^n (\phi \, X_{t-1} + \mu - X_t)$$ and $$ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \phi} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=2}^n (\phi \, X_{t-1} + \mu - X_t) \, X_{t-1}$$ Now, have a look at the terms in those sums... these are just sample averages and higher moments. Indeed $$ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \mu} = \phi \, \langle X_{t-1} \rangle + \mu - \langle X_t \rangle$$ and $$ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \phi} = \phi \, \langle X_{t-1} ^2 \rangle + \mu \langle X_{t-1} \rangle - \langle X_t \, X_{t-1} \rangle$$ where I've just switched notation $\langle ... \rangle \equiv \frac{1}{n} \sum_t ...$ to clean things up a bit. Now we can solve that coupled linear system of equations using linear algebra. First write it as a matrix equation $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 1 & \langle X_{t-1} \rangle \\ \langle X_{t-1} \rangle & \langle X_{t-1} ^2 \rangle \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{matrix} \mu \\ \phi \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \langle X_{t} \rangle \\ \langle X_{t-1} \ X_{t} \rangle \end{matrix} \right) ~ . $$ Inverting the matrix gives $$ \left( \begin{matrix} \mu \\ \phi \end{matrix} \right) = \frac{1}{var(X_{t-1})} \left( \begin{matrix} cov( X_{t} X_{t-1} , X_{t-1} ) - cov( X_{t} , X_{t-1}^2 )\\ cov( X_{t-1} , \ X_{t} ) \end{matrix} \right) ~ . $$
