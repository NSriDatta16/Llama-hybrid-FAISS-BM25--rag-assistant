How to simulate data to be statistically significant?

I am in 10th grade and I am looking to simulate data for a machine learning science fair project. The final model will be used on patient data and will predict the correlation between certain times of the week and the effect this has on the medication adherence within the data of a single patient. Adherence values will be binary (0 means they did not take the medicine, 1 means they did). I am looking to create a machine learning model which is able to learn from the relationship between the time of week, and have separated the week into 21 time slots, three for each time of day (1 is Monday morning, 2 is monday afternoon, etc.). I am looking to simulate 1,000 patients worth of data. Each patient will have a 30 weeks worth of data. I want to insert certain trends associated with a time of week and adherence. For example, in one data set I may say that time slot 7 of the week has a statistically significant relationship with adherence. In order for me to determine whether the relationship is statistically significant or not would require me performing a two sample t-test comparing one time slot to each of the others and make sure the significance value is less than 0.05. However, rather than simulating my own data and checking whether the trends I inserted are significant or not, I would rather work backwards and perhaps use a program that I could ask to assign a certain time slot a significant trend with adherence, and it would return binary data that contains within it the trend I asked for, and also binary data for the other time slots which contains some noise but does not produce a statistically significant trend. Is there any program that can help me achieve something like this? Or maybe a python module? Any help whatsoever (even general comments on my project) will be extremely appreciated!!
