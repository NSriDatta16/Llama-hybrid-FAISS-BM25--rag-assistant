If I'm not mistaken, I think you're asking how to extract the W vector of the SVM, where W is defined as: W = \sum_i y_i * \alpha_i * example_i Ugh: don't know best way to write equations here, but this just is the sum of the weight * support vectors. After you calculate the W, you can extract the "weight" for the feature you want. Assuming this is correct, you'd: Get the indices of your data that are the support vectors Get their weights (alphas) Calculate W kernlab stores the support vector indices and their values in a list (so it works on multiclass problems, too), anyway any use of list manipulation is just to get at the real data (you'll see that the length of the lists returned by alpha and alphaindex are just 1 if you just have a 2-class problem, which I'm assuming you do). my.model kernlab actually scales your data first before doing its thing. You can get the (scaled) weights like so (where, I guess, the bias should be 0(?)) weight.vector If I understood your question, this should get you what you're after.
