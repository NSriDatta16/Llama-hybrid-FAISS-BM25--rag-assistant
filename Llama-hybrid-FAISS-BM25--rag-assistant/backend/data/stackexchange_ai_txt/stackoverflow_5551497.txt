WAP2 not working: Critical Tunnel Failure

I'm developing an app for Blackberry but I'm stuck with something. I wanna use WAP2 to connect to the world, but I get this error: Critical tunnel failure I'm posting the code below: private String connectionParameters() { if(WLANInfo.getWLANState() == WLANInfo.WLAN_STATE_CONNECTED) { return ";interface=wifi"; } else { int coverageStatus = CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus(); ServiceRecord record = this.getWAP2ServiceRecord(); if(record != null && (coverageStatus & CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_DIRECT) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_DIRECT) { return ";deviceside=true;ConnectionUID=" + record.getUid(); } else if((coverageStatus & CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS) { return ";deviceside=false"; } else if((coverageStatus & CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_DIRECT) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_DIRECT) { return ";deviceside=true"; } } return null; } I really hope it's not Vodafone who's blocking WAP2 :( Thanks in advance to everyone!
