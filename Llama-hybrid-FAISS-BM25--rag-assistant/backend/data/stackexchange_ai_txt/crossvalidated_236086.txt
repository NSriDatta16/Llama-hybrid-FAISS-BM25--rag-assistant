Time series question - prove by induction

Can anyone help with this question.. Consider the process {X(1), X(2), ...} satisfying $X(t)=αX(t−1)+ε(t)$ for all integers $t≥2$, (1) where the random variable $X(1)$ satisfies $E(X(1)) = 0$ and has finite variance. Also suppose that: (i) For all integers $t ≥ 2$, $ε(t)$ and $(X(t−1),...,X(1))(X(t−1),...,X(1))$ are independent. (ii) The ε(t) are independent and identically distributed with $E(ε(t))=0$ and $E(ε^2(t))=σ^2>0$. $X(t)=α^{t−1}X(1)+ε(t)+αε(t−1)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{t−2}ε(2)$ (2) (a) Check that the formula (2) is true for $t = 2$. (b) Suppose that the formula (2) is true for given $t ≥ 2$. Using (1) prove that (2) is true for t replaced by t + 1 What I started with for (a) was: $αX(t−1)+ε(t)=α^{t−1}X(1)+ε(t)+αε(t−1)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{t−2}ε(2)$ = $αX(2−1)+ε(2)=α^{2−1}X(1)+ε(2)+αε(2−1)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{2−2}ε(2)$ = $αX(1)+ε(2)=α^{1}X(1)+ε(2)+αε(1)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{0}ε(2)$ but i don't know where to go from there (or if it's correct)... What I started with for (b) was: subbed t+1 into t $αX(t+1−1)+ε(t+1)=α^{t+1−1}X(1)+ε(t+1)+αε(t+1−1)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{t+1−2}ε(2)$ = $αX(t)+ε(t+1)=α^{t}X(1)+ε(t+1)+αε(t)+⋅⋅⋅+α^{t-1}ε(2)$ and also didn't know where to go from there?
