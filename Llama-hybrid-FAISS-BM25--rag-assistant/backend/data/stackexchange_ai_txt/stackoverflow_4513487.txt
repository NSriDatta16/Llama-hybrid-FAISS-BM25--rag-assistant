The behavior you're describing indicates you've corrupted your heap or stack. I'd suggest recompiling with options -Wall -Wextra , fix any warnings you encounter and then see if you still run into the crash. I'd pay close attention to functions declared non-void that don't return a value. g++ doesn't warn by default for this and will almost always cause a crash away from where the error actually is. -Wextra will turn that warning on.
