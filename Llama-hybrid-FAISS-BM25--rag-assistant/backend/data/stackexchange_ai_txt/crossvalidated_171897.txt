I'm not sure if you're looking for a mathematical implementation or a code one, but assuming the latter (and that you're using Python) sklearn has two implementations of a gradient boosted decision tree. One for regression and one for classification. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-tree-boosting They have a couple of simple examples there, but if you google sklearn gradient boosting there are tons of examples/tutorials out there. As for a sparse data set I'm not sure what to tell you. There's some optional parameters when creating the boosted tree but I'm not sure any of them would help with that. If you use a random forest you can create class weights which I've found useful in unbalanced data sets.
