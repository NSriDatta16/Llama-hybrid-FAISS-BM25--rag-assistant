The one main reason for using SMS as a way of authentication is that you link the account to a mobile phone, which effectively reduces the chance of fake user accounts by a very large margin. To implement this feature, you will need to sign an agreement with a SMS Gateway that has coverage for the countries (and operators) that your customers are located in.. Most SMS Gateways can easily be integrated in your software, and will most often provide you with access to all the mobile operators that you require. I would not recommend using an email to sms gateway if you can use an API, as these are most often less responsive than using a proper API to send messages, where you will get a live connection with the SMS gateway itself, not an email server in front of the gateway. Examples of SMS Gateway providers: PSWinCom - www.pswin.com (Note: I am employed in this company.) Clickatell - www.clickatell.com HSL - http://www.hslsms.com/
