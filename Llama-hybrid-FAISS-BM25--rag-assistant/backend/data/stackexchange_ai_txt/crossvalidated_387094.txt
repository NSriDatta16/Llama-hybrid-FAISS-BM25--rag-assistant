TL:DR on average it works out. The idea is that you use the same data for each and every model so that they are completely comparable. As for whether a particular portion of the data, say A, works better for one model, that is out of your control. As long as you create the partitions randomly, this should ensure that there are no biases in any one partition for any one model ( on average ). If you are worried about this you could perform repeated partitions of your data, each time selecting randomly. If one model works better on the whole data regardless of partitioning then that is a sign that this model is better suited for the data.
