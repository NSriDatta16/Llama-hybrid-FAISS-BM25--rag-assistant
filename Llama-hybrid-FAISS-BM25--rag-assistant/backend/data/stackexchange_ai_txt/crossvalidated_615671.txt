Probability to belong in a class in a Proportional Odds Logistic Regression

I'm having trouble understanding how the probability of belonging to each class is being calculated. Appreciate it if someone could help me out! Assuming the dependent variable with 3 ordinal classes (low, medium, high). And assume for simplicity, the coefficients for a model with 2 predictors: b1 : 2 b2 : -3 And intercept for low|medium: b0 : 1.5 And intercept for medium|high: a0 : 0.5 How do we find the probability that a new set of observations x0 = (x1 , x2) = (1,2) belongs to which class? Can you show how, using the equation for polr ? Thanks in advance for your help!
