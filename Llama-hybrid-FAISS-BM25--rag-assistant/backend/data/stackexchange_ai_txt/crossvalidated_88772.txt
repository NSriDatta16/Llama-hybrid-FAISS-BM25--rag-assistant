Sparse parameters when computing AIC, BIC, etc

I'm designing large-scale, regularized logistic regression models with lots of sparse, binarized features. e.g. isUS, isFR, etc. As a result, a lot of the weights in the model are zero. I'm wondering how I should compute the "number of parameters" in model-selection criteria like AIC, BIC, etc. Should I only count the number of non-zero weights or all of the weights? e.g. If there are 10 possible countries, but only 6 have non-zero weights, is the number of parameters 6 or 10?
