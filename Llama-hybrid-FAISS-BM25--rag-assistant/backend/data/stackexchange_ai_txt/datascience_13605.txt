forecast monthly shipment (time series) for 300 products individually in R

I can build ARIMA model with regressor to forecast monthly shipment for one product. but I have 300 products and each of them needs a monthly forecast. my question is, instead of building 300 models, is there another approach in R to deal with the goal I am trying to accomplish? thank you!
