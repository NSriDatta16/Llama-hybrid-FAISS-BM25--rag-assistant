I would give them 100 lines of code all under 1 method and then another 100 lines of code divided up between several methods and ask them to write down an explanation of what each does. Time how long it takes to write both paragraphs and then show them the result. ...Make sure to pick code that will take twice or three times as long to understand if it were all under one method - Main() - Nothing is better than learning by example.
