You could try Multidimensional Scaling, it is a technique to "transform" a set of points, where you have a distance on two points, into a set of euclidean vectors in such a way that the distances are nearly equal. If the points of this set are already vectors, then this technique is identical to Principal Component Analysis. Once you have your "points" transformed into Euclidean vectors, you could do Factor Analysis. For the distance in your points you could use the Gower Coefficient which mixes categorical and ordinal variables. Multidimensional Scaling: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling Gower Coefficient : http://venus.unive.it/romanaz/modstat_ba/gowdis.pdf Both are implemented in R, so you do not have to implement them on your own, but reading the articles is encouraged to understand what the implementation does. ( Gower R : Google "daisy r gower" , (Classical) MDS : Google "r multidimensional scaling" )
