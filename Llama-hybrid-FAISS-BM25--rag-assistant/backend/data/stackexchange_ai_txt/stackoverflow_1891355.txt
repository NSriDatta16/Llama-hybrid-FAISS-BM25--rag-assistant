Another viewpoint which leverages c#. As you already have a powerful general purpose functional programming tool your users are familiar with and have bought into in the shape of Excel I would look to build a solution around that. You still get the option that way of being able to use other 3rd party add-ons and integrated options (e.g. R and Mathematica) I would look into Managed Automation Add-ins for User Defined Functions . These are essentially c# library projects that use the System.Runtime.InteropServices as described in this article link text . To the users these functions are added at a cell level in the normal way using the function wizard and can be more or less what you want them to be. This then is your DSL. Users can choose to integrate the functionality in their existing models easily. It would also be fast to prototype something to test the feasibility of this. These are fully debuggable. Additionally using Visual Studio Tools for Office you can access the full excel object hierarchy and even add action panes which can be laid out by dragging and dropping controls for more complex data entry requirements. I believe it is even possible to use WPF with Excel in this way if you needed to add specialised visualisations. If you needed to persist data back to say Sql Server you could build a turn around validation form using this approach. I sound like a M$ shill! (Just to set the record straight I do not work for them). You would need to evaluate the performance of this and I am not sure how it would scale.
