Also had problems with sortable earlier: my case was Accordion and sortables inside. I could not get a clear answer, but if you look at any of the tree implementations they are using drag-and-drop directly and not sortable. Based on this experience - not very exact I know - I would agree with akiller and say: take a good tree plugin instead of trying to do this yourself with sortable. jsTree is quite good and should do the job - there are also others if for some reason jsTree does not suit your needs.
