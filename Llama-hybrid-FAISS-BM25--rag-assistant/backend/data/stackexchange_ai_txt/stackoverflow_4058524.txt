The main question is: how big are those pictures on average?? A thorough examination by Microsoft Research ( To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a Filesystem ) has shown: that it's better to store stuff inside your SQL tables as long as the data is typically smaller than 256 KB that it's better to store on filesystem if the elements are typically larger than 1 MB The in-between is a bit of a gray area.... So: are you pictures mostly more than 1 MB?? Then store on disk and keep a reference. Otherwise, I'd recommend storing them inside your database table.
