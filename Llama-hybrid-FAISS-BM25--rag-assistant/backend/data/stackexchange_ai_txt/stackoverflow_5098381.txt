Ok, as there aren't any alternatives - the hacky solution of my own would be the answer: find RVA of MemoryManager structure (refer to implementation part of System.pas ) Use it in your DLL to set its own memory manager to be the same as that of the application it is being loaded into. As already stated in the body of my question - it works with some limitations and is very fragile in scope of compiler & linker options
