The extern declaration in your header file lets modules other than the one in which the variable is defined use it. If it's supposed to be defined as int stack_counter = 0 and live in stack.c, define it like that and put an extern stack_counter in the header. On line 6 of stack.c, you didn't define a storage class for sroot. Since it's externed in the header, I assume you meant to type snode sroot=NULL . Fix those, then implement stackpush (make sure it doesn't return void) and deal with the rest of your warnings in order. Note that in C, you have to either use forward declarations of functions (with prototypes) or define your functions before they're used. The cstack function should probably be the last function in the file.
