Much of this will depend on how you are going to use the list and to what scale. If you are going to use it as a stack, or queue, then a TList would work fine. If your needing to search through the list for a specific item then you will need something that allows faster retrieval. TDictionary (2009) or TStringList (pre 2009) would be the most likely choice. Dynamic arrays are also a possiblity, but if you use them you will want to minimize the use of SetLength as each time it is called it will re-allocate memory. TList manages this for you, which is why I suggested using a TList. if you KNOW how many you will deal with in advance, then use a dynamic array, and set its length on the onset. If you have more items than will fit in memory then your choices also change. At that point I would either use a database table, or a tFileStream to store the records to be processed, then seek to the beginning of the table/stream for processing.
