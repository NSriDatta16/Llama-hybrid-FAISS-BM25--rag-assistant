Tensorflow supports complex numbers as type: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/complex Here is a work showing how complex numbers could be used in neural networks : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09792.pdf Here is the source code of that work: https://github.com/ChihebTrabelsi/deep_complex_networks In their code authors use Keras and Theano as backend - you just substitute (install) Tensorflow as a backend.
