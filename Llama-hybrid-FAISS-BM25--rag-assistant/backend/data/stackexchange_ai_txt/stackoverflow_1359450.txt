I would have different views that correspond to your states and then choose the view depending on which state you are in. You could also implement it with partials, breaking down the pieces so that you can easily include editable or read-only versions of the different sets of elements. The read-only view, then, need not even include a form element. You could also present the data in spans, divs, or paragraphs rather than as input elements. Note: you'll still have to check whether the current user has the ability to update/create data in the actions that process form submits. Just because you limit the ability to view data in a read-only format, that won't stop someone from crafting a form post to mimic your application if they want. You can't rely on hiding/disabling things on the client to prevent a malicious user from trying to enter/modify data.
