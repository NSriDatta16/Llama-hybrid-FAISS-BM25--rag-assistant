If you want to predict future values knowing only the current and past values, that is also how you specify the model. If the variable of interest is $y$ and the variables that can be used for prediction are $x_1,\dotsc,x_K$, you formulate the model as $$ y_{t+1} = f(x_{1,t},\dotsc,x_{K,t},\dotsc,x_{1,t-p},\dotsc,x_{K,t-p}) + \varepsilon_{t+1} $$ for some maximum lag $p$, where $f$ is the function the machine learning algorithm is trying to learn and $\varepsilon$ is something unpredictable. This way you can predict future $y_{t+1}$ using data that is available today (at time $t$). When training your model, you will have a sample spanning $1,\dotsc,T$. Then your $t$ runs from $p+1$ to $T-1$ in the training sample. You can verify that by noticing that for $t T-1$ you would have to use data that you do not have within $1,\dotsc,T$. Once you have formulated the model, training and prediction goes as usual.
