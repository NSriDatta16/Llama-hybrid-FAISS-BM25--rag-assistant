IIRC in order to use Lombok in Eclipse, there's a parameter required at start-up to introduce Lombok's Java Agent into the JDT compile process. This is normally specified in the eclipse.ini file. If Ant4Eclipse does not also make use of those parameters (I don't see why it would) you may have to specify the -javaagent:lombok.jar parameter for that too. DISCLAIMER: this is only a guess.
