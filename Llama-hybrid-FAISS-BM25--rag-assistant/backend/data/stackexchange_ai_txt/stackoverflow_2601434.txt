I think it's hard to talk about an average cost. The worst case cost is O(n 2 ) and happens either when the repeated elements are towards the end of the array, for example something like this: 2 3 4 5 ... 1 1 Or when the array contains nothing but distinct elements. The best case is when the array starts with two repeated elements, like this: 1 1 ... In which case the cost is a single comparison. Another good case is when there exists an element near the beginning of the array that repeats at the end of the array, something like this: 2 3 4 1 ... 1 This will be (closer to) O(n). The fact is the cost depends on the input, so you might as well assume you're going to always hit a worst case and try to find a better algorithm, maybe something based on sorting the array or on using hash tables, giving you O(nlog n) worst case and O(n) average case respectively.
