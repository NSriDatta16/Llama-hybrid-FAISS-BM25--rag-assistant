How to pass arguments between views in Drupal-7

I consistently find myself up against the following use case, and have yet to grok the proper workflow / solution: I would like to display two views. In the first view, each row displays one node of type-x. The second view shows nodes of type-y, which are associated with node type-x via a nodereference, as follows: View-1 View-2 ------ ------ row1 X-a Y-a row2 X-b Y-b row3 X-c Y-c row4 etc etc For example, X is an event, and Y is a venue. Or, X is a porfolio page, and Y is a paged gallery. I understand that there are other ways of approaching this - for example using node views rather than fields, but I am trying to leverage views to create 2 distinct custom queries related by an argument passed from one view to the other. This is a variation of a question I asked earlier ( Programmatic Views in Drupal 7 ), and hopefully a clarification. Any help, even (or especially) just on the semantic level, is greatly appreciated.
