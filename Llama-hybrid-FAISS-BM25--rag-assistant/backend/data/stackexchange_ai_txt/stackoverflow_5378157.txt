Have your download page redirect to the PHP file that will download it. If it can download it, it will redirect the user back to the previous page, because the download doesn't have the right content type, although it could be just a plain .html file. You don't need Javascript to do this: I recommend the Smart File Download , from zubrag.com, if you don't already have a PHP file specifically for downloading.
