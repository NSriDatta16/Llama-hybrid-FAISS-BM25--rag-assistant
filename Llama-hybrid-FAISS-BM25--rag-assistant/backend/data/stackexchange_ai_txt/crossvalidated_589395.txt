I agree with @Serendipity: The performance of neural networks can continually improve as more and more data is provided to the model, BUT the capacity of the model must be adjusted to support the increases in data. Let's say that you have a very small object detection model (7.2M parameters), it won't be able to learn all the information that you feed to it as the weights won't be able to accommodate for all the possible distributions found in the data, given that the data is complex enough. The model will only be able to learn large data variability if its capacity makes it possible
