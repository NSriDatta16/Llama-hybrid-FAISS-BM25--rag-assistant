Do the agents store its state on the device itself? In the most common scenario the SNMP agent is running on the device which monitors. In this case the agent has no other option and any state information must be stored on the device. SNMP agent just reads or sets these information. If there is a trap set on an agent, can you do a poll on the same OID to get the same information? I think you should be able to do that - for example SNMPv2 trap IF-MIB::linkDown contains three varbinds - IF-MIB::ifIndex, IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus and IF-MIB::ifOperStatus. In this particular case the ifIndex specifies the row in the ifTable and other two can be polled. Without using a mib file, is there a way to query a device for all of its information at once? Yes, use snmp-walk from the net-snmp package or any other snmp tool that can use get-next to poll the data. If not, and you're writing your own customized manager, do you have to know the structure of what it reports up front? You do need to know what the device MIB contains - without such information you get only numeric OID and value, which is meaningless both for developers and users. In case of more complicated MIBs you need to know quite a lot of details about the managed device. MIB file hardly ever contains enough information.
