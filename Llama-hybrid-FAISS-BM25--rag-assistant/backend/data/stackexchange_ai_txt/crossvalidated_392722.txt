lmer should have no problem fitting a model with an average of 1.8 observations per cluster. In general, problems arise where there are too few groups, not too many. The minimum sample size per cluster is 1 . Changing the grouping level as you suggest will lead to a loss of information and should be avoided if possible. Instead, it may make sense to specify nested random effects, if there is variation at the ProductCategoryID level: lmer(Y~ X + (1|ProductCategoryID/ProductID), myData)
