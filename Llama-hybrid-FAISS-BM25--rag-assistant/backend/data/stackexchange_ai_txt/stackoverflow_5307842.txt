Puzzling C++ syntax using "&"

Possible Duplicate: What is the meaning of & in c++? Here is a C++ class declaration snippet containing an ampersand that doesn't make sense to me: class rimage : public matrix { public: rimage( void ); rimage( int, int ); rimage( rimage & ); rimage & operator=( const matrix & A ); rimage & operator=( const rimage & A ); rimage & operator/=( int ); ... What does rimage( rimage & ); mean? Why is the & at the end? This snippet was from a text book on PCNNs This class declaration is giving me compilation problems so I need to figure this out.
