You should consider using Exceptions . They don't print anything if you don't want to. At least this would be a better separation of your actual code and error handling. You are right, having a function return a value or return false on error is not the best style (yes I know that this is probably done a lot). If you want to learn more about good coding practice, I suggest to read Clean Code by Robert Martin .
