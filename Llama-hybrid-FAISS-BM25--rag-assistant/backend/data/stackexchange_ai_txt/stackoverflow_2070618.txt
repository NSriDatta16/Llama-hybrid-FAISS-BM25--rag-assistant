You're inserting the script that invokes the jQuery dialog before you're inserting the div of the dialog itself. Therefore $("#dialog") matches no elements, so the dialog() call on the empty wrapper silently does nothing. You can get away with this in a simple HTML page because you're using $(function) to register an onready function that only gets called once the whole document is loaded. But in the Jetpack version, the whole document is already loaded, so inserting the onready script gets it called straight away. If this is an arbitrary third-party document you're inserting content into, this is something you should be very careful with. Loading a large library like jQuery&UI into an arbitrary page that won't be expecting it (rather than one particular page you're targeting) is a bit rude and potentially fragile. Plus what happens if the document already defines an element with id dialog ? And what if it has style rules that cause the dialog to render in unexpected ways? And so on.
