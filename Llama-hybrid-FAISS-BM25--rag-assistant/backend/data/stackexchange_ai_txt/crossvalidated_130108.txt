The trimmed mean is, from where you are starting, one generalisation of the median. If you trim (meaning, ignore rather than drop) 3 values in each tail of an ordered sample of 7 then you get the median; if you trim 0 values, then you get the mean. For small samples, thinking in terms of number trimmed is natural. Here is a Stata-based calculation with your "data" using code published with Cox (2013), but the output should be fairly transparent to users of other software: set obs 7 mat A = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3) mat B = (1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3) gen A = A[1, _n] gen B = B[1, _n] trimmean A, number(0/3) +---------------------------+ | number # trimmed mean | |---------------------------| | 0 7 1.714286 | | 1 5 1.6 | | 2 3 1.666667 | | 3 1 2 | +---------------------------+ trimmean B, number(0/3) +---------------------------+ | number # trimmed mean | |---------------------------| | 0 7 2.285714 | | 1 5 2.4 | | 2 3 2.333333 | | 3 1 2 | +---------------------------+ As common, results are shown to more decimal places than will be needed. For larger samples, it is more natural, and certainly conventional, to think in terms of the fraction or percent trimmed. The 25% trimmed mean has been given various names, the most common being "midmean". (Those familiar with box plots can think of it as the mean of the values falling inside the box.) The advantages of trimmed means include Ease of understanding and calculation. Trimmed means are used in judging sports as a way of discounting or discouraging bias in voting, so they may even be familiar to users of statistics from outside the field. Clear links to standard ideas, mean and median. Flexibility in choosing that mix of resistance to wild values and use of the information in the other values that is a good trade-off in a project. The disadvantages include Flexibility is another name for arbitrariness. It's not easy to see what the best extensions to bivariate or multivariate cases would be. Values are included or not, at least in the simplest flavour of trimmed means, which may not be subtle enough. Trimmed means other than the limiting cases of mean and median lose many of the attractive properties of either, including the equivariance of median and monotonic transformations emphasised by @whuber. Cox (2013) is a tutorial review emphasising the history of ideas and associated graphics. (It overlooks a brief mention by Jules Verne.) Cox, N. J. 2013. Speaking Stata: Trimming to taste.
