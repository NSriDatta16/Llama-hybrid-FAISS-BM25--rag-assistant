The Python mmap module provides a nice Python-friendly way of memory mapping a file. On a 32-bit operating system, the maximum size of the file is will be limited to no more than a GB or maybe two, but on a 64-bit OS you will be able to memory map a file of arbitrary size (until storage sizes exceed 2 64 , of course). I've done this with files of up to 30 GB (the Wikipedia XML dump file) in Python with excellent results.
