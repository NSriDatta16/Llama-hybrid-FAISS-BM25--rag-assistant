If you are used to DataTable , presumably you are used to the change tracking and the persistence support that adapters (etc) bring. In which case, have you considered LINQ-to-SQL and/or Entity Framework? These both support rich chaneg tracking and automated persistence, while offering various other DAL use-cases such as composable queries and all that other LINQ goodness. Definitely worth investigation. Note that changing to typed POCO entities (i.e. not DataRow nor a subclass there-of) is still a big deviation, so it won't be a simple change. If you haven't the time for a major change, it would be pragmatic to stick with DataTable (perhaps typed). This will provide EntitySet , IQueryable , etc for you, or you can just use List , Collection etc for ad-hoc usage.
