A simple question on CLT in possible connection with Berry-Esseen thm

I am curious about the contents while I read a note on machine learning. It could be obvious. So, please let me know if I am missing some fundamental things. $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ are from an i.i.d. distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma What I cannot grasp is the following comment: "This approximation is only valid for x within about $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ of $\mu$" . (FYI, this note is about large deviation.) I also wondering how this statement is closely related to the Berry-Esseen thm .
