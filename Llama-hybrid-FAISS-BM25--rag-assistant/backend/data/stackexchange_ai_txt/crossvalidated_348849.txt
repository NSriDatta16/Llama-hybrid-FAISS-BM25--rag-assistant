Derivative equal to zero in PCA

Source: presentation In PCA, we want to maximize variance $var(\alpha'_kX)$, i.e. $\alpha'_k \Sigma \alpha_k$ with respect to $\alpha' \alpha = 1$, where $\Sigma = X'X$. After introducing Lagrange multipliers, we set $\alpha_k$ derivative equal to zero in order to maximize variance, i.e. $\frac{d}{d \alpha_k} (\alpha_k' \Sigma \alpha_k - \lambda_k (\alpha_k' \alpha_k - 1)) = 0$. How does above derivative yield maximal variance?
