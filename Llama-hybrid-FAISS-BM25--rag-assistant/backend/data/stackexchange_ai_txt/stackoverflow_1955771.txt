What you may be looking for are Javaspaces (a Java implementation of tuple-spaces) and matching objects based on their attributes (called 'entries' in the Javaspace world). Spaces store objects with particular attributes or entries (e.g. an associated currency, city, user, whatever). You can then select objects from the space by specifying 0 or more such entries, and thus get back 0 or more objects. As such, it's a useful pattern for messaging and producer/consumer scenarios in particular. So you can store your objects (messages) with particular attributes (e.g. message type, consumer type etc.) and your consumers will select these objects based on a set of 0 or more attributes. Note that this doesn't require modification of the underlying object that you're storing. You can run a space in-process (in one JVM) - it's not just a networked storage pattern.
