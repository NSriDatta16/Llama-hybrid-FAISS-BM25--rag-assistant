I've just been looking at his problem myself on a project and came across a slightly more elegant solution, as long as you're only dealing with a habtm relationship and you need to ensure that at least one checkbox is selected. so for example you're editing a Project and you want it to be associated with at least one user Add this to beforeValidate() // check habtm model and add to data foreach($this->hasAndBelongsToMany as $k=>$v) { if(isset($this->data[$k][$k])) { $this->data[$this->alias][$k] = $this->data[$k][$k]; } } In the validation rules add the following: 'User' => array( 'rule' => array('multiple', array('min' => 1)), 'message' => 'Please select one or more users' )
