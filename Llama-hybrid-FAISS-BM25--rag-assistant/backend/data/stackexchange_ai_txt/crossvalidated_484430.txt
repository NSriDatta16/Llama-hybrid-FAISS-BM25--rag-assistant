How to evaluate logistic regression on continuous metric by having binary 0/1 data

Let’s say I have two logistic regression models trained on binary 0/1 data. The goal is to predict a continuous value as a score of confidence of a given example belonging to positive class_1 (e.g. “not spam” / “spam”). To make it clear I don’t regard logistic regression as a classification method at least in the context of the question. Both perform well in terms of accuracy and f1_score. However, I want to evaluate and compare them based on continues scoring rather than binary accuracy . My understanding binary accuracy is evil . Although these models may predict scores, the distribution and behavior of the continuous quantity may not match the desired one. For example, by a given observation bearing some similarity toward class_1, these models (A and B) may produce scores 0.01 and 0.4 respectively. Despite both agree and correctly classify that sample as class_0, I would favor model B because of better reflected sample’s tendency (distance) toward class_1. Manually I would estimate that sample with 0.4999. What I’m looking for is the loss/metric as a distance to the positive class_1 | y_label_prob - y_hat_prob | -> Huge loss rather than just misclassification | y_label_class - y_hat_class | --> No loss Unfortunately, I don’t have continuous labels (y_label_prob) to go into pure regression. If I had I could just compute squared errors. Instead, I trained multiple binary classifiers and used their scores mean as continuous labels. What might be recommendation to evaluate performance with respect to continuous quantity by having 0/1 labels?
