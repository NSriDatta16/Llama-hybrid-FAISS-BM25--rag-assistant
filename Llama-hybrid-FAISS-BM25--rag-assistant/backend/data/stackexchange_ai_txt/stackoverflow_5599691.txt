302's Location header according to HTTP 1.1 looks like this: Location = "Location" ":" absoluteURI absoluteURI according to URI Generic Syntax does not include fragment identifier. The one with the fragment is called URI-reference : URI-reference = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ "#" fragment ] The detail is described in @levik's question: URL Fragment and 302 redirects . I am now learning it the hard way, but the gist is that 302 with fragment doesn't seems to work with IE8. Using Javascript probably is more reliable way because you're suppose to pass the access tokens via fragment. Edit : I now know what happened with IE8. IE does respect the fragment identifier in Location header, but it ignores the one from source URI. My redirect URL was to http://example.com/oauth , which I had an automatic redirect to http s , https://example.com/oauth . OAuth redirects to http://example.com/oauth#access_token=foo . My server redirects to https://example.com/oauth . Between step 1 and 2, IE8 threw away the fragment identifier, while some of the other browsers redirected to https://example.com/oauth#access_token=foo . So the real answer is 302 is ok, as long as you don't use it more than once on the URL.
