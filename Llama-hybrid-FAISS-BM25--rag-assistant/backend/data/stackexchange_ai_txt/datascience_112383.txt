The characteristics you mention are typically called features. My interpretation of your description is that each of the models performs feature engineering. You'll still need to put all the features into a single model to predict species of fish. Predicting species of fish is a multi-class classification problem, assign a single categorical label to each data instance. If you think there may be novel species of fish that do not appear in the training set, you can handle that by modeling the uncertainty in your model's predictions. In other words, your model will have category predictions and associated probabilities. If the largest probability is below a threshold, the system should predict that the features of the current fish are not likely associated with any species of fish that appeared in the training data set.
