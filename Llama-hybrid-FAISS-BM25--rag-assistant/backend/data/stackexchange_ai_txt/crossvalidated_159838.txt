What is the minimum number of time periods for Granger causality test?

What is the minimum number of time periods required to reliably conduct a Granger causality test? I have a time series with only six data points, and I would like to know if it is possible to conduct Granger causality tests on it. Specifically, I want to examine cultural values from the World Value Survey , which collects data in "waves" that span five years each. So, the time points are: Wave 6 (2010-2014) Wave 5 (2005-2009) Wave 4 (1999-2004) Wave 3 (1995-1998) Wave 2 (1990-1994) Wave 1 (1981-1984) Given that there are only five or six data points (there's a gap between Wave 1 and Wave 2), is the Granger causality test at all feasible here? I know that this is a slightly different question, but if six time periods is too few, are there any appropriate causality tests I could run?
