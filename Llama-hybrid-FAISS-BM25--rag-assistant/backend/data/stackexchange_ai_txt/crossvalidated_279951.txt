Your interpretation of PCA components is not correct. PCA does not tell you which variables account for the most variation in the data, so a statement like Calcium is the most explanatory of the variance, as well as also being the third most explanatory variable for the variance. cannot be drawn from a PC analysis. What it does say is that the direction determined by the vector $$\begin{array}{cccc}&PC_1\\Calcium&0.6729\\Iron&0.5331\\Uranium&0.1123\end{array}$$ accounts for the most variation in the data. This direction is a combination of the directions determined by the individual variables. This mixing of directions is fundamental to PCA, and it cannot be undone or ignored. The further principal components are interpreted iteravely, they account for the most variation in the data in directions that are orthogonal to the previous PC directions.
