Is it possible we supply the differenced data to the ARMA model (not ARIMA) and have the model forecast for the original time series?

I am trying to fit an ARMA model in Python for a non-stationary series. Conceptually, is it possible that I difference the data to first convert it to stationary data, fit the model on this differenced data and then have the model forecast for the original series? If not, what if I get forecast for the differenced data and do some manipulation to convert that forecasted differenced series to forecasted series at original level. How do I achieve this?
