I'd say that function pointers are a good thing but you may be able to leverage the pre-processor to do what you want...(learning how to use function pointers is a good thing though)... I mean, if param2 is something that is known statically, it's pretty useless to have function pointers.. Function pointers would be better if you've dynamic values and while running your program once you want to give param2 = foo and then param2 = bar... Do you actually need different function prototypes or could you have something like... #ifdef BAR void foo() { whatever(); } #elif defined(FOO) void foo() { whocares(); } #else #define foo() do{} while(0) #endif and always have the same body but giving different -D on the command line...
