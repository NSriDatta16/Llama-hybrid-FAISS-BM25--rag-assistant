Prevent click events on Sortable of jQueryUI

I have sortable, draggable and click events binded to the same DOM element. On sorting, I want the click event to be disabled. I am using the following code for draggable, which works fine: $('.selector').draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { ui.helper.bind('click.prevent', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); }, stop: function(event, ui) { setTimeout(function(){ ui.helper.unbind('click.prevent'); },1000); } }); I got the above example while going through SF a while back. However, the same code doesnt work when I use it for sortable. I found out the reason being that the ui.helper is null for sortable's stop function. Any way that i can prevent click event on sorting ?
