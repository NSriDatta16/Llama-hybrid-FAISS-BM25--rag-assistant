What is the purpose of the model AIC if you can iteratively check the forecast RMSE at each lag?

If the purpose of the time series modelling is to build one that gives the most accurate forecast, may I ask if it necessary to check the model AIC to determine the optimal lag when you can iteratively check the forecast RMSE at all possible lags and determine the lag that gives the lowest RMSE? Also, is it unusual that the model that gives the lowest RMSE may not necessarily has the minimum AIC?
