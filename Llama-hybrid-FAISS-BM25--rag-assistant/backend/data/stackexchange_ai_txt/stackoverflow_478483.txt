Full-text indexes (which are indexes) are much faster than using LIKE (which essentially examines each row every time). However, if you know the database will be small, there may not be a performance need to use full-text indexes. The only way to determine this is with some intelligent averaging and some testing based on that information. Accuracy is a different question. Full-text indexing allows you to do several things (weighting, automatically matching eat/eats/eating, etc.) you couldn't possibly implement that in any sort of reasonable time-frame using LIKE. The real question is whether you need those features. Without reading the full-text documentation's description of these features, you're really not going to know how you should proceed. So, read up! Also, some basic tests (insert a bunch of rows in a table, maybe with some sort of public dictionary as a source of words) will go a long way to helping you decide.
