You might like to take a look at the new Google Visualization API . Saw a presentation on this at yesterday's Google Dev. Day in London and it looked very interesting. While it is currently only able to work with data retrieved from Google Spreadsheets, expanding it to handle data retrieval from other sources is a high priority for the Viz. team. HTH. cheers, Rob
