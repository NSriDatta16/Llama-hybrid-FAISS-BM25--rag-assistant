Logging all cocoa events?

I'm doing usability testing and would like to log all user input events: mouse movements, clicks, drags, and keyboard input. I'm not having much luck figuring out how, or finding any code to do so. Any hints? I took a look at the CoreGraphics EventTap mechanisms, but I'm worried that it will be too low-level; I'd like to actually know what particular UI elements the user clicks on. Edit to clarify: I'm doing usability testing, so I want to keep track of what parts of the interface the user uses and doesn't use. So, I want to keep track of "Button 'foo' was clicked 7 times at these particular timestamps, the user scrolled through this list and selected such-and-such item" and so forth.
