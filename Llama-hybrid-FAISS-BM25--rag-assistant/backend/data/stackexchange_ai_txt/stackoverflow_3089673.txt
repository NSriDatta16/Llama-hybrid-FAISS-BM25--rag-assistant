Don't forget about a separate service layer. as the dispatchservlet only take one controller for one form action, does it mean i need to implement each action a controller? would there be some more elegant ways? You can associate an action with a Controller method, so if there are several actions that make sense to group into a single Controller you can feel free to do it. Check out the annotations in Spring 3. I would also need pointers with setting up a security filter for authentication for all pages You can do basic auth or, better yet, use Spring Security.
