Linearly dependent features

I have a matrix A of 1000 observations (rows) and 100 features (cols). I would like to find: Linearly dependent features so that I can remove them and simplify the problem. rank(A) gives me 88, which I assume means that 12 of the features are linearly dependent. Am I right? After the above step, how do I determine which 12 out of the 100 columns are linearly dependent? I know there is no unique answer. But does that mean I can choose any 12 columns? Let's say I choose to remove the last 12 columns. But before removing them, I what to find the 12 linear combinations that compute to the last 12 columns. How do I get these? So far I have tried using Matlab's PCA, QR and SVD, but each of them give different matrices and I don't know how to use these matrices to get what I want.
