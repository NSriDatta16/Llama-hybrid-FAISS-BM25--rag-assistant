The drive mappings exist only for the logged on user. For this reason they are not visible to the service as it runs on lower level. You need to use some ftp client if you want to use the storage location from a service. The same problem appears with network shares where you cannot access a network share mapped to a network drives from services. The correct way to access these shares from a service is to use an UNC path similar to "\\SANS\Backuplocation" .
