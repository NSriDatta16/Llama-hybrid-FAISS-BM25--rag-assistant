Average estimated beta does not equal to true beta by sim.survdata

I recently use the R "sim.survdata" function in "coxed" package to simulate survival data. I did 2k simulations with one covariate and coefficient = 1. Each time I fitted a Cox regression and recorded the estimated beta and 95% CI. However the mean(betahat) doesn't equal to 1, and CIs do not cover 1 at 95% times. Please see the codes I used below. I wonder the reasons, any input is welcomed. Thank you in advance. bhat=NULL lb=NULL ub=NULL for(i in 1:2000){ set.seed(20110312+i) simdata $data$ event=as.numeric(simdata $data$ failed) fit=coxph(Surv(y,event==1)~X,data=simdata $data) bhat=c(bhat,summary(fit)$ coefficients[1]) lb=c(lb,log(summary(fit) $conf.int[3])) ub=c(ub,log(summary(fit)$ conf.int[4])) } > mean(bhat) [1] 0.9408025 > mean(lb =1) [1] 0.904
