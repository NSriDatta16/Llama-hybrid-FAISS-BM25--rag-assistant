Getting parameters of the best model with crossvalidation in with SparkMLLib

I am having trouble accessing the parameters of estimators of model in SparkMLlib. More precisely my problem is: I have a logistic regression model for which I want to find the best regularization parameters ( regParam and elasticNetParam ). To do that, I use the CrossValidator which works and finds me a model better than all the other one I tried. The issue is that I do not know how to access the actual value of the parameters that were found by the cross validator. Below is the code I use to fit my cross validator: from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression lr_predictor = LogisticRegression(featuresCol='polyFeatures', labelCol='label', maxIter=10) paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \ .addGrid(lr_predictor.elasticNetParam, [0., 0.5, 1]) \ .addGrid(lr_predictor.regParam, [0.1, 0.01]) \ .build() crossval = CrossValidator(estimator=LogRegPipeline, estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid, evaluator=BinaryClassificationEvaluator(), numFolds=2) cvModel = crossval.fit(train_set) bestModel = cvModel.bestModel # How to get the best parameters fitted by cvModel
