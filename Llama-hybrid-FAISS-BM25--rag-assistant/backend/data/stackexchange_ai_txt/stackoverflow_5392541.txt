Storing UUIDs in Core Data

What is the best method for storing UUIDs (for global multi-system object identification) in Core Data? Taking into account storage size and indexing capabilities. Ideally it would be stored as binary data (in 128-bits), but are there any immediate problems with doing this? It would be more efficient size-wise storing it this way rather than as an NSString, but I just want to check that there's no performance issues with storing this as binary data. Will it still be properly indexed as binary data? Are there any disadvantages storing what is effectively fixed-width binary data in a variable width field? I'm not overly familiar with SQLite and it's storage/indexing mechanisms so wanted to reach out for some advice!
