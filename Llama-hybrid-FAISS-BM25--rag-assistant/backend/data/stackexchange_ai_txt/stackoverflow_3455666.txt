Need help with event handling syntax in VB.Net

I want to add an event in my VB.NET code. I have done VB.net programming but not well experienced in event handling. I have declared like this public WithEvents FormEventCapture As vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_Event Then i put the following code in form load event FormEventCapture = new vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_FormEventEventHandler() AddHandler FormEventCapture.FormEvent, AddressOf Me.FormEventCapture_FormEvent Is it correct? When i compile i get the following error Delegate 'vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_FormEventEventHandler' requires an 'AddressOf' expression or lambda expression as the only argument to its constructor. (BC32008) So i need to pass an argument to this constructor then i changed as follows FormEventCapture = new vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_FormEventEventHandler(AddressOf Me.FormEventCapture_FormEvent) Then i get the following error Lambda expression cannot be converted to 'vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_Event' because 'vFormAgent.__vFormAgentLib_Event' is not a delegate type. (BC36625) I am not able to figure out what is the problem. Can any one tell me what is the problem?
