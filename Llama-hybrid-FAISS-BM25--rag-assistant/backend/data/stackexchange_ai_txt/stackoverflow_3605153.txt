How Can I Handle Parameters With Spaces in Delphi?

My program accepts input file names either as command line parameters or in a drag and drop operation or in Explorer by clicking on filenames with an extension that is associated with my program. The command line and drag and drop work fine, but it is clicking on the filenames in Explorer that causes problems when the filepaths of the files clicked on have spaces in them, e.g.: c:\temp\file one.txt c:\my directory\filetwo.txt c:\my directory\file three.txt then, the ParamStr function gives me back: ParamStr(1): c:\temp\file ParamStr(2): one.txt ParamStr(3): c:\my ParamStr(4): directory\filetwo.txt ParamStr(5): c:\my ParamStr(6): directory\file ParamStr(7): three.txt How can I best reconstitute these back into the three filenames that I need?
