Some decimal numbers can not be perfectly represented in binary format. Your obj.myValue property is a decimal number. For certain decimals, it simply will not be able to store anything other than (for example) 1234.4021000000000001, which is as close as it can be with a limited number of bits. I think Domenic has the right idea with his answer. Let decimal numbers remain un-rounded in storage, and only display* them rounded off. If you absolutely must have the numbers rounded in storage, you will have to use an integer format, which you then divide by 1000 prior to display. 1234.4021 would be stored as 12344021. *note: by "display" I mean "output to text", not necessarily "show to a user"
