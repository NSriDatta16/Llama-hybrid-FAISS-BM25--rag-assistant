I kind of feel like maybe some of these answers might be missing the obvious. What is the efficiency of the algorithm you are using? Linear? Logorithmic? exponential? It seems to me, that if it's the JAVASCRIPT that's getting slower, as the document gets larger, then it's the efficiency of YOUR code that's the problem, not MS's. IE javascript is slow, but what makes you so sure that it's specifically a problem with that browser? Do other javascript engines do okay with it? Without knowing a single thing about what you're doing or how you're doing it, one way to go is to trade off memory usage for speed- Cache previous results, and other optimization strategies which you can find lying around if you read this book or that website about programming. Another thing to keep in mind is that dom interaction is really slow. If you can reorganize your code to achieve the same thing, but with fewer manipulations in the dom, that will improve performance
