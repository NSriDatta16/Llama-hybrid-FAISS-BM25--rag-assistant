Thanks to PyAudio's author's speedy response to my inquiries, I now have a nicely installed copy. His directions are posted below for anyone who has similar issues. Hi Michael, Try this: 1) Make sure your directory layout is like: ./foo/pyaudio/portaudio-v19/ ./foo/pyaudio/ 2) Build portaudio-v19 from sources, as you have done 3) cd ./foo/pyaudio/ 4) python setup.py build --static-link (See the comments at the top of setup.py for more info on --static-link) If all goes well, inside ./foo/pyaudio/build/lib.macosx-10.6-.../, you'll find the built (fat) objects comprising i386, ppc, and x86_64 binaries. You can also do a "python setup.py install" if you like. Best, Hubert
