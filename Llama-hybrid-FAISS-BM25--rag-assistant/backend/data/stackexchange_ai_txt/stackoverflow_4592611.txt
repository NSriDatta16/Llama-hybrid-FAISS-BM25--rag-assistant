Just apply the rule to all divs first: #toolbar div { float: left; background-repeat: no-repeat; margin: 2px 12px 2px 12px; } Then you need to zero the values out for the specific case: #toolbar div.olControlNavigationHistor { float: none; background-repeat: repeat; margin: 0; } Of course this assumes that the property values that specific div would have had without the first rule applied are each properties defaults (such as margin: 0 and float: none .) EDIT: However in the future when CSS3 is supported everywere, you could also just rewrite your original rule as #toolbar div:not(.olControlNavigationHistory) and it would work correctly and elegantly.
