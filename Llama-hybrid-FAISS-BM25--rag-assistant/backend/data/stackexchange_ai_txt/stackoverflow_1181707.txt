When you licence your library you still retain the copyright. The licence governs what people can and cannot do with the library. You can select from many different open source licences . Without knowing anything about how your library is intended to be used, I'm going to make the assumption that it needs to be compatible with a proprietary licence. MIT Permit anyone to freely use without restrictions. LGPL Permit anyone to freely use provided modifications are made available. I strongly encourage you to read the terms of these licences.
