On the parameter $p$ you have the prior distribution $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_0=1, \beta_0=1)$ with density function $$f_p(p) = p^0(1-p)^0 = p^{\alpha_0-1}(1-p)^{\beta_0-1},$$ for $0 where the symbol $\propto$ (pronounced 'proportional to') indicates that we have omitted the norming constant factor that makes $f_p(p)$ integrate to $1$ over $(0,1).$ Based on $n$ Bernoulli trials with $x$ Successes among them, we have the likelihood function $$f_{x|p}(x|p) \propto p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.$$ Then by Bayes' Theorem that POSTERIOR $\propto$ PRIOR $\times$ LIKELIHOOD. we have the posterior distribution with density function $$f_{p|x}(p|x) \propto p^{\alpha_0-1}(1-p)^{\beta_0-1} \times p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\\ \propto p^{\alpha_0+x-1}(1-p)^{\beta_0+n-x-1}\\ \propto p^{\alpha_n -1}(1-p)^{\beta_n - 1},$$ where $\alpha_n = \alpha_0 + x = 1+x$ and $\beta_n = \beta_0+n-x = 1+n-x.$ Because the beta prior and the binomial likelihood are conjugate (mathematically compatible), we can recognize the final term of the relationship above as the kernel (density without norming constant) of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_n, \beta_n).$ There is only one possible norming constant for this posterior beta kernel, so we can be sure we have the correct posterior distribution. If you want to supply the norming constants (with $Gamma$ functions and binomial coefficients) throughout, then you can express factorials as $Gamma$ functions to find that the integral in the denominator of the final displayed relationship of your Question simplifies to the norming constant of $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_n, \beta_n).$ Notes: (1) In Bayesian statistics one of the attractions of using a conjugate prior and likelihood is that conjugacy often makes the posterior distribution obvious. (2) Even in frequentist arguments, likelihoods are often defined only 'up to a constant multiple'. The norming constant is irrelevant if the task is to maximize the likelihood.
