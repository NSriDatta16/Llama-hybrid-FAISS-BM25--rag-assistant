Time Series Plot for floating values

I have a Dataframe which looks as shown below I am trying to make a line plot for looking at the peaks for both columns (a,b), I have gotten as far as sns.set_style("darkgrid") plt.plot(wr['a'][:100]) plt.show() but the plot looks shabby, wr.set_index(['Date_x'],inplace=True) wr['a'][:100].plot() wr['b'][:100].plot() I am looking to have something like this Any Help is Appreciated.
