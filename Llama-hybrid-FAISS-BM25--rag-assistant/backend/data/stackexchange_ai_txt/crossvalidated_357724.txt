Ideally and theoretically, you should decide on the test before seeing any data, and then report only on that test. In your situation, I would say that you should report the test that makes sense based on what you know about your data generating process. It makes no sense to report on a simple $\chi^2$ test that does not account for covariates you know are relevant. If such covariates exist and are included in the logistic regression, then that is the model you should report. Of course, this does not hold if the logistic regression was the result of "fishing for significance" by trying different models until something significant came out. But I assume you would not be asking here if you had done that. And it's a great idea to discuss that your result, while statistically significant, may not be practically meaningful.
