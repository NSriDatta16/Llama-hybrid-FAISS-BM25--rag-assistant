How to encode a class with 24,000 categories?

I'm currently working on a logistic regression model for genomics. One of the input fields I want to include as a covariate is genes . There are around 24,000 known genes. There are many features with this level of variability in computational biology and hundreds of thousands of samples are needed. If I LabelEncoder() those 24K genes and then OneHotEncoder() them ... Is 24,000 columns going to make my keras training times unreasonable for a 2.2 GHz quad-core i7 CPU? If so, is there a different approach to encoding that I can take with this? Should I somehow try to dedicate a layer of my model to this feature? Does this mean I need 24K input nodes?
