How to choose hypothesis equation for logistic regression?

For Simple Linear/Polynomial regression, we can choose hypothesis equation based on data shape, eg degree-1 for linear data shape, degree-2 for parabolic data shape etc. But how do we choose the hypothesis equation degree for logistic regression? Is it also based on data shape?
