Typed Dataset not using TypedTableBase in .NET 4

I'm migrating our DAL class library to .NET 4 (from .NET 3.5). We're using typed datasets quite often, and we often iterate over tables: foreach(var row in ds.MyTable) var tmp = row.ID; This does not work anymore, as the designer changes the dataset's code so that tables do not derive from TypedTableBase anymore, but from DataTable (and implement the non-generic IEnumerable ). That's what the diff shows. Therefore, the row is of type object at compile-time. Does anybody know if this is the usual behavior? At the moment, I'm doing it the way shown below, but I hope there's a more elegant solution: foreach(var row in ds.MyTable.Cast ()) var tmp = row.ID;
