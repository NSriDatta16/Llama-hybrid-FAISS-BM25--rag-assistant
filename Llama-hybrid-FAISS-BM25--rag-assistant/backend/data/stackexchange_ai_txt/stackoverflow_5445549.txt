You can find those images in the Android SDK directory under platforms/android-X/data/res/drawable-Ydpi where X is the version code of Android and Y is the resolution (l/m/h). Most images are in the mdpi folder. It is recommended to copy the images to your App, as the Android developers do not guarantee that all images will be there in future releases. The image you are looking for looks like expander_ic_minimized.9.png
