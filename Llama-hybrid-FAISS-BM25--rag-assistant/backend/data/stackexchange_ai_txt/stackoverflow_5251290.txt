Rspec: stub relationship find (chain)

Controller: @organization.topics.find(params[:id]) How can I stub this in my controller_spec with Rspec? ( @organization IS being set in my spec helper) I've tried: controller.stub_chain(:topics, :find).with("37") { mock_topic } Topic.stub(:find).with("37") { mock_topic } Neither of the above seem to work. Any ideas? Thanks!
