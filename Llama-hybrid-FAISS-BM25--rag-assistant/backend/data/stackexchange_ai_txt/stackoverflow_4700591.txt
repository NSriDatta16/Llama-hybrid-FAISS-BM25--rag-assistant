Just put these lines into a header file, and you should be able to include the header and call the functions from any other Objective-C or C source file. (To support C++ also, you may need to put extern "C" { ... } around them, unless you are compiling everything as C++ or Objective-C++.) #pragma once #define STATES 5 int transitionTable[STATES][STATES]; // function declarations: double randfloat (void); int chooseNextEventFromTable (int current, int table[STATES][STATES]); int chooseNextEventFromTransitionTablee (int currentState); void setTable (int value, int table[STATES][STATES]); More detail: To use these functions from another class, you'll need the following files in your project: markov.h (or whatever you decide to call it), containing the lines above. markov.c (or whatever you decide to call it), containing the other stuff from your original source file, except for the main function, which you should remove Then, your other files that use the functions should have an #include "markov.h" line, and then you should be able to call them. If you are getting linker errors about missing functions, it means that you are not compiling markov.c as part of the project, or there are some options that are causing the function names to not match properly.
