Why is PCA "a regressional model without intercept"?

As stated in How does centering the data get rid of the intercept in regression and PCA? , PCA is a regressional model without intercept. Thus, principal components inevitably come through the origin. Why is that so? The principal components are the eigenvectors, right? (Sorry I know this is probably a naive question but I don't understand much about math.)
