Assume that we are classifying an email into one of the three groups: urgent, normal and spam. We compare the predicts with the ground truth labels, then we get the following confusion matrix and the recall and precision for each class. But how can we derive a single metric that tells us how well the system is doing? There are two methods to combie these values: In macroaveraging , we compute the performance for each class, and then average over classes. In microaveraging , we collect the decisions for all classes into a single confusion matrix, and then compute precision and recall from that table. The above figure shows the confusion matrix for each class separately, and shows the computation of microaveraged and macroaveraged precision. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods? As the figure shows, a microaverage is dominated by the more frequent class (in this case spam), since the counts are pooled. The macroaverage better reflects the statistics of the smaller classes, and so is more appropriate when performance on all the classes is equally important. In your case, since 67.28% of the data fall in class label 1, I guess that class label 1 dominates the microaverage and the performance of that class is better than other classes. If all classes are equally important the macroaverage is fairer. Referenceï¼š Speech and Language Processing
