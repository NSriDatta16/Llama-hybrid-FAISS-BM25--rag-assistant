Differences between using XML and JSON are: A lot easier to find an editor supporting nice way to edit XML. I'm aware of no editors that do this for JSON, but there might be some, I hope :) Extreme portability/interoperability - not everything can read JSON natively whereas pretty much any language/framework these days has XML libraries. JSON takes up less space JSON may be faster to process, ESPECIALLY in a JavaScript app where it's native data. JSON is more human readable for programmers (this is subjective but everyone I know agrees so). Now, please notice the common thread: any of the benefits of using pure XML listed above are 100% lost immediately as soon as you store JSON as XML payload . Therefore, the gudelines are as follows: If wide interoperability is an issue and you talk to something that can't read JSON (like a DB that can read XML natively), use XML. Otherwise, I'd recommend using JSON NEVER EVER use JSON as XML payload unless you must use XML as a transport container due to existing protocol needs AND the cost of encoding and decoding JSON to/from XML is somehow prohibitively high as compared to network/storage lossage due to double encoding (I have a major trouble imagining a plausible scenario like this, but who knows...)
