Javascript by default is an incredibly powerful dynamic language. Storing complex object as variables in Javascript in not an issue. Take for example: var o = [new Object({ name: 'Test1', value: 1 }), new Object({ name: 'Test2', value: 2 })]; alert(o[0].name) // Returns Test1 as a string Adding to or removing objects from the array by Ajax calls returning JSON objects is one relatively easy way. I don't see a reason to store more then just an ID in the DOM to lookup values in Javascript, regardless of how fast a DOM engine is in a browser it more elegant to store them in Javascript.
