What type of statistical tests can I use on this dataset?

I am relatively new to R , and I cannot figure out an acceptable statistical test to determine whether the number of dead aphids in a population depends on the starting number of aphids and the time. I have four columns representing the number of dead aphids in a population of aphids in separate Petri dishes. How do I decide on a test, and what commands can I use to produce these results and a plot displaying the differences between treatments and time points? Here is the dput of the dataset for reproduction: structure(list(result_after_time_hours = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), levels = c("2", "18"), class = "factor"), four_aphids_dead = c(3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3), eight_aphids_dead = c(2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 4, 8, 5, 2, 4), sixteen_aphids_dead = c(3, 3, 5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 10, 6, 8, 11, 8, 10), thirtytwo_aphids_dead = c(8, 4, 8, 5, 6, 10, 6, 19, 18, 22, 20, 13, 15, 11)), row.names = c(NA, -14L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")) I've tried following online flowcharts for tests, but I cannot figure out how to follow them well, and the basic test do not seem to work as expected. I'd like to answer the question of whether the number of aphids in a population affects the feeding behavior of lacewing larvae based on the proportion of what's eaten, with a hypothesis of "lacewing larvae will eat a higher proportion of aphids in a larger population compared to a smaller population."
