In Addition to the UIUserInterfaceIdiom stuff, you may also want to review the iOS Application Programming Guide paying specific attention to the hardware sections. Also if you haven't seen it this document specifically talks about building universal apps. Unfortunately there's not a perfect one stop shop, but it's not terribly hard, especially if you already have an app and are ready to port. Hope that helps.
