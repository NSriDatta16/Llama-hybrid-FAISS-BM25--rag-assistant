Independence of Shocks in ARCH(1): A Doubt from Hayashiâ€™s Book

I am reading Hayashi's Econometrics book, and on pages 104 and 105 he defines the ARCH(1) model for a time series $g_i$ as: \begin{aligned} g_i &= \sqrt{h_i} \varepsilon_i, \\ h_i &= \zeta + \alpha g_{i-1}^2, \\ \varepsilon_i &\sim iid(0,1). \end{aligned} He then says that $g_i$ depends on $g_1$ and the shocks $(\varepsilon_2, \varepsilon_3, ..., \varepsilon_{i-1})$ . Due to this, he concludes that $\varepsilon_i$ is independent of $(g_1, g_2, ..., g_{i-1})$ . I don't understand this argument. How does the dependence of $g_i$ on $g_1$ and the shocks imply the independence of $\varepsilon_i$ from the previous values of $g_i$ ? Can someone please explain this to me?
