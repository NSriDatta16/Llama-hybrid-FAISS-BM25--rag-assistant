Set value in UltraGridCell not firing events

I have an UltraGrid with checkboxes in one column. I have an event that is fired when one of the checkboxes is clicked (checked or unchecked). However, I want to set the value of the checkbox through code at a later time. I figured out how to do this by finding the UltraGridCell and doing cell.value = true; or cell.value = false; , but this isn't firing the event, which I need. I also found cell.SetValue(true,something) , but I am not sure what to pass into something . The docs are no help, and I can't find an example that does what I want. Any ideas?
