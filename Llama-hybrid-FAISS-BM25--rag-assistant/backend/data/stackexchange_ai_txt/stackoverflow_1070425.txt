How to make a static URL point to different servers?

Im building multi-server support for a file upload site Im running. When images are uploaded.... they are thumbnailed and stored on the main front-end server, until cron executes (every 10 mins) and moves them to storage servers, so for the first 10 mins, they will reside, and be served off the main front-end server. When a file is uploaded, users are given embed codes... which is a thumbnail url + link to the full size, which is a html page. So it might be something like http://www.domain.com/temp_content/filename.jpg which links to http://www.domain.com/file-ID Except in 10 mins, http://www.domain.com/temp_content/filename.jpg wont exist, it will be http://server1.domain.com/thumbs/filename.jpg if the user grabbed the original code... the thumb file will be broken. I COULD move the file to its destination, without cron, but that will take time, and will lag the script until the move is complete. I also dont like to have users running commands like that, I'd rather have the server do them at regular intervals. Anything else I can?
