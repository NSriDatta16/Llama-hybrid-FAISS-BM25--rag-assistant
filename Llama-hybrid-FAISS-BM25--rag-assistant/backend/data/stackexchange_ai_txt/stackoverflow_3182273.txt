In case anyone is interested ... I was able to successfully install OpenCV, by first installing Macports and then following the steps listed under "option 1" in the Willowgarage link from above. Note there is a comment in those instructions that says something like "on Mac OS" the /usr/... path is actually /opt/... (which is why I wasn't finding the /usr/ path). And my "test" Command Line program did work, so I guess they type of "C" was ok. So now I'm off to experiment with some of the OpenCV functions, which I hope will provide me the ability to accomplish some things I haven't been able to do using CIFilters...
