Cross-fertilization of neural network/machine learning theory and R&D in physiology

Clearly, the development of neural networks has been based, at least initially, on those occurring in actual animals, human or otherwise. Conversely, how have neural-network or machine-learning models/theories informed/directed/aided R&D in physiology (that of humans or other animals) or biomedical engineering, e.g., in development of prosthetics or exoskeletons for humans or control circuitry for other organisms or the mapping of actual neural networks in the human brain? References to survey articles would be especially useful.
