There is no such thing as "straightforward" in the world of SOAP. Any example and tutorial is bound to be complex due to the overengineered nature of this beast. If you can choose your technologies, I'd recommend putting axis aside, and using Tomcat 6 + Java 6 + Metro. Metro is Sun's latest, greatest Java web services (jax-ws) stack. Coupled with JavaEE annotations, it's a relatively painless way to get a web service off the ground quickly. Sorry to not answer the question directly.
