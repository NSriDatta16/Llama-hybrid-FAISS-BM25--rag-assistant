PCA: projecting a new data matrix onto existing loadings

So, I know that at first glance this looks like it would be answered here , but I think my situation is slightly different. I'm trying to adapt this algorithm into an R script because there isn't an available package yet, and I'm running into a problem projecting a matrix onto existing loadings (rotations from prcomp function). However, the matrix I'm trying to project is considerably larger than the matrix of rotations. There aren't any errors when multiplying A (dim 578x384) by rotations (dim 92x92), but I feel like that can't be giving a good result. I've also tried the predict() function to no avail; I could really do with some advice. Is what I'm trying to do impossible, or is there a workaround?
