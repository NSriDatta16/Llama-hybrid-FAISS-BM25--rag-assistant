Do you do linear regression in logistic regression?

I just studied single & multiple linear regression 2 days ago now I'm reading about logistics regression and I want to implement it from scratch, I just want to know If my understanding about logistic regression is correct. You see I was actually quite confused about logistic regression, In my understanding in logistics regression we still use the equation of linear regression $$\hat{y} = \hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_1x_1+\cdots+\hat\beta_nx_n$$ so what I think is happening here is: first find the best-fit-line, and for that to happen we need to find the beta coefficient just like multiple linear regression after finding the $\hat\beta$ coefficients, we plug them in the sigmoid function along with our independent variables to get the prediction, $$P(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0+b_1x_1+...+b_nx_n)}}$$ and then that's it. Is that how it's done? or was that wrong? or was there some steps we need to do first or after?
