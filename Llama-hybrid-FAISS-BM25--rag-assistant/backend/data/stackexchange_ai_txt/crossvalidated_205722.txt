No, leaving out a dependent variable does not violate any independence assumption. Consider a very simple example where I'm examining the effect of height, weight, baseball batting average on points scored per basketball game. We know that height is a great predictor of basketball skills, but maybe we want to see how batting average and weight do as a predictor. There is no prohibition against dropping any number of variables in order to build a model that examines the relationship between two variables. Think of it like this: there are millions of data out there that predict things like my income, height, weight and country of birth, however, it's possible to build a highly accurate model in which you predict any of these with very minimal data or with loads of data. There could be a "valence" out there that predicts my height or country of birth perfectly! The thing to remember about modeling/prediction in general is that your goal is to make predictions better than you would by random. If you're doing that part correctly (i.e. cross validating, testing on "wild" data) then you've met the goals of the task.
