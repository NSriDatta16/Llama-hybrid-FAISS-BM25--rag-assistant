Forecasting of highly correlated time series

In time series forecasting using various models like AR,MA,ARMA, etc, we usually focus on the modeling of the data in the change of time. But when we have 2 time series that Pearson correlation coefficient show they are highly correlated, is it possible to model their dependency and forecast values of one from the other? For example, when one serie have a linear relationship with the other, it seems possible. But is there a general method for this kind of dependency analysis?
