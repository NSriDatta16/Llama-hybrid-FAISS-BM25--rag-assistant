If you are only adjusting the grades if peer review is in the opposite direction of comparison from the original grades, the only possible outcome with a large number of peer reviews is that they end up with the same grade. Are you set on doing the peer reviews by comparison, rather than grades? The problem is that such a system also will have a bias for papers whose original grades are very far apart/very close when compared. Perhaps the peer reviews could also be grades just like the normal grades. Store them separately; if a paper has enough peer grades, they can be averaged in with the original grade, but at a much lower level of effectiveness; perhaps 100:1 even. I also think you might want a higher level of precision for the grades if you are going to be doing any kind of system like this.
