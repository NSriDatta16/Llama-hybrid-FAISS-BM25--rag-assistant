Are you sure that the other applications are actually starting faster than your test case? 1-2 seconds has been the minimum startup time for applications that I've tested on the older iPhones. For example, see James Thomson's description of the startup time optimization he performed on PCalc , where he measured that it takes ~1 second to even begin the startup process in your code. Perhaps what you are seeing is the default image that most applications throw up on screen when they launch, making them look like they're starting faster. They aren't actually responsive until 1-4 seconds after the launch, but they have the appearance of a fast start.
