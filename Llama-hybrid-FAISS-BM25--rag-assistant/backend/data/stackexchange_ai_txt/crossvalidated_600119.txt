I assume by the average of the two random variables, you mean the distribution of the mean of random variables with those distributions. Let the distributions have cdf's $F$ and $G$ . Let $q$ be the $100p$ 's percentile of that distribution $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \DeclareMathOperator{\E}{\mathbb{E}} \P(\frac{X+Y}{2}\le q )=p$$ leading to \begin{align} p &= \int \P(X \le 2q-Y \mid Y=y) f_Y(y) \; dy \\ &= \int \P(X \le 2q-y) \; dy \\ &= \int F_X(2q-y) f(y) \; dy \\ &= \E_Y F_X(2q-Y) \end{align} but that equation will have an explicit solution only in special cases. But first you will need to approximate $F$ and $G$ from the quantiles you have.
