I have done it. On my UITextView I have disabled cut, copy, select, etc. option very easily. I placed a UIView at the same place where i had placed the UITextView , but on self.view and added a touchDelegate method as follows: (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *scrollTouch=[touches anyObject]; if(scrollTouch.view.tag==1) { NSLog(@"viewTouched"); if(scrollTouch.tapCount==1) [textView1 becomeFirstResponder]; else if(scrollTouch.tapCount==2) { NSLog(@"double touch"); return; } } } and it worked for me. Thank you.
