How to model a schedule in Rails?

Using Ruby on Rails 2.3.8, I'm wondering how to represent a schedule for model that handles "reminders". Examples of reminder: "Must do ABC", Remind me in 3 days "Must do DEF", Remind me in 5 weeks "Must do XYZ", Remind me on 2nd Oct 2010 at 5 pm So, the Must do... goes into a description column. But how to deal with the fact that when to remind can have different types of values? Some things I thought of: I was thinking of creating a column for each type (remind_in_days, remind_in_weeks, remind_at) -->But this feels a bit kludgy. Have a field called remind_type which will be used to determine the type of value stored in a field called remind_type_value -->If I use this approach, is there a way that I can simply say in Rails code something like Reminder.RemindValue without having to use code like if remind_type==x then x ? ? Any ideas of how I should proceed (in a manner that is possibly elegant )?
