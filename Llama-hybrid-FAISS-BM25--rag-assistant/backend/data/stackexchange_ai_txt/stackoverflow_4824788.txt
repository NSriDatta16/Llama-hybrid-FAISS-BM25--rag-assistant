Azure table with different entities in development storage?

Still searching for an answer to this question: It's my understanding that there is no requirement that there be any structural or type similarity between different entities in a table in Azure storage. But what about development storage? I recently read that this is not true as development storage requires a schema because it stores the data using SQL Server Express. Can someone confirm this. Also if this is the case then how could I use Dev storage to model different entities within a table in production? Thanks in advance
