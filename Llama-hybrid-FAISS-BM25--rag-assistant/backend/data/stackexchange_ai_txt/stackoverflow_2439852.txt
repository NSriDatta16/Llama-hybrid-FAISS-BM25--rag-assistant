.NET Embedded Manifest Crashes XP

I am embedding a manifest in a .NET exe so that it can request elevated permissions in Vista and Windows 7. The manifest that I am using is as follows: It works as expected in Vista and Windows 7 but crashes XP with the standard "... has encountered a problem and needs to close..." error. If I don't embed any manifest then it works as expected but will obviously not have the required permissions in Vista and Windows 7. What is a standard way of producing an exe that will function with the correct permissions in XP and Vista / Windows 7? Thanks, Alan
