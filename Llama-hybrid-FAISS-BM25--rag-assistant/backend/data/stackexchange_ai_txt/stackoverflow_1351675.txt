Change control's parent at runtime VB.NET

I'm making a custom control that can be dragged around and it is semi transparent. I need it so that while it is moving (the mousemove event) that if it intersects a control that its parent becomes that control. I tried to have it iterate through all the controls and if control.bounds.intersectswith me.clientrectangle then me.parent = control type thing, but it did not work. Any help would be appreciated thanks.
