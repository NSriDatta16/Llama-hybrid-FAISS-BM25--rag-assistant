lmer logit regression - unexpected coefficients

I have a simulated dataset of N observations over NGroup individuals with a covariate x1 and a binary response y . The data is generated from $y_{i,j[i]} = \beta_{0,j[i]} + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i,\ i\in\{1,\ldots,N\},\ j[i]\in\{1,\ldots,J\}$ where $J$ is the number of groups and $N$ is the population size. This is the data set: set.seed(1991) N $y = 1*(sigmoid(beta1 * dt$ x1 + dt $eps + ifelse(dt$ group==1, beta01, beta02)) > 0.5) To fit a logistic regression with mixed effects I am using glmm There is a large discrepancy between the true parameters beta1 , beta01,beta02 and the estimated parameters. What am I doing wrong? Thanks for the help
