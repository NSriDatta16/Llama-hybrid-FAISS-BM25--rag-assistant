jQuery draggable/droppable: access to original element

I'm dragging elements from one unordered list to another: $('ul#drag li').draggable({ helper: 'clone' }); $('ul#drop').droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { ui.draggable.sourceElement.css(... ...); } }); I want to mark already dragged elements in source list (but still allow dragging them), how do I access them through jQuery chain? I guess I can set id attribute on the dragged element, and when dropping, the cloned element would have the same id , which I can use in finding the original, but I'm sure there's a nicer solution.
