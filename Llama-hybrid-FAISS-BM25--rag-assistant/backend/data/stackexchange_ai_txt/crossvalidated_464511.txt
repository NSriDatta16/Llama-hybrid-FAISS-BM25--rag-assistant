Random Forests use multiple kinds of randomization. In each split, they only consider a small subset of possible features. If you have only one feature, then this will of course always be used. Randomization in this sense thus doesn't have an impact, as you write. However, Random Forests also bootstrap: each decision tree is grown on a bootstrapped resample of the original data. This kind of randomization of course applies to your situation. The advantage of the bootstrap is that each tree will split on the predictor at different values. The Random Forest can therefore model nonlinearities in the feature-response relationship (assuming enough data).
