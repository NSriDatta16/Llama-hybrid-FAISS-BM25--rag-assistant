Spread of species and site scores in R (vegan) DCA ordination

I have performed a Detrended Correspondence Analysis on social survey answers, aiming to see the spread of answers to 25 interview questions and how they related to the three farmer types (n =45) we interviewed. This has been done using 'decorana' in vegan, with the following output: I'm unsure as to why the sites (which are acting as the sites if this were environmental data, shown as the colored symbols) are on such a different axis than the survey questions (which are acting as the species if this were environmental data), and why they aren't in the middle of the survey questions. Is this an issue, or is this standard for a DCA with so few (45) sites and large variation? All questions are either set as dummy variables (Married = 0, 1; Single = 0, 1) or are continuous (Age is a range between 18-81 etc). Any help would be hugely appreciated!!
