TSQL Prefixing String Literal on Insert - Any Value to This, or Redundant?

I just inherited a project that has code similar to the following (rather simple) example: DECLARE @Demo TABLE ( Quantity INT, Symbol NVARCHAR(10) ) INSERT INTO @Demo (Quantity, Symbol) SELECT 127, N'IBM' My interest is with the N before the string literal. I understand that the prefix N is to specify encoding (in this case, Unicode). But since the select is just for inserting into a field that is clearly already Unicode, wouldn't this value be automatically upcast? I've run the code without the N and it appears to work, but am I missing something that the previous programmer intended? Or was the N an oversight on his/her part? I expect behavior similar to when I pass an int to a decimal field (auto-upcast). Can I get rid of those N s?
