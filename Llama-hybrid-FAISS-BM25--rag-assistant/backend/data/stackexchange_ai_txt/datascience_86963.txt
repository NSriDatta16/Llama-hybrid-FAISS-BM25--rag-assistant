Implication of Central Limit theorem and its application in machine Learning

According to central limit theorem, irrespective of the distribution of the original/population dataset, the sampling distribution will follow normal distribution. My Question is if the means of n samples of the population data follow normal distribution, what is this helping us in ? I tried to find examples in the context of Ml but found no good example. It would be of great help if you could help me understand the significance of CLT ( basically application of knowing that sampling distribution will have bell curve) in the context of ML with an example.
