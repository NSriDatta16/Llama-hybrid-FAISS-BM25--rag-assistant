Interpreting Regression Diagnostic Plots

I'm sorry if this is a broad question but can someone explain to me how to interpret these regression diagnostic plots? I understand the Normal Q-Q show's how normal the spread of the data is, but the other three I am confused by. For the Residuals vs Leverage, what does it mean for a point to be outside of the bounds? What does it mean if the red lines are parabolic and curved like in the first two? Why do we care about residuals, and what do they tell us? I've searched the web multiple times for some guide to interpret these and I can't get any straight forward answers. Any help is appreciated, thank you.
