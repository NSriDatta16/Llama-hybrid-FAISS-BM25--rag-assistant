Since you haven't described the exact fields which are privacy sensitive (which will be removed before you're allowed to "take home" the data), I'm assuming these would be fields such as names, addresses, phone nos, income or expenditure details, employers, etc. If you'd prefer to fit a regression on interesting fields, then I would suggest storing the relative importance of independent variables is more useful than storing the coefficients as-is. I suggest you could try these steps to generate additional "features" from this data: Use last names to find concentration of demographic groups within the population, although keeping in mind it doesn't lead to your work being used for racial profiling (we all have to be sensitive about these things when working on data). Use addresses to get the approximate geospatial location of each individual, and generate features indicating concentration of these. You could first perform suitable clustering to get members and center points of clusters, and then round off the geospatial coordinates so that they are at a more coarse level sufficient to only identify an individual's city/town/county and not their exact home location. If location is an important consideration, the other details such as climate of the location and topography may also be relevant details to include. If income/expenditure is part of the dataset, then generate parameters for them such as identifying most suitable probability distribution an income fits, then mapping each records to get how many std. dev. it is away form mean (if normally distributed), etc. Also cluster it and add cluster centers and distance to center. If employers are listed, then determine the nature of employer such as govt. sector, industry type, size, geographic location. All these details about a firm are available publicly. If dates are part of the dataset, then you could identify the season and part of financial year, etc. from the date and retain those as new features. If the data is time series, then you could determine auto-correlation, or, perform some causality tests based on your hypothesis. You can think along these lines and check with the owners of the data to find out which features they would permit you to take away.
