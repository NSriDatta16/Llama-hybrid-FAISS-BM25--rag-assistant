Is an off diagonal ROC curve not always better than random?

I'm trying to better understand the ROC when used for machine learning model classification and was looking at this explaining curve, explaining what is better and worse. However, I am thinking, contrary what is shown on the curve, that perhaps worse is really whatever is closer to the random distribution. Because whatever is not random can always be functionally inverted. I.e. A curve well under the diagonal would actually be better than the diagonal? Is an off (below) diagonal ROC curve not always better than random? (Please, note that none of the previous answers actually address this question.) Related topics: ROC curve under diagonal?
