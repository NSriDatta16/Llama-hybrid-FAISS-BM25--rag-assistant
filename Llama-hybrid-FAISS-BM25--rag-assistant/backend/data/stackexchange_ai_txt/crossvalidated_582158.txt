Your description of "ensemble" sounds like what is usually referred to as "mixture of experts", which is a special type of ensemble. In a mixture of experts , one applies one of a collection of models depending on some properties of the input. But the notion of "ensembles of models" includes many more techniques. E.g., a simple standard ensemble in regression would be to take the average of the output of all the member models of an ensemble. More complex ensembles use boosting methods like e.g. the gradient boosting machines . For an overview of possible ensemble techniques, see here .
