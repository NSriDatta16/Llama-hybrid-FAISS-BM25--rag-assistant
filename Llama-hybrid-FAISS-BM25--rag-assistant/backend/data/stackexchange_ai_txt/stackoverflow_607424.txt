I personally prefer a declarative approach (i.e. the location-based web.config approach). This makes it easier to make changes when necessary without requiring redeployment of code. Under no circumstances do I recommend calling User.IsInRole() with a static string as you do in your example; use the web.config declarative approach if your auth doesn't change. Going the route you suggest in your last paragraph is perfectly fine, but I would only recommend it for situations where your auth information is likely to change frequently, i.e. for CMS applications or similar ilk. In short, I don't think there's a "best practice" on the subject; it really depends on the application.
