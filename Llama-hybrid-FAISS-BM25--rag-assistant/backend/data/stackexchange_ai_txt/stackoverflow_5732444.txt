mySQL Database on a 'server' (For beginner)

I'm trying to create a database on a server at work. IT has given me permission to do so, but I really have no idea what I'm doing (doesn't that just scream confidence...). To give a bit of background information: 1) On the 'server', it is basically a shared drive at work. They have given me 'server space', which is basically a file folder that I can use and give access to select users. 2) Only a few people would use this thing, and I only really need a basic basic database. I've worked with mySQL databases before a bit, but only as (localhost). This server will simply have one table (wooo!) and will eventually, hopefully, be part of a C# program I'm creating to interact with it.. 3) I have MySQL Workbench, if that makes things easier. Basically what I'm wondering, is how do I set up a database on a server? Is it significantly different than creating one locally? Is it just a file I have to drag into this folder I'm given? I have a feeling I have to install something on the server, but I dont' know how / what... Any help, tips etc is much appreciated! Cheers
