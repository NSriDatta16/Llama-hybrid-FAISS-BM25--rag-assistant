It depends on what you'd like to find, the properties of methods A and B, and what mechanisms you suspect might be in play for each method. If your intent is to compare methods A and B directly, I suggest comparing times from the first execution of method A with times from the first execution of method B. Other analyses using other subsets of your data will be appropriate for other purposes. With no limits given to participants on how many trials to undertake, individual-level variations will govern that number. Averaging times for method B may introduce some error formerly in your error term into the measure itself, regardless of effects on variance. From my reading of your question it sounds like a major issue might be practice-- people may become better (presumably represented in data by shorter task times) at either method as they continue to use it. If so, the varying numbers of trials could be a big issue. The comparison is no longer between A and B, all else being equal, but between less-practiced A and variably practiced B (where B is nearly always practiced more than A, perhaps substantially so). Other questions certainly exist, and different stratification and data schemes will probably suggest different approaches.
