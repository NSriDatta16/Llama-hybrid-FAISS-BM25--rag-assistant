Is it just about Word2Vec or NLP in general? About Word2Vec, there is this paper that might be interesting: Relevant Word Order Vectorization for Improved Natural Language Processing in Electronic Healthcare Records https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.02627.pdf Then, other ones could answer your question, but not directly. Maybe they could give some interesting clues: Towards Structure-aware Paraphrase Identification with Phrase Alignment Using Sentence Encoders https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05302.pdf Tag-Aware Document Representation for Research Paper Recommendation https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03660.pdf Please let me know if it helps, I may have other interesting papers.
