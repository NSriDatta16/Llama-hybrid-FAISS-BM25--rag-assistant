For paragraphs, try putting your text inside the {} so that you have \paragraph{ Para11............. } But normally I think you can just put two lines between each paragraph and not bother with \paragraph{}. Otherwise, you can change the parskip value. Wikibooks shows how but I'm not allowed to post a 2nd link. It's in the Document Structure part of the Latex wikibook. You can use the geometry package to specify your margins: \usepackage{geometry} \geometry{top=3cm, left=2cm, right=2cm, bottom=3cm} Documentation
