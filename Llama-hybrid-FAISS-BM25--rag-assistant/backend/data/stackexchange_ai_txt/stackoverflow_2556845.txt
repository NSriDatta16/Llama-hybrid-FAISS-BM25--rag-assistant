I reached a satisfactory solution. It is along the lines of what you suggested and what I had in mind initially but it took me a while to figure out the software and GIS concepts, I am a GIS newbie. If someone bumps into something similar again here's my setup: PostGIS for PostgreSQL, maps from Natural Earth , GIS editing software qGis and OpenJUmp , routing algorithms pgRouting . The Natural Earth maps needed some processing to be useful, I joined the marine polys and the rivers to be able to get some accurate paths to the most inland points. Then I used the 1 degree graticules to get paths from one continent to another (I need to find a more elegant solution than this because some paths look like chess cubes). All these operations can be done from command line by using PostGIS, I found it easier to use the desktop software (next, next). An alternative to Natural Earth maps might be the OpenStreetMap but the planet.osm dump is aroung 200Gb and that discouraged me. I think this setup also solves the distance accuracy problem, PostGIS takes into account the Earth's actual form and distances should be pretty accurate. I still need to do some testing and fine tunings but I can say it can calculate and draw a route from any 2 points on the world's coastlines (no small isolated islands yet) and display the routing points names (channels, seas, rivers, oceans).
