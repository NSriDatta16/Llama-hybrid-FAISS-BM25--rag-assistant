What happens when there is a request for memory block which is not a power of 2?

Suppose we do a malloc request for memory block of size n where 2 ^k !=n for k>0. Malloc returns us space for that requestted memory block but how is the remainig buffer handled from the page. I read Pages are generally blocks of memory which are powers of two. Wiki states the following: Like any method of memory allocation, the heap will become fragmented; that is, there will be sections of used and unused memory in the allocated space on the heap. A good allocator will attempt to find an unused area of already allocated memory to use before resorting to expanding the heap. So my question is how is this tracked? EDIT: How is the unused memory tracked when using malloc ?
