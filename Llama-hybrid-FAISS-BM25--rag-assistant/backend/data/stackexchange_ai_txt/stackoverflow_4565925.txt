Yes, doesn't work, the Text property gets the label value after this event runs. Which is why e.Cancel works. So the Text value you assigned will be overwritten again by code that runs after raising this event. Code inside of the native Windows control. There is no AfterAfterLabelEdit event and you cannot alter e.Label in the event handler, you need a trick. Change the Text property after the event stopped running. Elegantly done by using Control.BeginInvoke(). Like this: private void treeView1_AfterLabelEdit(object sender, NodeLabelEditEventArgs e) { this.BeginInvoke((MethodInvoker)delegate { e.Node.Text = "S: " + e.Node.Text; }); }
