Generate sets of values with high correlation coefficient

Apology if this is too simple. I couldn't get the more advanced r-help group to respond. I am planning to characterize workloads by measuring the correlation coefficient of two sets of real values but before that I wish to generate two sets of sample values that have a high coefficient and a low coefficient. I want to plot both in the same graph so that I can see the highly correlated values' together(peaks and troughs). I use R and know about rseek. If there is any particular R book that could help my capcaity planning efforts I will buy it. Generate a random variable with a defined correlation to an existing variable is a tad too advanced for me at this time. Note : The two sets of values that I am about to plot are related because I am plotting CPU usage and a througput number. So if the no: of bytes increases the CPU usage may increase. Both are postitive values. So if the correlation is high both will either increase together or decrease together. Thanks.
