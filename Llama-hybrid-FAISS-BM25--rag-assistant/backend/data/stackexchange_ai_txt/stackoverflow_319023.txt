Too much parameter is a "Code Smell". You can divide into multiple methods or use class to regroup variable that have something in common. To put a number for the "Too much" is something very subjective and depend of your organization and the language you use, A rule of thumb is that if you can't read the signature of your method and have an idea of what is it doing than you might have too much information. Personnaly, I try not to go over 5 parameters.
