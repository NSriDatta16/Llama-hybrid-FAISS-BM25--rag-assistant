Collecting Files From Many Machines?

I have many machines (20+) connected in a network. each machine accesses a central database, queries it, processes the information queried, and then writes the results to files on its local hard drive. Following the processing, I'd like to be able to 'grab' all these files (from all the remote machines) back to the main machine for storage. I thought of three possible ways to do so: (1) rsync to each remote machine from the main machine, and 'ask' for the files (2) rsync from every remote machine to the main machine, and 'send' the files (3) create a NFS share on each remote machine, to which the main machine can access and read the files (no 'rsync' is needed in such a case) Is one of the ways better than others? are there better ways I am not aware of? All machines use Ubuntu 10.04LTS. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
