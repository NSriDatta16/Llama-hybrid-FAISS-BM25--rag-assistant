Technically speaking, you can't store the information in LDAP since it is a protocol, not a storage mechanism. However, there is no reason (that I know of) that you couldn't store the information in Active Directory or other directory services type engine, and retrieve them with a query from the application. You would just need to come up with some organizational scheme and I would suggest some common code in a library or something that allows you to access the information. I'm not saying that storing it in Active Directory is the best option, but I believe you should be able to do it without a problem.
