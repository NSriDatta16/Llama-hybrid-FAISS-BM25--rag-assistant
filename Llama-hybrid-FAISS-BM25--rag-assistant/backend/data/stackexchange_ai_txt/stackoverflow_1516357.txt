I doubt Excel will be able to deal with 1.5mil elements/rows. When you say to visualise data in grids - how will your customer make changes? Manually or is there some automation behind it? I would strongly encourage automation (since you know about only 2 types of changes at the moment). Maybe even a simple standalone "converter" application - don't make part of the main program - it will be too tempting for them in the future to manually edit data straight in the DB tables.
