I can think of a slightly different way how to organize your classes. The part you want the client to know about (the class "customer") contains all seeable properties. Internally in your lib you use wrapper classes that include the customer entity. So your librabry works with a full set of methods, using the wrapper classes that include the customer class but have more methods, and the client passes the costumer class to your lib which wraps it before continueing.
