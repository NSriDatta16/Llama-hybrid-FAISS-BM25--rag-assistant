You are presumably trying to fit a slope and a trend for each city. You have six cities, so that's six slopes and six trends. But you have attempted to fit a linear model with 13 coefficients, so obviously one of the coefficients must be redundant. The redundancy is not caused by removing the intercept but rather by trying to force R to estimate 6 interactions terms with your six one-hot coded dummy variables when there are actually only 5 degrees of freedom available for interaction. Your problem would be easier if you created a factor indicating the city (lets call it City ) instead of doing your own coding of dummy variables. The model you presumably want is: m1 which will estimate a separate intercept and slope for each city. An added advantage of this model is that the coefficients for the different cities are statistically independent, so forming confidence intervals for the slopes or for pairwise comparisons between them is easy. Note the use of : instead of * , which tells R to include only the simple nested interaction without trying to expand out a main effect for ano , which is what has caused all your problems. I can already tell from the model summary posted in your question what the trend will be for each city. The trend will be positive (upward) for cities 5 and 6, there's no trend for city 3, and the trend is negative (downward) for cities 1, 2 and 4. The slope for city 6 is 0.06878 (P = 0.029). The slope for city 5 is 0.06878 + 0.01989 = 0.08867, which will presumably also be statistically significant. The slope for city 4 is 0.06878 - 0.14021 = -0.07143, which will almost certainly be statistically significant in the opposite direction (you need to fit my model to get the exact p-value). The trends for cities 4 and 6 are significantly different (P = 0.00139), so pooling them would be questionable. It appears that your cities fall into three groups. If I were you, I would examine the characteristics of the cities, especially their geographical location, to understand why the trends might appear different. The easiest way to estimate an overall trend averaged across all cities is to fit the simpler model m1 This model allows a different baseline for each city but assumes a common trend. Almost certainly, the overall trend will not be significant because the conflicting results for the individual cities will cancel out. Concluding no trend may be scientifically questionable however given the significant trends for individual cities.
