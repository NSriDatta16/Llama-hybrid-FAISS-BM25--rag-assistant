CSS3 easing Mobile Safari

How do I recreate the easing/friction for touch events in Mobile Safari? For example, if I have a scroller and drag the contents it will bounce back when you go past the top or past the bottom? I tried messing with the cubic-bezier easing function but couldn't emulate the friction in Mobile Safari on an iPhone/iPod. I want to make the HTML page as similar to an app as possible. Thanks!
