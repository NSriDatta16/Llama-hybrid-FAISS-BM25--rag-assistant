I dragged out an old Delphi program that counted the number of solutions for any given board size, did a quick modification to make it stop after one hit and I'm seeing an odd pattern in the data: The first board that took over 1 second to solve was n = 20. 21 solved in 62 milliseconds, though. (Note: This is based off Now, not any high precision system.) 22 took 10 seconds, not to be repeated until 28. I don't know how good the optimization is as this was originally a highly optimized routine from back when the rules of optimization were very different. I did do one thing very different than most implementations, though--it has no board. Rather, I'm tracking which columns and diagonals are attacked and adding one queen per row. This means 3 array lookups per cell tested and no multiplication at all. (As I said, from when the rules were very different.) Now for some real insanity: 29 took 9 seconds. 30 took almost 6 minutes!
