"Your teaching score depends on how well your students did compared to a prediction made based on What they knew beforehand, as measured by a pretest, How well we think the students can learn based on what we know about them individually (their "characteristics"), And how well students do on average in your district, school, and classroom (if there are other teachers in your classroom). "In other words, we are evaluating you based on the amount of learning that was measured, after factoring in the preparation and characteristics of your students and the typical performances of all students in settings like yours with the resources that were available to you. "In this way your score reflects what you contributed to the student performances, insofar as we can determine that. Of course we cannot know everything: we know you had unique and special students and that the situation you faced could never be duplicated. Therefore we know this score is only an estimate that imperfectly reflects how well you taught, but it is a fairer and more accurate estimate than one based solely on post testing or on raw test gains made by your class."
