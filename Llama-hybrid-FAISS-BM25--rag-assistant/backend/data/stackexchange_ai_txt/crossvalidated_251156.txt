Logistic regression for data from Poisson distributions

From some machine learning notes talking about some discriminative classification methods, in particular logistic regression, where y is the class label (0 or 1) and x is the data, it is said that: if $x|y = 0 \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(λ_0)$, and $x|y = 1 \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(λ_1)$, then $p(y|x)$ will be logistic. Why is this true?
