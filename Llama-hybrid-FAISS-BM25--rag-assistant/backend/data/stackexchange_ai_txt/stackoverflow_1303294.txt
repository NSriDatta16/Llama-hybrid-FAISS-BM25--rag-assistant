how to find selected elements with Jquery UI selectable

I am looking for info on the event and ui objects the jQuery selectable events: "selecting", and "start" take as parameters. I cannot find this in the documentation and looping through the properties is no help. $('#content_td_account').selectable({ filter: 'li:not(".non_draggable")', selecting: function(event, ui) { } }); Specifically I want to find what elements are being selected and check them to see if their parent elements are the same or not. I assumed this would be in the ui object some where.
