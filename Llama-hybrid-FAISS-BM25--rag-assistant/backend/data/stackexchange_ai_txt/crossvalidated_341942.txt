To decide if you need to report one, two, or all three models, you should run yet one more model. In this new model, include a new dummy variable for the country. Include the interaction terms with the dummy variable. If any of the interaction terms with the dummy variable or the main effect for the dummy variable is statistically significant, then this indicates that you have different models for each group. In this case, you can simply report the two separate models. If they are n.s., then you are justified in collapsing the two countries into one model. Note, you can also run an omnibus model comparison test and assess if there is anything gained by adding any of the dummy variable and interactions. As for APA format, the best strategy is to Google the title of a common APA journal (say Journal of Educational Psychology) and "logistic regression". Then you can scan a few articles to see how those authors reported their results.
