This is because the exception is un-handled and Visual Studio can not move past that line without it being handled in some manner. Simply put, it is by design. One thing that you can do is drag and drop the execution point (yellow line/arrow) to a previous point in your code and modify the in memory values (using the Visual Studio watch windows) so that they do not cause an exception. Then start stepping through the code again 1 . It is a better idea though to stop execution and fix the problem that is causing the exception, or properly handle the exception if the throw is not desired. 1 This can have unintended consequences since you are essentially re-executing some code (not rewinding the execution).
