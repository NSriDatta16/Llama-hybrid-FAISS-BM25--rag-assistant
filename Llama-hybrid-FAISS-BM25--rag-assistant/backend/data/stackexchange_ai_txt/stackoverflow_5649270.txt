How to write conditions in loop bodies?

This is probably a bit subjective, but I'm in fact looking for answers that contain some reasoning. I've met the following two programming styles for conditions in loop bodies. This: for (int i = 0; i And this: for (int i = 0; i I've usually used the first style, because it keeps indentation levels sane, especially when there's more than one condition. But I began to wonder if the second isn't actually cleaner. Do you have a preferred style and can you explain why? Update: Here's a more realistic example. Imagine I'm reading a file like this "First name: Last name", e.g.: John;Doe Joe;Bloggs This is how I read each line into a name object, ignoring empty lines (which may occur): while (line = file.readLine()) { if (line.isEmpty()) continue; String[] columns = line.split(";"); names.add(new Name(columns[0], columns[1])); }
