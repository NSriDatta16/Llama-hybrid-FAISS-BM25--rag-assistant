Gwt Graphics and ClickHandler

I am using gwt graphics and gwt dnd for a program. I have a button which when clicked creates a circle at specified position on the panel and the circle is draggable. For dragging i have used gwt-dnd. I have also added a click handler to the circle which when click should print "ERD Circle". Here is the code layout: Button b = new Button("Circle"); b.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){ @Override public void onClick(ClickEvent event) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub Circle c = new Circle(20, 15, 10); d.add(c); c.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){ @Override public void onClick(ClickEvent event) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub System.out.println("ERD Circle"); } }); dragController.makeDraggable(d); boundaryPanel.add(d, 200, 200 ); } }); This button is then added to an absolutepanel which in turn is added to the rootpanel. Problem that i am facing is click handler does not work when it is made draggable. If i remove dragController.makeDraggable(d); click handler works perfectly fine. Question: Am i doing anything wrong here? If the code is correct, then is there anything else that i need to add to get both click handler and draggable working? Any suggestions will be of great help. Thank you.
