is it possible to add a reference to other browsers in vb.net

The web browser in vb.net is using IE or maybe its not even a web browser. Maybe its the primitive browser in windows that came before IE. Is it possible to change the browser that is used by the vb.net web browser(dragged from the toolbox)? Maybe through the add reference?
