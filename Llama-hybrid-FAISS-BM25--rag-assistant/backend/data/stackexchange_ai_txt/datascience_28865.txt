I am working on sales forecasting problem.I am able to provide data about which items got sold and not sold to the algorithm. How to provide algorithm information about items that are not present in the store.Is there any way we could encode this information in data or any other algorithms accepts this kind of information .Currently, I am using Neural Networks and Random Forest to forecast Sales.
