Checkbox in Datagrid header ClientID (JQuery)

Within a masterpage I have a standard DataGrid: Have the following jQuery that makes the header checkbox select all: $(document).ready(function() { $("#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_dgMyGrid_ctl01_cbSelectAll").click(function() { $("# :checkbox").each(function(i) { this.checked = $("#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_dgMyGrid_ctl01_cbSelectAll").is(":checked") }); }); }); this works, but it's a bit ugly - I cant get the client ID for the header checkbox with (as I have done for the datagrid) Possibly because the javascript is rendered before that control. Is there a more elegant way for me to get the clientID of my checkbox out of the datagrid? I think it Would be better if I didnt hardcode the clientID like this. Apologies if the answer to this is obvious, it's my first day trying jQuery! :)
