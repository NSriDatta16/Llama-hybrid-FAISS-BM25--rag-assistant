The trick is making a instance of Underlying aware of the related instances of Thing. Below are a couple approaches you could leverate. Option #1 - Make the Relationship Bidirectional The easiest thing to do would be to make the relationship bidirectional. Then you could leverage the @XmlInverseReference extension in EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) . Note: I'm the MOXy tech lead: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/jpa-entities-to-xml-bidirectional.html Option #2 - Use an XmlAdapter You could create an adapted version of Underlying. When building the adapted Underlying object the XmlAdapter could query the instances of Thing to populate the things property: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/xmladapter-jaxbs-secret-weapon.html
