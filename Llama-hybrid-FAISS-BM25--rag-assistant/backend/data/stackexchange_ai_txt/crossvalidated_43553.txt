If I understand you correctly, you want to use Variable1 := var1_0-20cm + var1_20-50cm + var1_50-100cm Variable2 := var2_0-20cm + var2_20-50cm + var2_50-100cm (i.e. "independent of depth"; depending on how your data was generated you might want to use the mean or a weighted average instead of the sum. e.g. 0.20 times the first, 0.30 the second and 0.50 the third) instead of the full data space? What exactly is the problem with doing this? A key benefit is that this way you can control what happens quite well. Then in the end you can e.g. use PCA on these non-divided variables. You can however try to use the PCA result to project the original data, too - do the same mapping for the "divided" attributes that you got by PCA for the non-divided variables.
