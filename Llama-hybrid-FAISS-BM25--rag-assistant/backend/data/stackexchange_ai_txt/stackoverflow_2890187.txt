If there is a performance difference, it's negligible. Don't worry about these sorts of micro-optimizations unless you know that passing by reference is causing a performance hit (except I can't imagine a situation where that is true). On a side note, people generally advise against passing arguments by reference because it encourages bad design, much like using global variables does. I'm not sure what you meant by the last part, though. PHP passes arguments by value by default.
