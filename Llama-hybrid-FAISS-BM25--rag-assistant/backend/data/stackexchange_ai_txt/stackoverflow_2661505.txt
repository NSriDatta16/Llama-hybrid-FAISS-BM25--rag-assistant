Is there a free (LGPL compatible) Grid plugin for jQuery that has similiar capabilities to the Ext-JS Grid?

One of the most appealing features of Ext-JS is the Grid control in my opinion. I was searching for something free that does something close and have set my hopes on jQuery. I haven't found a jQuery (or other LGPL compatible) Table / Grid plugin that allows to: Reorder columns by dragging Resize columns by dragging Add or Remove columns on the fly Have a default good looking UI (subjective, but Ext-JS look I think is a concensus) In addition to the rest most grid controls have (Sort, Paging etc) Is there a free (LGPL) jQuery plugin that does the above?
