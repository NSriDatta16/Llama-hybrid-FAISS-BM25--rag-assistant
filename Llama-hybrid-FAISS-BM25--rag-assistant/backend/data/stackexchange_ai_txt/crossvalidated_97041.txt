GEE in my mind is most useful when we are not using Bayesian modeling and when a full likelihood solution is not available. Also, GEE may require larger sample sizes in order to be sufficiently accurate, and it is very non-robust to non-randomly missing longitudinal data. GEE assumes missing completely at random whereas likelihood methods (mixed effect models or generalized least squares, for example) assume only missing at random.
