Secretly adding (extra) HTTP GET Variables to a swf file through PHP

I'm trying to build a workaround for embedding my (downloaded) flash videoplayer. (it's the JWplayer...) At the moment, when somebody wants to embed the videoplayer they have to include the swf with all the added flashvars (ex: www.site.be/core/swf/player.swf?streamer=url&file=file.mp4&image=file.jpg&plugin=analytics...). That's messy, and it feels a bit risky... people who know what they are doing can also just remove the plugin and other added data, resolving in me not being able to track pageviews etc. My workaround is like this: $data = file_get_contents('URL'); header("content-type: application/x-shockwave-flash"); echo $data; Turns out that, when I use file_get_contents on a regular test file, info.php, that responds through a $_GET['var'], the above stated code works, but when I use it on the flashplayer, it doesn't... As in: the flash file does not seem to be accepting (or responding to) the added header variables... Can somebody tell me why this is? Is this a 'flash' related problem or a 'Php' related problem? Or are there suggestions on how to handle my "flash-embed-with-to-much-junk"-problem in a different way? (thanks)
