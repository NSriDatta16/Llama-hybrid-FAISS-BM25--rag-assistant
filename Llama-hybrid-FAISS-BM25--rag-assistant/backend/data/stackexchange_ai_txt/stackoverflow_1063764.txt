You can always use the ternary operator to switch '=' for 'IS': ("=","IS")[var is None] Would return "IS" if var is None and "=" otherwise. It's not very elegant to do this in one line though, but just for demonstrating: query = "SELECT * FROM testTable WHERE a %s %s" % ( ("=","IS")[a is None], str(a) )
