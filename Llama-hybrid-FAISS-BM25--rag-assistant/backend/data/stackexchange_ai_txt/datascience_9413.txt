How to analyse move kindness in python (Logistic regression, neural network, etc.)?

With a team of researchers we were given the assignment to make a scale for the move kindness (how inviting a room or place is for exercise--e.g., a gym). In order to get objective results we were asked to make a measurement device. This device receives input through various sensors and maybe some true/false questions, and then analyze it with training information in mind. After the analysis it returns a number from, say: 1 to 10, indicating the move kindness. So a gym gets, for example an eight and a classroom a three. The problem with this is, that move kindness is very subjective, so we have conducted some surveys. For example one of the criteria is the temperature of the room/place. While the survey was being conducted we measured the temperature: From a scale from 1 to 10, what is your opinion about the temperature? And then we measured the temperature. We have put all these information into some spreadsheets: Rating (Move Kindness): 8 Temperature: 18 degrees Celsius At the end of this survey we asked them to give the move kindness a rating. So we have this, for example: Temperature: 8, 18 Light: 7, 300 Humidity: 8, 50 .... Rating (Move Kindness): 8 So my question is, what's the best way to analyse these data for a reliable measurement device using python? We were thinking of using neural networks, because they can be trained, but logistic regression or some other machine learning algorithm is also an option. Can anyone give me some direction on this?
