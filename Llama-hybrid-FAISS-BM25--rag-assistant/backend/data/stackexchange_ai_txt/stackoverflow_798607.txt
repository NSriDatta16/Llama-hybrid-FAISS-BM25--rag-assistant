It seems like whenever you have to hit the Excel object model, you're going to take a performance hit. I agree with the previous poster, that if you want to speed up performance, you'll need to read the Excel files directly. As a side note, since Excel 2007 files (*.xlsm, *.xltm) are essentially *.zip files, you would need to find and access the vbaProject.bin file directly. A quick look points to the path as (I changed the extension so I could browse the file): ..\Book1.zip\xl\vbaProject.bin Obviously you could dig through that bin file manually and find particular references (as suggested by the previous poster), but if you're looking to loop through all of the references in a project, you'll need to use the API calls IStream/IStorage. There's a great article about reverse engineering the Office BIN files here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/office2007bin.aspx . To access references in vbaProject.bin, look for the section titled "Reading or updating vbaProject.bin parts". There is also a sample C# code project that demonstrates how to read an OLE container. I just took a peak at the code sample, so I can't attest to it's effectiveness, but it certainly seems in order. Hope that helps!
