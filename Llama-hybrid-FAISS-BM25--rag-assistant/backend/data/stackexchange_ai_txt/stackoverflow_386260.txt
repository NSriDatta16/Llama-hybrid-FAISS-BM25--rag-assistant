The question is -- what do your customers know about Oracle? Nothing? You should probably rethink this position. Oracle is very large and complex. If you assume your customers know nothing, you'll then start providing tutorials and help that's inappropriate. Minimally Competent? If they're competent, they know enough to run imp by themselves. Also, they know enough to run a script that executes SQL. Actual DBA's? Most organizations that can afford Oracle can afford real DBA's. Real DBA's can cope with a lot of things -- they do not need much hand-holding. Some of them like to assign storage parameters according to their shop standards. You should provide a script with reasonable defaults. You should define your script in a way that someone can easily find all of your storage parameters and tweak them if necessary. Your initial data can be via export/import or via a script. I prefer a script.
