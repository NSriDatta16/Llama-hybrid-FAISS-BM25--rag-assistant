What is the difference between Regularization, optimization, and pruning?

Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning = reduces or solves overfitting problem. Optimizing Neural Network Structures with Keras-Tuner = reduces the connections and number of neurons for optimal performance. Pruning in Keras example = According to this article pruning and regularization are types of Optimization: However, I am confused because the above three links don't conform to the diagram's terminologies. What is the difference between Regularization, optimization, and pruning? Are they different or the same?
