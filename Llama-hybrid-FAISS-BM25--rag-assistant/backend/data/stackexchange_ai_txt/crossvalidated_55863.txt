feature selection vs feature extraction

As per my understanding in dimensionality reduction, Feature selection chooses a subset from a list of available variables and, Feature extraction transforms available variables into lower dimension. How exactly does the transformation work? Is it like an interaction term of two or more variables? Could anyone please explain if one technique is more preferred over other or does it depend on the data set? Also, is one preferred over other for Linear Vs Non-Linear dimensionality reduction? Any help is much appreciated
