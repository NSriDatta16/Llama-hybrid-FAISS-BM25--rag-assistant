Exposing property to databinding in WPF

This is my scenario. I have internal class with a standard int property. public class Session : INotifyPropertyChanged { public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged; private ushort _Level; public ushort Level { get { return _Level; } } private void OnPropertyChanged(string name) { if (PropertyChanged != null) PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(name)); } // a timer code here updates the _Level property every 60 seconds // and calls OnPropertyChange("Level"); } In my UI window, I have a label that binds to the Session instance and displays the Level value. And the window constructor has this code: public MyWindow() { SessionInstance = new Session(); this.InitializeComponent(); } public Session SessionInstance { get; set; } However, as you can guess, when I update the value of _Level, the UI doesn't update the textblock. Adding DependancyProperty inside the Session class is unacceptable. I could do this on the window, but then I still need notifier that would check the value back to the Session instance. I was wondering if there's elegant way of doing this. I can't think of anything, other than running another timer in the window that would check and refresh the textblock value. Any thoughts?
