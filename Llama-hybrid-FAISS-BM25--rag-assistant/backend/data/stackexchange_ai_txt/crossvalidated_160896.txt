If I find, for example, that 70% of a sample got it right, how do I know how many got it right by chance and how many actually know what they are talking about? Simple answer is: you don't. And here you provide a simple counterexample when your logic fails: For an observed $x = 20\%$ I get $R = -60\%$ (okay, because lower limit is 50% due to chance). You can have from $0$ to $100\%$ (nobody to everybody of your sample), what would it mean that "$-60\%$ people know the answer"?! This does not make any sense. With $50\%$ chance of guessing you can get no less than $50\%$ points on average. So if chance of guessing correctly is symmetric to chance of guessing incorrectly, than there $50\%$ is the upper boundary for both values. Following your logic, this makes the rest of answers correct or undefined. This shows that the problem is not that simple (e.g. the probability of guessing correctly can be other than simply proportional to probability of guessing incorrectly - this makes your simple approach not applicable since $R_c$ tells you nothing about $W_c$). In real life some people know the answers, some don't know at all but guess, some make educated guesses that are more probable to be correct then by pure chance, some people are inclined to guess incorrectly for some kinds of questions (so are more likely to guess incorrectly), some do not attempt to guess at all because they consider it "not fair", there could be whole groups of people who share similar incorrect beliefs about some topics and so answer incorrectly etc. The bare fact that for yes/no kind of questions it is possible to have more than $50\%$ wrong answers (and, yes, it happens) makes your method not applicable. In real life it is more complicated and so your method won't provide correct answer. As I mentioned in my comments, in this kind of cases Item Response Theory models are commonly used (e.g. here or here ). In such models you use logistic regression with two or more parameters for (a) item difficulty and (b) student ability, since at least those two factors influence the final result. For such estimating such model you need multiple students answering multiple questions to have enough information for estimating those two parameters. If your test is easy, while you get many incorrect answers that tells you something about the students, if it is hard, while there are some who get $100\%$ correct scores it tells you something about those students, if you give your test to group of geniuses and no one of them can solve it correctly, it tells you something about your test. It is not just guessing-or-knowing problem.
