Not per the spec for CSS 3 (Section 8.5.3): The color of borders drawn for values of 'groove', 'ridge', 'inset', and 'outset' depends on the element's border color properties, but UAs may choose their own algorithm to calculate the actual colors used. Technically I suppose that "choose their own algorithm" could involve allowing the developer to set them, but no user-agent seems to do that at this point. Of course, even if they did, you'd have a solution for only that rendering engine.
