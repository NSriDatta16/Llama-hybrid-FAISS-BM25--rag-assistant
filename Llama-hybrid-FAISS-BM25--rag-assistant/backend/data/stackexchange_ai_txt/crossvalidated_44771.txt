PCA and EFA on bond returns using Stata

I've got a datafile which has bond returns (30, 20, 10, 5, 1 year) and time. The bond variables are returns on the different time bonds. I need to perform PCA and EFA on the data. I tried using time as one of the factors but it returns Heywood case as the uniqueness is 0. Should I disregard time? What i don't understand is if I disregard it then my analysis will have no practical interpretation. Already I've two principal components using PCA and I'm unable to interpret them. Please help me in understanding the practical implications of the data. Thanks in advance for your time and kind consideration... P.S. I'm working in Stata 12.1. Solutions in SPSS will be helpful too but I won't be able to perform them as my SPSS 20 does not accept datafile from this version of stata.
