I am not very expert in data science and also by general knowledge of data science I have so far, I think the data is very small. Although certain general data cleaning procedure that you can try in my opinion is Outlier detection and removal. May be you can use IQR method to detect outlier and remove then or impute them with median. May be if it make sense, you can see correlation among the columns. The close and Adj_close might be highly correlated, So they both might not be needed but this entirely depends upon the model that will be used. If Linear regression then have columns should not be correlated, if tree based then correlated columns are ok. The Signal column is not in the scale of other columns. So you can scale all columns and bring them to similar range of values. This is beneficial for Linear Regression. If there are few rows missing and the usecase does not allow for the rows to be missing then you can artifically create rows and impute the the values using median or last value or mean or interpolation. Hopefully my answers will be of any help to you.
