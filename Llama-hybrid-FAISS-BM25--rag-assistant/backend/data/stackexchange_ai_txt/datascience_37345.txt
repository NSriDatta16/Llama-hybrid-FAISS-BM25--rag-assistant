What is the meaning of term Variance in Machine Learning Model?

I am familiar with terms high bias and high variance and their effect on the model. Basically your model has high variance when it is too complex and sensitive too even outliers. But recently I was asked the meaning of term Variance in machine learning model in one of the interview? I would like to know what exactly Variance means in ML Model and how does it get introduce in your model? I would really appreciate if someone could explain this with an example.
