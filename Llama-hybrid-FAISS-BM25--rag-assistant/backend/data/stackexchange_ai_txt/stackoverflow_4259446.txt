Changing scaleX/scaleY on parent scales the children but doesn't update height/width property?

I have created a custom component - MyImage - that has two children including a Bitmap as well as a Sprite. My display object hierarchy is as follows - mx:Canvas view:MyImage mx:Bitmap my:Sprite If I change the MyImage.scaleX, scaleY property, the children scale as I would expect them to. However when I try to place the children in the center using placeAgain() on getting a resize event: public function placeAgain():void { if (image==null) return; var pCanvas:Canvas = this.parent as Canvas; if (image.width I find the image.height & width have not changed despite the image getting scaled! Isn't the child supposed to have its bounds changed after scaling its parent ? Especially after the child has actually been scaled correctly ? Why are bounds of the child stuck at the same value as before scaling? I am not caching the Bitmap, have not turned on caching of bitmaps.
