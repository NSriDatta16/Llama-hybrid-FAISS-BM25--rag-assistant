Check out the Test List Editor (under Test | Windows ). This shows you all tests in a Solution. At the left you can create a TreeView of groups and each test can be dragged into a group. With checkboxes on each TreeView node you easily toggle which (group(s) of) test(s) you want to run or debug. Is this what you were looking for? This information seems to be stored in the vsmdi metadata file, so it should be persisted. However, I am not sure if (and how) this ties in with automatic testing. It looks like a VS GUI feature to me, meant for manual grouping and running of tests. EDIT: For automated testing I would try to separate test code for different "occasions" (like eg. quick unit tests you always want to run when working on code, performance tests that could take a bit of time, integration tests over multiple layers, etc.) into different test projects semantically, even though you're using the same unit test framework to physically implement all these tests. Then you should be able to select the correct group of tests to be run at the right time (check in, daily build, manual test when needed).
