The question in dealing with outliers is whether or not they are generated by the same process as all the other points or not. If you have reason to believe it is truly a fluke (and since this is your data, you are in the best place to make that decision), the point can be eliminated. However, you might keep it in based on the idea that there could be other flukes in the future, and you want a model that will best represent reality - now and later. If you want to deal with these points systematically, at least two alternatives come to mind. The first is to calculate each point's leverage, then establish a threshold to eliminate those points. The second is to use some type of robust regression (e.g., 'M' or 'MM' estimation) that is less sensitive to outliers.
