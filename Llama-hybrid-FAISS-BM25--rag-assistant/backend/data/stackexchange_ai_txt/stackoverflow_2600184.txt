I think the right way to go is: in memory, you concatenate user name + password + some cookie (lets say: megan fox"). You then apply a commercial hash algorithm to it. I use SHA (System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider) from .NET Framework but I am sure it is no problem to make it work in C++ or perhaps get it for C++. So, even if someone gets to look the stored hash, there is no way he can know the password. Event if he wants to compare identical passwords, he will get nothing because of the user name + cookie concatenation. Your login code must create the hash and compare it against the stored one Problem is, you do not get to recover the password. But I think this is something good. Hope this helps.
