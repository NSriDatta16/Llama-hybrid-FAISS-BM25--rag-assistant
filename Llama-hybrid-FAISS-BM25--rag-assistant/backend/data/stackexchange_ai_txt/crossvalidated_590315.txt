Do I need stationary time series data for Isolation Forest Model?

I am trying to predict anomalies using an isolation forest model with daily time series data. Do I need to make sure my data is stationary as I have observed weekly seasonality? I read that you need stationary time series data for forecasting and predicting future events, however, an isolation forest model is not technically forecasting. Generally, if you are using time series data for a machine learning model, when does your data need to be stationary?
