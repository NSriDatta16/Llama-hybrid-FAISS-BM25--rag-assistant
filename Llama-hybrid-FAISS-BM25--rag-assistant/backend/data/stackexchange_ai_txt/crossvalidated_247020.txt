Lets say we are trying to figure out how sex{ male=1, female=0 } ($x_1$) influences monthly wages ($\hat{y}$). The resulting $R^2=0.05$ . The coefficient($\beta_1$) is highly significant ($p $\hat{y}=\beta_0+350x_1$ This means that amount the surveyed people, there is an average difference in wages between men and women of 350 dollars (men earn more on average). We can say that there is a difference in the population in wages, between men and woman with a $0.1\%$ chance of error (the actual difference can be estimated with confidence intervals , with a predefined margin of error). The $R^2$ however, tells us that only $5\%$ the variance in wages between individuals can be explained by the difference in their sex. This makes sense of course, as many-many unobserved or confounding elements can influence wages - education, experience, intelligence, field, location etc... So even if a coefficient is large and highly significant, it might very well still explain but a fraction of the dependent variable.
