SQL figuring out days remaining based on days interval (using SQL Server 2005)?

I have a table that represents a user's subscription to our system. I have two tables. One represents the subscription for an account and the other represents the type of subscription. The subscription table relates to the subscription type table with a subscriptionTypeID field in the subscription types table. I need to figure out the days remaining for that account. Here is my example: The user signed up on January 1, 2010 and their term is 30 days. Based on today's date (January 25, 2010) they would have 6 days remaining. I need help designing the SQL. Here is what I have so far in my stored procedure: @SubscriptionTypesID int Declare @term int Declare remainder int Set @term = (SELECT subscriptionTerm FROM dbo.SubscriptionTypes where dbo.SubscriptionTypes.SubscriptionTypesID = @SubscriptionTypesID) Now i need to figure out what to do with the remainder query, or if I can somehow have one SQL statement so I don't have to get the term separately. Update: Here is what I got now with all your help, but I still want a more elgant way to pump the term field value into the query: Select (DateDiff(day,getDate(),DATEADD (day , 30, '01/01/2010' ))) days Update 2.0 ;) Sometimes the answer is right in front of me and I can't even see it. I tend to over think problems and make them more complicated than they need to be. Thanks to everyone who helped! HEre is the code: SELECT (DateDiff(day,getDate(),DATEADD (day , subscriptionTerm, dbo.Subscriptions.subscriptionDate ))) days FROM dbo.Subscriptions INNER JOIN dbo.SubscriptionTypes ON (dbo.Subscriptions.subscriptionTypeID = dbo.SubscriptionTypes.SubscriptionTypesID) WHERE dbo.Subscriptions.userID = 129
