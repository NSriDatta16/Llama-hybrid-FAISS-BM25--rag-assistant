Most modern spam filters work by some form of Bayesian Analysis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_analysis If these messages don't trigger the spam filter as "bad" they will end up in the "good" filter, weighting a future real spam message (Viagra ad or Nigerian scam or whatever) which also contains the same gibberish. So they are seeding your spam filter so they can get past it later. My thoughts were quickly supported by analysis on many sites through a simple Google search. See, for instance, http://ezinearticles.com/?Gibberish-Spam-Email---Why-Do-Spammers-Send-It?&id=573584
