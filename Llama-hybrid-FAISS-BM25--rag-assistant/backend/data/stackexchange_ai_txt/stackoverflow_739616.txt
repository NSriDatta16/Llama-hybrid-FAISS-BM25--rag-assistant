Eclipse Plugin API: how can I add javadoc support for specific platform plugins?

using Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede and I cannot find the way to add javadoc support for all platform plugin apis, but specifically to JFace e Ui Forms packages. Opening the property panel of any jar linked to the library named "plug-in dependecies" I receive the following message into the "Javadoc location" node: The current class path entry belongs to container 'Plug-in Dependencies' wich does not allow user modifications to Javadoc locations in its entries"... what does it mean, that I must re-build Eclipse with some wired javadoc location?
