ARMA(8,4) might be too complex. That is, it fits well in sample but may generalize poorly out of sample (where its good performance is actually needed). ARMA(2,0) looks adequate except for autocorrelation at lag 1 in squared residuals. That calls for ARCH(1) structure in the conditional variance. So you could try AR(2)-ARCH(1). Also pay attention to values of information criteria (AICc, AIC, BIC). This way you may get an indication which of the alternative models strikes the best balance between fit and model complexity.
