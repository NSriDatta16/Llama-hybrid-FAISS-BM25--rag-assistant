tolua++ ignores assignment and inequality operator?

I am embedding Lua in a C++ class. It seems that tolua++ is ignoring some overloaded operators of my class. tolua++ issues the following warnings: **tolua++ warning: No support for operator=, ignoring **tolua++ warning: No support for operator!=, ignoring Is there any way around this?
