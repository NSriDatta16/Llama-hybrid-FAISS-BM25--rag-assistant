Is there an elegant way to add multiple HTML classes with XSLT?

Let's say I'm transforming a multiple-choice quiz from an arbitrary XML format to HTML. Each choice will be represented as an HTML tag in the result document. For each choice, I want to add an HTML class of correct to the if that choice was the correct answer. Additionally, if that choice was the one selected by the user, I want to add a class of submitted to the . Consequently, if the choice is the correct one as well as the submitted one, the should have a class of correct submitted . As far as I know, white-space separated attribute values aren't a part of the XML data model and thus cannot directly be created via XSLT. However, I have a feeling there's a better way of doing this than littering the code with one conditional for every possible combination of classes (which would be acceptable in this example, but unwieldy in more complex scenarios). How can I solve this in an elegant way? Example of Desired Result: Who trained Obi-Wan Kenobi? Mace Windu Qui-Gon Jinn Ki-Adi-Mundi Yaddle
