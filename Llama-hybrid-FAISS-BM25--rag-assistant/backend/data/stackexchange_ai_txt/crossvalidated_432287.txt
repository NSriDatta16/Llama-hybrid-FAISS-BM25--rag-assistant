If CNN returns random results, there must be the part related to RNG. If it's hard to locate where exactly they are, you can just try several times and compare them with mean and STD. However, I wouldn't recommend you to do that b/c it might take a long time to train CNN. Rather, I recommend you to read the documents of ML module that you are using (i.e. Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, ...) to find out where the RNG is coming from.
