Here's how Google App Engine's cron API is configured, it's a bit more user-friendly than cron : http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/cron.html#The_Schedule_Format Python (and Java?) source to implement it should be available in the SDK. Haven't looked to see how easy it would be to extract, but it should at least provide some ideas. I think it'd be possible to add various things to the format as required - it's structured enough to be extensible. For example it's currently missing the ability to say "every hour at 4 minutes past", which is common in UNIX cron but not really relevant to GAE because although perhaps the engine could figure out which minutes are busy and which aren't, and balance load, the user certainly can't. Obviously the major weakness of offering something that looks like natural language to the average user, is that they'll think your code is psychic, and expect it to also understand things like "every other Wednesday except the week after Easter", or "whenever the clocks change" ;-)
