You can't override trace itself, but for ease of typing I like to create a global function called 'tr'. It's a little known fact that you can create global functions in AS3, but it's easy. Create a file called tr.as inside you main source directory (not in a subdirectory or package), with the contents: package { public function tr(msg:String, ...):void { // add custom trace logic here trace("tr message: "+msg); } } If you need to have a lot of logic or static storage variables etc, it might be better to make a separate static class, and have the global tr function call out to that, such as: package { import org.code.MyTracer; public function tr(msg:String, ...):void { MyTracer.tr(msg); // all the tracing logic is inside the MyTracer class } }
