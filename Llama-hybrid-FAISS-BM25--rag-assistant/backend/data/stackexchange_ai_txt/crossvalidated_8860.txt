Neyman's confidence intervals make no attempt to provide coverage of the parameter in the case of any particular interval. Instead they provide coverage over all possible parameter values in the long run. In a sense they attempt to be globally accurate at the expense of local accuracy. Confidence intervals for binomial proportions offer a clear illustration of this issue. Neymanian assessment of intervals yields the irregular coverage plots like this, which is for 95% Clopper-Pearson intervals for n=10 Binomial trials: There is an alternative way to do coverage, one that I personally think is much more intuitively approachable and (thus) useful. The coverage by intervals can be specified conditional on the observed result. That coverage would be local coverage. Here is a plot showing local coverage for three different methods of calculation of confindence intervals for binomial proportions: Clopper-Pearson, Wilson's scores, and a conditional exact method that yield intervals identical to Bayesian intervals with a uniform prior: Notice that the 95% Clopper-Pearson method gives over 98% local coverage but the exact conditional intervals are, well, exact. A way to think of the difference between the global and local intervals is to consider the global to be inversions of Neyman-Pearson hypothesis tests where the outcome is a decision that is made on the basis of consideration of long-term error rates for the current experiment as a member of the global set of all experiments that might be run. The local intervals are more akin to inversion of Fisherian significance tests which yield a P value which represents evidence against the null in from this particular experiment. (As far as I know, the distinction between global and local statistics was first made in an unpublished Masterâ€™s thesis by Claire F Leslie (1998) Lack of confidence : a study of the suppression of certain counter-examples to the Neyman-Pearson theory of statistical inference with particular reference to the theory of confidence intervals. That thesis is held by the Baillieu library at The University of Melbourne.)
