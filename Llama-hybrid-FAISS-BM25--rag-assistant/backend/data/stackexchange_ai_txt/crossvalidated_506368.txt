How to initialize an encoder-decoder type of neural network that is used in image segmentation?

In this example: https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch/blob/dcd19d676bdfbf73fc140d5b98d780f449b0a2f8/segmentation_models_pytorch/base/initialization.py It only initializes the decoder and header, but not the encoder. More strangely, it initializes convolutional layers in decoder with nn.init.kaiming_uniform_, but initializes fully connected layers, as well as convolutional layers in header with nn.init.xavier_uniform_. Is there a specific reason for doing so?
