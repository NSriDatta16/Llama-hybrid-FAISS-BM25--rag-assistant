Too many split screens opening in Emacs!

Ever since I installed emacs on a new machine I have seen an ugly behaviour. Unfortunately, my old .emacs files are rather fragmented and I can't determine whether I used to have elisp that took care of this. The problem is this: it used to be that when I performed a command that would open a new buffer such as grep'ing, or clicking a file name within search results, one of two things would happen: If only one buffer is showing, the screen will split once If more than one buffer is showing, the buffer window after the current buffer window would open the desired file I want this behaviour back. What I am getting now is the following: Emacs will keep splitting the window until four buffer windows are open. If I continually click multiple grep results, the buffer window where they open cycles through the three other (non-grep-results) buffer windows. I'd like it if they just kept opening in the same location: the "next" buffer window beside/below the results--same buffer window every time. Any thoughts on how to achieve this behaviour?
