Yes, this is possible and often done. However, it seems to me that it is not currently possible to do using scikit-learn. To certain extent you could simulate this by duplicating samples in the training and validation set to increase their weight, but it is certainly not an efficient way to achieve it. If you plan using neural networks, I would recommend using some more advanced library such as TensorFlow, which has weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits loss function implemented. Using TensorFlow in combination with Keras might provide a beginner-friendlier interface, even though the learning curve may still be a little steep. Alternatively, scikit-learn has SVM classifier that supports weighted samples, perhaps it could work for your problem.
