JQuery method for IFrame functionality

I have a aspx page (details page) that needs to be loaded in a modal window on a click of a button. I have buttons in the aspx page that calls server side functionality. So, this is similar to an IFrame way (except that it's now in a modal window) Is there a JQuery way of doing this? It appears that the JQuery load loads only fragments of HTML
