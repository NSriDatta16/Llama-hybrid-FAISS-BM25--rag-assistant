How to deal with hourly non-stationary time series data with multi-seasonality?

I currently have hourly electricity demand data last for 5 years, where I used: demand The plot of stl shows the data have a clear decreasing trend and seasonality, the data is also not normally distributed. I tried: take seasonal difference, then take first difference log transform Box-Cox transform All of them do not work, I still have a time series with seasonality and trend. (Do you know how to deal with this?). e.g. the plot of 40 days data after seasonal and first difference: Then I use following code to fit the above three times series. fit I get ACF plot with clearly seasonal, and significant PACF plot until lag>200. I also tried: fit No improvement in residuals. Can any one help me with this? Many thanks.
