run multiple deep learning models on the same GPU

Can I use just one GPU to train a model and predict images at the same time? I want to host a website for image predictions. So using GPU for prediction is persistent. At the same time, I may use it to train some models. Is that doable? Or I need two GPUs to do these two tasks. Thank you in advance.
