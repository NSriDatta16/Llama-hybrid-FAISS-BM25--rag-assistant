Prediction interval using predict and NeweyWest in R

I have a basic linear regression model I fitted to a time series. Unfortunately I have to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasicity in the model and I have done so with the NeweyWest function from the sandwich package in R while analyzing the coefficients. Now I would like to create prediction intervals using the predict() function (or any other function) while utilizing the NeweyWest matrix/SEs. As this is the first quesiton I post on here and my experinece in R is very limited here is some information: LMModel = lm(Return~Sentiment, data=Time Series) This is the function I used for my coefficient testing: coeftest(LMModel , vcov=NeweyWest(LMModel , lag=27, ar.method="ols")) I would like thsi function to use NeweyWest in some way: predict(LMModel, newdata, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95) Thanks a lot in advance!
