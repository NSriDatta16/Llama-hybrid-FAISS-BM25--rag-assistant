Is the paging file fragmentation different on each machine? High fragmentation could slow down paging operations and thus exacerbate memory issues. If the paging file is massively fragmented, sort it out e.g. bring the server off-line, set the paging file size to zero, defrag the drive, re-create the paging file. It's hard to give any specific advice on how to deal with perf problems with your string handling without more detail of what you are doing.
