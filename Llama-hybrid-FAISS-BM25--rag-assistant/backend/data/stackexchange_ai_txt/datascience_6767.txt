Aggregate Data Since you're only given aggregate data, and not individual examples, machine learning techniques like decision trees won't really help you much. Those algorithms gain a lot of traction by looking at correlations within a single example. For instance, the increase in risk from being both obese and over 40 might be much higher than the sum of the individual risks of being obese or over 40 (i.e. the effect is greater than the sum of its parts). Aggregate data loses this information. The Bayesian Approach On the bright side, though, using aggregate data like this is fairly straightforward, but requires some probability theory. If $D$ is whether the person has diabetes and $F_1,\ldots,F_n$ are the factors from that link you provided, and if I'm doing my math correctly, we can use the formula: $$ \text{Prob}(D\ |\ F_1,\ldots,F_n) \propto \frac{\prod_{k=1}^n \text{Prob}(D\ |\ F_k)}{\text{Prob}(D)^{n-1}} $$ (The proof for this is an extension of the one found here ). This assumes that the factors $F_1,\ldots,F_n$ are conditionally independent given $D$, though that's usually reasonable. To calculate the probabilities, compute the outputs for $D=\text{Diabetes}$ and $\neg D=\text{No diabetes}$ and divide them both by their sum so that they add to 1. Example Suppose we had a married, 48-year-old male. Looking at the 2010-2012 data, 0.73% of all people get diabetes ($\text{Prob}(D) = 0.73\%$), 0.77% of married people get diabetes ($\text{Prob}(D\ |\ F_1)$$= 0.77\%$), 1.02% of people age 45-54 get diabetes ($\text{Prob}(D\ |\ F_2) = 1.02\%$), and 0.70% of males get diabetes ($\text{Prob}(D\ |\ F_3) = 0.70\%$). This gives us the unnormalized probabilities: $$ \begin{align*} P(D\ |\ F_1,F_2,F_3) &= \frac{(0.77\%)(1.02\%)(0.70\%)}{(0.73\%)^2} &= 0.0103 \\ P(\neg D\ |\ F_1,F_2,F_3) &= \frac{(99.23\%)(98.98\%)(99.30\%)}{(99.27\%)^2} &= 0.9897 \end{align*}$$ After normalizing these to add to one (which they already do in this case), we get a 1.03% chance of this person getting diabetes, and a 98.97% chance for them not getting diabetes.
