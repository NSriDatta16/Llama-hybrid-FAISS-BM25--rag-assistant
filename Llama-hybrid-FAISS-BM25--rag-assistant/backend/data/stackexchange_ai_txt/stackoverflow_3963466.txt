You probably still need to have the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, in case you do not have that. Your bigger problem is that cp is not in any sort of PATH . In fact, I do not see the cp command anywhere on the Android 2.2 emulator, though I have not done an exhaustive search. The way a savvy programmer would solve this is using Java , since that eliminates your dependency on undocumented/unsupported command-line binaries.
