Your functions can raise TypeError if they are not satisfied with the data types they receive. You can then catch this exception and see whether you are passing an appropriate type. You can also catch any other exception type. But trying to call the functions and catching the exceptions can be quite slow. You could also organize your functions into different sets depending on the argument type. functions = { list : [some functions taking a list], int : [some functions taking an int]} ... x = choose_function(functions[type(p)]) p = x(p)
