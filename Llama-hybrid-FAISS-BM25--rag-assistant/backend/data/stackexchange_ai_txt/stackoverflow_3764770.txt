Yes, your webserver can examine the USER_AGENT string that comes with every request. Each of thee devices you mention will send a string uniquely identifying what it is. I'm on a mobile device now, and don't have references, but you'll find what you need if you google 'useragent'. Once you know the device, you can easily send device-specific HTML, stylesheets and/or JavaScript to tailor the experience for each device. Good luck!
