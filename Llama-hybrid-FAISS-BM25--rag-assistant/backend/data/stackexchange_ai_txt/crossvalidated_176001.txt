Machine Learning for Assisting in Medical Diagnosis

I am working on a project with the aim of assisting Doctor in his Medical Diagnosis. The data which is available is the set of questions for various diseases asked by doctors who are expert in diagnosing the respective diseases. Data available is in this format: The learning algorithm is expected to learn the pattern of question asked for a particular disease and when a patient comes,depending on his answer for a particular question the system will tell which question to ask next and so on. Idea is that doctor has some idea of the disease patient might have and this kind of system will simulate second opinion from expert doctor on that disease. This will help the doctor in confirming his diagnosis. My problem is how to formulate this in Machine Learning model? I can think of Learning a Decision Tree but how to generate questions from it?
