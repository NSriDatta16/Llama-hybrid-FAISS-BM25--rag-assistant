One possible problem with the same posted is that if the XHR requests take longer than the poll period (on average) there will be an increasing queue of pending requests . If the web-server itself starts to backlog requests this can turn into a vicious cycle. To avoid this possible case, use a CPS-style coding where the next action is done using the appropriate callbacks. That is, don't start the next request until required (previous request complete: success or failure) -- this approach can still be used to create a manual request queue with a controllable size if numerous outstanding requests are required. Also, make sure that unused objects are be eligible for reclamation as this is the "standard" cause of a "memory leak" in a GC language. Happy coding. The code in the post contains nothing that will inherently leak memory . It could possibly be an issue internally with jQuery, but this is just speculation. Additionally, tools like Firebug that monitor XHR/web requests can consume significant amounts of memory so it's something to check and make sure the behavior is not a Heisenberg. Also, remember that increasing memory usage doesn't not indicate a memory leak unless it grows unbounded. A garbage collection cycle will only occur when the hosts feels like it.
