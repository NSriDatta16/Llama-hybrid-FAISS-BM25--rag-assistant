Basic CSS question

In CSS, how do I achieve the following layout? xxxxxxxxxxxxxR1xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxR1xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxR1xxxxxxxxxxxxx xR2.1x xxxxxxxxxR2.1xxxxxx xR2.1x xxxxxxxxxR2.2xxxxxx xR2.1x xxxxxxxxxR2.2xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxR3xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxR3xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxR3xxxxxxxxxxxxx R2.1 is an image that I want to go to the left, and R2.2 is a div that I want to go to the right. If R2.2 was a paragraph, it would be easy - I could just use float:left on R2.1 - but the fact that it is a div seems to mess things up. I've tried using and , together and separately, but they don't seem to combine well. What am I doing wrong?
