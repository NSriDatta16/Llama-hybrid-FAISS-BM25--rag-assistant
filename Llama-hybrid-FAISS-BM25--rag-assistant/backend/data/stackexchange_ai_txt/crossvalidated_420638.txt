Given a transition matrix P for weather conditions (modeled as either rainy or sunny), is $P^n$ the n-Step Transition Probabilities for day n+1?

wiki uses this example to illustrate Markov chains. The probabilities of weather conditions (modeled as either rainy or sunny), given the weather on the preceding day, can be represented by a transition matrix: ${\displaystyle P={\begin{bmatrix}0.9&0.1\\0.5&0.5\end{bmatrix}}}$ The matrix P represents the weather model in which a sunny day is 90% likely to be followed by another sunny day, and a rainy day is 50% likely to be followed by another rainy day. The columns can be labelled "sunny" and "rainy", and the rows can be labelled in the same order. The weather on day 1 is known to be sunny. This is represented by a vector in which the "sunny" entry is 100%, and the "rainy" entry is 0%: ${\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{(0)}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\end{bmatrix}}}$ for day n + 1( Note : the original value on wiki is n, which seems to be incorrect) ${\mathbf {x}}^{{(n)}}={\mathbf {x}}^{{(0)}}P^{n}$ The superscript (n) is an index, and not an exponent. is $P^n$ here the n-Step Transition Probabilities?
