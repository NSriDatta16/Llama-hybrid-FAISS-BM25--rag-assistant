Here are two papers that deal with this exact problem. They use support vector regression instead of splines: LÃ¡zaro et al. "Support vector regression for the simultaneous learning of a multivariate function and its derivatives." Neurocomputing 69.1 (2005): 42-61. http://gtas.unican.es/pub/68 Jayadeva et al., "Regularized Least Squares Twin SVR for the Simultaneous Learning of a Function and its Derivative," 2006 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp.1192,1197 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716237&isnumber=36115 Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a popular implementation of any of such methods, as it's a quite specific problem.
