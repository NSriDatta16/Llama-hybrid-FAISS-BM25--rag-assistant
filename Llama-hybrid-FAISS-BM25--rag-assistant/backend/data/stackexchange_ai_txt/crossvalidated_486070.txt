You specifically ask about simulation. Following @Dave's Answer (+1), here are a couple of simulations in R. Suppose I take a million samples of size $n = 16$ from a population distributed as $\mathsf{Gamma}(\mathrm{shape} = 4,\, \mathrm{rate}=.1),$ so that the population mean is $\mu = 40$ the population variance is $\sigma^2 = 400,$ and $\sigma = 20.$ Then the sample means (averages) $A =\bar X_{15}$ have $E(A) = 40$ and standard errors $SD(A)= \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 5.$ With a million samples, the simulation results should be accurate to about three significant digits. set.seed(904) a = replicate(10^6, mean(rgamma(16, 4, .1))) mean(a); sd(a) [1] 40.00176 # aprx 40 [1] 4.996061 # aprx 5 By contrast, let's do a similar simulation of a million samples of size $n = 100$ from the same population. Now $E(\bar X_{100}) = 40$ and $SD(\bar X_{100}) = \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 20/\sqrt{100} = 2.$ set.seed(2020) a = replicate(10^6, mean(rgamma(100, 4, .1))) mean(a); sd(a) [1] 40.0014 # aprx 40 [1] 2.001084 # aprx 20/10 = 2
