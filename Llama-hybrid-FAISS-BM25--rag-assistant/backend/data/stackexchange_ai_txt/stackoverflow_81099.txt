Safe feature-based way for detecting Google Chrome with Javascript?

As the title states, I'd be interested to find a safe feature-based (that is, without using navigator.appName or navigator.appVersion) way to detect Google Chrome. By feature-based I mean, for example: if(window.ActiveXObject) { // internet explorer! } Edit: As it's been pointed out, the question doesn't make much sense (obviously if you want to implement a feature, you test for it, if you want to detect for a specific browser, you check the user agent), sorry, it's 5am ;) Let me me phrase it like this: Are there any javascript objects and/or features that are unique to Chrome...
