Pooling samples ahead of analysis - valid?

probably a basic question here! I am a scientist. I'm planning an experiment with cells in a dish. The cells are cheap. I can afford n = 8 biological replicates (individual wells in a multiwell plate, each containing some number of cells.) However, the chemical test I want to do on the cells is expensive to run. I want to quantify how much of compound X the cells produce as a result of their treatment group. The test is done on the cells' broth - you draw the liquid broth off the cells, place it in a test tube, and run the test from there. I am wondering if there is any statistical reason I can't combine the liquid broth n = 8 wells of cells into n = 4 test tubes. This would allow me to pay for only n = 4 analysis runs. Assuming I'm careful to mix exactly the same volumes of liquid from each well, it seems to me that this is equivalent to averaging every two samples. Of course, this would mean my n for any statistical tests I run on the results of the chemical test would drop from 8 to 4. Am I missing anything here? Seems too easy. For biologists, I'd think this is also equivalent to going from n = 8 in a 96-well plate to n = 4 in a 48-well plate. I'd do that except that we don't have any 48-well plates in stock. Edits requested: there are 20 treatment groups. N = 8 is wells per group (so 160 wells total).
