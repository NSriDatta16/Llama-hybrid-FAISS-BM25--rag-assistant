Do I need to apply a Ranking Algorithm for this?

I have data of the form : Id1 A_Id2 B_Id2 C_Id2 D_Id2 E_Id2 F_Id2 1 6 3 9 23 20 5 1 4 7 8 9 11 56 1 2 36 98 73 2 4 1 9 5 2 7 32 24 1 14 7 5 9 12 5 2 34 4 7 10 7 12 2 5 57 23 91 4 6 2 7 . . . . . 2 3 . . . . . 2 . . . . . . . . 100 . . . . . . Basically, I want to build a model such that I can get a best match of Id1, given top 5 Id2 matches of each attribute(A_Id2, B_Id2,...,F_Id2). Now every match should be computed keeping in mind A has highest priority, followed by B and C, followed by D and least priority to E and F. So the output will look like this : Id1 Match_Id2 1 9 2 7 3 . 4 . I hope the problem is clear, if not please ask. How should I go about building a Machine Learning model for this? I was wondering if ranking algorithm will help ?
