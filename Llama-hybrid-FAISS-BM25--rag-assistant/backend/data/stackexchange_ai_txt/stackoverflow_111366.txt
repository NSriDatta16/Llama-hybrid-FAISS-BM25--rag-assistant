A centralised system doesn't necessarily prevent you from using separate branches to do development on. There doesn't need to be a single true copy of the code base, rather different developers or teams can have different branches, legacy branches could exist etc. What it does generally mean is that the repository is centrally managed - but that's generally an advantage in a company with a competent IT department because it means there's only one place to backup and only one place to manage storage in.
