Django + S3 (boto) + Sorl Thumbnail: Suggestions for optimisation

I am using S3 storage backend across a Django site I am developing, both to reduce load from the EC2 server(s), and to allow multiple webservers (redundancy, load balancing) access the same set of uploaded media. Sorl.thumbnail (v11) template tags are being used in our templates to allow flexible image resizing/cropping. Performance on media-rich pages is not very good, and when a page containing thumbnails needing to be generated for the first time is accessed, the requests even time out. I understand that this is due to sorl thumbnail checking/downloading the original image from S3 (which could be quite large and high resolution), and rendering/checking/uploading the thumbnail. What would you suggest is the best solution to this setup? I have seen suggestions of storing a local copy of files in addition to the S3 copy (not to great when a couple of server are being used for load balancing). Also I've seen it suggested to store 0-byte files to fool sorl.thumbnail. Are there any other suggestions or better ways of approaching this?
