The overhead isn't that important as good architecture. REST isn't a protocol it is an architecture that encourage good scalable design. It is often chosen because too much freedom in RPC can easily lead to a poor design. The other reason is predictable cost of RESTful protocols over HTTP because it can leverage existing technologies (mainly proxies). RPC initial cost is quite low but it tend to increase significantly with load intensification.
