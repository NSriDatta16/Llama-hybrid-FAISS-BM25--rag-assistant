In Magento, How does one modify the admin store select list at the search filter stage and not the select stage?

Magento Admin has a store select drop down list of all the stores. I have added an addititional "SELECT ALL STORES" value to allow me to know when a user wishes to carry out a task on all stores. I based this customisation on enterprise magento version 1.9 although I think the version is quite irrelevant since my question is quite generic to magento I think. How do I stop my "SELECT ALL STORES" from being selected by default in the search ? /index.php/admin/admin/urlrewrite/index
