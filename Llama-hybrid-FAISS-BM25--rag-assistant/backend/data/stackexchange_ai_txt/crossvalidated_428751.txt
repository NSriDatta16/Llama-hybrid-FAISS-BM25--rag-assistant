Time Series Book Recommendation

Can i asked for a text book recommendation to study time series analysis if i don't have a strong background in Probability? My background is in Pure Mathematics and my probability background is only as good as the basic understanding of discrete and continuous random variables. I tried many text but all of them requires a strong probability background.
