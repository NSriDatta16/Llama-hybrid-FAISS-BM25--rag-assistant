How does Unobserved Components Model work ? What exactly does it do after decomposing the time series in components?

I was working on Unobserved Components Model in R but found that the content in the help section of R is not very elaborate.Maybe it's not completely updated yet. The Nile dataset example online also does not get a lot into how the model works. I want to know how UCM is different to ARIMA and other time series models. When do we opt for this model over the others ? Could someone point me towards a source of documentation on this.
