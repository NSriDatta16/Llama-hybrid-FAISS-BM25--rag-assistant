Seeking a closed form for a posterior distribution

In the book Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al. (3rd edition, 2014), a hierarchical model (or one-way random-effects ANOVA) is presented in section 5.4 as follows, \begin{equation}\label{eq:lme1} y_{ij} = b_0 + \lambda_i + \varepsilon_{ij}, \end{equation} where the data $y_{ij}$ come from the $i$th measuring entity (e.g., student performance in a school district) collected under the $j$th condition (e.g., a school within the district), $b_0$ is the population mean, $\lambda_i$ is the deviation of the $i$th measuring entity from the population mean, and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the measuring error ($i=1, 2, \ldots, k;\ j=1, 2, \ldots, n$). A posterior inference is derived in the book for the effect of each measuring entity $\theta_i=b_0 + \lambda_i$ based on a Gaussian assumption with a known variance $\sigma^2$ for the residuals $\varepsilon_{ij}$ and a prior distribution $G(0, \tau^2)$ for $\lambda_i$. Specifically, the mean and variance for $\theta_i$ are estimated as below: \begin{align} {\rm mean}(\theta_i) &= \frac{\frac{n}{\sigma^2}\bar{y}_{i\cdot}+\frac{1}{\tau^2}b_0}{\frac{n}{\sigma^2}+\frac{1}{\tau^2}} \\[7pt] {\rm Var}(\theta_i) &= \frac{1}{\frac{n}{\sigma^2}+\frac{1}{\tau^2}} \end{align} where $\bar{y}_{i\cdot}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n y_{ij}$. Even though the variance for the $\lambda_i$ is assumed to be known, I could solve the model as a mixed-effects model through, for example, function lmer() in the R package lme4 , and use the estimated variances $\tau^2$ and $\sigma^2$ to obtain the posterior distribution using the formulation above. Is this a reasonable and solid approach? I know that I could directly obtain the posterior distribution through R packages such as brms and rstanarm . However, the computational cost is too heavy in my case, and that's why I'm trying to see if the above closed form is a a reasonable approach to directly obtaining the posterior distribution by plugging the variance estimate $\hat{\sigma}^2$ from lmer , rather than going through the typical Bayesian route..
