'drag' move a uibutton so it acts like uiScrollView

I need to slide a uibutton up and down the screen (Y only). It needs to be confined to an area. I want to be able to click on it and drag or flick it, just like a uiScrollView. The reason it is different to a uiScrollView is that you have to start on the button, as opposed to anywhere inside a uiScrollView!
