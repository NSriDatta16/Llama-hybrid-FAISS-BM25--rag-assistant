How do you keep user.config settings across different assembly versions in .net?

Basically the problem is that each time the assembly version changes (i.e. the user installs a new version of the application) all their settings are reset the the defaults (or more accurately a new user.config file is created in a folder with a different version number as the name) How can I keep the same settings when upgrading versions, since using ini files or the registry seem to be discouraged? When we used Clickonce it seemed to be able to handle this, so it seems like it should be able to be done, but I'm not sure how.
