How to choose between models with very small deltaAIC? (model averaging not an option)

My question is regarding selecting the best fitting model using AIC scores when the deltaAIC is very small between best models. I am running PMM's - Phylogeneticly-informed Mixed Models- using the package 'sommer'. The top three models with the lowest AIC scores are less than 1 point apart. I would normally use model averaging in this case but this can't be done with this type of model. How would I otherwise go about selecting between these models? The simplest model? Based on degrees of freedom? Thanks for your help,
