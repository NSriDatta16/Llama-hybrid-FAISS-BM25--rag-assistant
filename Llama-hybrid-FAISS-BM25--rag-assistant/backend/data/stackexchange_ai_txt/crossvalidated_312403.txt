The easiest way would probably to take an electricity demand (or production) time series, fit an appropriate model, randomly permute the residuals and add these back to the fitted values. You can inflate the permuted residuals to make the simulated series less similar to the original series. Alternatively, don't resample the residuals, but instead draw from an appropriate parametric distribution. However, given the amount of data you will likely be working with, I don't this this will yield very different results from the permutation approach. Here is an example. A good model to fit electricity data is tbats , which can model multiple-seasonalities . The top left panel is the original series; the rest are resampled simulations. Note how the intra-daily and intra-weekly patterns look similar, but the simulated series are more noisy. You can tweak the scaling-factor to govern this. library(forecast) taylor.fit
