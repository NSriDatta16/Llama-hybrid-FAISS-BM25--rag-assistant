Link test for pooled logistic regression

After logistic regression of the cross-sectional data sets, link test _hatsq shows insignificant. However, when I pool the same two data sets, the link test using the same set of variables regression gives significant _hatsq which shows specification error in the pooled data regression. Why is this happening?
