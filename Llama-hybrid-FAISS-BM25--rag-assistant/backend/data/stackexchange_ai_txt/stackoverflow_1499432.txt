Is there a standard copy-paste way to safely put a SWF in a web-page?

While embedding a SWF in HTML is not too hard, there are a few subtleties for different browsers, detecting if Flash is installed, etc. For enabling AJAX, there are standard chunks of code you can use to save the hassle of coping with all cases... is their a similar 'reference implementation' to embed a SWF which covers all the bases?
