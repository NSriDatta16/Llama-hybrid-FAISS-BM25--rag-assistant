Load External SWF, assign MOUSE_DOWN event, and prevent empty space / sub stage from being clicked

I've been developing in Flash now for over 15 years, and recently started developing games in Flash Actionscript 3. I am having some difficulties, and need some help. I've spent days trying to find a solution, with no luck. I have a main SWF, which loads sub SWF animations. One object can have 5 different animations / SWFs associated with it. So lets say I have a chicken, chicken01.swf, chicken02.swf, ... I assign a MOUSE_DOWN event to the first loaded SWF, then based on the tool used while clicking on the object, it will load the other animations. My problem is that each SWF has empty space around it which becomes clickable. I only need the object clickable, and not the empty space, because some of the objects can overlap each other, which makes it hard to click on the object behind another object. The Sub SWFs / animations are on a single timeline, and I played with Bitmap Tracing to remove the empty space around the imported PNG objects. This works if I reduce the Stage size to behind the Object, but then screws up the size of the loaded SWF due to the Stage size being smaller than the object. So when I assign a width and height to the object, with a smaller stage, the object is huge. If I constraint the stage size to the size of the object, even as a Traced bitmap image, the stage is still clickable. I tried to assign the MOUSE_DOWN event to the object on the sub SWF, from the Main SWF, but this gives errors. My goal is to load a sub SWF, assign the MOUSE_DOWN event, and only have the object clickable, and not the Stage, or empty space around the object. Is this possible? I also played around with creating an invisible button, but this makes it difficult to assign to 300 + objects of different shapes and sizes. Below is some of the code I'm using. var loadimage = foreground_list[i].imagelocation + foreground_list[i].image; var loader:SWFLoader = new SWFLoader(loadimage,{container:tn_mc,x:current_tn_x,y:current_tn_y,name:current_name,alpha:1,width:current_tn_w,height:current_tn_h,rotation:0}); loader.load(); tn_mc.buttonMode = true; tn_mc.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, tn_down ); tn_mc.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, tn_up ); addChild( tn_mc ); function tn_down(e:MouseEvent):void { switch (MovieClip(this.root).PointerTool) { case "move" : stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stage_up ); e.target.startDrag(); break; case "play" : var loader4:SWFLoader = new SWFLoader(foreground_list.imagelocation + foreground_list.playimage,{container:tn_mc,name:e.target.name,x:foreground_list.setx,y:foreground_list.sety,width:foreground_list.setw,height:foreground_list.seth,rotation:0}); tn_mc.removeChildAt(0); tn_mc.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, tn_down ); tn_mc.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, tn_up ); loader4.load(); loader4.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeactionHandler); break; default : //Some other animation break; } }
