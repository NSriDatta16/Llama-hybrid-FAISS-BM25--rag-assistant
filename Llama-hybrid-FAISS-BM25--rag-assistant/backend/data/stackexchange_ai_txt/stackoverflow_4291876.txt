div problem why is line break inserted?

I want to display one image which is 300px by 300px and then i want to display some text. Unfortunately the text i want to display begins on the next line after image. This is the bare code :- some text which is too long probably a big paragraph How can display everything in smooth flow layout? Thanks in advance :)
