The emphasis on what constitutes "Discrete Mathematics" in Computer Science undergraduate curriculums has shifted in the past forty years. It used to be that such courses would cover material such as abstract algebra and go into concepts such as 'sorts' and 'kinds', which is useful for algebraic specification of programs. If that is the sort of math you think you will enjoy, then buy an old book on Discrete Maths, like this one: Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science (1977) $5 shipped! I don't believe the ridiculously expensive Susanna Epps book contains similar material, and should know, since that hideously overpriced book is what I had to use in my freshman Discrete Maths class (2003) -- I can't believe the price has almost doubled since its outrageous price even then!
