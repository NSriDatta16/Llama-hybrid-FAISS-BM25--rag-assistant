Allocating a few large objects will fragment memory less than allocating a larger number of smaller objects. Even more important, since a larger percentage of your objects are exactly the same size, you'll often be able to reuse a freed block exactly as-is. Splitting your object up into a larger number of smaller objects will generally make fragmentation more of a problem, not less. If you find that fragmentation does become a problem, you generally want to deal with that by defining your own allocator.
