Displaying text in multiple lines in Android

I have a graphical Android project and my primary trick for providing user interface functionality is to use drawrect and drawtext to draw a rectangle with a label on the screen. Then, I capture touch events and check to see if they occur in the rectangle -- when they do, voila, I have a button. It may not be the most elegant method, but is seems to be working like a charm. However, not all of my labels look good all on one line, and I'd like to write them on two. I suppose I could write two separate lines and manually work out arranging the text to be nicely spaced and centered, but I'd like to avoid that if possible. In Android, is there a simple way to split a text label and write it out in a single step?? Thanks, R.
