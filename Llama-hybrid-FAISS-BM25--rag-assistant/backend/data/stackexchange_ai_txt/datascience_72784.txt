Classifier Analysis Try to leverage this python library for more insights: https://github.com/marcotcr/lime reference: https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Lime%20-%20basic%20usage%2C%20two%20class%20case.html Deep Learning Specifics For deep learning models, you can use Google Collab if possible. If the model is deep learning based and is built on allennlp, the Gradient visualization can be performed. Refer this link for Demo on Sentiment Analysis Problem, https://demo.allennlp.org/sentiment-analysis/MTc0MzQwOA== Tutorial is at https://allennlp-course.apps.allenai.org/ . Multi Label Specifics Refer here https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html . Looks the probelm you are addressing is Multi Label Classification. This will give you class wise reports, sklearn.metrics.classification_report. Accordingly, the narrow down poorly performing classes. And then tweak the model. There is Micro/Macro metric for Multi Label problems. Refer here Micro Average vs Macro average Performance in a Multiclass classification setting Suggestion My suggestion is better to explore how the metric is calculated. Find the fact that what F1 is being referred here. Analyse F1, precision and recall, over labels. Then, it can be found out which labels are performing poorly.
