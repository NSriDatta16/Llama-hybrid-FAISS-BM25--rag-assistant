Comparing two logistic regressions

I am working on creating a predictive model using logistic regressions. I am hoping to compare two different populations, using the same set of variables but different data sets with different sample sizes. Is there a good way to compare the two regressions in R to see if they are statistically different from each other? Edit for clarification: My goal is to determine if the variables affect the outcome differently to a statistical degree. My analysis is about political socialization of two different populations, so I want to try to determine if xx population is socialized differently than yy population to a statistically significant degree. The two logistic models look different, but I am trying to give a more analytical answer than just "they look different".
