I would believe it more likely they're using a Fully Fledged DBMS as a backing store, and only generating/parsing XML as an interface. XML is imho far too heavy to be used for a high-data store database. The Structure is too parse-heavy and even if you had some sort of server which started, parsed, and then ran based on the XML data, the initialization time would be killer, as would be the data reserialization phase every time a write was done. RDBMS's benefit by having much more efficient packed data storage with predictable searching/seeking through records and multiple data-stores and multiple indicies.
