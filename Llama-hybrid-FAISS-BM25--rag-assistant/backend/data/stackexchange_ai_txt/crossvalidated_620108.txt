Average Treatment Effect extensions for non-binary treatments

Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a common measure to determine if a treatment (e.g. taking a particular medicine, you either take it or not) exert an effect on a particular target variable (e.g. sickness status). Additionally, as it seems to me a big part of causal inference literature, ATE considers binary treatments. I was wondering if there is any similar concept in the case of ordinal non-binary treatments for binary outcomes. One such example may be to quantify the effect that your school final grade (finite, ordinal, and non-binary) has on whether or not you gain more than 100k$ per year (binary).
