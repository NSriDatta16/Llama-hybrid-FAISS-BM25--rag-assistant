Relative changes instead absolute values in LSTM training

I am reading some papers about glucose time series prediction and I have noticed that some of them propose LSTM models that use relative changes between two measures. For example, if $$ glucose(t)=60, glucose(t+1)=65$$ We will send $$\triangle_{t}=5$$ to the next cell. If this cell were the last one, we would calculate the absolute value and return it. Does this approach have any advantage or is it only a way of representation? Article: K. Li, J. Daniels, C. Liu, P. Herrero and P. Georgiou, "Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Glucose Prediction," in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 603-613, Feb. 2020, doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2908488.
