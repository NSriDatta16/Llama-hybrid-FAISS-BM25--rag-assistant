Logistic regression: can weights be used as a predictor variable?

I counted the number of birds in a flock, which gave counts like these: set.seed(1) number.birds.in.flock I recorded the species that formed each flock: species I then counted the number in the flock that were feeding: set.seed(1) number.birds.feeding And the number of birds in the flock that were vigilant: number.birds.vigilant I then went on to model the number of the flock that were feeding. First I converted number.birds.feeding to a proportion: proportion.feeding I used a binomial generalised linear model, with number.birds.in.flock as a weight: glm(proportion.feeding ~ species, weights = number.birds.in.flock, family = "binomial") Here's my question, can I also number.birds.in.flock as both a weight and a explanatory variable like this: glm(proportion.feeding ~ species + number.birds.in.flock, weights = number.birds.in.flock, family = "binomial")
