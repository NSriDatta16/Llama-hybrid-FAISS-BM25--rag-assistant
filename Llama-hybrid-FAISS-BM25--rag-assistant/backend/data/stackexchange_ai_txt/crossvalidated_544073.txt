If you are certain that one wrote the beginning and the other wrote the end, you can annotate each sentence in the first paragraph as author A and the rest as author B. Train a supervised machine learning model or several (e.g. an ensemble of SVM, NB, LR, RF) on this annotation, cross-validate and note the accuracy of the model. Since words indicative of topics might mess up the model, you better focus on stop words, adjectives, and sentence lengths. Then reset the border to annotate the first two paragraphs to A and repeat. Note the accuracy. Then annotate the first three as A and repeat. Do this until you reach the situation where all is A, except for the last paragraph. If there were two authors and there is a difference in writing, there will be a point where the model is most accurate.
