Warning: should not initialize a non-const reference with a temporary

I get the warning from the title on Sun Studio 12.1 with the following snippet: #include std::vector g() { std::vector result; result.push_back(5); return result; } int main() { int b = g()[0]; // Warning text is: Warning: should not initialize a non-const reference with a temporary. While I know that initialising a non-const reference with a temporary is a bad thing, I cannot see how that happens here. I know that [0] returns a reference to the first element of the vector which itself is temporary, but I fail to see what the problem is. Can somebody explain Why does to compiler complain? Is it a legitimate warning? If yes, what do I have to change? If no, how can I silence it elegantly?
