How to do 'fastScrollEnabled' like ListView in ScrollView?

I need fast scroll thumb in ScrollView (which we can scroll by dragging the thumb, like in fastScrollEnabled ListView). Problem detail: The list are rows composed with different TypeFace and alignment. Row 1: TextView1 (TypeFace:A & LeftAligned) TextView2 (TypeFace:B & RightAligned) Row 2: TextView3 (TypeFace:A & LeftAligned) TextView4 (TypeFace:B & RightAligned) . . . Second requirement: I need to be alerted when the view scrolled, including new scroll position - which is implemented by overriding onScrollChanged method of the ScrollView. So I use ScrollView cause I though its impossible to implement using ListView. Suggestion?
