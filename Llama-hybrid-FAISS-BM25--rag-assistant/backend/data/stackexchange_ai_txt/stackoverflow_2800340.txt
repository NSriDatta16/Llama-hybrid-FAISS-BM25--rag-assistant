Reading a UTF-8 file is fairly simple in Java: Reader r = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filename), "UTF-8"); If that isn't working, the issue lies elsewhere. EDIT: According to iconv, Google Cameroon is serving invalid UTF-8. It seems to actually be iso-8859-1. EDIT2: Actually, I was wrong. It serves (and declares) valid UTF-8 if the user agent contains "Mozilla/5.0" (or higher), but valid iso-8859-1 in (some) other cases. Obviously, the best bet is to use getContentType to check before decoding.
