How do I create a new Beamer environment with a verbatim environment?

I'm creating a Beamer presentation that has a lot of example LaTeX in it, which has to go in a verbatim environment. I'm getting tired of typing \begin{example} \begin{verbatim} Verbatim Text \end{verbatim} \end{example} I wish to create a new command or environment that will shorthand this for me. I also need this for blocks and theorems, since I'm using those frequently as well. But if I can figure it out for examples, it should be easy to translate to another example. I can't create a new environment or command using just \begin{verbatim}, since it cuts off the rest of the command. So I switched to using the fancyvrb package, and tried the following: \DefineVerbatimEnvironment {MyVerbatim}{Verbatim}{} \newcommand{\makeexample}[1]{ \begin{example} \begin{MyVerbatim} #1 \end{MyVerbatim} \end{example} } \makeenvironment{VerbExample}{\begin{example} \begin{MyVerbatim}}{\end{MyVerbatim}\end{example}} That gives me the \makeexample{Example Text} command, and the \begin{VerbExample}...\end{VerbExample} environment, but they both still throw errors on compile. The frame I'm trying to use them in looks like this (I've got the [fragile] option on the frame, so it's not that). \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Why Doesn't Verbatim Work?} \makeexample{Verbatim Text} \begin{VerbExample} Verbatim Text \end{VerbExample} \end{frame}
