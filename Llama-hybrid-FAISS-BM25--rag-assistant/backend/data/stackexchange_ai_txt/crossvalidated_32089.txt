There are many things wrong here. As @NÃ©stor explains, he implicitly assumes prior probabilities on $H_0$ (no link) and $H_1$ (link). He places a very high weight (very close to 1) on $H_0$ and a very small weight on $H_1$. This is the first dubious thing he does, since there is a mechanistic link between smoke and heart disease (consider active smokers), the question really is if the exposure is enough. This does not even consider the previous studies done. So it's really not one of a "vast number of things" to be tested as wearing red socks for example would be. This means he already starts with a highly biased and not really justifiable prior. He then updates his prior by stating that the probability of getting an 95%-confidence interval of not containing the true value has a probability of 5%. While this is true, this is not the chance of getting that particular interval under the assumption of the null hypothesis . Note that he would have treated a confidence interval of [1.17, 1.32] exactly the same as a confidence interval of [100, 200] which is clearly problematic. This is really important to the Bayesian approach: while you have a total probability of 5% of not getting an interval containing the 1 under the assumption that 1 is zero, the probability density of getting that particular interval is different (and smaller). The third mistake is that he never specified his prior nor states how likely $H_0$ has to be versus $H_1$ for him to get that result. It's just "vanishingly small". The fourth mistake is to say that the appropriate action to take would be to dismiss the data. Note that his result does not even depend on the data, his argument implies exactly the same action would have been done for any data at all. If you find an interesting link but suspect it might just be a fluke, the proper scientific thing to do is to try to replicate your result!
