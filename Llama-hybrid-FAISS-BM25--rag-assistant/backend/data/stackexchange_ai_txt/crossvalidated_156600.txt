Random forest for binary panel data

I have a dataset with observations from about 50 countries and 20 years. My dependent variable is binary and I was wondering if I could use random forest to do out-of-sample predictions. My problem is: as far as I know, RF considers observations to be independent, which is not the case in my dataset. Is there any software (preferably an R package) that takes data structure into consideration when doing bootstrap sampling? I was thinking about something like GMERT , random effects combined with RF (see: How can I include random effects into a randomForest ). However, due to my limited programming skills, I could not adapt the authors' code to use it with binary response variables. Any suggestions?
