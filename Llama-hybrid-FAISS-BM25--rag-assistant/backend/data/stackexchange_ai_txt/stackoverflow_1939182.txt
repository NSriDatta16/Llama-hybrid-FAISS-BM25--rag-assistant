I think Storyboard.Stop() should work here. But if you not find anything elegant, you can try reset buttons' transform after you've hided the window. E.g.: ((TranslateTransform)((TransformGroup)topRightButton.RenderTransform)[3]).X = 0; ((TranslateTransform)((TransformGroup)topRightButton.RenderTransform)[3]).Y = 0; Hope I didn't make any mistake while casting. NB: You may also find useful this example from MSDN: How to: Control a Storyboard After It Starts
