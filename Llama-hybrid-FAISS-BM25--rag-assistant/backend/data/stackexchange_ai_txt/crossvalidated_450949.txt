Can't Handle Data Set with Text in Byte-Format

I am a beginner, starting to use a new .dta data set in Stata. It has variables like schooling and gender with storage type 'byte', which implies they are integers. However the individual entries are "highschool" or "female" . When I then try to stuff like drop schooling if gender==female it says female not found . And when I try it this way drop schooling if gender=="female" it says type mismatch . I'm confused as to what the actual problem is. I tried to convert the variables into strings with gen state1 = string(state) which only yielded a state1 variable full of "1" entries.
