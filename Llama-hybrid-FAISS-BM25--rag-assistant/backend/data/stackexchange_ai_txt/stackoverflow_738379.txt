Sounds like this would lead to more well-rounded developers, and also allow those who are experts in certain areas to continue to contribute their expertise. I haven't used Scrum much myself (yet), but from your description, these types of teams would lead to a team/organization that is also more well-rounded as a whole - and shouldn't that be the goal of any team?
