How to prepare data to analyze two values simultaneously as one

as a newbie in statistics I'm having trouble with preparing my data. I have data where a measure is performed on left and right side. When comparing group means I need to take simultaneously both measurement from left and right. So for example I have: Case Side_left SIde_right When analyzing means should be n=2xCases, so if I have 15 cases, my means is computed from 30 measurements, 15 from left and 15 from right. Simply creating averaged from left and right won't do the trick, because SD's are different, Also if I have missing value from one side, for 15 cases I'd have 29 measurements. By creating means first this information is omited. Is there a way to do it SPSS or any other software or manual solution.
