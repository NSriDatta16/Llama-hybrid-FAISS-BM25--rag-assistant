Here is a monkeyrunner script that sends touch and drags to an application. I have been using this to test that my application can handle rapid repetitive swipe gestures. # This is a monkeyrunner jython script that opens a connection to an Android # device and continually sends a stream of swipe and touch gestures. # # See http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/monkeyrunner_concepts.html # # usage: monkeyrunner swipe_monkey.py # # Imports the monkeyrunner modules used by this program from com.android.monkeyrunner import MonkeyRunner, MonkeyDevice # Connects to the current device device = MonkeyRunner.waitForConnection() # A swipe left from (x1, y) to (x2, y) in 2 steps y = 400 x1 = 100 x2 = 300 start = (x1, y) end = (x2, y) duration = 0.2 steps = 2 pause = 0.2 for i in range(1, 250): # Every so often inject a touch to spice things up! if i % 9 == 0: device.touch(x2, y, 'DOWN_AND_UP') MonkeyRunner.sleep(pause) # Swipe right device.drag(start, end, duration, steps) MonkeyRunner.sleep(pause) # Swipe left device.drag(end, start, duration, steps) MonkeyRunner.sleep(pause)
