How to add confidence to model's prediction?

I am a newbie in ML working on a time series prediction project. The objective is to predict the future outcome of a time series (int valued, with different upper bound, think of it as different sized parking lot availability prediction) based on its historical value. I'm currently using a regression approach using slide windows algorithm. I tried different ML models and they seem to be working okay(better than my baseline at least). Now I'm trying to add confidence to my prediction, something like "I have 95% confidence that the outcome would be 2". I'm thinking about using the prediction mean squared error as a metric. The problem is, Is it feasible to assume the prediction error follows gaussian distribution and add confidence based on that? What distribution should I use for highly discrete state space? For example, when there is only 4 possible states {0,1,2,3}, and I predicted 2.5 with mse 1, how can I distribute the possibility over those states? Any advice on the general model architecture and confidence set up will be appreciated!
