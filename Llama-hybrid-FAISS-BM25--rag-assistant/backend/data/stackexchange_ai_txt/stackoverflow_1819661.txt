Join queries taking more execution time than their corresponding nested queries

I have 2 tables Person_Organization and Person_Organization_other and nested query is : SELECT Person_Organization_id FROM Person_Organization_other WHERE company_name IN (SELECT company_name FROM Person_Organization_other WHERE Person_Organization_id IN (SELECT Person_Organization_Id FROM Person_Organization WHERE person_id = 117 AND delete_flag = 0) ) Whereas the above query's corresponding query with join that I tried is :- SELECT poo.Person_Organization_id FROM Person_Organization_other poo, Person_Organization_other poo1, Person_Organization po WHERE poo1.Person_Organization_id = po.Person_Organization_Id AND po.person_id = 117 AND po.delete_flag = 0 AND poo.company_name = poo1.company_name GROUP BY poo.Person_Organization_id However the nested query is found to take less time as compared to it's corresponding query with joins. I used SQL profiler trace to compare times of executed queries. For the nested query it took 30 odd ms. For the joined query it took 41 odd ms I was under the impression that as a rule nested queries are less perfomant and should be "flattened out" using joins. Could someone explain what I am doing wrong? regards Nitin
