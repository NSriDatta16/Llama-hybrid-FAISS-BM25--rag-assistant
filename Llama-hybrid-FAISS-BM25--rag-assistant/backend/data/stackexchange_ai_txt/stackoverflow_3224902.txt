Django: What is the most ideal place to store project-specific middleware?

I'm aware I can "store it anywhere in my python path" and all, but what's an organized pattern I can use to store middleware classes for my project? I am appending my project root directory and project directory to the sys path through mod_wsgi: sys.path.append( '/srv/' ) sys.path.append( '/srv/workarounds/' ) The latter line being the project root. As an example, let's say I want to apply this middleware class: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1179/ Would I just copy the snippet contents into a middleware.py file and dump it in my project root? Create a directory for middleware, add that directory to my python path?
