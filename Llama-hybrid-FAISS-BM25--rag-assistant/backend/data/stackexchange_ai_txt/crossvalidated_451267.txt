How to deal with a time series that has a trend but not a unit root?

I need to fit my VAR model, so I am trying to induce stationarity in all my variables. One in particular, Industrial Production for the euro area, is creating me some issues. Below you see why. There is a clear break which divides two trending series. What I do then, well I first log the variable and then difference it. This is the result: Before showing you the outcomes of the tests I performed, I want to say that I also subsetted the series around the break but the same problem persists. Coming to the analysis, If I read the outcomes of the tests correctly, this series doesn't have a unit root but it has a trend - it's trend stationary. Hence, despite not having unit root, I can't conclude it's covariance stationary. This is the outcome of ADF test that shows no unit root: ############################################### # Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Unit Root Test # ############################################### Test regression none Call: lm(formula = z.diff ~ z.lag.1 - 1 + z.diff.lag) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.044247 -0.005311 0.000850 0.007861 0.029896 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Is it wrong if I throw it in the vAR model with a stationary trend in it? Thanks so much for your help I include here the data of my orginal (not transformed) variable (monthly data from 2002-01 to 2018-09). Reproducible in R. df
