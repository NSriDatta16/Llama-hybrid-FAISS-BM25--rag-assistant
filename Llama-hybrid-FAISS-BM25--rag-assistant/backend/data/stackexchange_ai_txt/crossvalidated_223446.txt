variance of the mean of correlated and uncorrelated data

I read this paragraph in James et al, Introduction to Statistical Learning , p183-184 [1]: Since the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than does the test error estimate resulting from k-fold CV. Can you give me a numerical example e.g. in R to check the validity of this claim? I tried to check it using the following code: x = 1:100 #highly correlated data y = sample(100) #same data without correlation var(x) == var(y) # TRUE What is wrong with this code? LOOCV stands for "leave one out cross-validation" [1]: James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R.
