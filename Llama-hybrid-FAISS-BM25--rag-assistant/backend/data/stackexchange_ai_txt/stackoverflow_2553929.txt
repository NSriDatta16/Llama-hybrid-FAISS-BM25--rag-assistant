Max file size for File.ReadAllLines

I need to read and process a text file. My processing would be easier if I could use the File.ReadAllLines method but I'm not sure what is the maximum size of the file that could be read with this method without reading by chunks. I understand that the file size depends on the computer memory. But are still there any recommendations for an average machine?
