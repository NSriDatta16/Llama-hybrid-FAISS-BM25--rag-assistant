Another answer... from an intuitive perspective... The standard deviation is a measurement of the dispersion around the mean. Suppose you have two data sets distributed as below, set 1 is on the left and set 2 is on the right. The red points represents the mean of each set. In each set, the data points are close together. The standard deviation for set 1 is 3.74 (with a mean 8.7) and the one for set 2 is 4.72 (with a mean of 92). In both cases, the data points are "gathered" around their respective means, so their standard deviations are "similar" in terms of scale. If you average them, you get a standard deviation of 4.23. Now if we consider the entire data set (set 1 + set 2), the average has moved to the middle (green point)... In this configuration, the data points are quite scattered around the mean. The resulting standard deviation is 43! Very far from the averaged standard deviation of the two separate sets.
