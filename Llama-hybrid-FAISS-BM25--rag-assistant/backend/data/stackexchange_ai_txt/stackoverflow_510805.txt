Can a Win32 console application detect if it has been run from the explorer or not?

I have to create a console application which needs certain parameters. If they are missing or wrong I print out an error message. Now the problem: If someone starts the program from the explorer by double-clicking the console window disappears immediately. (But the application is not entirely useless from the explorer, you could drag files onto it and it would work) I could always wait for a keypress, but I don't want that if the user did start it from the command line. Is there some way to distinguish between these situations?
