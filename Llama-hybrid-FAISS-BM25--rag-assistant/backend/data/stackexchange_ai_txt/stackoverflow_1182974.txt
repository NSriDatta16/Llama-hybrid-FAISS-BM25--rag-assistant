I haven't solved the problem yet, but I think the ultimate solution to reputation, "karma" or any variation on finding a consensus among a group of people lies in Maynard Smith's work described in Evolution and the Theory of Games. Specifically, he develops the concept of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), which is behavior pattern that is robust against outside bad actors. If we assume that everyone is altruistic, then things are simple. What Maynard Smith calls the "Dove" strategy of always deferring to others is an efficient strategy in the sense that no one wastes time fighting. But it isn't an ESS, because it can be invaded from outside by selfish actors. This would be analogous to a site that only has upvotes. It would fail because anyone could vote anything to the top. More sophisticated systems like Stack Overflow and Slashdot encourage primarily upvotes, but allow for downvotes. They are more robust against people who are not "cooperating", but they are still vulnerable to "gaming". In both cases, it's easy to run up reputation quickly by being the first one to post, by posting something funny rather than useful, and similar actions.
