How do I determine what target is calling my current target in Nant?

I am modifying a Nant build script to run some unit tests. I have different targets for locally run tests and tests to be run on team city. in the target do-unit-tests I set up which test assemblies are run by setting a property and calling for NCover to do a code coverage run as follows: commandLineArgs="${test.args}" As you can see in the ncover part I need a property called "test.args" . This property depends on "test.assemblies" ie: " /> test.args needs to be set up differently between the locally run unit test and the one on team city ...so I'm trying to figure out how to set this up. if i put the property for test.args in "do-unit-test" after the property "test.assemblies" I can't specify one test.args if do-unit-test is called by run-unit-tests and another for run-unit-tests-teamcity. I've been trying to do something like the following in "do-unit-test": but obviously that doesn't work because the target will always exist. What I'd like then is to test if my current target do-unit-test has been called by run-unit-tests-teamcity Is this possible? I can't see it in the Nant documentation? Since its not there it either means that it will be a feature in the future or that I'm not understanding how things are specified in a Nant build script.
