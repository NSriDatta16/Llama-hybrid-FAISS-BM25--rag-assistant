Xcode : Missing icons for iOS apps in Organizer's archives

If I choose "build and archive" from XCode, the Organizer is launched and I can see a list of my archived applications. I have 4 different applications (with several archives each), but the icon that's displayed in Organizer for one of the apps is missing -- there is a question mark icon instead. The app does have an associated icon and it validates and submits to the app store without any issues. Why isn't Organizer picking up the icon correctly and how do I fix it?
