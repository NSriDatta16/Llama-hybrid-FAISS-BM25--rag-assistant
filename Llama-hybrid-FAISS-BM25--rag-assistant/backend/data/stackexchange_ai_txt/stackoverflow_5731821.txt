You'll have to read through the entire file at some point, unless you know beforehand how many prefixes and suffixes there are. Since I assume you don't, or that it can change and you don't want to maintain a number for storing that, you'll have to read through the file, and readline() is a good way of doing that. However, you can preprocess your text file so that it uses another format, such as a pickle file. In other words, read the text file into a dictionary, and pickle that dictionary. The dictionary might look something like this: dic = {'prefixes': ['Ae' ,'di', ...], 'suffixes': ['dar', 'kil', ...]} From the lenght of the arrays you can then determine what the maximum random number is. It should be more efficient than reading an entire file line-for-line each time. And if not, at least it's a bit more elegant solution.
