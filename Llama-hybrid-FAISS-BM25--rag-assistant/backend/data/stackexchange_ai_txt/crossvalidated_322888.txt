In this talk ( slides ) the presenters discuss their use of PCA to discriminate between high variability and low variability features. They actually prefer the low variability features for anomaly detection, since a significant shift in a low variability dimension is a strong indicator of anomalous behavior. The motivating example they provide is as follows: Assume a user always logs in from a Mac. The "operating system" dimension of their activity would be very low variance. But if we saw a login event from that same user where the "operating system" was Windows, that would be very interesting, and something we'd like to catch.
