SQL statement to select the value of the latest version of data based on the latest date

I have a simple query and am wondering if it could be more elegantly coded. The final solution has to be ansi-compliant. I need to fetch the latest value from a table based on date and version. A sample would explain more clearly: declare @t table (id int, due_date smalldatetime, version int, value nvarchar(10)) insert into @t select 3, '1/1/2010', 1, 'value 1' insert into @t select 3, '1/1/2010', 2, 'value 2' insert into @t select 3, '3/1/2010', 1, 'value 3' insert into @t select 3, '3/1/2010', 2, 'value 4' insert into @t select 3, '3/1/2010', 3, 'value 5' insert into @t select 3, '3/1/2010', 4, 'value 6' insert into @t select 3, '4/1/2010', 1, 'value 7' insert into @t select 3, '4/1/2010', 2, 'value 8' insert into @t select 3, '4/1/2010', 3, 'value 9' select value from @t t inner join (select due_date, version=max(version) from @t where due_date = (select max(due_date) from @t) group by due_date) maxes on t.due_date=maxes.due_date and t.version=maxes.version So I would expect the output to be value 9 which it is based on the above query. I'm not particulary happy with this solution - any better ways to accomplish this?
