OK I found a solution. Which is mostly a workaround. I should have thought of that earlier. What I'm doing is the following. I'm finding all projects and recursively all categories associated with projects. Now since cakephp does not translate categories I am using the results from the initial query and I am performing a second one only for categories but using the category id values that I found on the first query. Now cakephp translates categories since I'm only searching for them and I can have their data translated. At the moment I'm OK with this solution but it would be nice if first cakephp makes the translate behavior out of the box ready or secondly if someone had a behavior that could support retrieval of translation on associated models.
