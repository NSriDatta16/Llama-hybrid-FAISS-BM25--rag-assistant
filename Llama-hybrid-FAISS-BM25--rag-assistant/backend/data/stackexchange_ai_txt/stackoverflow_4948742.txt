You can leverage the SelectedItemTemplate and SelectedIndex attributes of your ListView to accomplish this. Change the CommandName property to "Select" in your ListItemTemplate. That way when the the postback occurs, the ListView will have the row index of the LinkButton you selected. You can then set your custom command to the CommandArgument paramter for any custom processing when the ItemSelected event is raised by clicking the LinkButton. Then in your SelectedItemTemplate, you can apply the class right there. Your ListView would look something like this: ' CommandName="Select" CommandArgument=' ' runat="server"/> ' CommandName="Select" CommandArgument=' ' CssClass="selected" runat="server"/>
