Using logistic regression vs Cox regression

Say I am interested in looking at the 5 year occurrence of an serious adverse drug reaction including mortality occurring in a group of patients being treated for a disease. I would imagine that because we are looking at the odds of whether someone is alive or not/experienced hospitalisation for the ADR or not at the time point of 5 years, then that would require logistic regression. I imagine Cox may be more suited to a question asking what the survival is post-cancer, as it looks at the time to event. However, when I look at papers modelling adverse drug reactions, I see a Cox proportional hazards model is frequently used to estimate hazard ratios. Any guidance on what I am misunderstanding would be much appreciated.
