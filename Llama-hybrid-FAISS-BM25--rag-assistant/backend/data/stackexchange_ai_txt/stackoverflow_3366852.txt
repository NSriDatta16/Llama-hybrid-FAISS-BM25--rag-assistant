Scalable, fast, text file backed database engine?

I am dealing with large amounts of scientific data that are stored in tab separated .tsv files. The typical operations to be performed are reading several large files, filtering out only certain columns/rows, joining with other sources of data, adding calculated values and writing the result as another .tsv. The plain text is used for its robustness, longevity and self-documenting character. Storing the data in another format is not an option, it has to stay open and easy to process. There is a lot of data (tens of TBs), and it is not affordable to load a copy into a relational database (we would have to buy twice as much storage space). Since I am mostly doing selects and joins, I realized I basically need a database engine with .tsv based backing store. I do not care about transactions, since my data is all write-once-read-many. I need to process the data in-place, without a major conversion step and data cloning. As there is a lot of data to be queried this way, I need to process it efficiently, utilizing caching and a grid of computers. Does anyone know of a system that would provide database-like capabilities, while using plain tab-separated files as backend? It seems to me like a very generic problem, that virtually all scientists get to deal with in one way or the other.
