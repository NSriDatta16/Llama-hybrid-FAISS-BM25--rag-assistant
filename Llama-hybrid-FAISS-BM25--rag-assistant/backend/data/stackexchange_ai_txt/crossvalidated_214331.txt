Standardization and prediction on new data

As far as I know it is common practice to do standardization of variables before shrinkage or PCA, which are methods I intend to use on my model selection for a predictive model. But the problem is, how do I use the model with standardize coefs on future data. Do I simply assume that future data has the same distribution as my current or are there work arounds?
