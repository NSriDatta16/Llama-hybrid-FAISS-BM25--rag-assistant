Obtaining log-odds coefficients instead of proportions in output of post-hoc tests in emmeans package

I got in trouble for posting this on Stack Overflow a few days ago. It seemed to me more of a coding question than a statistical question (i.e. what argument to use in the emmeans package to obtain proportions), but the responder had 290k reputation so I will defer to their judgement and post here. I conducted a multinomial logistic regression examining the difference in log-odds of respondents indicating they treated a range of different medical conditions ( pain , sleep , mental-health/substance use ( mhsu ) and all other conditions ( allOther )) with either licit or illicit medical cannabis. Here is the toy data df And the proportions of each type of condition reported for each type of cannabis ( perc column is %) mcType cond n tot perc 1 illicit pain 491 1207 40.7 2 illicit sleep 148 1207 12.3 3 illicit mhsu 360 1207 29.8 4 illicit allOther 208 1207 17.2 5 licit pain 280 534 52.4 6 licit sleep 31 534 5.81 7 licit mhsu 141 534 26.4 8 licit allOther 82 534 15.4 Now I want to see whether there are differences in the relative proportion of respondents indicating each type of condition based on the type of cannabis they report using. So I ran a multinomial logistic regression using multinom() in the nnet package. summary(mm Now the coefficients for this regression are clearly in log-odds. Now I want to run test of simple effects. So I turned, as always, to the emmeans package # testing effect of mc type at each level of condition (em_mcTypeByCond Now these coefficients are clearly proportions. This is fine, but when I go to actually run the tests using the pairs() function (mcTypeByCond_test The coefficients also seem to be in differences in proportions, not log-odds. So my question is are these propotions, and, if so, how do I get the coefficients reported in log-odds? . I have tried searching the web for answers but have come up with nothing. I tried adding the argument type = "response" but it had no discernible effect on the output. It seems to be very automatic behaviour to me so I'm wondering if there isn't some interaction between nnet::multinom() and emmeans that I am not aware of: emmeans is compatible with so many packages it's hard to find any info and The help for ?summary.emmGrid is no help, at least not to me.
