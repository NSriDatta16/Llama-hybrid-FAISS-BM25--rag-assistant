reportviewer control issue

I am using VSTS 2008 + C# + .Net 3.5 + ASP.Net + SQL Server 2008 Enterprise to learn how to use reportviewer. Under the toolbox and under Data Tab, I learned there should be reportviewer control which I can drag into aspx page designer. But I can not find reportviewer control. Any ideas what is wrong?
