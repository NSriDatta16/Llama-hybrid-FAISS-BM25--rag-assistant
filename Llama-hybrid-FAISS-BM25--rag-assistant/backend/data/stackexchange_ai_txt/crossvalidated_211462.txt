I have experience working on a similar data set. The positive response rate in my case is less than 0.01%. So it is pretty rare. I don't know what's the positive response rate in your case. I have tried hurdle models (because of the huge amount of negative responses in my sample), glm, glm mixed, and some regulated regressions, for example, elastic net and ridge regression, and also some machine learning methods, for example, regression trees, random forests, discriminant analysis. I've also tried to boost each single one of the above mentioned methods. Specificly, for the logistic regression, to get predictions you use predict(fit, newdata,type='response') This way you get the 1/0 predictions for your $newdata$. I recommend you to try what I have tried in my case, and also methods mentioned by other people here. A good reference book is An introduction to statistical learning by Gareth James and others: you can easily find an online version on google.
