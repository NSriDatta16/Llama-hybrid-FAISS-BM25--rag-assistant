Validate hash keys/values

I am trying to validate the values of certain keys in a hash: response[:payment_status] == 'Completed' && response[:receiver_email] == 'test@example.com' && response[:foo] == 'Bar' While the above approach works I am quite sure there is a more elegant solution. I would hate to have a really long line if I add extra keys/values I want to validate. P.S: I should mention I want a simple true/false returned.
