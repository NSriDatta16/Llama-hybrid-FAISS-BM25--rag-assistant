If the overfitting keeps on happening then I would suggest taking a look at the number of hidden layers you're using and the nodes per hidden layer. The error will differ based on seeds but these two (hidden layers and neurons) combining has a bigger impact. There's a vast literature available online but the suggestion from Introduction to Neural Networks for Java by Jeff Heaton worked fine for me.
