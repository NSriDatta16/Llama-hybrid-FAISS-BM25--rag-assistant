The first version would never work. PHP only cares about pairs and utterly ignores anything outside of them. The IE conditional comments are only used by the browser, so the include would get executed on the server every time. The second version has the logic reversed - you're including the file anytime IE6 is detected. you'd want !preg_match instead. However, remember that the user agent string is under user control and can be faked/hacked/subverted. There's no 100% reliable method of detecting the remote browser that can't be subverted somehow.
