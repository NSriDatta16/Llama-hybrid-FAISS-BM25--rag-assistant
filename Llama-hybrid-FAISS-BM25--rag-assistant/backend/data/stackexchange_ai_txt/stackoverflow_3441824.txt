I thought Joel's article was pretty much spot on - it is the history behind the evolution of character sets and storage which has brought this about. FWIW, in my oversimplistic view Character Sets (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE) would be the numeric representation of characters, independent of storage considerations Encoding would relate to the efficient storage of characters, ANSI, UTF-7, UTF-8 etc, for file, across the wire etc Code Page would be the 'kluge' needed when the demand for the addition of new characters (without wanting to increase storage capacity) meant that (certain) characters were only knowable in the additional context of a code page. IMHO Wikipedia currently doesn't help things by defining code page as 'another name for character encoding' and redirecting 'character set' to 'character encoding'
