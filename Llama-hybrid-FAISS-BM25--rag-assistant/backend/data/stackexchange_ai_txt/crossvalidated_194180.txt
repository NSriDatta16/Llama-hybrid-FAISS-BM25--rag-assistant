If I used a dynamic time warping based clustering method to segment the set of time series into separate clusters, would those clusters tend to be the same in a topological sense? (i.e. they each describe dynamical systems that have the same number of attractors with the same stability types?) Unless you restrict yourself to a very narrow range of dynamical systems: No. And if you make that restriction, there are far easier ways of classifying your dynamics. The only thing you can expect to separate are fixed points from periodic time series from chaotic and noise-dominated time series and there are easier and more robust ways to separate those. A subcategorisation as you want it will be problematic for the following reasons: Fixed-point time series do not give you any information to begin with. All you have is noise kicking the system away from the fixed point and the dynamics bringing it back. You cannot make any reasonable statement of what else there might be in your system. (Of course your noise might be strong enough to kick the system to another attractor, but then you can only observe noise.) Periodic time series can look anything from sinusoidal over sawtooth-like to complex mixed-mode oscillations. But what you get is only mildly correlated to your phase-space topology. If your only invariant set is a limit cycle, the time series may still take all sort of forms. Chaotic time series will be like noise to your approach and finding anything else about the phase space is nigh impossible just from the time series. Moreover, even with techniques aimed at this, it is very difficult to separate chaotic time series from noise.
