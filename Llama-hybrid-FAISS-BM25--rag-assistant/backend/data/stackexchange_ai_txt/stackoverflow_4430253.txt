Since UIView inherits from UIResponder , you can create a new subclass of UIView and use that instead, overriding only the touch-related methods: –touchesBegan:withEvent: –touchesMoved:withEvent: –touchesEnded:withEvent: –touchesCancelled:withEvent: Also be sure to read the Event Handling Guide for iOS .
