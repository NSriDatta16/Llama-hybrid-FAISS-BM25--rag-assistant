Do you have an example of an article where this approach is not good enough? How are you evaluating different approaches? If you have a bunch of articles where you have labels for who the main protagonist is, you could frame this as a supervised ML problem. You'd want to featurize the articles appropriately, eg. into a vector of the top-K most commonly-occurring candidate entities in each article (each represented as an embedding vector from some pretrained model along with an extra dimension that includes the count of the entity in the article, and perhaps another extra dimension that quantifies where in the article this entity is mostly mentioned). Then this could be a standard multi-class classification task with K-classes (which of the top-K entities is the main protagonist).
