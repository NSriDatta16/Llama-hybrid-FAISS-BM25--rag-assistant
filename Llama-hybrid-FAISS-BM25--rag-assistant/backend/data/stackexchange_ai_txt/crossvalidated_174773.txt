I think after you get you intercept and $\beta$ from the logistic regression you can directly calculate the probability for Sepal.Lenth=4.3 Here is the R code to do the logistic regression iris$Species_new results: #Call: glm(formula = Species_new ~ Sepal.Length, family = "binomial", data = iris) #Coefficients: #(Intercept) Sepal.Length #27.829 -5.176 #Degrees of Freedom: 149 Total (i.e. Null); 148 Residual #Null Deviance: 191 #Residual Deviance: 71.84 AIC: 75.84 Now your logistic regression model is: $log\frac{p}{1-p}=27.829-5.176x \tag{1}$ $x$ is the Sepal.Length Now Sepal.Length=$4.3$ plug this value into (1) $log\frac{p}{1-p}=27.829-5.176*4.3$ It is easy to solve this equation: $\frac{p}{1-p}=e^{(27.829-5.176*4.3)}$ Solve this we get $p=0.9962123$ Let us check what the computer get automatically, p_i You need to check the 14th data point for $p_i$ which is Sepal.Length=4.3 The $p$ is 0.9962154 It is almost the same as calculated by hand, the difference is only caused by different float point I think.
