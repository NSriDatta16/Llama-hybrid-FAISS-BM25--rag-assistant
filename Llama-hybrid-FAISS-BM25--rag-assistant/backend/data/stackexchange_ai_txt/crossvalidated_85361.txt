I would like to see the entire model included somewhere in the paper, probably in the methods section or in a supplement/appendix. If it the model is huge, a table is a nice way to present this. You could even organize the table to distinguish between "interesting" variables (e.g., drug dose) and boring covariates that are likely to be trivially true (e.g., rater). I saw this done recently and thought it was very convenient, but I'm having a hard time tracking the paper down. However, once you've "disclosed" your model, there's no need to give equal time to each of its components when discussing the results. You could ignore the covariates completely, or you could start the results section with something like After controlling for observer bias (see complete model in Appendix 1), we found that.... If the bias is particularly surprising or you have done something to control it (e.g., provide raters with a standardized rubric), then it might be worth a slightly longer mention.
