The best book to read for introduction to graphics-oriented fluid simulation is "Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics" by Robert Bridson (disclaimer: he was my PhD advisor). http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/fluidbook/ Ultimately, there is plenty of math involved, but there's also plenty of code examples to clarify things for the less math-inclined. It covers mainly the cell-based approach you mentioned. The other main alternative is "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics" or SPH. Matthias Muller has some papers about this if you're looking to get started.
