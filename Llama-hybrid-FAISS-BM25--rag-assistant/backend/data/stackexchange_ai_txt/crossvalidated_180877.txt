First let's deal with your first problem (sample size changes). I will think about the second problem later.. I would probably assume that all the observations of a given procedure have the same distribution, no matter what the year is. So for example for procedure A I would make the assumption that you draw: $ X_A \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_A, \sigma_A^2) $ This would mean that for year $t$, if I denote by $\bar{X}_{A,t}$ the average across that year and $N_{A,t}$ the measurements you got that year, then (under independence): $$ \bar{X}_{A,t} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_A, \frac{\sigma_A^2}{N_{A,t}}\right)$$ Now assume that all observations are also independent across years, then you can get an estimate of $\mu_A, \sigma_A$ based on just $\bar{X}_{A,t}, t \in \{t_0\cdots,t_f\}$. For example the maximum likelihood estimates are: $$ \hat{\mu_A} = \frac{\sum_t \bar{X}_{A,t} N_{A,t}}{\sum_t N_{A,t}} $$ and $$ \hat{\sigma_A^2} = \frac{\sum_t (\bar{X}_{A,t}-\hat{\mu_A})^2 N_{A,t}}{\sum_t N_{A,t}} $$ Now calculate the same things also for $X_B$ and then just go ahead and do a Welch t-test using these estimates. I have not thought about what happens to the degrees of freedom though, but if you have enough samples you could just compare to a standard normal.
