Deep learning outperforms classical machine learning methods in terms of quality of solutions, it's also less complicated to implement universal solutions. Since DL was born you don't need to focus on features, because you expect that model will recognize the most useful of them from the data by itself (this is the strongest point). You should only provide the exact capability of the model to catch all needed features and don't allow to catch noises or overfit. It's much simpler. You can try preparing models with features descriptors and then use SVM, however SVM computation complexity is high, memory consumption is extremely high and it's hard to processing data in parallel. On the other hand computation of DNN are matrix-based and is relatively simple, finally can be easily done in parallel. Because of that SVM can't handle a large amount of data, it's much faster to do it on GPU-based DNN. The amount of training data is key to the quality of a solution. Many papers confirm that the classical approach performs worse than DL. Finally, you can prepare DNN for less class and much simpler tasks.
