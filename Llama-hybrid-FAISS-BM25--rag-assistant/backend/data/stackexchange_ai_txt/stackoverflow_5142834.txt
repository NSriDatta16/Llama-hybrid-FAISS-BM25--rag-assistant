Your app won't have access to the screen when the call is ringing. Press power and home buttons together to do a system screenshot? Use the screenshots section in the Xcode Organizer to capture the screen while tethered? When a call is in progress you can press Home and re-open your app. At that point you could use UIGraphicsBeginImageContext but it probably won't include the statusbar or green 'in progress' bar.
