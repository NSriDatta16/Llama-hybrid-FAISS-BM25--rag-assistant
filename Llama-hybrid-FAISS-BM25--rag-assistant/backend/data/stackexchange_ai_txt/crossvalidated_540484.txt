Is the "real world" distinction between trend stationary and difference stationary ultimately a matter of judgement?

I am new to time series analysis. I am having trouble distinguishing between trend- and difference stationary time series: my application is a VARX model. Consider the following plot of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in the US from 1960 through 2019 (data below). If I run the ADF and KPSS tests with a linear trend on this series I get the following test statistics and $p$ -values: Results of Dickey-Fuller Test: Test Statistic -2.573359 p-value 0.292306 #Lags Used 2.000000 Number of Observations Used 57.000000 Critical Value (1%) -4.127070 Critical Value (5%) -3.490541 Critical Value (10%) -3.173740 Results of KPSS Test: Test Statistic 0.172378 p-value 0.028019 Lags Used 4.000000 Critical Value (10%) 0.119000 Critical Value (5%) 0.146000 Critical Value (2.5%) 0.176000 Critical Value (1%) 0.216000 Clearly, the series is not linear-trend stationary. So I use statsmodel 's detrend function to investigate further; the plots of a linear, quadratic, and cubic detrending look like I see that there is not much difference between the quadratic and cubic cases, so a quadratic detrending should suffice. Indeed, when I run the ADF and KPSS tests (now with no trend) on the quadratically-detrended series I obtain Results of Dickey-Fuller Test: Test Statistic -4.743919 p-value 0.000070 #Lags Used 1.000000 Number of Observations Used 58.000000 Critical Value (1%) -3.548494 Critical Value (5%) -2.912837 Critical Value (10%) -2.594129 Results of KPSS Test: Test Statistic 0.063162 p-value 0.100000 Lags Used 3.000000 Critical Value (10%) 0.347000 Critical Value (5%) 0.463000 Critical Value (2.5%) 0.574000 Critical Value (1%) 0.739000 InterpolationWarning: The test statistic is outside of the range of p-values available in the look-up table. The actual p-value is greater than the p-value returned. I conclude that I can run a VAR model on the quadratically-detrended series (or alternatively, include these trend terms in the regression). I like this conclusion, since it accords with my economic intuition that a time series like GFCF should be mean reverting. However , I could just as well have differenced my data to make it stationary. Indeed, a single difference passes both statistical tests, but since I see visually that there is a slight trend in the first differenced series, I take two differences just to be on the safe side.

The actual p-value is greater than the p-value returned. Needless to say, my conclusion regarding the type of stationarity in my series makes a big difference for my VARX model. Hence my questions: Is there any (statisatical) reason to go with one type of stationarity? Am I missing anything in my analysis, e.g. could the series be both trend and difference stationary? More generally, is the final decision ultimately a matter of interpretation and judgement? I am inclined to believe this: according to this webpage , "Unfortunately, for any finite amount of data there is a deterministic and stochastic trend that fits the data equally well."
