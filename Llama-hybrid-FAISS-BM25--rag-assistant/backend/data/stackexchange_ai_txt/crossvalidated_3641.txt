Forecasting Age distribution

I would like to project the data in this graph for at least 4 or 5 periods. Unfortunately, that won't be possible with a moving average. A regression will result in negative values after the 3rd period. What are my forecasting options? Basically, what i'm trying to do, is predict where the boomer hump is gonna be based soley on the population and age per year data EDIT AT work we have lots of image sites blocked, here's the image in case you can't see it. EDIT 2 Updated Image
