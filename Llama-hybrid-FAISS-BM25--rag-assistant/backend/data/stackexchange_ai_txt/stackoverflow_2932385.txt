I think the easiest solution is to modify your application to accept a directory as the parameter as opposed to a list of files. This would allow you to copy the multiple files into a single directory. You can then drag and drop the folder onto your executable. It would then run a command like "c:\myapp.exe \folder-with-files-in-it" which should not run into the command line parameter limitation that you are experiencing now.
