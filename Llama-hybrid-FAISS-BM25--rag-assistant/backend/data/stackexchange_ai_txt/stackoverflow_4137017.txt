You may be able to leverage Stephen Lebans' SaveRelationshipView for this. His code saves properties for each item from the Relationships view to a table. Later the same layout view can be recreated from the table. You could adjust your copy of the Relationships view to determine the values to include for a new row in the tblRelationshipViews table. Then let the users recreate their Relationships view based on the updated table information. Perhaps you could even automate to do it for them automatically.
