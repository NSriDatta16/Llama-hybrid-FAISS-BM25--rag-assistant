One thing I saw running your example: >> agent = WWW::Mechanize.new !!!!! DEPRECATION NOTICE !!!!! The WWW constant is deprecated, please switch to the new top-level Mechanize constant. WWW will be removed in Mechanize version 2.0 You've referenced the WWW constant from (irb):3:in `irb_binding', please switch the "WWW" to "Mechanize". Thanks! Sincerely, Pew Pew Pew I don't have an account on that system so logging in won't work for me. What do you see if you run your initial steps in IRB?
