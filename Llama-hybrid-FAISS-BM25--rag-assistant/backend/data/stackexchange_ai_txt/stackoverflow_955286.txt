Is your client a programmer? Non-programmers should never dictate how long a programming task should take. If you're cowboy coding without testing "today" would probably suffice, but any sane and professional development shop would never let this happen. Now let's clarify what your client really told you to do : Your dev seems to be assuming that he has to support adding/uploading videos from your CMS. If your dev is going to use a 3rd party API like YouTube, 2 sounds reasonable. If you're going to serve it on your own site, it'd take at least a week's worth of programming to make sure your site can take such a heavy load of streaming data -- it's stupid, not to mention highly irresponsible, to assume it could be worked out in a day. Now, if you're client is only really talking about embedding videos in blog entries or articles, that's a very trivial task: YouTube, Vimeo and other video sharing sites already supply the HTML embed code that's needed to display a video on a page. In fact that's a zero effort task assuming that your blog entry editor properly parses the embed code, or has an Edit HTML feature. So, which one is which?
