Your question has two separate aspects - one is the interpretation of the outputs of statistical models and the other one is the ranking of random variables based on their probability distribution. It is easiest to answer the kind of questions you are describing in a Bayesian framework, since in that case you can describe everything probabilistically - that is, you actually get a probability distribution for every prediction (as depicted in your plot). so for example if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the failure times of two observations you can use those distributions to calculate for example $P(t_1 > t_2) = \int_{t_1>t_2}f_1(t_1)f_2(t_2)dt_1dt_2$ which will tell you how likely it is for $t_1$ to happen after $t_2$ . However just as with any random variables there is no unique way of ranking the outputs. You could also calculate for example the expected values $\mathbb E[t_1]$ and $\mathbb E[t_2]$ , and it is possible to have at the same time $\mathbb E[t_1] > \mathbb E[t_2]$ and $P(t_2 > t_1) > 1/2$ , that is, the expected value of $t_1$ can be larger but $t_2 > t_1$ is more likely than $t_1 > t_2$ . So, you will have to decide based on which criterion you want to rank them (this is somewhat similar to the analysis of risk vs. expected value in finance, see e.g. Mean-variance analysis ). In a classification case where the model outputs probabilities this is more straightforward, and it does makes sense to rank based on the level of certainty. However keep in mind that usually those models don't perform a full Bayesian calculation so there can be issues with the Calibration of those probabilities.
