-when a significant amount of your coding time is devoted to "where do I put this code?" -when reasoning about side-effects starts to become really hard. -when there's a significant amount of code that's just "in there", and nobody knows what it does or if it's still running but it's too scary to remove -when lots of team members spend significant chunks of their time chasing down intermittent bugs caused by some empty string somewhere in the data where it wasn't expected, or something that you think would usually be caught in a well-written application, in some edge case -when, in considering how to implement a new feature, "complete rewrite" starts to seem like a good answer -when you dread looking at the mess of code you need to maintain and wish you could find work building something clean and logical instead of dumpster diving through the detritus of someone else's poorly organized thinking
