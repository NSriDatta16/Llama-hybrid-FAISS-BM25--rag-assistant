There has been a fair amount of discussion of Lua on the iPhone on the Lua list . It appears that Apple is touchy about allowing user-supplied scripts, but has approved apps that used Lua internally as an implementation language. I know I've seen reference to several approaches to wrapping iPhone goodies mentioned, but since I'm not personally an iPhone developer (or even user) I haven't paid attention to the details.
