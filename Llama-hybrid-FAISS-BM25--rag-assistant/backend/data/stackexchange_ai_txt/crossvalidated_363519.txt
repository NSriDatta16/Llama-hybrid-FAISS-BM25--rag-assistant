Wise sense stationarity implies weak or covariance stationarity, i.e only the first two moments(mean and variance) are time-invariant or constant. A white noise time series in its simplest form has 0 mean, constant variance and is serially uncorrelated. Hence white noise implies wide-sense stationarity
