Machine learning strategy for imbalanced data with high number of examples

I am working on a classification problem , with unbalanced classes : Number of positive examples: ~200k; Number of negative example is ~230 Millions examples. The only two requirements that I have is: Using AUC for evaluation and the evaluation should be at natural rate i.e. 200k/230M = 0.0008. My question here is, knowing that using all that data is quite impossible because of performance constraints (currently the limit is around 6M sample of the data), what would be the strategy to train, cv and test a model ? Two propositions came up, we can't decide which one is the best practice in this case: Train on 6M neg + 190k pos, Crossvalidation using natural rate, Test using natural rate Train on 6M neg + 5k pos (natural rate), CV and Test are all in natural rate
