You should as well add it in your attribute on the server side. If you're using Magento Entreprise Edition , you can simply edit the company attribute through back end, and set it to "required" . If you're working with a Community Edition , you'll have to manually change this value with SQL . It's in eav_attribute table, the attribute_code is company and you just need to set is_required to 1 .
