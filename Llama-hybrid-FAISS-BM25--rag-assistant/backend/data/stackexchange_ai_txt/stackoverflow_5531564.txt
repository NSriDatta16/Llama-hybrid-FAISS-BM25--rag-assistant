As i posted on the related github issue posted by filipe, using a "schemaless" database like couchdb is probably the way to go, when you want to version schemas+data elegantly. Doing automatic model transformations on schema transformations is surely posible, but my experience is that schema transformations alone are fragile and require a lot of care and testing. there are quite a lot of nosql databases outthere, and deciding if couchdb or hbase or [insert your nosql database of choice] is ok for your needs will depend a lot on your use case.
