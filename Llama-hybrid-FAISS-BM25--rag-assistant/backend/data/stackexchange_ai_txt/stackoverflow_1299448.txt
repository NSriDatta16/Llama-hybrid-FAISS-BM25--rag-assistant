Thanks for the replies everyone! Meanwhile, I have just stumbled upon a workaround. To preface, I have to clarify/correct two things for my particular case: The problem only occurs when hovering over the links in the Tasks section. The jump doesn't necessarily go to the top-of-page. Rather, it goes to wherever the original landing spot was when you opened the doc. (In URL parlance this is the fragment, e.g. #//apple_ref... ). On to the workaround: In the Xcode doc viewer (and even in Safari), there should be a "Jump To..." drop-down in the "developer-documentation" window located to the right (and as a peer) of the "table of contents" expander when this problem occurs. You only need click on it once, dismiss it, and then the jumping problem goes away!
