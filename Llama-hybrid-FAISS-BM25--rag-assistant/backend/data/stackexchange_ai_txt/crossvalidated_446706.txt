It is easy to see that the sign of scores does not matter when using PCA for classification or clustering. But it seems to matter for regression. Consider a case where you have just one principal component or one common factor underlying several variables. Then lm(y ~ PC1) will give you different predictions of y compared to lm(y ~ -PC1). If y and PC1 have a positive linear relationship, y and -PC1 have a negative linear relationship. Maybe for regression, you should consider other alternatives discussed here , for example lasso regression.
