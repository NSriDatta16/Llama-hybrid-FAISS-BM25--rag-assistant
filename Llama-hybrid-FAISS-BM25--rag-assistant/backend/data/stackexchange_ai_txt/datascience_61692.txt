What does dimension represent in GloVe pre-trained word vectors?

I'm using GloVe pre-trained word vectors ( glove.6b.50d.txt , glove.6b.300d.txt ) as word embedding. I have a conceptual question: What is the difference between these files? On the other hand, what does the dimension represent in the GloVe pre-trained word vectors?
