Cost-sensitive SVM with sklearn

Is there a direct cost-sensitive implementation of the SVM classifiers (CS-SVM) within the sklearn module? There are several ad hoc methods for the cost-sensitive SVM on "the market", but I am wondering whether there is a simple way to integrate a CS-SVM into a python pipeline.
