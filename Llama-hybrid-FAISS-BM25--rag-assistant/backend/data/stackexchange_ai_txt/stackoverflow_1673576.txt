How to detect a word in an Image

I need to find out the word in an image where user has clicked. So far i have succeeded in OCRing the image. I have a picturebox control in my c# app. user can draw a box around any text and drag it to a textbox to fill the textbox with it. I have completed this. But now i have a new requirement saying user can select a textbox and then click on a word in the image so that the word is filled in the text box. I have no clue on how to proceed. How can i cut the word portion alone from the image and give it to OCR. User can click on any part of the word. Please give me any pointers. What algorithm should i follow to find the boundaries of the word on which user clicks. IF i found the boundaries i can cut it from the image using copyfromscreen method and will give it to ocr engine to get the text. Hope i made my problem clear here. Thanks and Regards, Dinesh.
