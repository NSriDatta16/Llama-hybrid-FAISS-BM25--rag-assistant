Are pipelines capable of cacheing intermediate results?

I use pandas to do feature extraction for machine learning. I hope to achieve the following: Consider I have five data processing steps done sequentially, and if I execute them once, the results will be saved automatically. Next time, if I change e.g. the fourth step, the library will automatically start from third step. Would this cache function be supported in pandas or sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline or other data processing libraries naturally without our need to save them explicitly?
