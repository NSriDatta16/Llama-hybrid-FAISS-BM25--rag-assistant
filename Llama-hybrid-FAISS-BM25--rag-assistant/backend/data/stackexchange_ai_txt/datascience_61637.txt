Time Series segmentation

I have a time series graph that is segmented into a few parts based on the maintenance day. You can think of it like vertical lines appearing out of the x axis which symbolize maintenance at the date. I would like to find out the relationship between the segmentation to predict what would happen to the signal after a maintenance day. Is there any way to tackle that problem? How should i solve it?
