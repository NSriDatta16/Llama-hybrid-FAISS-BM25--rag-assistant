I have not seen such case which descriptors are matrices. However, I have a little experience about PCA and I know that it makes normalized linear combinations of descriptors and sort them based on their scores. So your sentence "I can sum all the matrices in order to have only one descriptor (merging)" , does not make sense at all. I strongly recommend you download (free) book " Introduction to statistical learning " from here and read PCA section. You will obtain a good understanding about the PCA.
