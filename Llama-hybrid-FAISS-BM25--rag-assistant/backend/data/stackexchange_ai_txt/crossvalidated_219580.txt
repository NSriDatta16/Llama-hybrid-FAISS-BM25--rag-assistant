What imputation methods can be used for missing not at random covariate values in a survival analysis?

I'm new to survival analysis and trying to understand how to use it properly. My dataset is a time series dataset where most dependent variable values are available, 2 dependent variable values are right-censored, and some covariate values are missing before a time threshold (say before 1964, so not at random, since these values were not recorded/unavailable). The imputation methods I've read about (e.g., MI) seem to handle only missing dependent variable values but not missing covariates. What would be some appropriate imputation methods to use here? Thank you.
