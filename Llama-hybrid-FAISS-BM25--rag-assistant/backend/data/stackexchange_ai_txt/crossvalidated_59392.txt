Should you ever standardise binary variables?

I have a data set with a set of features. Some of them are binary $(1=$ active or fired, $0=$ inactive or dormant), and the rest are real valued, e.g. $4564.342$. I want to feed this data to a machine learning algorithm, so I $z$-score all the real-valued features. I get them between ranges $3$ and $-2$ approximately. Now the binary values are also $z$-scored, therefore the zeros become $-0.222$ and the ones become $0.5555$. Does standardising binary variables like this make sense?
