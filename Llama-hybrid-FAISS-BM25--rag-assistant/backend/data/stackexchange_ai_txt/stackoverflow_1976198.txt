This is a prime example for what a service layer is used for: (Article with more indepth descriptions of the various layers) You can stick with your MVC architecture, but now the controller calls upon your service layer (a seperate class library project in your solution), for any business logic methods. It sits on top of the domain and repository and allows you to perform business related actions between any project using the service layer. This way your business rules aren't spread all over in your controller and your controller is left to do its job: retrieve and organize data to be passed into the view. In this way, you can have your client application and your web application both reference the same service layer project and share the business logic code between them.
