Posthoc test for zero-altered models (hurdle, ZNAB)

I have created a zero-altered negative binomial model (ZNAB, using the hurdle function in R). This model consists of two parts, one which analysis zero values, and the other analysing positive values between variables. Now, I assume I would have to continue with two posthoc tests to find differences between categories of a variable. I'm not sure how to do this, as the lsmeans function considers and outputs averages, I think. How would you analyze these two model compartments separately?
