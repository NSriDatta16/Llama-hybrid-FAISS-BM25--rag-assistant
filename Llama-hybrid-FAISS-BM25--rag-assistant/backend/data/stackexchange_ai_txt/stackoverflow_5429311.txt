Have you made sure that the appropriate permissions for writing to/reading from an external storage device have been set in your Manifest.xml file? Also, does the code exit with any of the exceptions above? Print more illustrative messages than the stacktrace. Something like so: try { } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { Log.v(this.toString(), "Exception caught in block"); } or something on these lines.. HTH Sriram
