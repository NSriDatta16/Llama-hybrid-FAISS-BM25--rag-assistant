Edit: after the edit in the question, 1) does not relate so much anymore, but 2) still does. It depends a bit on the form of the location data. If you have a segmentation mask (i.e. another image with two colors denoting for each pixel if it belongs to the object or not), then going with another channel as n1k31t4 suggested might be a good idea. If you have the coordinates or something in a vector form, Figure 2 in this paper shows a way to put the information together. Essentially, the authors concatenate the additional info (in your case the location data) to the output of the feature extractor and feed that into the classifier of the CNN.
