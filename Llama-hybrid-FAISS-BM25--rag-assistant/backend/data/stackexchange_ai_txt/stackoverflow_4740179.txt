What's the difference between and in Office Open XML?

What's the difference between these two Office Open XML fragments? btyler and btyler note: The second sample I created manually based on the spec, the first is from an actual Excel workbook. Both seem valid and pretty much identical according to the spec, so I'm wondering why there is t="str" when seemingly does the same thing. When does Excel choose to use one over the other?
