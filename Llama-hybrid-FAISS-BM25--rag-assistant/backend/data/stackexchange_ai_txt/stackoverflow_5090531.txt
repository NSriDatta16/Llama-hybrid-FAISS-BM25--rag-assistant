CellSetGrid is an Open Source ASP .Net (c#) control, which offers pivot table like functionality. This used to be available for download in this site: http://www.SQLServerAnalysisServices.com Now the site does not host this control anymore. So I have uploaded the source of the control - CellSetGrid here . You can build the source Add this as a Control in Visual Studio toolbox. Drag and Drop control to a web form Set the connection string to the cube This will show all the dimensions and measure groups so you can drag n drop what you want to get a pivot table like functionality
