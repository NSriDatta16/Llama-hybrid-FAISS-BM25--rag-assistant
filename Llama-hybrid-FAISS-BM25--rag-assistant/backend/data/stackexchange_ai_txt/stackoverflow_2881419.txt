Not enough storage is available to complete this operation - Program or Storage memory?

I've been given a Windows Mobile app written in .Net CF 3.5 to fix, and one of the problems is to do with storage. The message 'Not enough storage is available to complete this operation' has appeared a few times - it's logged in the SQL CE database, and always happens during data access (but not the same bit of data access). The thing I'm slightly confused about is whether this refers to Program Memory (e.g. RAM) or Storage Memory (e..g permanent storage). It would appear to be storage memory, but the devices seem to have plenty free. While there are some OutOfMemoryExceptions, these appear totally unrelated to this problem (in that that happen at a different time due to an image-related issue). We're using SQL CE 3.5 with a single connection, which is stored along with the app on the device (as opposed to the storage card). The device is a Motorola MC75 running Windows Mobile 6.1. Any thoughts?
