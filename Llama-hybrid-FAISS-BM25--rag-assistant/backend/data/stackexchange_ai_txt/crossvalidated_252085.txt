The two methods you mention (predictive mean matching, and normal) are suitable for imputing continuous variables. Your reference to items in a sub-scale leads me to believe that these have only two or a small number of categorical values. In that case you would choose a different method logistic regression for binary and proportional odds for ordered categorical. My feeling is that with less than 5% missing the results are unlikely to be affected much but it is worth doing as a sensitivity analysis.
