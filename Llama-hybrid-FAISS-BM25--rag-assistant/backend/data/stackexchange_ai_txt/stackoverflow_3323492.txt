Animation architecture pattern

I'm writing a game project as a hobby, and am looking for some architecural advice about how best to organize my game objects and their various animations. For example, I have a class called Wizard, and a class called Dragon. A Wizard has, at least, 10 different specific animations associated with it, depending on its state, and the same for Dragon. So my question is this: is there a standard pattern for organizing these sorts of objects so that it is efficient and easy to extend (i.e. it should be easy to add new animations and new objects)? I have various ideas about how to move forward on this, but I don't want to get this wrong since it is such an important part of the game architecture. It seems easy to get this working for a small game, but I am afraid of unmanageable complexity as it gets bigger.
