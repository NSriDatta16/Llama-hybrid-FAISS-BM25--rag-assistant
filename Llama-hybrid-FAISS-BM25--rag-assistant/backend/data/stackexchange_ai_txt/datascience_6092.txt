How to generate ratings without training data?

I am working on generating restaurant ratings automatically and I have various feature values like delivery time, cost estimate, etc. I want to generate a rating for each restaurant between 0 to 5. But I don't have any training data or ground truth to validate . This rating might vary with user. Most of the related work, mostly related to the Yelp data challenge, have some relevance score as training data. I though of using reinforcement learning to learn the rating with user feedback, but not sure how to do that. Can anyone please suggest a relevant technique or algorithm for this problem?
