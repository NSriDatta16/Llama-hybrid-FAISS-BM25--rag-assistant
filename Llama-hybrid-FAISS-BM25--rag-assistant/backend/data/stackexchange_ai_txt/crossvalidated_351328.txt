Medical Imaging in Python (PyRadiomics): Concrete steps

I am new to medical imaging, but I am trying really hard to replicate some former analyses within this topic out of interest (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26337765 ). My questions are: Are there any online resources that provide step-by-step guides for performing radiomics analyses ? Not scientific articles, but beginner guides. Provided TCIA data, how do I, for example, construct the measure " Necrosis : dark region observed in T1 scans "? I have T1 scans and segmentation, but I don't know how to extract this specific feature. PyRadiomics allow for FOS, shape, etc. Given 300 of such TCIA images, do I just do a simple average across all "Necrosis" scores to get the aggregate?
