I would try to do a hierarchical cluster analysis on your outcome variable(s) using your original data (rather than the country averages). Take a look at the dendrogram of the results and see if any reasonable clusters of people emerge. Look and see if they have countries in common. Another approach, if you have enough data, would be to calculate the mean for your outcome, its variance and maybe some other higher moments (to get at issues of distribution) within each country, and then do a cluster analysis on those moments to group the countries. In the end, I think you will have to use domain knowledge to make sure that your grouping looks reasonable.
