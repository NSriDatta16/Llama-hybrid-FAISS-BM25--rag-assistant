How to predict a time series with seasonal pattern in R

I have data set (download from here ), this data set is occupancy level in an office building within 30 days. There is a seasonal pattern daily as you may easily understand. I tried diff(t, lag=1440) but it is still non-stationary. What methods should I use to predict this pattern? I would like to predict the next few days based on the historical data. I tried different methods in R: a = read.table("test.csv", sep=","); # read data b = a[,2] t = ts(b, frequency = 1440) # convert to time series plot(t) d = decompose(t) plot(d) acf(d$random,na.action = na.pass) # non-stationary Box.test(d$random)
