I just found one paper that might be at least somewhat relevant to your question. It doesn't use binary features; it uses text features instead, but you could probably modify their approach to accommodate your inputs. The paper is Estimating User Location in Social Media with Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders . It's a deep learning approach using the text of tweets to create one model that estimates region within the U.S. and also state, and then another model that estimates latitude and longitude. The only flaw that I see with their approach is that they don't seem to be treating the earth as a sphere or an oblate spheroid. If your city happens to be bisected by the international date line, this might be a serious problem, but otherwise you may be able to ignore this and still get decent accuracy.
