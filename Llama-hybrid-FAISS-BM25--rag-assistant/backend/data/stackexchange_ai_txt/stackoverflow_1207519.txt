I don't know if this is possible with the Emma Maven plugin, but this is the default behaviour for the Cobertura Maven plugin . It also gives you the number of times a line is hit, which can be useful in determining where your testing is minimal. See this report for an example of the output. I find Cobertura and Emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking, just that Cobertura has a better Maven plugin and Emma has a better Eclipse plugin in my opinion.
