Does @property(retain) need a release?

Below are three fragments of code, the first two are interfaces for two objects along with a couple of @property commands. Please note that this is just me learning, its not part of an application just a small test program. After adding (retain) to the 2nd @property I noticed that my machine object was leaking when my program exited, what I did to fix this was add a release in the Artist objects dealloc, does this sound right? @interface Machine : NSObject { NSString *name; NSString *type; NSString *os; } @interface Artist : NSObject { NSString *name; Machine *system; } @property(copy) NSString *name; @property(retain) Machine *system; @end // DEALLOC IN @implementation Artist -(void)dealloc { NSLog(@"_deal: %@", self); [system release]; [super dealloc]; } gary
