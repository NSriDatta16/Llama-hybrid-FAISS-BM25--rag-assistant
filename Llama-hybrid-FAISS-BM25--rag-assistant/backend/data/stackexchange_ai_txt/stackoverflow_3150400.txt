Html List tag not working in android textview. What can I do?

Html List tag not working in android TextView. This is my string content: String str="A dressy take on classic gingham in a soft, textured weave of stripes that resembles twill. Take a closer look at this one. Trim, tailored fit for a bespoke feel Medium spread collar, one-button mitered barrel cuffs Applied placket with genuine mother-of-pearl buttons ;Split back yoke, rear side pleats Made in the U.S.A. of 100% imported cotton. "; I loaded it in a text view like this: textview.setText(Html.fromHtml(str)); The output looks like a paragraph. What can I do? Is there any solution for it? Edit: webview.loadData(str,"text/html","utf-8");
