R Statistics: Average True Range Trailing Stop indicator

I am using the following article: marintrading.com/106VERV.PDF to create the Average True Range Trailing Stop indicator in R. I have tried various ways to do this, including for loops, pmin and creating a lagging time series, and nothing seems to work. Could you help me out please?
