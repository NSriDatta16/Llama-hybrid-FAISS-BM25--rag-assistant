output xml fragment without headers

I have a feeling I'm being thick, but here's my problem: I'm creating dynamic XML trees using PHP. These trees describe employee hierarchies, file directories, etc. They comprise small sections of content on a webpage. The rest of the webpage is glued together from various other sources that may be SQL based, or static text or some special presentation class. When I go to output my trees, I transform the XML into a nested . I'd like to output that without any doctype/header info. PHP's DomDocument and SimpleXML classes don't seem to allow this. Is the only option to strip the offending info off after storing the in a string?
