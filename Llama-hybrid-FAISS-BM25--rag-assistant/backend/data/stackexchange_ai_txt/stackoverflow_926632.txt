how do I pass a byte[] reference as the buffer in a System.Net.Sockets.Send().Recieve()

I have been reading about the various memory management issues that .NET Asynchronous Sockets have. There are but a handful of links, but spidering this one will get you them all: http://codebetter.com/blogs/gregyoung/archive/2007/06/18/async-sockets-and-buffer-management.aspx Basically when a socket is asynchronously sending/receiving many small byte[]'s the send/receive byte[]'s are pinned in memory leading to fragmentation. SO for the purposes of creating a buffer manager : I have a managed buffer (byte[]) byte[] managedBuffer = new byte[1024]; // do stuff with managedBuffer; how do I send this byte[] to the socket's asynchronous .BeginSend() method by reference? // I don't want to pass the VALUE to the method, but a reference // to managedBuffer; System.Net.Sockets.Socket.BeginSend(managedBuffer...(other params));
