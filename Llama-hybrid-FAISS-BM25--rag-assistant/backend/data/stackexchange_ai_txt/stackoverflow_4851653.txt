You should treat your session as a write-once, read many storage. But one which is rather volatile - e.g. the state of your underlying application data should be consistent (or recoverable) if all the sessions suddenly disappeared. There are some exceptions to this (normally the shopping basket would be stored in the session - but you might want to perform stock adjustments to 'reserve' items prior to checkout). Here items may be added/edited/changed multiple times - so its not really write-once - but by pre-reserving stock items you are maintaining the recoverabiltiy of the database - but an implication of this is that you should reverse the stock adjustments when the session expires in the absence of completion. If you start trying to store information about the data relating to individual page turns, you're quickly going to get into problems when the user starts clicking on the forward/back buttons or opens a new window.
