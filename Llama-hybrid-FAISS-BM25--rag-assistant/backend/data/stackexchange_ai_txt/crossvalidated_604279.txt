This is a classic example of 'experts' deliberately misinterpreting the intent of the OP's question and refusing to provide a clear answer on the basis that the original question lacked technical precision. I suspect this is the actual answer you are looking for: Yes, your calculation is correct. However, your 68% proposal implicitly assumes a normal distribution. For a single die roll, this doesn't make much sense. However, were you to roll a die say 100 times, then a normal distribution would provide a very close approximation to the actual distribution of results. The more times you roll the die, the better the approximation becomes. However, now you have to scale the Variance according to the number of die rolls. The variance of the total scales according to n (100), while the variance of the average scales according to 1/n. Therefore, if you roll a die 100 times: Total sum : Expected value 350, Variance roughly 17 (10 1.7) Average : Expected value 3.5, Variance roughly .17 (1/10 1.7) And your 68% rule applies. Notice how the expected value and variance of the total sum is 100 * those of the average.
