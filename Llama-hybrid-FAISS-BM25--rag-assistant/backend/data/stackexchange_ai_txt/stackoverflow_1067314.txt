Is a unified, enterprise-wide information system a feasible or worthy goal?

Considering the vast amount of digitized information sitting in each department of a large organization, is it a worthy goal to refocus information systems development away from linking individual systems and start considering a single infrastructure that aspires to be flexible and extensible enough to meet all the current and future requirements of each department? For example, sales has a CRM package but would like to integrate with a custom-built system that the legal department uses. Both refer to the product database that is managed by the engineering and business development departments. Business rules across departments abound. This web of dependencies is messy- so I am wondering if there is any best practice in dealing with this. Is a single "system to rule them all" a practical approach? Does this type of goal amount to a net positive for the business, or have you experienced net negative effects? It would obviously be an iterative development process but should some pieces get rolled out without a full spec + implementation, or would it be better to run a parallel system and cut over at a certain time? I still haven't mentioned the business requirements of the finance department... :)
