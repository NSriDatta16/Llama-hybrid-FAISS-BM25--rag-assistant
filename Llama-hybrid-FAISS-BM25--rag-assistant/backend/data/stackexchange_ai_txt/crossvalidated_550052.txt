how to configure nlmer/nmle for polynomial logistic regression?

I previously modeled my data with glmer and it is OK: model = glmer(optionval ~ ot1 +section:(ot1 ) + (ot1-1|participant.id), data=current_data, family=binomial, control = glmerControl(optimizer = "nloptwrap", calc.derivs = FALSE)) Now I am told that we may need a nonlinear model, so I am trying to transform the model into nonlinear ones. I am new to nlmer and nmle packages, and the modelling functions seem to be very different from glmer kind, e.g. selfStart functions(SSlogis) along with the " start " parameter in the function. Current attempt may be nonsense: model = nlmer(optionval ~ SSlogis(ot1, Asym, xmid, scal) ~ ot1+section:(ot1) +(ot1)|participant.id, data=current_data, start = getInitial(optionval ~ SSlogis(ot1, Asym, xmid, scal), data = current_data), control =glmerControl(optimizer = "nloptwrap", calc.derivs = FALSE)) It can run but produce the error message of: Error in eval_f(x, ...) : step factor reduced below 0.001 without reducing pwrss I believe the model is not configured in the right way. Can anyone please suggest some ideas or a sample to use nlmer/nmle?
