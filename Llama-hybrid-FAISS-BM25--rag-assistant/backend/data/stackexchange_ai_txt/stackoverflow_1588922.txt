How to detect and estimate heap fragmentation in my C++ program?

I'm developing a VC++ NT service that is meant to operate continuously for many months. It uses VC++ runtime heap intensively. Clearly heap fragmentation can at some point cause it malfunctioning (thinking it's out of memory). What tests can I run on my service to estimate the degree it is prone to heap fragmentation?
