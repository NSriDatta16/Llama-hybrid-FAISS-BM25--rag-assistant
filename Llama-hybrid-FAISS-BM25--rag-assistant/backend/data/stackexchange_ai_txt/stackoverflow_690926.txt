Here's one approach.. Create a variable of type object. Create a "Execute SQL Task" that grabs your source data and loads it into the variable (ADO.NET). Create a "ForEach Loop Container. Drag the Success connector (green) from the "Execute SQL Task" to the "ForEach Loop Container". Change Enumerator on the loop container to "foreach ADO Enumerator" and pick your variable from the "ADO object source variable". Within your loop, you should be alble to add an "Execute SQL Task" that you can work with.. You should be able to use the SCOPE_IDENTITY() to get each ID after inserting into the master table and use that to insert into the detail table.
