Which values contains nodes of our IDX_MultiColIdx B-Tree index? Values of name , age and the row pointer ( RID / ROWID or clustered key, depending on the table organization), sorted lexicographically. How exactly they will be stored, depends on the datatype and database system. Usually, CHAR is stored right-padded with spaces up to its size, while VARCHAR is prepended with its length. MyISAM and some other engines can use key compression : the matching parts of a set of keys are only stored once, and the other keys only store the differing parts, like this: Hamblin Hamblin, California Hamblin (surname) Hambling Baronets Hambly Hambly Arena Hambly Arena Fire Hambo Hambo Lama Itigelov Hambok Hambone will be stored as: Hamblin [7], California [7] (surname) [7]g Baronets Hambly [6] Arena [6] Arena Fire Hambo [5] Lama Itigelov [5]k [5]ne , where [x] means "take leading x characters from the previous key"
