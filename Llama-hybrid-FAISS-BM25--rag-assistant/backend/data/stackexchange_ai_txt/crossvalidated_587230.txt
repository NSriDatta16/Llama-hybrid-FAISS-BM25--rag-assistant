At least according to the documentation for the R package performance , that formula for McKelvey and Zavoina pseudo r -squared is only for binomial logistic regression with the logit link. ( rdrr.io/cran/performance/man/r2_mckelvey.html ). I don't have access to the original paper by McKelvey and Zavoina to see what formula they use for Poisson regression models. Also note that the webpage you cited is titled " Psuedo r-squared for logistic regression ".
