It looks like the tabledrag stuff is being built in the cck theme functions - eg theme_content_multiple_values it's adding a 'draggable' class to the table rows, and calling drupal_add_tabledrag on the table. You should be able to override this in your theme/module(?) and add a fairly simple switch to test for users with an appropriate permission before adding the drag.
