Why not just store it as: Height Width GroundType * (Height * Width) Giving something like 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 It's both easier and more compact. :) As for in-game storage, a 2D array is perfect for this, unless you have other specific needs. A typical collision detection technique is to have a broad phase done by a the physics subsystem, with bounding spheres or axis-aligned bounding boxes for example, and then have the pairs of possibly colliding objects to compute if there was in fact a collision. Your tile class should probably not be a component, unless you have a very compelling reason. Edit: Forgot the object type up there, but it'd be easy to integrate it too.
