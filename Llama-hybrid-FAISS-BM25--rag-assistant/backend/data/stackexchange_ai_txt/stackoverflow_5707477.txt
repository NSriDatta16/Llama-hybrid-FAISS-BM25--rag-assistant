If the snippet is well-formed most DOM implementations I've seen will also support the non-standard DocumentFragment node type which allows you to inject dom nodes from string. EDIT: Quick Google search throws up some JavaDocs: http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/DocumentFragment.html IIRC the api works like this (pseudo code): parent = find_parent_node_of_fragment(document); fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); fragment.appendXML(" xmlstring "); parent.appendChild(fragment); If you don't have this luxury or if your string is not well formed there is the option to inject CDATA. If you can't make do with injecting CDATA (because you essentially want to affect nodes that follow, for instance the new node must become the parent of old nodes which will be enclosed in the new document), you could try an XSLT transformation.
