Deriving Transition Matrix of the Embedded Markov Chain given the generator matrix?

Full Problem: A continuous-time Markov chain has generator matrix $$Q= \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & -4 \\ \end{pmatrix} $$ (i) Exhibit the transition matrix of the embedded Markov chain. (ii) Exhibit the holding time parameters for each state. OK, I must be misunderstanding something. I have the following for the embedded chain transition probabilities: $$P_{ij} = \frac{q_{ij}}{q_i}$$ where $q_i$ is the parameters of the exponential length of time that the process stays in i. The problem is that I know $q_i$ is the minimum with exponential distribution and parameter $\sum_k q_{ik}$. But when I calculate $P_{11}$ that gives me $-1$ which is impossible.. Obviously there is an error in my thinking but can anyone shine light on what I'm misunderstanding? Thank you greatly in advance.
