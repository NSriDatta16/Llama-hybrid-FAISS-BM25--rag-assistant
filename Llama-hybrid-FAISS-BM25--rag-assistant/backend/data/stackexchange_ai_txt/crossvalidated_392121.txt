While I produced a detailed answer to an earlier X validated question , let me recall here that there are many ways of approximating the normalising constant, besides importance sampling : Chib's (1994) (or the candidate's) formula Gelfand and Dey's (1995) representation, which includes the infamous harmonic mean estimator particle filters and sequential Monte Carlo nested sampling reversible jump MCMC path sampling or thermodynamic integration bridge sampling Geyer's (1994) logistic regression the Savage-Dickey representation some of which are unbiased and most of which are described in Chen, Shao and Ibrahim (2001) .
