Detecting the browser language of choice with PHP

I'm trying to implement this code to have different files to load for german, spanish or english browser languages of choice. The case is that with my spanish IE I still get the english file. I used both HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE , and HTTP_USER_AGENT . This is the test of the site, if anyone wanted to check it, with german or spanish as a language of choice in the browser : http://paragraphe.org/janette/ I have my Firefox in english and is working nice, but I can't be sure the code is working for spanish and german cases. I found the snippet in this SO thread , but I'm a bit lost at this point. Thanks so much for any input, EDIT: the code does work in Firefox (but not IE).
