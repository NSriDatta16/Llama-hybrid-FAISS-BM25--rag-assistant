The Powers That Be want solid numbers on the cost of each type of crash being worked on I want to fly in my hot air balloon to Mars, but it doesn't mean that such a thing is possible. Seriously, I think you have a duty to tell them that there is no way to accurately measure this. Tell them you can rank the crashes, or whatever it is that you can actually do with your data, but that's all you've got. Something like "We can't actually work out how much it costs. We DO have this data about how long things are running for, and so on, but the only way to attach costs is to pretend that X minutes equals X dollars even though this has no basis in reality" If you just make some bullcrap costing algorithm and DON'T push back at all, you only have yourself to blame when management turns around and uses this arbitrary made up number to do something stupid like fire staff, or decide not to fix any crashes and instead focus on leveraging their synergy with sharepoint portal internet web sharing love server 2013 Update: To clarify, I'm not saying you should only rely on stats with 100% accuracy, and just give up on everything else. What I think is important is that you know what it is you're measuring. You're not actually measuring cost, you're measuring uptime. As such, you should be upfront about it. If you want to estimate the cost that's fine, but I believe you need to make this clear.. If I were to produce such a report, I'd call it the 'crash uptime report' and maybe have a secondary field called "Estimated cost based on $5/minute." The managers get their cost estimate, but it's clear that the actual report is based on the uptime, and cost is only an estimate, and how the estimate works.
