Remove noise by clustering on which step of pre-processing is better?

I am working on a classification task. The dataset is a UCI data set about machine learning with 200 observations and 2 classes. Part of my model includes the following preprocessing steps: remove missing values normalize between 0 and 1 remove outlier smoothing remove trend from data SMOTE I would like to use a clustering method to remove noisy data points. The question is, at which step should this happen?
