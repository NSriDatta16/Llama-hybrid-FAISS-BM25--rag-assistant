Applying PCA to test data for classification purposes

I've recently learned about the wonderful PCA and I've done the example outlined in scikit-learn documentation . I am interested to know how I can apply PCA to new data points for classification purposes. After visualizing PCA in a 2 dimensional plane (x,y axis), I see that I can probably draw a line to separate the data points so that one side would be of one classification and the other of another classification. How do I draw this "boundary" and apply this to the new data points?
