The reason is value allocation Hijax Ok lets say a user links to http://www.example.com/stuff#fluff The link actually counts as a link to http://www.example.com/stuff#fluff but as http://www.example.com/stuff#fluff and http://www.example.com/stuff are the same HTML content, google will canonicalize (summarize) the value allocation to http://www.example.com/stuff Your site www.example.com/stuff/fluff that you communicated to non javascript clients (googlebot) does not come up in this whole process Fazit: so basically a link to http://www.example.com/stuff#fluff is seen by google as a vote for http://www.example.com/stuff Hashbang A user links to http://www.example.com/stuff#!fluff Googlebot interpretes it as www.example.com/stuff?_escaped_fragment_=fluff And as it offers different content (i.e.: different content from www.example.com/stuff ) google will not canonicalize (summerize) it with any other URL. Google will display http://www.example.com/stuff#!fluff to it's users Fazit: A link to http://www.example.com/stuff#!fluff is seen by google as a vote for www.example.com/stuff?_escaped_fragment_=fluff (but displayed to it's users as http://www.example.com/stuff#!fluff )
