You are comparing apples and oranges. The emmeans() results are predictions from the model, or averages thereof. The confint() results are estimates of the fixed-effect regression coefficients. In notational terms, you have a model that says something like $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + e $$ Your model is a lot more sophisticated than this, but this is the basic idea. The emmeans() results are estimates of predictions for $y$ at various combinations of the $x_j$ , and the confint() results are estimates of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots$ .
