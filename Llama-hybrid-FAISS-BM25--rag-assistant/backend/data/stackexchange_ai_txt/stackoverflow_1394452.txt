G'day, I'd agree with the couple of answers, so far, that recommend sticking with gmake. Maybe have another look after reading the first few chapters of Robert Mecklenburg's excellent book "Managing Projects with GNU Make" ( sanitised Amazon link ). Or, even better, is to search out a copy of the previous edition called "Managing Projects With make" by Andrew Oram and Steve Talbott. The first few chapters give an excellent description of (g)make and [Mm]akefile basics. And I see you can buy a second hand copy of the 2nd ed. from Amazon for the princely sum of $0.01! ( sanitised Amazon link ) After reading that intro you'll even understand how make is backward chaining, which is a bit non-intuitive when just looking at make's behaviour. HTH cheers,
