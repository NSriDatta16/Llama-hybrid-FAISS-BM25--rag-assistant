Is it normal to have thousands of df in a logistic regression model?

I'll admit right off the bat that degrees of freedom is not a concept I understand very well in general. That being said, I was reading a study that reported the following results: I struck me that the df for most of these factors is way, way higher than I'm used to seeing in other contexts (when I actually pay attention to the df). Is it normal to have dfs as high as 2,125? Why would only one variable end up being a tiny fraction of that (the last with a df of 25.69)?
