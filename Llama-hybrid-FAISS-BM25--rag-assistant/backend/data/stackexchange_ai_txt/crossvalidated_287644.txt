A better feature set would help you to make more concrete decisions later in the process and it also helps to remove some of the unwanted noise that is present in the dataset and features that might mislead one. That being said, having noise in the data is a good thing as it might help you generalize better. I am guessing that you are trying to perform a supervised task, in that case, you can keep all the variables and try dropping your neurons from the perceptron at random (dropout) in order to reduce the dependency on a particular variable. It would be better if you elaborate your question a bit, explain a bit more about the dataset and see if you really need a neural network for the task or some off the shelf model would work out for you.
