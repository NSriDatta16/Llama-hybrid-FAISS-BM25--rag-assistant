It is a little beyond what statistics can do to tell you if an observation is "legitimate" or "can be trusted", because that's a very context-specific matter. Among the things it can do that are sort of like that is quantify how far an observation is from the rest of the data; that is, how much of an outlier it is. All other things being equal, a data point that's more of an outlier is more likely to represent bad data of some kind (anything from a number being written down incorrectly, to a rich person ending up in a sample that you wanted to include only poor people). If you want to look for outliers, the first thing to do is plot your data. (Actually, the first thing to do in pretty much any data-analysis problem is plot your data.) However, I don't think quantifying outliers is necessarily a good way, on its own, to answer your question about whether different meters are on the same transformer. For that, you presumably want a sample of distinct pairs of meters that you know aren't on the same transformer, and a separate sample of distinct pairs of meters that are. Then you can use the data from these known pairs to classify the unknown pairs in your original data.
