SQL Server features/commands that most developers are unaware of

Possible Duplicate: Hidden Features of SQL Server I've worked as a .NET developer for a while now, but predominantly against a SQL Server database for a little over 3 years now. I feel that I have a fairly decent grasp of SQL Server from a development standpoint, but I ashamed to admit that I just learned today about "WITH TIES" from this answer - Top 5 with most friends . It is humbling to see questions and answers like this on SO because it helps me realize that I really don't know as much as I think I do and helps re-energize my will to learn more, so I figured what better way than to ask the masses of experts for input on other handy commands/features. What is the most useful feature/command that the average developer is probably unaware of? BTW - if you are like I was and don't know what "WITH TIES" is for, here is a good explanation. You'll see quickly why I was ashamed I was unaware of it. I could see where it could be useful though. - http://harriyott.com/2007/06/with-ties-sql-server-tip.aspx I realize that this is a subjective question so please allow for at least a few answers before you close it. :) I'll try to edit my question to keep up a list with your response. Thanks [EDIT] - Here is a summary of the responses Please scroll down for more information. Thanks again guys/gals.
