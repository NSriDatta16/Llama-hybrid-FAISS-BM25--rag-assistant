I experienced a problem whenever I added a new device in the device list, and then made the new profiles by selecting the new devices and drag them to Xcode and prepare the build. The moment I use that build for device installation I get the error ENTITLEMENTS ARE NOT VALID I tried to resolve it by all the ways I could think of but nothing positive came out. Anyhow, I have to make the new App-ID or have to repeat the whole process of creating profiles. Then I can install the build on the device.
