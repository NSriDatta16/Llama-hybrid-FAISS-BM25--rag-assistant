LSTM architecture for multivariate time series

For a multivariate time series analysis, which of the following LSTM architectures would work better and why? 1) Having two independent LSTM layers (one for the time series variable and one for the features) and later concatenating these independent layers using Keras functional api. 2) Having both the time series variable and the features in one multidimensional array which is used in LSTM.
