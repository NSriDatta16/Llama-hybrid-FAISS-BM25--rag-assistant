The linear probability model is just $$ \Pr(Y=1) = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} $$ It is a very simple model that does not give you any guarantees of the probabilities being proper. Technically, it implicitly assumes that nothing could go beyond the $[0, 1]$ bound. This model simply does not try to give proper predictions (unless within some bounds), so trying to be pedantic here is hopeless. Truncating the probabilities is not a part of this model, though may be a practical workaround for its limitations. In most cases, however, it would make more sense to use a model that does give guarantees of making predictions that make sense, e.g. logistic regression.
