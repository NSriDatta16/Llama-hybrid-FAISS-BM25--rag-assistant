What is the rationale for using Univariate Time Series modelling?

Usually when creating a regression model using cross sectional data we assume a dependent and independent variable. but in AR,MA, ARMA and ARIMA models forecast based on the previous periods values or disturbance terms. What is the rationale for univariate time series modelling and why would one prefer to use a univariate forecast as opposed to a multiple variable one?
