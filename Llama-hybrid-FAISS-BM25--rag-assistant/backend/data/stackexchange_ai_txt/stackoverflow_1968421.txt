there are two different situations to consider: (1) an object is created in the local scope and it is not needed outside this local scope. in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca() or with a RAII approach. Using calloc alloca() has the big advantage that you don't have to care about calling free() because the allocated memory is automatically freed when the local scope is left. (2) an object is created in the local scope and it is needed outside this local scope. In this case there is no general advice. I would free the memory when the object is no longer needed. EDITED: use alloca () instead of calloc()
