Try to post the non-treated warnings. However, I too remember that I got some level 4 warning from in , that could be safely ignored (IIRC it was C4702 , which is harmless). To avoid the warning, I put around the STL #include s some appropriate #pragma warning directives (enclosed in the correct #ifdef s to have them considered only on MSVC++, thanks to @Alexandre C. for reminding me of it): #ifdef _MSC_VER //Disable the C4702 warning for the following headers #pragma warning(push) #pragma warning(disable:4702) #endif // _MSC_VER //map STL container #include //list STL container #include //vector STL container #include #ifdef _MSC_VER #pragma warning(pop) #endif You could also simply lower the warning level to 3 (or even lower) just in that section with: #ifdef _MSC_VER // Lower the warning level to 3 just for this section #pragma warning(push, 3) #endif //map STL container #include //list STL container #include //vector STL container #include #ifdef _MSC_VER #pragma warning(pop) #endif // _MSC_VER For more info, see the documentation of #pragma warning .
