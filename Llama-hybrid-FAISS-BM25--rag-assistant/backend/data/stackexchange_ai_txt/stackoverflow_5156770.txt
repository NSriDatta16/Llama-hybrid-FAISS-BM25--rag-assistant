YUI Tooltip not displaying on top of Panel

Currently having a problem trying to get YUI Tooltips to display on top of a YUI Panel after it is shown that were previously created. The problem is is that the Panel cannot be registered to the overlay manager because it would require a TON of code to be changed and tested extending a hard deadline. The only way to get this to work is to setup the Tooltips after the Panel is shown. Problem there is the amount of code changes that would have to be done to attach another function call. My problem is that I was hoping that I could use the event handling to use "showEvent" but I cannot seem to get it to work (I apologize for word count): var panel_obj = new YAHOO.widget.Panel('someID', { width: "700px", height: "500px", close: true, draggable: false, modal: true, constraintoviewport: true, visible: false, fixedcenter: true }); panel_obj.render(); var tooltip_name = 'newTooltip1'; var element_id = 'htmlElementIDToBecomeTooltip'; function createTooltip() { window[tooltip_name] = new YAHOO.widget.Tooltip(tooltip_name, { context: element_id, xyoffset: [15, -15], zIndex: 999 }); } function successfulScenario() { panel_obj.show(); createTooltip(); } function failedScenario1() { YAHOO.util.Event.addListener( 'someID', "showEvent", createTooltip ); } function failedScenario2() { createTooltip(); panel_obj.show(); } The only way I have seem to get it working is by running something like successfulScenario() . I'm coming from a jQuery background so I'm still learning YUI. I would love to be able to just extend (subclass) YAHOO.widget.Panel's show() function to call createTooltip but I'm not that much of a guru or I would probably need to change a very large codebase to do it.
