Yes, you can do it with cvFindContours() . It returns the pointer to the first sequence that was found. Using that pointer you can traverse through all of the sequences found. // your image converted to grayscale IplImage* grayImg = LoadImage(...); // image for drawing contours onto IplImage* colorImg = cvCreateImage(cvGetSize(grayImg), 8, 3); // memory where cvFindContours() can find memory in which to record the contours CvMemStorage* memStorage = cvCreateMemStorage(0); // find the contours on image *grayImg* CvSeq* contours = 0; cvFindContours(grayImg, memStorage, &contours); // traverse through and draw contours for(CvSeq* c = contours; c != NULL; c = c->h_next) { cvCvtColor( grayImg, colorImg, CV_GRAY2BGR ); cvDrawContours( colorImg, c, CVX_RED, CVX_BLUE, 0, // Try different values of max_level, and see what happens 2, 8 ); } Besides this method, I would advise you to take a look at cvBlobs or cvBlobsLib . Latter one is integrated in OpenCV 2.0 as official blob detection lib.
