I think the potential sticking point that hasn't been touched on yet is your phrase "login to this website"... Depending on how you need to log in, you may need to go in through a back door to access the report. I had problems with this kind of thing in the past when I had to download a report from a third party site. The issue was that I couldn't authenticate to access the report parameters because of the hard-coded and less-than-script-friendly way I was required to log in to the site. However, I presume that your site is internal to your organisation, so it may be possible to bypass/rework the security requirements in order to access the data. If this is the case, then you should be able to use one of the screen scraping methods outlined above. If not, you may need to incorporate the actual login procedure into your script or application, download and capture any cookies that may be set and incorporate them into your data request.
