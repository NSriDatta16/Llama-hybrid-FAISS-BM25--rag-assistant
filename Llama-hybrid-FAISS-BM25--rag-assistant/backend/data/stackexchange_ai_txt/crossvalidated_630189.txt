Specifying priors for bivariate model with both a gaussian and binomial distribution in MCMCglmm

I have two response variables, one is gaussian (parental feeding rate of chicks per hour "Rate_h") and one is binomial (proportion of chicks that survive to fledging "propfledged"). I want to see whether the two responses covary at the among-individual level ("ID"). I am unsure how to properly specify my priors for the bivariate, particularly in whether to fixed the residual variance or not. I am able to specify the priors and model correctly for the binomial case when it is univariate: prior1 model1 Based on my reading, I hold the residual variance at a fixed value to improve the running of the model in the binomial case. However, when I want to set up the bivariate, I don't know how to properly set up my priors when I have both a gaussian and binomial response. I tried this for the bivariate but was told that V is the wrong dimension for some prior $G/prior$ R elements: prior2 bivfledge I also tried fixing the residual variance and come up with the same problem: prior3 bivfledge How do I correctly specify my priors here?
