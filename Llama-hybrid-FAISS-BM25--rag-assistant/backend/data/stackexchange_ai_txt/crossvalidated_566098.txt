Does k-fold cross validation change the model in each iteration?

My basic understanding is that the machine learning algorithms are specific to the training data. When we change the training data, the model also changes. If my understanding is correct, then while performing k-fold cross-validation, the training data is changed in each k iteration so is the model. Therefore, if the model is changed each time then how the accuracy in all k iterations is reliable? Is it better to split the model in training, validation, and testing (just perform hyperparameter tuning based on training and validation sets and test it on the testing set) than performing k-fold cross-validation?
