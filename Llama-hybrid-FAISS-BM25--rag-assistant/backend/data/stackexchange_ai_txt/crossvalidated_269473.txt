First, if there is a trend in time series, then tree-based model maybe not the good choice (because of tree model can't extrapolate, can't predict value bigger or smaller than the value in the training set), or you can remove the trend first, then using the xgboost to predict the residuals of linear models. Second, as Mortezaaa suggests, if this time series correlation with day of week, holiday, weekends, or season and so on. Then you can construct many features to improve you prediction result! Beside it, the moving average of time series can be the features too. There is a lot of good example on kaggle, such as rossmann-store-sales prediction and bike-sharing-demand prediction, there are time series too, and the winners do a lot of feature engineering! You will learn a lot.
