What do you mean by application variables? Like: private int _key = 0; If so, these kinds of variables are not saved between web requests. When the page unloads, and you have to use session or cache or viewstate to store it like: ViewState["Key"] = 1; or Session["Key"] = 1; And reload it from here when the page loads again. If you mean something else, please comment and I'll update my response. EDIT: For application, check these out: http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/archive/2003/12/01/40526.aspx http://www.dotnetheaven.com/UploadFile/mahesh/ApplicationState05102005051501AM/ApplicationState.aspx Application state is application-wide storage, and so to limit to a user, you need to append the user ID to the key, or use session.
