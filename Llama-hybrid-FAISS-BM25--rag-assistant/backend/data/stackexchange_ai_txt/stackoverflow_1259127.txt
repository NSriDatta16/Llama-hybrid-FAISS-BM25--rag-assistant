The easiest way to do this, is to go pixel by pixel and use randomness: for each pixel, probability of coloring it back = darkness of the original color. That can give you a two-line dithering algorithm. It's not going to look as nice as Floyd-Steinberg (because that one keeps track of the errors), or as artistic as the "tile and then put disks in each tile so that fraction of black = average darkness in the original tile", but it works quite well in practice.
