I would use a Strategy pattern coupled with a factory to create the appropriate strategy based on the value of the enumeration. EDIT As others have pointed out you could also determine the correct strategy via a Map as well. Factory is my choice because it only encapsulates the logic and doesn't require any data storage. public interface IExtractionStrategy { object Extract( Document doc ); // or what ever result is best } public class TextExtractionStrategy : IExtractionStrategy { public object Extract( Document doc ) { .... algorithm for extracting text... } } public class ImageExtractionStrategy : IExtractionStrategy { public object Extract( Document doc ) { .... algorithm for extracting images... } } public static class StrategyFactory { IExtractionStrategy GetStrategy( ExtractionEnum strategyType ) { switch (strategyType) { case ExtractionEnum.Text: return new TextExtractionStrategy(); break; case ExtractionEnum.Image: return new ImageExtractionStrategy(); break; ... } } }
