For example, the Calinski-Harabasz variance ratio criterion (VRC) is fairly standard. Calinski, T., and J. Harabasz. “A dendrite method for cluster analysis.” Communications in Statistics. Vol. 3, No. 1, 1974, pp. 1–27. But there are many many more, such as C index, DBCV, etc. I believe some of the indexes even had a dozen variants. The Dunn index is essentially the ratio separation/compactness, while davies-bouldin is a compactness/separation. So I guess you are suggesting just one of the many variants of these two. Note that if you have many clusters, it is better to only consider the nearby neighbor clusters, and not the average distance to all others! Assuming you have one very badly split cluster, but extremely well separated from the majority of the data, the naive within/inbetween quotient will fail. That is why you usually define separation based in the nearest other cluster(s) only, instead of the entire data set. It just shows once more that you cannot rely on Wikipedia alone (and too many people and even books just copy from Wikipedia only...) But beware that all these are just heuristics . You can find counterexamples for each, I suppose.
