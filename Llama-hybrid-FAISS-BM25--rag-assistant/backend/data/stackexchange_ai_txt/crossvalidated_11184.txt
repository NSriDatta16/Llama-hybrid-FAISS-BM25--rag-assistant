Just a few thoughts: n is the sample size for each bivariate correlation, i.e. $n \neq 6$. I am not sure if this makes sense but you could run a small meta-analysis (based on the Fisher's transformed correlations). This would give you a pooled standard error (see page 4). Whatever you do, your effect sizes (correlations) are not independent because each country is part of three bilateral correlations. Using dependent effect sizes will probably lead to a biased pooled standard error (which means that running a simple meta-analysis isn't such a good idea but you could do a robust variance estimation ). I do not understand the last paragraph of your post/question: "It would be great if I could create a confidence interval for each of these mean statistics and report it in one table so that the reader is able to compare across these regional correlations as they like." Can you give us an example?
