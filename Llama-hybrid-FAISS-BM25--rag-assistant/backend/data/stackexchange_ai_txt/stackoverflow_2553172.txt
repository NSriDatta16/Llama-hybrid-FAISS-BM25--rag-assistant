If Google's Polish translation is correct, then you don't have make installed on your machine. Try entering which make . If you see nothing, then you need to handle that first. I'm not sure the name of the package you need in OpenSuse. You should be able to search in Yum (Yast? whatever OpenSuse's package manager is called...) for something like Debian's 'build-essential' package. Edit : In OpenSuse, the package you need seems to be called "C/C++ Development" (or "C/C++ Compiler and Tools"). See this thread for some pointers: http://forums.opensuse.org/applications/413553-build-essential.html I don't know OpenSuse, but if it's anything like Debian, you can probably also install Ruby gems (and Perl and Python modules) directly from your package manager. This can be good and bad. Good because the package manager takes better care of dependencies and uninstalling (on average) than you would on your own. Bad because the distro will often have older versions than you might be able to get yourself. Still, it's an option to consider.
