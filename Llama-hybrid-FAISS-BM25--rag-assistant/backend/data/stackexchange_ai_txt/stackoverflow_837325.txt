You could try Masaki Fukushima's library for embedding python in ruby, although it doesn't appear to be maintained. YMMV With this library, Ruby scripts can directly call arbitrary Python modules. Both extension modules and modules written in Python can be used. The amusingly named Unholy from the ingenious Why the Lucky Stiff might also be of use: Compile Ruby to Python bytecode. And, in addition, translate that bytecode back to Python source code using Decompyle (included.) Requires Ruby 1.9 and Python 2.5.
