Actually, you don't need to use FFTs for this -- digital filters are very computationally efficient, needing just a few multiplies and adds per sample being processed. A good resource for the implementation of this is Robert Bristow-Johnson's Filter Cookbook . There are also good digital signal processing tutorials at Stehpan Bernsee's DSP Dimension
