One hot encoding alternatives for large categorical values?

Hi have dataframe with large categorical values over 1600 categories is there any way I can find alternatives so that I don't have over 1600 columns. I found this below interesting link http://amunategui.github.io/feature-hashing/#sourcecode But they are converting to class/object which I don't want. I want my final output as a dataframe so that I can test with different machine learning models? Is there anyway I can implement ?
