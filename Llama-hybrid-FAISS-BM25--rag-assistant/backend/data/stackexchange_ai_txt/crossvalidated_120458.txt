It is one thing to detect an Outlier at a particular level of confidence and yet another to place a second specification that would further restrict the acceptance of the outlier. I was once asked the following question " Can AUTOBOX detect a mean shift of xx units at a pre-specified level of confidence". Essentially what was required was a dual test. AUTOBOX is a piece of software that I have helped develop which you might find cost-effective as no free software has implemented this dual test. Thanks Nick: I was using a level shift as a particular example of an "outlier" or in general the empirically identified deterministic impact. Other forms of "outliers" are Pulses, Seasonal Pulses and Local Time Trends AND particular combinations such as a transient change to a new level. The main point was that there may be two hypothesis that are in play reflecting statistical significance and real-world significance. The customer that had originally brought this problem to my attention was interested in both.
