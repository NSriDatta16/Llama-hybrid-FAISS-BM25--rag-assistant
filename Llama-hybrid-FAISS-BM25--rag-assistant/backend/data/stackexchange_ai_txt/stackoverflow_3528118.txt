Selecting the row before the resultset in sqlite

so lets say i have a table called data data id | date | name --------------------- 1 | 19/8/2010 | John 2 | 19/8/2010 | Mary 3 | 20/8/2010 | Peter 4 | 20/8/2010 | Bert 5 | 20/8/2010 | Ernie if i do a select statement like this SELECT * FROM data where date = '20/8/2010'; is it possible to edit this select statement to take the row before it as well. in this case it returns me row number 3 - 5. but is is possible to edit the sqlstatement in any way to select row 2 as well?
