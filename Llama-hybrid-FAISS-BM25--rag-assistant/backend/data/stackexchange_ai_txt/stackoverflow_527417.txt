Like Ben mentioned, one way to do this is to attach an NSNumberFormatter to your textfield, which is pretty trivial to set up in interface builder and will likely Just Work™. If you don't like the modal dialogs NSNumberFormatter throws at your users when they enter non-numeric values, you can subclass NSNumberFormatter to implement different, ‘more forgiving’ formatting behavior. I think overriding – numberFromString: to strip out non-numeric characters before calling super's implementation should do the trick. Another approach is to create and register your own NSValueTransformer subclass to parse strings into NSNumbers and back, but I'd try using an NSNumberFormatter first since it's pretty clearly the class that has been designed for this exact purpose.
