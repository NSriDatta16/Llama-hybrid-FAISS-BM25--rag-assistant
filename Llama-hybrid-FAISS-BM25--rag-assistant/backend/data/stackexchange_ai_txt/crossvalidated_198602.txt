Assuming you're concerning random variable of Gamma distribution with shape $\alpha > 0$ and rate $\beta > 0$ parameters, that is $X \sim Gamma(\alpha,\beta)$, you can find $\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{X^2}]$ in the following manner: For any random variable X of continuous distribution (like Gamma) for which $f$ denotes its probability density function (in your example $f(x) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1}e^{- \beta x}$) and for any function $g$ of this variable (in your case $g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} = x^{-2}$), it holds: $$ \mathbb{E}[g(x)] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+ \infty}g(x)f(x)dx$$ In your example, it simplifies very much (pay attention on $-3$): $$g(x)f(x) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 3}e^{- \beta x}$$ The fraction doesn't depend on $x$, so it can be put outside an integral. By the way, for discrete distribution it's very similar: $$ \mathbb{E}[g(x)] = \sum\limits_{x \in \mathcal{X}} g(x)f(x), ~~\text{where}~\mathcal{X}~\text{denotes support for X (set of values it can take)}$$ I won't keep you in suspense any longer. First of all, recall that $\Gamma(\alpha+1) = \alpha \cdot \Gamma(\alpha)$. Let $f_{\alpha}(x) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1}e^{- \beta x}$. Combining these two results in a straightforward observation: $$ x \cdot f_{\alpha}(x) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \cdot f_{\alpha+1}(x)$$ Consecutively: $$ \frac{f_{\alpha+1}(x)}{x} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \cdot f_{\alpha}(x)$$ Using this twice, you will get the result: $$ \frac{f_{\alpha}(x)}{x^2} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha-1} \cdot \frac{f_{\alpha-1}(x)}{x} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha-1} \cdot \frac{\beta}{\alpha-2} \cdot f_{\alpha-2}(x) $$ Ultimately (as $f_{\alpha-2}(x)$ is also PDF which integral equals $1$): $$ \mathbb{E}(\frac{1}{X^2}) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{f_{\alpha}(x)}{x^2} dx = \frac{\beta}{\alpha-1} \cdot \frac{\beta}{\alpha-2} \cdot \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_{\alpha-2}(x) dx = \frac{\beta}{\alpha-1} \cdot \frac{\beta}{\alpha-2} $$ This solution above is for this particular case, but as whuber pointed out, the more general case for any real and positive $p \in \mathbb{R},~p >0$ it holds: $$ \mathbb{E}(X^p) = \beta^p \cdot \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + p)}{\Gamma(\alpha)}$$
