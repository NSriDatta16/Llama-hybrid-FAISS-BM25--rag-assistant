(Many thanks to GavinB for his helpfully leading comment on the question.) The call to glRenderbufferStorageOES was failing. glGetError() returned GL_INVALID_VALUE . The constants were all legit, so I cranked down the width and height params to very small, and succeeded here. Seems like there's an upper bound on the size of the surface I can create-- I'm not sure if the error means "you ran out of memory during allocation" or "there's a hard limit on dimensions regardless of ambient free memory" (can anyone enlighten me?). Is there such a thing as an OpenGL API reference (e.g. from Apple) with information specific to the iPhone? Many behaviors/limits are implementation specific, and it would be awesome to be able to look that stuff up in advance, rather than getting generic stuff when using Google...
