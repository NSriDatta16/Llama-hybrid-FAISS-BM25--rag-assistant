iPhone - Using OpenGL to create apps - What is a good wrapper or low-level engine to use?

I'm working on a couple apps which require the use of OpenGLes 2.0. I made a prototype of one starting from a simple sample project. However, I wasn't very happy with the clutter that all of the OpenGL code caused. I think that all the clutter would cause issues if I kept extending the code. So- Is there a good solution to working with OpenGL on a slightly higher level? I don't really need all the complexity and overhead of a game engine. I just am slightly frustrated I can't deal with OpenGL like this: ShaderProgram shader(fragmentCode, vertexCode); RenderBuffer renderBuffer(xResolution, yResolution);
