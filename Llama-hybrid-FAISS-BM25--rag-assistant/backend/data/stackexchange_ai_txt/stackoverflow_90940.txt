How can I find out how much of address space the application is consuming and report this to user?

I'm writing the memory manager for an application, as part of a team of twenty-odd coders. We're running out of memory quota and we need to be able to see what's going on, since we only appear to be using about 700Mb. I need to be able to report where it's all going - fragmentation etc. Any ideas?
