There's two parts to this - getting the files to the micro, and controlling the playback. The second part is easy - use mpd (http://mpd.wikia.com/). There's good clients available for Android and mpd is lightweight enough to run well on low-end or embedded devices, and ucLinux is specifically supported. Getting the files there is trickier. mpd expects to get the files from a filesystem, which tends to require more "serverness" than Android typically has. I found two options. If you can root the Android device you can run a samba server on the device (http://mobilitydigest.com/woah-samba-server-for-android/) and mount that. If you can't or don't want to root the device, there is a WebDAV server for Android (http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/productivity/davdrive_fwtl.html) and Linux supports mounting WebDAV shares as a filesystem. It can be pretty fiddly to get working though, and reliability can be a bit iffy too. Having said that, I think your best bet might be to give some local storage to the microcontroller and have it sync the files in advance, then control the playback with an mpd client.
