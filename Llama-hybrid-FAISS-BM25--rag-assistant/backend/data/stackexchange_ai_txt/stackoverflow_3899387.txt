How do I use the Youtube API to check if a video is embeddable?

Does anyone know how to check if a Youtube video is embeddable using the Youtube API? I've tried using this URL: http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/47z7i79NuK8 but the response I get, pasted below, doesn't seem to have a field for embeddable? entry: rating: rel: http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall max: "5" min: "1" average: "4.744681" numRaters: "94" group: duration: seconds: "47" player: url: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47z7i79NuK8&feature=youtube_gdata_player category: Entertainment title: "Sesame Street: P is For Princess available everywhere on DVD!" thumbnail: - time: "00:00:23.500" url: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/47z7i79NuK8/2.jpg height: "90" width: "120" - time: "00:00:11.750" url: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/47z7i79NuK8/1.jpg height: "90" width: "120" - time: "00:00:35.250" url: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/47z7i79NuK8/3.jpg height: "90" width: "120" - time: "00:00:23.500" url: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/47z7i79NuK8/0.jpg height: "240" width: "320" content: duration: "47" medium: video yt:format: "5" isDefault: "true" url: http://www.youtube.com/v/47z7i79NuK8?f=videos&app=youtube_gdata expression: full type: application/x-shockwave-flash description: |- "Once upon a time on Sesame Street, there lived a fairy-in-training named Abby Cadabby, and she loved playing princess with friends like Rosita.
