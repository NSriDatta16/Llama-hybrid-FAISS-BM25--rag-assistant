sphinx, buildbot (and code coverage). how do they integrate?

I have a not-so-small python package, with quite some history, documented with docstrings. During its development we introduced buildbot and later on Jenkins/Hudson . Recently I added a sphinx recipe to my buildbot.cfg , in order to collect the documentation from the sources and keep up to date web accessible docs. so far, so good: each time I commit a change, Jenkins takes care of extensively checking the package, generating a very complete overview and updating our documentation site. one of the sphinx extensions I enabled: coverage , for documentation coverage report, which is currently undocumented. I execute sphinx in my buildbot-generated environment, and I don't seem to manage to include the coverage statistics in the sphinx-generated documentation site! any hints?
