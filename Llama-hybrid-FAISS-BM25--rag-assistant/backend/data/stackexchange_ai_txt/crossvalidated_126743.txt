As far as I know, using a one-class SVM could be used to detect outliers, if you can define what the outliers (or conversely normal data) would look like. In that case, you can train an SVM with labels "normal" and "outlier", and use it to differentiate. Have you tried using a density based approach? Running OPTICS on the dataset and identifying some clustering and then defining the outliers would be a better bet as far as I know, unless you know what exactly an anomaly looks like.
