MVC-ish : Who is responsible for loading the data?

I just got out of a small project and I've tried to follow a somewhat domain-driven design (well, what I think it is...). I've struggled a bit were some of my domain class started to need to load something. I'm not sure this is the right place for it. Let's take for example a boring image slideshow. For my domain classes, I would define let's say an Image class and maybe a Slideshow class which contain a bunch of Image instances. Now, somewhere in my application, someone needs to load the actual image from the file system to display it. So the questions are : Who is responsible for loading the actual image? The Image class, The Slideshow class or something outside the domain classes? Should my domain objects be organized differently? Where do I store this image once it's loaded? How do I pass it to the view? Note: In a non-blocking, not multithreaded environment like Flash, loading stuff is always asynchronous. Thanks
