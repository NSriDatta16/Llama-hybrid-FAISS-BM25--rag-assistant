Best Practices for embedding .NET assemblies in SQL Server

What are some important practices to follow when creating a .NET assembly that is going to be embedded to SQL Server 2005? I am brand new to this, and I've found that there are significant method attributes like: [SqlFunction(FillRowMethodName = "FillRow", TableDefinition = "letter nchar(1)")] I'm also looking for common pitfalls to avoid, etc.
