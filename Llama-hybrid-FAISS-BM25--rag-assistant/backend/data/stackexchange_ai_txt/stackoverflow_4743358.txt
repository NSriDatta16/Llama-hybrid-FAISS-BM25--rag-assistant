You actually don't need to use the interfaces as the JavaScript XMLHttpRequest implementation will work just fine: There is an example here: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Example.3a_Asynchronous_request var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.open('GET', 'http://www.mozilla.org/', true); req.onreadystatechange = function (aEvt) { if (req.readyState == 4) { if(req.status == 200) dump(req.responseText); // your HTML is in this variable // since the element is an HTML element, you can use HTML DOM methods document.getElementById("container").innerHTML = req.responseText; else dump("Error loading page\n"); } }; req.send(null); Also, see this post as this is a repeated question: Ajax In Firefox Plugin EDIT: I made some adjustments to further target your question about embedding HTML in a tabpanel. Assume you have an HTML DIV container in your XUL, which can be accomplished using the HTML namespace bound to the window element. You can now use HTML DOM methods to inject your HTML into the XUL tabpanel. Inserting HTML in XUL Interfaces: http://www.xul.fr/tutorial/html.html
