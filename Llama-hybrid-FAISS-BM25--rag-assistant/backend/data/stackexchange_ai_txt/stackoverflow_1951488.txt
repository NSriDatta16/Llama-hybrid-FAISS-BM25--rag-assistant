Easiest way to manage my CLASSPATH?

I'm beginning to play with Clojure a bit and my Java experience is pretty limited. I'm coming from the dynamic world of Ruby and OO, so the functional side of things is very interesting! Anyway, as I discover libraries and various tools for use (and the tutorial files for the Pragmatic Clojure Book), everything typically calls for placing files in the CLASSPATH in order for Clojure to see the library for use. Is there such thing as good CLASSPATH practice? Would I ever want to only have a CLASSPATH with just the external libraries of files I need or can I go ahead toss any library or file I would ever need in a directory and simply define it as my CLASSPATH and only require what's needed? If it helps, I'm an OSX and Emacs user (Using slime and swank-clojure).
