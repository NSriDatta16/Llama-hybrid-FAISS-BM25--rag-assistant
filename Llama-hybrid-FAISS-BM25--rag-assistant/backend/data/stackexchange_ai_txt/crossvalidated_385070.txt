For an irreducible markov chain, Aperiodic : When starting from some state i, we don't know when we will return to the same state i after some transition. We may see the state i after 1,2,3,4,5.. etc number of transition. Periodic : When we can say that we can return to the state i after some transition with certainty. If a state is reachable after transition step of 2,4,6,8...etc. then it has periodicity of 2. For your example, if you draw a transition diagram you can see that it is possible to arrive at each state after different transition(1,2,3,4) which means there is no period to a state or state is aperiodic. This link also gives a good understanding of markov chain perdiocity.
