Getting Residuals to be White Noise

I'm on a time series project for an undergraduate course. For the project I'm trying to come up with an ARIMA model for the housing starts data set. http://www.quandl.com/FRED/HOUST-Housing-Starts-Total-New-Privately-Owned-Housing-Units-Started I have been trying to adjust the p and q to get residuals that are uncorrelated white noise. I tried auto.arima to get parameter values. > fit.start=auto.arima(data) > fit.start Series: data ARIMA(2,1,3)(2,0,0)[12] Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 ma3 sar1 sar2 1.2874 -0.3256 -1.6559 0.8715 -0.1725 -0.1352 -0.2074 s.e. 0.5709 0.5348 0.5665 0.7266 0.2052 0.0520 0.0517 > fit213200 tsdisplay(residuals(fit213200)) So is there anyway to get the residuals to be just white noise?
