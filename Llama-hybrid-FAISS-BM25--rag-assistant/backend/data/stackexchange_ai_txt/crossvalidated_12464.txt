I the key you may be looking for can be found on the UCLA website for Multinomial Logistic Regression where it states: Perfect prediction: Perfect prediction means that only one value of a predictor variable is associated with only one value of the response variable. You can tell from the output of the regression coefficients that something is wrong. You can then do a two-way tabulation of the outcome variable with the problematic variable to confirm this and then rerun the model without the problematic variable. I would recommend running a two-way table for each of the predictors (vs. the response) to determine if one level of the response occurs with only one level of your predictor.
