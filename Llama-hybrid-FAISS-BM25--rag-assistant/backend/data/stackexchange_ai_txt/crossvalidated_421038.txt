Test set residual diagnostics and summary statistics for regression

Is it not common in Statistics to perform residual diagnostics on out-of-bag data? In (linear) regression software packages (like Python's statsmodels), the output of a trained model often provides summary statistics and residual analytics out-of-the-box for the data the model was generated on (in Machine Learning lingo, I would call this the training set). Examples are: $R^2$ studentized residuals residuals in QQ-Plots This functionality is usually reserved for the data the model has been created on. I.e. for data that has not been used in the calculation of the model ("test data", unseen data, out-of-bag data), software packages usually offer a "predict" method on a trained model, but not the full set of evaluation tools that are provided for summary statistics and residual analytics on the "training" set. My question: Is it not common in Statistics to perform residual diagnostics on out-of-bag data? Or is this just a shortcoming of the particular implementations that I have used?
