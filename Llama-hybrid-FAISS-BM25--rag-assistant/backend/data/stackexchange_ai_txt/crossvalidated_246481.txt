Bayesian parameter estimation or Bayesian hypothesis testing?

It seems that there is an ongoing debate within the Bayesian community about whether we should be doing Bayesian parameter estimation or Bayesian hypothesis testing. I'm interested in soliciting opinions about this. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these approaches? In which contexts is one more appropriate than the other? Should we be doing both parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, or just one?
