When a user-agent (client application) requests a resource they will beacon out several different mime-types for that single requested resource. This occurs for compatibility reasons to let the web server know what the user-agent is capable of accepting. It is the job of the server to determine what the mime-type of the resource will actually be. It doesn't hurt to make some decisions on the server side to in finding the appropriate response. If you wish to serve all HTML pages as XML, for instance, but a major user-agent does not support the necessary mime-type you can supply a dynamic response using an assisting technology, such as PHP or ASP. In the case of this example the best idea would be to set the correct mime-type as the canonical and if the user-agent does not support the canonical then serve them something else that they will support, otherwise everybody gets the canonical.
