You ask whether it's ever valid. Let me provide a common example, whose elucidation may suggest additional analytical approaches for you. The simplest example of an interaction is a model with one dependent variable $Z$ and two independent variables $X$, $Y$ in the form $$Z = \alpha + \beta' X + \gamma' Y + \delta' X Y + \varepsilon,$$ with $\varepsilon$ a random term variable having zero expectation, and using parameters $\alpha, \beta', \gamma',$ and $\delta'$. It's often worthwhile checking whether $\delta'$ approximates $\beta' \gamma'$, because an algebraically equivalent expression of the same model is $$Z = \alpha \left(1 + \beta X + \gamma Y + \delta X Y \right) + \varepsilon$$ $$= \alpha \left(1 + \beta X \right) \left(1 + \gamma Y \right) + \alpha \left( \delta - \beta \gamma \right) X Y + \varepsilon$$ (where $\beta' = \alpha \beta$, etc). Whence, if there's a reason to suppose $\left( \delta - \beta \gamma \right) \sim 0$, we can absorb it in the error term $\varepsilon$. Not only does this give a "pure interaction", it does so without a constant term. This in turn strongly suggests taking logarithms. Some heteroscedasticity in the residuals--that is, a tendency for residuals associated with larger values of $Z$ to be larger in absolute value than average--would also point in this direction. We would then want to explore an alternative formulation $$\log(Z) = \log(\alpha) + \log(1 + \beta X) + \log(1 + \gamma Y) + \tau$$ with iid random error $\tau$. Furthermore, if we expect $\beta X$ and $\gamma Y$ to be large compared to $1$, we would instead just propose the model $$\log(Z) = \left(\log(\alpha) + \log(\beta) + \log(\gamma)\right) + \log(X) + \log(Y) + \tau$$ $$= \eta + \log(X) + \log(Y) + \tau.$$ This new model has just a single parameter $\eta$ instead of four parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta'$, etc.) subject to a quadratic relation ($\delta' = \beta' \gamma'$), a considerable simplification. I am not saying that this is a necessary or even the only step to take, but I am suggesting that this kind of algebraic rearrangement of the model is usually worth considering whenever interactions alone appear to be significant. Some excellent ways to explore models with interaction, especially with just two and three independent variables, appear in chapters 10 - 13 of Tukey's EDA .
