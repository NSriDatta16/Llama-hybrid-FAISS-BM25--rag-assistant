Why does my logistic regression model fail the Homer and Lemeshow's test?

I apologize in advance if my questions seem incredibly dull. Trying to teach myself Stata before I get to grad school as someone who's brain is very much not made for handling statistics. So trying to understand how to perform a logistic regression using Stata. Using this data set from PEW: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-68/ . So thought it might be interesting to see if mask wearing can be explained by partisanship, knowledge of health risk (using variables living in a metropolitan area, age, educational level, and how closely they follow the news), and income (because I'm thinking this would affect access to resources/masks?). I recoded my variables of interest. Run models, and the Pseudo R2 value seems to imply that with each model, the explanatory power increases, but when I try to check Homer and Lemeshow's fit, my model is super not a good fit. Any tips? Am I setting up this model correctly? Here is my code: import spss using "C:\Users\NAME\Desktop\ATP W68.sav" recode F_AGECAT (1/3 = 0) (4 = 1), gen(age) label variable age "Age" label define abracket 0 "18-64" 1 "65+" label value age abracket replace age = . if age == 99 recode F_INCOME_RECODE (3 = 0) (1/2 = 1), gen(income) label variable income "Income Level" label define irange 0 "
