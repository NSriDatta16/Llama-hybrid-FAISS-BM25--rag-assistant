Average sample size of two fishers z correlations

I am conducting a meta analysis of Pearson's r correlations. As there are two correlations , sometimes three , for the same study and dependent variable I have averaged the correlations via fishers z transformations. I now need one sample size for both correlations in order to calculate the standard error of the combined average score. If I am to use the formula of 1/(√N−3)to calculate the standard error of the averaged score then this requires one sample size. Is there a way in which to calculate a combined or averaged sample size please?
