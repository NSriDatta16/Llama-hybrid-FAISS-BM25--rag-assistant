Similarities between algorithms in anomaly detection in time series

I am interested in detecting outliers (contextual outliers, global outliers) in a 2-dimensional time series data, so I decided to use the tsoutliers library implemented in R, Holt method (I could not use Holt-Winter because the period is not fixed) and DBSCAN. Holt method and tsoutliers were applied separately to each variable, while DBSCAN was applied to the 2-dimensional time series. Tsoutliers was applied to the original data, Holt's method was applied after removing seasonality with dummies and DBSCAN was applied to the residuals of an ARIMA model after removing seasonality and trend. I used the Jaccard index to measure the similarity between the three algorithms and obtained a very low similarity between the algorithms. The similarities are shown in the figure below. Is this a normal result and if not, what could be the cause of this problem? (I used DBSCAN on residuals because otherwise the algorithm would only be able to find global outliers)
