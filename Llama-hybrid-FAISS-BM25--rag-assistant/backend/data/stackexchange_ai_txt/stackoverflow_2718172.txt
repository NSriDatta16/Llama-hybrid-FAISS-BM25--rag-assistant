Using the Module Pattern for larger projects

I'm interested in using the Module Pattern to better organize my future projects. Unfortunately, there are only a few brief tutorials and proof-of-concept examples of the Module Pattern. Using the module pattern, I would like to organize projects into this sort of structure: project.arm.object.method(); Where "project" is my global project name, "arm" is a sub-section or branch of the project, "object" is an individual object, and so on to the methods and properties. However, I'm not sure how I should be declaring and organizing multiple "arms" and "objects" under "project". var project = window.project || {}; project.arm = project.arm || {}; project.arm.object = (function() { var privateVar = "Private contents."; function privateMethod() { alert(privateVar); } return { method: privateMethod }; }()); Are there any best practices or conventions when defining a complex module structure? Should I just declare a new arm/object underneath the last?
