Is there such a thing as RNN-LSTM

From the title, I wanna know if there's such a thing as RNN-LSTM. I know that they are their own thing but I've yet to know if there's such a "combination". For context, I was reading a research paper and there was this passage (source below): RNN-LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997): The Recurrent Neural Network using LSTM cell. We combine an LSTM layer and a dense layer to perform multivariate time series forecasting. Source: Cheng, J., Huang, K., & Zheng, Z. (2020).
