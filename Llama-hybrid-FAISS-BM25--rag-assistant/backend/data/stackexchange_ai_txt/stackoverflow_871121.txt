Best storage approach for small amount of 99% static data needed at startup?

I have some (small amount) of data that I'll need quick access to on inital load, but not after that. Right now, I have serialized the data (Generic List) to an Xml file and I'm deserializing it on load as needed. My question is should I use the XmlSerializer or the BinaryFormatter? I'm not worried about file size, but serialization speed.
