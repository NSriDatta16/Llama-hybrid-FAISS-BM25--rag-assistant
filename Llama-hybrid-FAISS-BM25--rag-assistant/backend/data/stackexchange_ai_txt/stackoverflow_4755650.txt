Well, no. Sure you can upcast from MapImage to Vector2D, but the vector<>'s are unrelated types. Are you expecting a direct case, or a copy to be created? The latter won't happen because of the non-const reference to the vector<>. Why? Support these were just arrays, an iterator would need to know the size of a record, and this will be different for the different types.
