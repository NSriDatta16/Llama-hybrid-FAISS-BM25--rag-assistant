Quick-R is a nice site for some examples on how you can easilly do a ton of useful stuff in R: http://www.statmethods.net/ For fancy visualizations, check out some of the examples from my package qgraph :) http://sites.google.com/site/qgraphproject/examples Most of those pictures are included in the help files ( ?qgraph.pca , ?qgraph.efa ) And of course check out examples from ggplot2
