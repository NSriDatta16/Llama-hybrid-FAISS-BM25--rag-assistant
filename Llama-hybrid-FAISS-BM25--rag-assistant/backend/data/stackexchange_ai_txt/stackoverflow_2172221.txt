You could use a StringWriter to first write the stylesheet information into it, and then marshal the object into it: StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); //add processing instructions "by hand" with escaped quotation marks //or single marks writer.println(" "); writer.println(" "); //create and configure marshaller to leave out processing instructions Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller(); marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FRAGMENT, Boolean.TRUE); //marshal to the StringWriter marshaller.marshal(someObject,writer); //get the string representation String str = writer.toString(); Of course you can also directly print to every other output stream you want, e.g. files or Sytstem.out.
