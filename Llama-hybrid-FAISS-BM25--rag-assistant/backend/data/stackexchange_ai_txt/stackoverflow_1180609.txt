RHEL/Apache ssl.conf configuration problem

We've got multiple subdomains, each with it's own virtualhost entry in httpd.conf and (for those supporting https) in ssl.conf as well. Our main www subdomain has a GoDaddy cert associated with it. The subdomain I'm configuring right now on our dev server ("api.bulbstorm.com") has an ssl.conf virtualhost entry that looks like this: DocumentRoot "/var/www/api" ServerName api.bulbstorm.com:443 ErrorLog logs/api-error_log CustomLog logs/api-access_log common LogLevel warn SSLEngine on SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 SSLCertificateFile /var/www/certs/api/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /var/www/certs/api/server.key SSLOptions +StdEnvVars SSLOptions +StdEnvVars Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On AllowOverride All Order allow,deny Allow from all php_value include_path "/var/www/inc" SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \ nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \ downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0 CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \ "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b" ... the crt & key files in /var/www/certs/api/ were generated using openssl per instructions found here . The api subdomain originally pointed to the godaddy cert for the www subdomain. But even though I've changed the virtualhost entry associated with the api subdomain to point to the self-signed certificate/key pair (and have restarted httpd, completely cleared browser settings related to the previous exception for the godaddy cert, etc.) browsers are still throwing warnings saying that the cert is for the www domain. When I look at the cert the browsers are pulling it looks like they're still getting the godaddy cert. Higher up in the ssl.conf file there are these lines: SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key This cert/key pair is different than the godaddy cert/key pair referenced in the virtualhost entry for the www subdomain, which looks like this: SSLCertificateFile /etc/www.bulbstorm.com_ssl/www.bulbstorm.com.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/www.bulbstorm.com_ssl/www.bulbstorm.com.key SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/www.bulbstorm.com_ssl/gd_intermediate_bundle.crt Any light that anyone can shed on the issue I'm having will be appreciated.
