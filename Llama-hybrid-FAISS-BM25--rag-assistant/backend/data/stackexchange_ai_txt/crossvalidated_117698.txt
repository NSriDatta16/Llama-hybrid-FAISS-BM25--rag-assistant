It is not true that they "should be of unit length"; PCA works fine without using unit vectors given your data $x$ as long as you use a fixed arbitrary length $l$. Having said that you want to have the eigenvectors $\alpha_k$ of your covariance matrix $C$ to be unit vectors, ie. $\alpha_k^T \alpha_k = 1$, so you can: Use the associated eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ as the variance of $\alpha_k^T x$. Use the eigenvectors as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to $x$. The first chapter from Jolliffe's Principal Component Analysis (Introduction) gives a more detailed (and nicer) exposition of these issues.
