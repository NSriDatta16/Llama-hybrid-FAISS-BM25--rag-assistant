Interfaces with lots of controls and options immediately on one screen can be overwhelming to users. GMail has this slogan " Search, don't sort ". The same principle can be applied to user interfaces. As you mentioned, users are already doing this themselves by googling for features.

The IDE Insight feature in the upcoming RAD Studio 2010 does exactly that.
