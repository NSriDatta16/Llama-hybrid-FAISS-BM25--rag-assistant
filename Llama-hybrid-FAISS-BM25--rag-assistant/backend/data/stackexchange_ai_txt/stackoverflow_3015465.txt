You wrote: But it is not HTML5 and without a DOCTYPE Not true. From http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/ There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax And For XHTML, it is recommended that the DOCTYPE be omitted because it is unnecessary To date there is no support for HTML5 in IE. The same applies to SVG (except by using plugins). It is clear then that IE is not your target browser. Today I would not pay much attention to validator because HTML5 is a Working Draft. Answer : Stay with XML serialization, this will give you full support for SVG.
