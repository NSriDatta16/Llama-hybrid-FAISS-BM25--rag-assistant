Why is the chi-square test more popular than the G-test?

Pearson's chi-square test and the G-test are two goodness-of-fit hypothesis tests for categorical data -- i.e., testing whether a sample came from a given distribution on a finite set. The respective test statistics are given by $$\chi^2 = \sum_i^k \frac{(X_i-np_i)^2}{np_i} ~~~~~ \text{ and } ~~~~~ G = 2\sum_i^k X_i \log\left(\frac{X_i}{np_i}\right),$$ where $n = \sum_i^k X_i$ is the sample size and $X_i$ is the observed number of items in category $i$ and $p$ is the null hypothesis distribution. As far as I can tell, the G-test is "better," but the chi-square test is more popular. Why? By better, I simply mean in terms of the statistical results (i.e., p-values) it produces, rather than aesthetics or ease of use. In my experience, the G-test is better when the number of categories $k$ is large (but the distribution $p$ is quite concentrated, e.g., Poisson or geometric) and is also more robust to changing a single sample. Wikipedia says "For testing goodness-of-fit the G-test is infinitely more efficient than the chi squared test in the sense of Bahadur, but the two tests are equally efficient in the sense of Pitman or in the sense of Hodges and Lehmann." The only explanation I have been able to find comes from an unsourced (and now removed) paragraph on Wikipedia : The approximation of G by chi squared is obtained by a second order Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm around 1. This approximation was developed by Karl Pearson because at the time it was unduly laborious to calculate log-likelihood ratios. [citation needed] With the advent of electronic calculators and personal computers, this is no longer a problem. Is that the reason? The chi-square is used to avoid computing logarithms? Another answer on this site recommends the chi-square test instead of the G-test "because R has a convenient function for that which includes the option of simulating the p-value." This is reasonable, but it makes you wonder why there isn't an R function for the G-test. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone with a better knowledge of statistics and its history can shine some light on this question. Perhaps there is some advantage of chi-square that I am not aware of or perhaps it's entirely historical.
