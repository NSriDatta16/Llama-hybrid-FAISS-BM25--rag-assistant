It's normally called a conversion function. It isn't an implicit conversion per se, but does allow implicit conversion to the target type. Edit: just checked to be sure -- ยง12.3.2 of the standard uses the phrase "conversion function". Edit2: I checked in the official standard, which isn't (at least supposed to be) freely available (though you can buy it from the ISO or most member standards organizations such as ANSI , BSI , etc.) A lot of people prefer to save the money and use the final committee draft , which is free.
