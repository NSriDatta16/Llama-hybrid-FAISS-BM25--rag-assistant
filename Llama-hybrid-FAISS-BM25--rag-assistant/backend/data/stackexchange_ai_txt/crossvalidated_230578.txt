Prerequisites for generalized linear models class

I am considering taking a course in generalized linear models at an American university this year. I have good knowledge of probability at the level of Ross and also Tsitsiklis . My calculus and linear algebra knowledge I am quite confident in. For any instructors of such classes or students that have taken the class, do you think I have the proper background for such a class? The class follows the textbook by McCullagh and Nelder which I've began reading and find it moderately challenging but still unsure if the course will require more statistics background from me.
