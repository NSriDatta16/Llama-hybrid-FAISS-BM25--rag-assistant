Well I think it's best to determine which subset of the hardware you have available you'll be developing your application for. Software for the PS3 needs special attention and will require separate development from something built to run on typical linux servers. You may also need to do some research on how you could develop an application for the 360; I'm not sure if it'd really give you what you're looking for to be honest. Once you've decided on the subset of hardware you need to develop for it would be good to start with some basic development to ensure you can a foundation put together which enables communication. With a solid foundation you'll be able to expand your code to support a variety of distributed projects. I hope I'm understanding your question correctly! Cheers
