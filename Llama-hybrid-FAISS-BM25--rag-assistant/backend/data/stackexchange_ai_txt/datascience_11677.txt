As Jeremy Barnes and Jamesmf said, you can use any machine learning algorithms to deal with the problem. They are powerful and could identify the features automatically. You just need to feed the algorithm the correct training data. Since it is needed to work on images, convolution neural networks will be a better option for you . This is a good tutorial for learning about the convolution neural network. You could download the code also and could change according to your problem definition. But you need to learn python and theano library for the processing and you will get good tutorials for that too
