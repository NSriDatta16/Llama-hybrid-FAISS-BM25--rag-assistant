Store the binary files in the file system. Create a ASP.NET application for the storage and retrieval operations. You can be fancy with the web app (doc versioning, multi-tier security, etc). I think this is the consensus in the doc management industry. Since your "number of document is growing drastically", looks like this is becoming large scale. You may want to start looking at third-party, out-of-the-box solutions (such as http://kofax.com/capture/ - I have an extensive experience with this!) to do the "dirty job" for you. Or better yet, consider looking at SaaS offering such as these guys http://www.edocumentsolutionsllc.com/ :-)
