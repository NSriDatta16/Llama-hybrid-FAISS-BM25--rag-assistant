There’s a lot of statistics that isn’t machine learning: experimental design, inference, interpretable models. All three could be much more important than machine learning, depending on the job. Then there’s the part that statisticians don’t like, which is that most of what a data scientist does is argue with data sets that are in nasty formats. That could be of considerable importance to a machine learning group, but someone good at programming with no knowledge of predictive modeling could be quite excellent at such a task.
