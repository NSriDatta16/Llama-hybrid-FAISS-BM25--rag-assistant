gedit broken shortcut keys, has mod2

I have been trying to play around with gedit and came across the "shortcut editor" plugin. But somehow, it messed up my key bindings. It no longer works. Everytime I try to setup a new shortcut, I get a "Mod2" addition to the bind. How do I reset to the default key bindings? How do I remove Mod2? Thanks, Wenbert EDIT: Google does not seem to return any relevant results regarding this issue.
