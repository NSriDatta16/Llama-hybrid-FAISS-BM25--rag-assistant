CTS_ERROR >>> Failed to execute shell command am instrument

Using the Android 2.2, API-8, SDK-r7 along with CTS-2.2_r4 suite. Updated the SDK_ROOT environment variable with SDK_r7 tools in “android-cts/tools/startcts” script and the “SDK_ROOT/tools” also included in PATH environment variable. Ran the “android” and created a new virtual device and started the same. This invokes the emulator named as “emulator-5554” . Now, started the cts using the below command: bash android-cts/tools/startcts. start –plan android Above command failed with: Test package: android.app install met failure [install_failed_insufficient_storage] CTS_ERROR >>> Failed to execute shell command am instrument -w -r -e package android com.android.cts.app/android.test.InstrumentationCtsTestRunner on device emulator-5554 com.android.ddmlib.ShellCommandUnresponsiveException. A few more issues are: CTS_ERROR >>> Got exception while processing command CTS_ERROR >>> Installing met timeout due to Unknown reason CTS_ERROR >>> Timeout: ReferenceAppTest CTS_ERROR >>> Timeout: getDeviceInfo Any hint to avoid the above timeout issues? Thank you very much for anticipating a quick response from you.
