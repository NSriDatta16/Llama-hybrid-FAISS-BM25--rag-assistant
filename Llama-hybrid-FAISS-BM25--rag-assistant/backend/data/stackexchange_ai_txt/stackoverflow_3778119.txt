I would advise to plan along the lines of almost-infinitely scalable solutions (see Pat Helland's paper on Life beyond distributed transactions) and the CQRS approach in general. This way you'll be able to avoid common pitfalls of the distributed apps generally and Azure table storage peculiarities. This really helps us to work with Azure and Cloud Computing at Lokad (data-sets are quite large plus various levels of scalability are needed).
