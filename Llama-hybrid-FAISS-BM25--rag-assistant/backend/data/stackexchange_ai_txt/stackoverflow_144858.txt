If it requires more time to read and understand the code (if that is even possible) than it would to rewrite the entire application, I say scrap it and start over. Be very carefull with this: Are you sure you aren't just being lazy and not bothering to read the code Are you being arrogant about the great code you will write compared to the rubbish anyone else produced. Remember tested-working code is worth a lot more than imaginary yet-to-be-written code In the words of our estemed host and overlord, Joel - things you should never do , it's not always wrong to abandon working code - but you have to be sure about the reason.
