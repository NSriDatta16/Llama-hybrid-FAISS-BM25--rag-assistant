How to replace values in a numpy array?

I'm learning how to implement and evaluate a Logistic Regression Model, for this I need to change the values of my array from strings to 0 & 1. I have the following numpy ndarray as a result of a DataFrame.values call ['PAIDOFF', 'COLLECTION', 'COLLECTION', 'PAIDOFF', 'PAIDOFF', 'PAIDOFF', ...] I would like to know how can I change the values like: 'PAIDOFF' to 0 and 'COLLECTION' to 1 Any help will be much appreciated
