How to drag-and-drop on custom Swing components

How can I implement drag and drop on custom components, e.g. my own JPanel subclasses? What I need is full Swing-like drag and drop support. With TransferHandlers , DropTargetListeners etc. So the trivial mousePressed() and mouseReleased() is not what I'm looking for.
