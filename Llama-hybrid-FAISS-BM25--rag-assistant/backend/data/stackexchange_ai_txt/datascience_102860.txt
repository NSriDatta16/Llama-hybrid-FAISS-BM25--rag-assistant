This could be framed, as a first approximation, as a supervised learning classifier , where, based on the input texts (both name and description), you can build a series of features to build your classification model. One option is: tokenize (split into words) your texts (both name and descriptions) filter some not useful (presumably) words like preprositions and other so called stop words (look at libraries like nltk for language processing select the most frequent words of your bag-of-words based on all of the categories you have until now; this is something you can find out by looking at a frequency bar plot for your entire words dataset find the frequency of ocurrence of each word in each of your name-description sample, where each row of your dataset could be something like: kitchen bathroom storage cooking microwave oven ... CATEGORY_label 0 0 0 0 2 1 ... 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 ... 3 ... where label 1 is your kitchen appliances category and so on... This would end up in a multi-class classifier, since you are trying to classify among several possible categories. As many new entries as you end having, more key words you will have for each category. This is the easiest approach (based on words counting) you could begin with, since, for natural language processing, you can go on lagter with other approaches: TF-IDF instead of just counting words, and other more sophisticated like word embeddings
