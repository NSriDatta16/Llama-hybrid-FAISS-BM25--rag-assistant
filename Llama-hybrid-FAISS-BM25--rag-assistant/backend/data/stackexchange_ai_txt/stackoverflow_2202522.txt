user interface: what should a file drop target look like?

I have a dialog that includes file selection and it has a "Browse..." button. But it seems like it would be a good idea to provide some kind of drop target so that the user can use his/her favorite file browser to select a file (or files) and drag it onto my application. Is there any standard practice for what to use as a drop target? Is it a file icon of some sort? what would that look like?
