I haven't really tested any other webservice frameworks - always been going with CXF and am quite happy with that. If you're using Netbeans (even if not, it's still useful I'd say), check out this tutorial: http://sites.google.com/site/apachecxfnetbeans/loanproc Just skip the first few paragraphs (Database integration, testing etc. etc. .. all of which you should already have knowledge about). The CXF integration in Netbeans is useful for writing fast clients using the built-in netbeans functionalities. cheers
