Is there a number limit on opened win32 IStream object for IStorage created with StgCreateStorageEx?

I create an IStorage by StgCreateStorageEx function, with type: STGFMT_STORAGE . Then I used the CreateStream method to create IStream objects (around 60). I didn't call Release on all of the IStream interfaces, but when I call Seek on some of them, it returns STG_E_REVERTED . However, if I create them and use them one by one, it works properly. Does anyone know why? Is there a limit?
