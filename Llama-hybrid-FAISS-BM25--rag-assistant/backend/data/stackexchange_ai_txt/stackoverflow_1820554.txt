Just some addition to what RickNZ proposed above.. Since your master data which you are caching currently won't change so frequently and probably over some maintenance window, here is what should you do first on database side: Create a SNAPSHOT replication for the master tables which you want to cache. Adding new entities will be equally easy. On all the webservers, install SQL Express and subscribe to this Publication. Since, this is not a frequently changing data, you can rest assure, no much server resource usage issue minus network trips for master data. All your caching which was available via previous mechanism is still availbale minus all headache which comes when you add new entities. Next, you can leverage .NET mechanisms as suggested above. You won't face memcached cluster failure unless your webserver itself goes down. There is a lot availble in .NET which a .NET pro can point out after this stage.
