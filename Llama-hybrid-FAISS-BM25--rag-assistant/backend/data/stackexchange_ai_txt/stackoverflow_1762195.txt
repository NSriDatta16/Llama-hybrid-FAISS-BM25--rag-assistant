It all depends on how many projects you have, the size of your organisation, how related the projects are, and so on. If you're part of a large team with a couple of dozen projects, a repository per project is going to be pretty unwieldy to administer. Depending on what type of work your organisation does, another option is to have one repository per client . Where I work, we currently have four repositories - one for projects that are completely internal to us, one for the software we sell, and two that are completely specific to particular clients for whom we produce custom software applicable only to them. This is an attempt at a 'best of both worlds' solution - we don't have one massive repository that contains everything and has a revision number in the billions (I exaggerate obviously!), but nor do we have dozens of piddly little repositories lying around with one project in each.
