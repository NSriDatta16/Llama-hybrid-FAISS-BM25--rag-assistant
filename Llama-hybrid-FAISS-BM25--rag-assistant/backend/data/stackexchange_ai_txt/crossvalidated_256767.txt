It would appear to me that you have daily time series data where you are measuring two characteristics. I would initially suggest using augmented ARIMA methods incorporating both memory and possible dummy indicators reflecting pulses. level/step shifts and/or time trends. Secondly it is possible to additionally relate these two series using a multivariate extension of ARIMA called Transfer Functions while investigating the impact of some of your user-suggested explanatory variables. If you wish to post data on one of your subjects showing both characteristics , I might be able to hep further. You can search SE for DAILY DATA or ARIMA and learn more about time series analysis. Model forecasts can always be converted to expected growth rates.
