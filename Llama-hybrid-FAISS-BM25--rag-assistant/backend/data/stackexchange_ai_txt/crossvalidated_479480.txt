Predicting Probabilities of non-binary outcomes with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) in R

I have three non-binary, discrete variables X0.1, X0.12 and X0.15. I want to model X0.1 as a MARS model of X0.12 and X0.15, then using the model answer queries of the form P(X0.1=x|X0.12=y, X0.15=z). This is what I have tried so far : > mars1 mars1$coefficients X0.1 (Intercept) 1.2392880 h(1-X0.12) -0.8291468 h(X0.15-1) -0.3891442 > predict(mars1, data.frame(X0.15=0, X0.12=1), type="response") X0.1 [1,] 1.239288 This is clearly not a probability. I have also tried converting my variables into factors. > a $X0.1) > b X0.12) > c $X0.15) > mars1 mars1$ coefficients 0 1 2 (Intercept) 0.7890499 0.013295241 0.1976548 b1 -0.4273462 0.001813694 0.4255325 b2 -0.3652277 0.091872210 0.2733555 c2 0.1230729 0.105687002 -0.2287599 predict(mars1, data.frame(b=factor("2"),c=factor("2"), levels=levels(c)), type="response") 0 1 2 [1,] 0.5348205 0.3321178 0.2452333 [2,] 0.5348205 0.3321178 0.2452333 [3,] 0.5348205 0.3321178 0.2452333 The row sums of the prediction are not 1, so these can't be the probabilities either. What exactly do these numbers mean? Where am I going wrong? Is MARS the wrong tool for this? I want a multinomial logistic regression setting such that interaction terms are automatically detected (I intend to run this on bigger sets of variables).
