Can you briefly explain what is Sharepoint? Microsoft's all-in-one powerhouse tool that's been gaining a lot of traction lately. Used heavily (and often inappropriately) by lots of corporations for internal document management, portal-type communities, and workflow solutions. Do you need a license to deploy a Sharepoint website? SharePoint Foundation is free. SharePoint Server is not. SharePoint Server comes with additional tools that your client may or may not need. What do you need to develop for it? (license, tools) The only real way to develop for SharePoint is Visual Studio 2010. 2010 specifically because they added a ton of new SharePoint-specific features to it (MS is pushing SharePoint really hard.) Does it need to run on a IIS server? Yes. What language will/could be used? Any .NET language, I believe. I've only done it in C#. In summary: you need to take a big, long step back and discuss this with the client. For one, SharePoint has a massive API that's going to take a while to learn, especially if you're working with LAMP developers. For two, SharePoint is the most in-demand skill in enterprise software development right now. If you need to hire SharePoint developers; take the average salary of a software dev in your area, and double it, because that's how much a decent SharePoint developer will cost. This is to say nothing of the non-development side of things, such as server administration, information architecture, and content management.
