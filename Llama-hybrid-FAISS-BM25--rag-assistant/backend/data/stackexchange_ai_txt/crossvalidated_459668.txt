How to train a neural network with an incomplete dataset?

I am currently training a neural network with a dataset containing approximately 10 features and 1000 entries. The problem is that 70% of the entries contain at least one missing value for at least one of the features. I am testing two different approaches: 1-Dropping all the incomplete entries, leaving me with 30% of the total data, to be split between training, validation and testing. I managed to get around 70% testing accuracy, which could definitely be improved. 2-Keeping all the entries, but replacing each of the missing values with the mean of all the values for that given feature. In this case, the accuracy is very low, around 50%. How can I better use my data, in order to maximise the amount of data used for training? Maybe some kind of data augmentation technique (even though my data is not image, it only consists of numbers)?
