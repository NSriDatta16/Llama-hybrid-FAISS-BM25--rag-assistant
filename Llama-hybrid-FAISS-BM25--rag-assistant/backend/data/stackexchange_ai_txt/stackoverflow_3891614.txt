I found what was wrong. For every enum type [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAttributeAttribute()] public REQUESTTypetype Type; I got this: [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIgnoreAttribute()] public bool TypeSpecified; And in the code I should do this: request.Type = REQUESTTypetype.One; request.TypeSpecified = true; It works fine now. I should have post them in my question but I did not pay attention to these "specified" members at all. Thanks for your replies.
