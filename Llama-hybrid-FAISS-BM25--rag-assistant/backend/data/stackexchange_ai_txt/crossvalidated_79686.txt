BP like methods find the optimal parameters for maximizing posterior. This is basically the parameter estimation. Inference can also be done in a similar way. Prediction of the new label could be cast as maximizing a posterior given the optimal parameters of the new model. This is a fully Bayesian approach to estimation, in contrary to directly doing EM steps. For more details see section 4 @ http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/Wainwright06_JMLR.pdf
