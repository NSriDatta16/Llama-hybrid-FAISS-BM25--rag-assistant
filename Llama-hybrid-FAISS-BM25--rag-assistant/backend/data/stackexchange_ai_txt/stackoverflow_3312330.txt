Since you are deciding where to go exactly, to be in software development or to become expert in hardware and networking, I would like to point out that in my opinion it is two different occupations and they require two different mindsets. Good hardware experts are usually not good programmers and good programmers almost always not experts in hardware and networking. So I would say don't try to embrace both, stick to one direction which is most suitable to your mindset. To pursue two rabbits would result in catching no one. @Justian I see, sorry I somewhat misunderstood you. Desire to understand intricacies of how code gets processed inside of hardware is a very natural one. When in college I was reading the book "How computer works" - it is fairly simple, even somewhat primitive book about general hardware functionality. But it can get you a broad look on the topic. Another analogy came to mind. Say linguists research internal mechanics of language, but it is neuroscientists who research on how language signals get processed in brain. Two very different occupations. This is not to discourage you from learning hardware though, this is just to underline difference between two realms.
