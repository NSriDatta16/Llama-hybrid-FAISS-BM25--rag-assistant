Random forest is an ensemble of many (weak) trees. Each tree grows independently from each other. So to answer your question, we could just use one tree. When a tree grow, it has to select a variable to split to maximum some gain (like Gini information). If a variable is constant, or with a lot of missing values, then the variable is very much likely not to be chosen. Trees does not remove any variable but it selects informative variables. As a result, some variable probably will never be selected (thus abandoned by the algorithm).
