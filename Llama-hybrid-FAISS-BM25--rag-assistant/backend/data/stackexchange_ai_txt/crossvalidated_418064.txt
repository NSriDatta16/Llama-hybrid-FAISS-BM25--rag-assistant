Need PCA or other dimensionality reduction with mixed type variables, before doing clustering

I have a fairly large dataset of 171 mixed variables (104 dichotomous/qualitative, and 67 continuous). My goal is to build a typology of agricultural systems. I originally used a PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and use the PCA factors to do a cluster analysis and determine the typologies. The results had some sense but I felt I was loosing key information since I´ll use the clusters for further analysis. I have realized that I might be making a mistake by PCA (with all those dichotomous variables). I have found alternative analysis for data reduction (PCAMix, FactoMineR), however, I dont know how to use the separate results of a PCA, MCA or FAMD to later, perform a Cluster Analysis. I appreciate any insights. I´m working on R and SPSS.
