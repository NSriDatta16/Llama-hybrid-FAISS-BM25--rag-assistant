There are two projects in github that fit what you're asking. ruby-hdfs provides native C bindings to HDFS for Ruby. ganapati interfaces with a Thrift server. You could also make system calls directly to the file system shell . For example: cmd = "hadoop fs -mkdir #{hdfs_path}" cmd += " 2> /dev/null" system(cmd) if $? == 0 puts 'ok' exit(0) else puts "Error: failed to create hdfs://#{hdfs_path}" exit(2) end
