One way is to use Super Keys to constrain subtypes Item would have a TypeID column (lookup to a new table ItemType) New ItemType 1=Pizza, 2=Sides, 3=Beverage etc There is a new unique constraint on Item with current PK column(s) + TypeID Each table Pizza, Beverage, Sides has a typeID column with a CHECK constraint to restrict entries in the table to one of Pizza, Sides, Beverage. So 1 for Pizza etc. The FK from Pizza, Beverage, Sides to Item is the same as the new unique constraint above This answers your second question too
