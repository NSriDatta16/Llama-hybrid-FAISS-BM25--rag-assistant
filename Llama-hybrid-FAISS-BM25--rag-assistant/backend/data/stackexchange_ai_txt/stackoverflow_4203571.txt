Did you try something like: window.open("data:text/plain;charset=utf-8," + localStorage.WebAppData); For the download, I guess you need a round trip to a server, that will set a mime/type that will make the download box to pop up. EDIT : If you use localStorage , may be window.postMessage is available in your environment and could help for speed.
