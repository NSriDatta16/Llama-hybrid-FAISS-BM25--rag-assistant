It means there's no indexAction method in your controller class. Your controller was instantiated and, based on the URL, Magento determined the action was "index". This is the default action. For example, if you have a URL like this http://example.com/products/ is usually (Zend is used differently all over the place) the same as a URL like this http://example.com/products/index That is, they would both instantiate a ProductController and with an action of index. public function indexAction(){...} So, your controller is missing a method named indexAction. What happens next is, the request is sent to PHP magic __call method. If this method exists on a class, calls to non-existent methods go there. The Zend Exception is telling you that, in addition to there being no method for indexAction , there was nothing in __call about indexAction either.
