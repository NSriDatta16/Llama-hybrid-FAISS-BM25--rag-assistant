What defines a "low" predictive error

Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach I have estimated a parameter from my observed data. Now, following this vignette from the R package abc ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/vignettes/abcvignette.pdf page 4) I am estimating the predictive error (PE) of my estimate: I have two questions: 1) What does Var(theta(i)) mean? How can I get a variance for one value? 2) I think the PE is unbounded? I would only want a low value? How low should I expect this value to be?
