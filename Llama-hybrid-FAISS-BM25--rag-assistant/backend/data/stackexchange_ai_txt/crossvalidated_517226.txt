This is a bais-variance problem. If you do LOOCV, you will end up with a high variance, but a low biais, given you go through every single point one by one. Each score will be highly different increase the variance but the bais will be almost non existant because you train with almost everything. In a k-fold you will reduce the variance because you will average the performance over a larger sample but the biais will increase because of the sub selection of the k folds. I guess that in this book "accurate" has to be understood as low variance, meaning closer to the real, underlying, value. Something is accurate if it is well determined and close its true value, meaning it has a low variance around its true value.
