Do you have a customer? You might want to ask them. The time spent on page is the most valuable. You can see what pages result in reading and which pages are ignored. The referrers and keywords is the next most valuable, because that tells you if your promotions are working or not, if you are getting the right audience. Google analytics has some integration with adwords' analytics and that is on my periodid checklist as well. Everything else depends on if you have a specific question in mind, like is it safe to start ignoring MSIE6 users, are there enough users of Opera visiting to care how things render for Opera, do I need to pay attention to international readers and add internationalization features to my website, etc.
