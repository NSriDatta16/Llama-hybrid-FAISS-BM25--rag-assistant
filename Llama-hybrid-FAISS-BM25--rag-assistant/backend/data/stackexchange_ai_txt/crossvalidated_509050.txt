Correlation between daily average and individual observations

I just want to calculate the correlation between two variables. One of them ( $Y$ ) is measured daily while the other ( $X$ ) is measured multiple times per day. The two obvious options are: Calculate the correlation between $Y$ and the daily average of $X$ Broadcast the value of $Y$ for each value of $X$ on a given day and calculate the correlation. Obviously this question applies to regression more broadly, but all I really want is to calculate the correlation. It doesn't seem like multi-level models are exactly what I want, because I think they assume the effect of $X$ on $Y$ differs by group. In my case, the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ should be fixed.
