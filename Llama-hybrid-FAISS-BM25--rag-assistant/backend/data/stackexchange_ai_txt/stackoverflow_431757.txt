It sounds like you are highlighting the valid squares by drawing directly, but this will get erased on any repaint. You will probably lose the highlights if your window is repainted for other reasons also, such as minimizing and restoring it, or dragging another window on top of it. If this is the case, you probably need to override the OnPaint method and do your highlighting there. When you want to change what is highlighted, set some state in your class to control what is drawn as highlighted in the OnPaint method, and then Invalidate your window.
