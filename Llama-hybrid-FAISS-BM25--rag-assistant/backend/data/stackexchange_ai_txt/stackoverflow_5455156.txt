The App Engine data store is not a relational database. The fundamental unit of data storage are called an entity. You always fetch the whole entity, and not a subset of the entity. For more information look at the App Engine Datastore API documentation as well as the Low Level API documentation. http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-summary.html
