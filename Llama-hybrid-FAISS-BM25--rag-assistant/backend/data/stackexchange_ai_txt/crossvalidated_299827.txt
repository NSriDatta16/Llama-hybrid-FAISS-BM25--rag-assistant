The machine learning textbook explanation would be that your're mapping the inputs to a discrete set of letters, that's why it's classification. The outcome variable is not only discrete, but also nominal or categorical. In that 'a' is not more or less than 'b' or 'c', it's simply distinct, different from other values. If you were to map the writing into continuous variable, then they'd say it's regression. For instance, if you were trying to assess the stress level by hand writing, where stress level is a continuous score from 0 to 1. Here, not only the outcome is continuous, it's also cardinal, in that 0 is actually less than 1, not just different. Moreover, 0 is at the same distance from 0.5, as 0.5 from 1. In classification problems this is not the case, you simply deal with distinct outcomes, they often not even ordered
