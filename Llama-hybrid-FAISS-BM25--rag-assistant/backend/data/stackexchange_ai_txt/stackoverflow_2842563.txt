Actually, quite a lot of Java applications do use native launchers instead of batch scripts: Eclipse , NetBeans , IntelliJ IDEA , JRuby and Vuze are only few of the examples. The main reason why people don't do this more often, is that embedding a JVM in C is actually somewhat tricky and if you can get away with launching it from a batch script, then why bother?
