Assuming the quotes are always paired on a given line, you could create matches before and after for an even number of quotes, and make sure the whole line is matched: ^([^"]*("[^"]*")*[^"]*)*\b(? this works because the fragment ([^"]*("[^"]*")*[^"]*)* will only match paired quotes. By adding the begin and end line anchors, it forces the quotes on the left and right side of your regex to be an even count. This won't handle embedded escaped quotes properly, and multiline quoted strings will be trouble.
