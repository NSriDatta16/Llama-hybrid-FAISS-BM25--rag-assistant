front-end configurable products from simple products in magento?

a client has imported 1000 items to magento as simple products. many of these SHOULD be configurable products (ie, 4 yellow dresses of different sizes). the psuedo-configurable products all have the same "Style" number, so our 4 yellow dresses would have different SKU values but all 4 would share the Style. is there a way to program magento on the front end to display these 4 simple products as one configurable products? we need to keep them as simple because of the inventory system the store is using. thanks very much,
