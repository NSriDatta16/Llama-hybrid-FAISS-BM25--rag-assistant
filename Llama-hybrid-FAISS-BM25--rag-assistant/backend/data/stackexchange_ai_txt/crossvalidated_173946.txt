I am not sure what you precisely mean by "change", but there is indeed a pitfall. When you do fixed effects, you can do what you call the "whole regression problem", i.e., regress $y_{it}$ on $X_{itk}$, $k=1,\ldots,K$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, $t=1,\ldots,T$ and $n$ individual-specific intercepts, for a total of $n+K$ coefficient estimates. Alternatively, you can do FWL, which amounts to first subtracting the individual-specific averages from all the $y_i$ and $X_{it}$ tp get $y_i-\bar{y}_i$ and $X_{itk}-\bar{X}_{ik}$ and then regress $y_i-\bar{y}_i$ on $X_{itk}-\bar{X}_{ik}$. This second regession only has $K$ regressors. If you now (under homoskedasticity) estimate the error variance $\sigma^2$, a component of the variance-covariance matrix, by the usual formula $SSR/(n\cdot T-K)$ you make a mistake, because the formula neglects the fact that you have already fitted $n$ coefficients in the first step. That mistake moreover does not vanish even asymptotically, as $n$ of course keeps growing if you add more individuals to the panel. Instead, $SSR/(n\cdot T-n-K)$ can be shown to converge to $\sigma^2$.
