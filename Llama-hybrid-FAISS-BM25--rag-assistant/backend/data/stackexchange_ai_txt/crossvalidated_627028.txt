Robustness - Independent samples t-test vs. One-Way ANOVA

I am trying to compare the means of two groups (male/female) for different attitudes. Since my data sometimes violate the assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity, I was planning to do a Mann-Whitney U Test. However, my professor insisted that I still use a parametric test and told me that a One-way ANOVA is more robust to such violations that a regular t-test. Now, my questions are: Is a One-way ANOVA more robust than an independent samples t-test? Can I report differences in means for just two groups, using ANOVA? I have a copy of the SPSS guide by A. Field and would like to make such a statement: "On average, participants experienced greater anxiety to real spiders (M = 47.00, SE = 3.18) than to pictures of spiders (M = 40.00, SE = 2.68). This difference was not significant t(22) = âˆ’1.68, p > .05." It is from the chapter on t-tests (which makes sense!), but now I am confused whether or not I can make a similar statement based on an ANOVA (for two groups only). Thanks!
