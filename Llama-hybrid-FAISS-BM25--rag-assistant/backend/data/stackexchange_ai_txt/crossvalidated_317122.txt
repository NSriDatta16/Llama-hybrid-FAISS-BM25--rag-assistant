According to Wikipedia: "The Hopfield network is an RNN in which all connections are symmetric." Other types of RNN that are not Hopfield networks are: Fully reconnect, recursive, Elman, Jordan and more. Further: RNN is a network were output can also be an input to the network. See this image to illustrate (taken from the video referenced below): Hopfield network is just a recurrent network like this one, where the weight from node to another and from the later to the former are the same (symmetric).The Hopfield network is fully connected, so every neuronâ€™s output is an input to all the other neurons. Another feature of the network is that updating of nodes happens in a binary way. These features allow for a particular feature of Hopfield's nets - they are guaranteed to converge to an attractor(stable state). See: A friendly intro to RNN .
