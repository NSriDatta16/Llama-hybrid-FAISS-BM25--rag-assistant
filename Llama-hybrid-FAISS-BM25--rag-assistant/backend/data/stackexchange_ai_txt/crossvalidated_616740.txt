Comparing binary and continuous predictors for diagnostic test

There is a "traditional" biomarker (binary predictor) used in the diagnosis of a disease (binary outcome) that has a high cost to perform for the clinical labs. I'm studying alternatives, which are all analyte measurements (continuous predictors). How can I compare the two? (as in, can we replace the binary predictor with one, multiple or a combination of the continuous predictors) I know I can evaluate the binary's performance by directly comparing to outcome (precision, recall, etc.) and the continuous by AUC but I can't think of any common measures between them. Do I fit them both in logistic regression and compare coefs/odds ratios? Do I need to find a cutoff (youden?) for the continuous variable and treat it as a binary? I'm probably overthinking this, but I appreciate the help.
