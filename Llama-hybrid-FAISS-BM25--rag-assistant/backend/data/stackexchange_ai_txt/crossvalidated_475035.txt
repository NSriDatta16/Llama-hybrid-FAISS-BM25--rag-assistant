Your justification for beta-naught, B0 , is that 150 is the "Average GRE Quant. score of test takers", but that's not what an intercept is. The intercept is the log of the odds of passing the math course when their quantitative GRE score is 0 (note that it isn't possible to actually score 0 , so this is a score 130 points worse than missing everything). In other words, your posited data generating process isn't remotely sensible. One thing that can be done with regression models to make the intercept more relevant is to center your X data. That is, subtract off the mean from every data point. This won't really have any effect on the model or the information it provides, but does change the meaning of the estimated intercept. Namely, the intercept will become the log of the odds of passing the math course for those whose quantitative GRE score is typical. That will probably benefit you here. From that point, I would think about the probability of passing that you believe (or want to simulate) for average test takers. Then convert that probability to a log odds and use that value for your simulation. Here are some further readings that may help you: Interpretation of simple predictions to odds ratios in logistic regression Intercept term in logistic regression Is it possible to get fitted values 0 or 1 in logistic regression when the fitting algorithm converges?
