Before asking 'how can autoencoder be used to cluster data?' we must first ask 'Can autoencoders cluster data?' Since an autoencoder learns to recreate the data points from the latent space. If we assume that the autoencoder maps the latent space in a “continuous manner”, the data points that are from the same cluster must be mapped together. Hence in a way, the encoder will group similar points “together”, cluster them “together”. We've seen in literature that autoencoders fail to hold this assumption of continuity in the latent space. But to our benefit, variational autoencoders work exactly in this manner. Variational encoders learn the latent space mappings with the two main properties: continuity, completeness1. The continuity property ensures that two points close to each other in the latent space do not give two completely different outputs when decoded. The completeness property ensures that on sampling a point from the latent space will give a meaningful output when decoded. Therefore using an autoencoders encoding can itself, might sometimes be enough. However, work has been done to improvise/learn the clustering explicitly. The algorithm proposed by Xie et al. (2016) 2 is an example, which "iteratively refines clusters with an auxiliary target distribution derived from a current soft cluster assignment."
