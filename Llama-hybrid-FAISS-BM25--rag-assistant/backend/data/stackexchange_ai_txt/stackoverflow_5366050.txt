Unless the $name is always nested only once, the only semi-elegant solution would be to split the $name and make a loop extracting each array one after another... I see that inti has already posted such solution. But if you like doing things ineffective and brittle way, you can always take the raw query string and process it with some Skinner's Constants: $query = $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] . '&'; $name = 'a[b][c][d]'; $from = strpos($query . '=', $name) + strlen($name) + 1; $to = strpos($query, '&', $from); $result = urldecode( substr($query, $from, $to - $from) );
