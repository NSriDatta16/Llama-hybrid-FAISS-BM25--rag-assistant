Entity Framework is a great product - but it's clearly designed for more advanced, more complex cases, where you need to be able to have a domain object model that is or can be different from your underlying storage model. If you need that - great - but for most smaller apps, this is total overkill and only adds additional layers of performance killers. For a small app, go with Linq-to-SQL - or have a look at Subsonic . Those both offer quite thin and very simple layers on top of your tables, and they work great for smaller apps. DataTables are so 1990's .... stay away, they're messy, they're hard to use, they're not pleasant and not efficient to work with.
