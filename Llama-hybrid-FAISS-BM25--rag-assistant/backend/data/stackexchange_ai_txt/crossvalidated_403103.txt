Bayesian spatial autoregressive (SAR) model with heteroskedasticity in R

In socio-economic data, I always found heteroskedasticity that can't be solved using transformation.I had read a paper "Spatial autoregressive models with unknown heteroskedasticity:A comparison of Bayesian and robust GMM approach". In this paper, I know solution the problem of heteroskedasticity in SAR, but I have difficulty to apply Bayesian method for SAR model with heteroscedasticity in R. I have tried using R-Inla, but it turns out that it is for homoscedastic models. My question is how to implement SAR model with heteroskedasticity using the bayesian approach in R?
