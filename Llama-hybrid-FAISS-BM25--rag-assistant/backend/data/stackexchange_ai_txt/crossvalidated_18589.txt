Probably the most used CI-based technique for forecasting are the Neural Networks (NNs), you can find several reviews about NN application on forecasting. A good but not recent one is this one and this one is instead on short-term load forecasting. Other CI-based methods are not very common, maybe there are few fuzzy logic-based approaches (also neuro-fuzzy). However, a little bit of Google Scholar can help you to find all the references you need.
