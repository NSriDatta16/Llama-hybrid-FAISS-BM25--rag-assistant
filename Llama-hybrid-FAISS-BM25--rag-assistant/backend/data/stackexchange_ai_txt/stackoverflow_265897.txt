If you want simple, consider the Manchester Mark I. See page 15 of this PDF . The machine has 7 instructions. It takes about an hour to write an interpreter for it. Unfortunately, the instructions are pretty dang limited (which is why pretty much a full spec of the machine can fit on one page). Javier's approach of rolling your own is very pragmatic. Designing and creating a tiny machine is a two day task, if that. I built a tiny VM for a project a few years ago and it took me two days to write the VM with a simple visual debugger. Also - does it have to be RISC? You could choose, say, 68K for which there are open source emulators , and 68K was a well-understood target for gcc.
