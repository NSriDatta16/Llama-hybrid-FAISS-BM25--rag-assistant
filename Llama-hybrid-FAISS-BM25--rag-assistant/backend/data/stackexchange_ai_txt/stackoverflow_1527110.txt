Are you sure the controls have been added at the time you're inspecting the property? The GroupBox stores child controls in the Controls property, just as any other container control would. Edit I can't really begin to speculate about the custom control. Obviously it would be possible to create a control with the behavior that you describe, but I can't fathom a reason for it. Just creating a sample Windows Forms project and dragging two buttons into it and calling MessageBox.Show(groupBox1.Controls.Count.ToString()) from another button presents a 2 , as expected. Given the code that you've posted for the GroupBox , I can't see any reason for this to happen aside from the controls genuinely not being in the GroupBox . If you inspect the Parent property of one of the controls, what is the value? Edit 2 If you're saying that you have a UserControl that contains your custom GroupBox and you're trying to place the UserControl on a Form and put controls insde the GroupBox from there, then that won't work. The designer on the form only "knows" about the UserControl ; it doesn't know (or care) that it contains a GroupBox (for one thing, the designer doesn't have access to that variable by default, and neither do you, since it's private unless you explicitly change the modifier). In order to do this exactly as you want to, you're going to have to do the necessary lifting to make your UserControl a container, but that is a non-trivial amount of work. I would suggest just placing the GroupBox on the form directly.
