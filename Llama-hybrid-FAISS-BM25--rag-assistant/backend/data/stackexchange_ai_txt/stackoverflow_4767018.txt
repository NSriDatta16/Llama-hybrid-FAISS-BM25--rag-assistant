asp.net keystore for password storage?

I know that encrypted passwords can be stored in the web.config or hashed and salted passwords can be stored in a database, but is it possible to store passwords in something like a keystore? Would a keystore even be a good idea to store 'service account' passwords that are needed by an application?
