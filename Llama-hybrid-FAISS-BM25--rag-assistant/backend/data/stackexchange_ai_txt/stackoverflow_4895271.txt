You can scale up the threads in nutch-site.xml. Increasing fetcher.threads.per.host and fetcher.threads.fetch will both increase the speed at which you crawl. I have noticed drastic improvements. Use caution when increasing these though. If you do not have the hardware or connection to support this increased traffic, the amount of errors in crawling can signifigantly increase.
