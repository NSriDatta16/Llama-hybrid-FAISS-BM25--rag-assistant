I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do since your example URL doesn't match that required for the signature of your method. Typically if you use a method that requires a complex object, you pass the values to construct that object in the query string or as form parameters and the ModelBinder constructs the object from the data supplied in the parameters. If you want to pass just the id, then the method typically doesn't take any parameters, you extract the id from the RouteData, and look the object up in persistent storage (or in a cache). If you want to do the latter, your method should look like: public ActionResult SomeMethod() { int messageObjectID; if (RouteData.Values.TryGetValue("id",out messageObjectID)) { ... get the object with the correct id and process it... } else { ... error processing because the id was not available... } return View(); }
