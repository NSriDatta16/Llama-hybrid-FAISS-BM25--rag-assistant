Using ServiceAgents wrappers for your web services would be one possible way of doing it. This is a pattern i have followed in previous projects of mine. Since they are interface based, you can easily mock out the services. There are other advantages to this pattern (besides unit testing) including being able to abstract your application from external dependencies to a certain extent. However it does add the overhead of creating another class layer on top of the services.
