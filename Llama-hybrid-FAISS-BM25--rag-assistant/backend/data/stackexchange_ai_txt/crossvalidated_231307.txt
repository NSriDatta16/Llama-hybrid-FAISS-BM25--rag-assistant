Assuming a GARCH model is sensible for your data (daily log-returns on currency exchange rates), here are some possible solutions: Try different starting values. Most of the times this should do the job. Add a negligible amount of noise to the original data (enough to get the solver unstuck but still not affecting the parameter estimates noticeably). Either do this once or perhaps multiple times and average over the outcomes. Try a different model: GARCH(1,1) with variance targetting, GARCH(1,1) with a different conditional distribution (e.g. Student-$t$ in place of Normal) -- if this is still a satisfactory benchmark for you.
