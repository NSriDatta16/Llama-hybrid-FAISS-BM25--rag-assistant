A possible answer to your research question can be obtained by a mixed binary logistic regression. The model can be explained as follows. Let $Y_{is}$ be your answer variable such that $Y_{is}=0$ if the answer is A and $Y_{is}=1$ if the answer is B for every individual $i=1,\ldots,n$ at any setting $s=1,2,3$ . Assuming $Y_{is}$ is independent from $Y_{js}$ for all $i\neq j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ , then we assume \begin{align*} Y_{is} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{is})\\ p_{is} &= \frac{\exp(\alpha_{i}+\beta_0)}{1+\exp(\alpha_{i}+\beta_0)}\\ \alpha_i&\sim N(0,\sigma_{\alpha}^2), \end{align*} where $\alpha_i$ are unknown random intercepts assumed to be independent. The parameters, to be estimated from data, are $\beta_0,\sigma^2_\alpha$ . In particular, $\beta_0$ is your parameter of interest: if $\beta_0\neq0$ means that the proportion of the zeros and ones (e.g. A's and B's) in your response are different. The random effects $\alpha_i$ are useful for handling the dependence in the response due to repeated sampling. You can fit this model in R using the glmer function from the lme4 package, e.g. something like mm In the summary, look for the estimate of the intercept and the associate p-value or build a confidence interval. The summary will also provide an estimate for $\sigma_\alpha^2$ .
