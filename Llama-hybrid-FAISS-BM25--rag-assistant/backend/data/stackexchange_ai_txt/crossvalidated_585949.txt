In addition to Stephan's answer, here are some potentially useful resources for time series forecasting: Hyndman & Athanasopoulos - Forecasting: Principles and Practice - A great resource for learning forecasting, all code examples in R {fable} - An R package developed by Mitchell O'Hara-Wild, Hyndman, and others, for time series forecasting (used in the above book) {modeltime} - An R package for time series forecasting using the tidy principles and the tidymodels framework/workflow The first resource will help you understand how to think about time series forecasting, how to build good models, and what approaches are appropriate for different issues. The second and third will help you build on that understanding and start building your own models in R, once you're ready.
