jQuery UI regenerate (zombie) draggable elements

I'd like to know how to create draggable elements using jQuery UI that once they are dragged and dropped into another container, regenerate the same item. For example, I can drop a button from container A to container B, and once I do that, the same button (a clone) re-emerges in container A. Thanks in advance.
