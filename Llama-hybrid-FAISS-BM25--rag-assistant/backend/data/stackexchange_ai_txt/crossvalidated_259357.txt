What is implied by i.i.d.?

It's common to see statements that data must be i.i.d. But if data in a time series are independent, aren't they just noise? At one point I thought, they're only referring to the errors, i.e. the errors must be independent. Why should the deterministic part be serially independent? I can see the necessity for information calculations. But, all in all it's confusing. Can anyone tell me exactly what i.i.d. means? Writers don't kill themselves making it clear. Thank you.
