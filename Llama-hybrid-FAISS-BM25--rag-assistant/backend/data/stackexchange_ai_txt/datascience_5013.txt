Machine learning for Point Clouds Lidar data

Our main use case is object detection in 3d lidar point clouds i.e. data is not in RGB-D format. We are planning to use CNN for this purpose using theano. Hardware limitations are CPU: 32 GB RAM Intel 47XX 4th Gen core i7 and GPU: Nvidia quadro k1100M 2GB. Kindly help me with recommendation for architecture. I am thinking in the lines of 27000 input neurons on basis of 30x30x30 voxel grid but can't tell in advance if this is a good option. Additional Note: Dataset has 4500 points on average per view per point cloud
