You could use the Microsoft.VisualBasic library, but this doesn't seem like a very elegant solution to me. I wouldn't be surprised if it were deprecated in the future anyway. A simple extension would be a nice solution: public decimal PresentValue(this decimal value, decimal interestRate, decimal years) { return value / Math.Pow(1 + interestRate, years); } This is of course based off the simple definition of compound interest. There are variations on the present value which you could calculate similarly. Note the use of the decimal type to preserve base 10 accuracy. It also allows a fractional time length by using Math.Pow .
