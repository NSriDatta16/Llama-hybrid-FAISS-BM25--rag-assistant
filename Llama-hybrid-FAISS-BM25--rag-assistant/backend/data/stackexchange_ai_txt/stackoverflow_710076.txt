How do I share user controls between web applications in ASP.NET?

This question is a follow up to my question about sharing resources between web applications , because I have not yet found a good solution. I have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web applications. Solution | +-CommonControlsWebApp | +- resources | | +- images | | +- scripts | | +- stylesheets | +- UserControls | +-WebApp1 | +-WebApp2 | +-WebApp3 This is what I know this far: I can not compile CommonControlsWebApp into a single dll since I am creating user controls. This is only possible with custom server controls, where everything is in the code-behind file. So I need a way to share the ascx files between the four projects. Copying the files from CommonControlsWebApp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution explorer. I would have to 'add exting items' all in all three WebApps when a file is added or renamed in CommonControls. Changing to the Web Site model would remedy this, but I am worried about the compile time for WebApp1-3 if I do this. 'Add as link' does not work for directories. I could use Subversion to share the files between the projects, but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if I am developing a user control that I have to test through one of the WebApps. Can it really be true that ASP.NET does not have a good solution for this? How are you guys organizing large web applications? Edit: Thanks a lot for all the answers. I am going to copy my user controls with a build event for now, and then see if we have time to refactor them into server controls.
