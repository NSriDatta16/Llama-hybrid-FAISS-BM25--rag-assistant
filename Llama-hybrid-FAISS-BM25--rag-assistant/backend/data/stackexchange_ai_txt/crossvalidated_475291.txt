Is my Moving Average model correctly implemented

I am new to time series modelling and I was trying my hands on a dataset which records number of customers per day from 1 jan 2018 to 31 dec 2019. So far, I have tried implementing a naive moving average and got the following results. Is this a legitimate fit? If this is not a right model, what approach should I use? Thanks Things I have done: Checked data for stationarity: Data is stationary Implemented a moving average by calculating the average of previous 'window' number of observations as in the plot above.
