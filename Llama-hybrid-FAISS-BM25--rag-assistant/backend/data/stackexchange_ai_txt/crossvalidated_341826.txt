Why the name "kernel" in stats and ML?

This has been asked on other SE sites in the context of operating systems and linear algebra, but the same question bugs me regarding kernel methods used in statistics and machine learning. Often it is said that kernels, e.g. in kernel density estimation or SVMs, represent some kind of similarity, but I don't get where the name 'kernel' comes from and what is the symbolism of it. So, what's the etymology of kernels, in the context of statistics and machine learning? To be clear, I'm well aware what a kernel is and the main properties of it, I'm just curious about the name, as I don't see what it has to do with the seed or core as it's mostly defined in dictionaries. Or at least I can't see a deeper meaning than 'the essential part of the method'.
