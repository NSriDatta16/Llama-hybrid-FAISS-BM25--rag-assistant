iPhoneOS4.0 Wifi Scanning problem

I have just started to make a iPhone Wifi scanning app. I have searched a lot websites, finally I have the recent code the below. Someone told this is working for iPhoneOS4.0 well. libHandle = dlopen("/System/Library/SystemConfiguration/WiFiManager.bundle/WiFiManager", RTLD_LAZY); open = dlsym(libHandle, "Apple80211Open"); bind = dlsym(libHandle, "Apple80211BindToInterface"); close = dlsym(libHandle, "Apple80211Close"); scan = dlsym(libHandle, "Apple80211Scan"); But, I have the below warnings. warning: Unable to read symbols for "/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.0.1/Symbols/usr/lib/libpcap.A.dylib" (file not found). warning: Unable to read symbols for "/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.0.1/Symbols/System/Library/SystemConfiguration/WiFiManager.bundle/WiFiManager" (file not found). I am using xcode_3.2.3_and_ios_sdk_4.0.1 and iPhone 3G device that jailbroken, unlocked and updated to 4.0.1. I know, if I use a private API, can not service and get a risks, but I should do that. If you any clue about this, please let me know.
