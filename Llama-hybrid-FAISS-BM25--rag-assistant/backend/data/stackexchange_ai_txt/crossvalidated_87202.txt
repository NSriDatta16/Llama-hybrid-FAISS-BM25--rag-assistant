In univariate logistic regression, does the scale of values affect the predicted "risk" at a particular value of the independent variable?

I have many datasets representing different populations. Each dataset contains values of an independent variable along with (0/1) representing the occurrence of an undesirable event. I analysed each of the datasets separately by using univariate logistic regression. The goal was to calculate and compare the risk at a particular value in all the datasets. I was then able to put the different populations in order based the risk predicted at the same value V. The problem is that I found that the risk calculated has quite a strong negative correlation with the maximum values in the datasets. In other words, the population X with the lowest risk happens to have the largest maximum in its dataset compared with the other populations. I am now concerned that my conclusion (i.e. the population X has the lowest risk at value V) may only be a result of having the largest independent value in its dataset, and not because of any other factor. Is my concern correct?
