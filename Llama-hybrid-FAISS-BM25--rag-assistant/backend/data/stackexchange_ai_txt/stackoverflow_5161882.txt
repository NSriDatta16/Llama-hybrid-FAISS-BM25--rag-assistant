Q: Is it possible to have a JSP be an error page, or should it be static HTML? It's perfectly fine. It can even be a servlet or something. As long as it doesn't have bugs of course. Q: What am I doing wrong? Your error page has a bug. You're apparently using inside the error page to include a fragment from /WEB-INF . This is disallowed because it's not a public resource (honestly I don't recall that it would ever have worked in ancient JSTL versions). Rather use .
