@GregS has an approach that will probably work for you. Based on what you have told me, I would just create a C binary and leverage the BN_generate_prime(...) function in OpenSSL. That cuts out all of the intermediate parsing and despite adding a separate binary into the mix, it's probably easier than the road you are headed down.
