As COOLSerdash says , what you are doing is method of moments estimation : you estimate parameters of a distribution so the estimated distribution's moments match the ones you observe (here, the first two moments, the mean and the variance). This is a completely valid estimation method. Alternatively, you could estimate the parameters through maximum likelihood. Wikipedia has the details for the gamma distribution. However, the differences between the two estimation methods are typically not very large, unless you have very degenerate distributions. If your model gives you unsatisfactory results, this does not seem to be due to problems with your estimation. It may simply be that fitting gammas to your word frequencies does not separate different words cleanly enough. You may want to think about different methods. For instance, fitting gammas separately to each word's incidence loses all the context. You may want to try methods that model context, such as Markov chains or LSTM/RNNs .
