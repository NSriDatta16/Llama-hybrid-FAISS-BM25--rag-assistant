You could train a standard auto-encoder. An auto-encoder is a neural network that tries to learn a reduced dimensional representation of some data set. Once you have trained the network, and you want to know which features the ith feature is related to, you can examine the partial derivative of the ith output activation with respect to all the inputs. This should give you a sense for where the relationships are likely to be, but might be challenging to decipher the exact nature of the relationship.
