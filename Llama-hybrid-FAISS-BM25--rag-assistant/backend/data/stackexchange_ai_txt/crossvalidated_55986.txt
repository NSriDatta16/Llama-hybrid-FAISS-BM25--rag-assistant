kernel density estimation for each time series The term you're looking for is probably kernel smoothing; and perhaps kernel regression/local (polynomial) regression. There are other forms of smoothing; you might have spline smoothing for example, and (relatedly), smoothing filters (e.g. Whittaker-Henderson / Hodrick-Prescott type smoothing). The bandwidth of kernel smoothing will need to partly relate to the smallest features you want to pick up. Note that identification of peaks in smooth curves relates to derivates and optimal bandwidths for the derivative are different from the optimal bandwidth for the original function. However, because these are time series, the usual assumption of independence will be suspect; take care with that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodrick%E2%80%93Prescott_filter Also somewhat related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series -- Edit: I meant to mention when I posted before that there are also "peak finding" methods based on fitting what are essentially mixtures of scaled gaussians (or other scaled peaked distributions like say the Cauchy). If you're contemplating a maximum of two peaks (unimodal vs bimodal), the elimination of the possibility of many peaks makes this a fairly easy one to consider implementing, and it should work fairly well. -- Do you have the numbers that generated those plots? I may be able to illustrate a couple of these.
