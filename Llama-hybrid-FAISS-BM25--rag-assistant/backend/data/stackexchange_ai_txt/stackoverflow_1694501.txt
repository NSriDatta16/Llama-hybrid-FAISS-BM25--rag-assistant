Ajax reorder list not draggable

I have been trying to get a basic reorderlist working following this guide -> http://www.asp.net/LEARN/Ajax-Control-Toolkit/tutorial-40-vb.aspx . I have tried a demo version and in my browser so it's not a browser problem. I am on asp.net 2.0 and have installed the AjaxControlToolkit and the DLL file is in the Bin folder. However when I run the page - I get the list I expect but nothing is draggable, I cannot see what I am getting wrong. It will be part of a more complex page but I have taken it out into a simple page to firgure out what is wrong. Anyone have any ideas what I may have wrong here? " OldValuesParameterFormatString="original_{0}" ProviderName=" " DeleteCommand="DELETE FROM [Specs_LensDetailsTbl] WHERE [DBID] = ?" SelectCommand="SELECT Specs_LensDetailsTbl.DBID, Specs_LensDetailsTbl.LensName, Specs_LensCatLookupTbl.OrderNum, Specs_LensCatLookupTbl.Active FROM Specs_LensDetailsTbl LEFT OUTER JOIN Specs_LensCatLookupTbl ON Specs_LensDetailsTbl.DBID = Specs_LensCatLookupTbl.LensDBID WHERE (Specs_LensCatLookupTbl.CatDBID = 1) ORDER BY Specs_LensCatLookupTbl.OrderNum" UpdateCommand="UPDATE Specs_LensDetailsTbl SET OrderNum=@OrderNum WHERE [DBID]=@original_id"> ' />
