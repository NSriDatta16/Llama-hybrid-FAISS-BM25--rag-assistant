I agree with you that binning doesn't make much sense in the general case. The random forest itself already performs binning of the input space (as you mentioned), and it does so adaptively (i.e. in a way that allows good predictions). Manual binning destroys information, and forces trees to split at pre-defined bin edges, which might be suboptimal. I could see a use for it if there were a priori knowledge that a particular binning was meaningful/good. Or, perhaps as an approximation strategy to save time/space in the case of very large datasets (quantized values require fewer bits to store, and there are fewer possibilities to search through when seeking a threshold for splitting a node).
