Average correlation

In this blog post Extraction of features from a given correlation matrix the author claims: the percentage of variance explained by the first PCA component and the average (absolute) correlation is the same thing I think I understand what it means "variance explained", i.e. PCA and proportion of variance explained . I can not understand how the proportion of highest eigenvalue and the average correlation provide the same information.
