The broadcast receivers themselves will not directly consume much battery life. BOOT_COMPLETED happens once; PACKAGE_REPLACED happens only on an application upgrade. Those probably average one event per day. Now, if those broadcast receivers do other stuff, such as starting services, that may have significant battery implications...but that is a problem with your services, not with the receivers themselves.
