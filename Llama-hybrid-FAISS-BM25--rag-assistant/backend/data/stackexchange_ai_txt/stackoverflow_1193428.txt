A different captcha approach

Reformatted into a question.... Is drag and drop a good catcha method? I.e. would it be a good way of allowing only humans to submit a form? Original text: You can start voting down but i am a newbie and here is my captcha version! The captcha will be based on drag and drop... a human being could implement drag and drop. A bot? Just a thought!
