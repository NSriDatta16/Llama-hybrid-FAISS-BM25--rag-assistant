Logistic regression is for a binary response variable. It should be distributed as a Bernoulli or, more generally, a binomial . For either of those, the variance is a function of the mean: \begin{align} \newcommand{\Var}{{\rm Var}} \text{Bernoulli: }\quad \Var(Y) &= \quad\!\pi(1-\pi) \\ \text{Binomial: }\quad \Var(Y) &= N\pi(1-\pi) \end{align} where $\pi$ is the parameter that controls the behavior of the distribution, namely the probability of 'success' (or the mean of a vector of $0$s and $1$s). Thus, if the variables have any association with the response at all, even if not significant, then the variance also has to change as a function of the variables. That is, you expect to have heteroscedasticity. Homoscedasticity is not an assumption of logistic regression the way it is with linear regression (OLS).
