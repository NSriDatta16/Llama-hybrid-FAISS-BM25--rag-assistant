Your database organization is a problem; you need to normalize it. Rather than having one row with a comma-separated list of values, you should do one value per row: uid artist 1 401 1 11 1 5 2 5 2 4 2 2 Then you can query: SELECT uid FROM table WHERE artist = 401 You should also look into database normalization because what you have is just going to cause more and more problems in the future.
