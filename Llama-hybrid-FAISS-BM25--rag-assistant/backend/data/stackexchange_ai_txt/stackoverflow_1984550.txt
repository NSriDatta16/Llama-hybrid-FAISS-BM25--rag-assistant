Using a named query in a hbm with import class

In my MSSQL server I have a SQL view called AllFavourite. In order to load the data into my DTO class I have the following in my hbm.xml file... In my code I have the following. public IList GetFavourites(int userId) { var query = Session .CreateSQLQuery("SELECT * FROM AllFavourite where UserId=:UserId") .SetInt32("UserId", userId) .SetResultTransformer(new AliasToBeanResultTransformer(typeof(AllFavourite))); return query.List (); } This works great and produces the results that I am after, however I would like to move the SQL from code into a named query into the hbm.xml file. So my hbm.xml file now looks like this and my code now looks like this public IList GetFavourites(int userId) { var query = Session .GetNamedQuery("GetAllFavouriteByUserId") .SetInt32("UserId", userId) .SetResultTransformer(new AliasToBeanResultTransformer(typeof(AllFavourite))); return query.List (); } However when I run this I get an error:- Parameter UserId does not exist as a named parameter in [SELECT * FROM AllFavourite WHERE UserId=:UserId] So my question is it possible to use a named query in this manner?
