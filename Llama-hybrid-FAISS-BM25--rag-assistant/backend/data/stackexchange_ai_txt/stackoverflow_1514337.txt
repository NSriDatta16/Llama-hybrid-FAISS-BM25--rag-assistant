I know you say "apart from creating a new ImageField type", but I'd imagine that the best way to do this would be to do just that, and override the get_filename method of FileField (which ImageField obviously subclasses). Apart from that, it is possible to create your own Storage ( django.core.files.storage ) subclass, which you would pass as the storage argument to the ImageField in your mode. You would need to override the get_valid_name method there. To note is that the actual underscores come from the get_valid_filename method in django.utils.text . I really don't what's wrong with subclassing ImageField to provide the necessary functionality, though.
