analysis of different time series

i have 26000 items of a shop (rows) and the sell quantity in every week of 2017( 52 columns). i'm doing forecasting: this is the goal. Now, however i'm in the data preprocessing step and i want understand the noise and calculate some correlation analysis (analysis of time series). I want do for example a cluster of items that bought in the winter and in the summer and continuo's items and then apply mixture regression or glm . However, now my problem is to do analysis for all the time series of all items. I have no idea of how i can have the correlation analysis of all the items in a easy way. The idea, very hard, that i have is to do a function that do all type of analysis and do a cicle for all items and save the results in different matrix. Have anyone any idea?
