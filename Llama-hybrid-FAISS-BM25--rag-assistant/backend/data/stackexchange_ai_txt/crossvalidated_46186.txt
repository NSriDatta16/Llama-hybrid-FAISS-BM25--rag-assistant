The parameters you're describing are standard kernel parameters in SVM classification. I almost always forget what they mean too, but have found the LibSVM website to be a solid reference for this. From the site, linear is the cost parameter, which is appears in every kernel, and $$\text{Linear: } u'*v$$ $$\text{Polynomial: } (\gamma*u'*v + coef_{0})^{degree}$$ $$\text{RBF: } exp^{(-\gamma*|u-v|^{2})}$$ $$\text{Sigmoid: } tanh(\gamma*u'*v + coef_{0})$$ Does that help?
