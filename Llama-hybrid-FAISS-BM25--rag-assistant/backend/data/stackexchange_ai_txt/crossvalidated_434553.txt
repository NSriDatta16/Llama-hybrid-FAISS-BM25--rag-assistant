Comparing the first principal component with an observed variable (mean)?

I want to see how using the mean of my variables instead of the first principal component helps represent (the first dimension) of my data. The idea is that if those are similar enough, I might as well use the mean, which is much easier to explain. In mathematical term, I want to compare basically $X v$ ( $v$ first eigenvector of $\Sigma$ ) to $X \tilde{1}$ ( $\tilde{1}$ is vector of (1,1, ..., 1)/p, $p$ is number of variables) Is there a literature dealing with similar concerns? Which methods would be suggested? I can think of three metrics: Compute the first PCA, and the mean. Measure their correlation. Compute the variance from first PCA, and variance from mean. See how much is lost by using mean instead of PCA. Compare the first eigenvector, to the mean weight vector (1,1, ..., 1)/p, take some measure of distance between those two. Thanks!
