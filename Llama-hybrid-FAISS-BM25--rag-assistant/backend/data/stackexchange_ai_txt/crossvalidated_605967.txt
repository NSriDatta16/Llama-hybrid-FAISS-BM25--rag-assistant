How can q(z,l,u,c|x) be factorized to q(z|x)q(l|x)q(c|z)q(u|c,z)?

How can q(z,l,u,c|x) be factorized to q(z|x)q(l|x)q(c|z)q(u|c,z)? I don't know what assumptions are behind this equation, which is I want to know. I think normal chain rule of probability is in the process, but only chain rule can't derive the formula. What I know is that z, l, u follows gaussian distribution, and c follows multinomial distribution. It's from the paper Xu C, Lopez R, Mehlman E, Regier J, Jordan MI, Yosef N. Probabilistic harmonization and annotation of single-cell transcriptomics data with deep generative models. Mol Syst Biol. 2021 Jan;17(1):e9620. doi: 10.15252/msb.20209620. PMID: 33491336; PMCID: PMC7829634. That formula is used for derive ELBO, since the model is similar to VAE.
