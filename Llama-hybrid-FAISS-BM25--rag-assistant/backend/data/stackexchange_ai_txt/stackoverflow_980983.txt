How do I assign a unique key to a UITouch throughout it's lifecycle?

I need to associate a unique key to a UITouch instance throughout it's lifecycle -Began, Moved, Ended, Cancelled. I've been printing NSLog on a key for each touch and noticed to my suprise that each touch does not generate a unique key if the key is generated as follows: for (UITouch *touch in touches) { // ... NSValue *key = [NSValue valueWithPointer:touch]; // ... } How can I make each touch generate a unique key? Thanks.
