The Box-Jenkins approach incorporates all well-known forecasting models except multiplicative models like the Holt-Winston Multiplicative Seasonal Model where the expected value is based upon a multiplicand. The multiplicative seasonal model can be used to model time series where one has the following (in my opinion a very unusual) case: If the amplitude of the seasonal component/pattern is proportional to the average level of the series, the series can be referred to as having multiplicative seasonality. Even in the case of multiplicative models, one can often represent these as ARIMA models thus completing the "umbrella." Furthermore since a Transfer Function is a Generalized Least Squares Model it can reduce to a standard regression model by omitting the ARIMA component and assuming a set of weights needed to homogenize the error structure.
