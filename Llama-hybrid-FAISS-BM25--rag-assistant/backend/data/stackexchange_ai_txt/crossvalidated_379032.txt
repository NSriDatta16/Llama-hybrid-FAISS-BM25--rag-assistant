My own view is that we should formulate models which answer the question(s) we are interested in, rather than torture the predictor variables until they confess. When you fit a model like lm(hp ~ disp, data=...), you are essentially assuming that horsepower (hp) tends to either increase or decrease linearly as displacement (disp) increases and you are interested in estimating the rate of increase/decrease from the data. (In this model, you are treating disp as a continuous variable). The model answers questions such as: Does hp tend to increase/decrease with disp and if so, at what rate? Let's say now that instead of working with the continuous version of the predictor displacement, you are going to work with a binary version of this predictor, defined like this: disp.binary = 1 if disp > observed mean value of disp in the data disp.binary = 0 otherwise In other words, disp.binary keeps track of whether or not displacement is bigger than average. We can now fit the model lm(hp ~ disp.binary, data = ...) to the data but this model will answer a different question: Do cars with a displacement which is bigger than average tend to have a larger/smaller horsepower than cars with a displacement which is not bigger than average? Of course, in practice people discretize predictor variables all the time, sometimes not realizing that not only does this lead to a loss of information but also to answering different questions based on their models. If you have to discretize a predictor variable, you should at least do so in a way which ensures that you are still answering relevant questions. Some people discretize variables using cut-offs pulled out from the literature or inspired by other subject-matter considerations. Others use data-driven cut-offs like the observed mean of the variable to be discretized or the observed quantiles. The problem with data-driven cut-offs is that they are not portable across similar studies, since they reflect the idiosyncrasies of the data collected in the study at hand. If you are contemplating discretization of a predictor variable simply because some of the assumptions underlying your current model are violated by the data, there are better options available to you. For example, consider a more flexible model which allows the effect of the predictor to be nonlinear rather than linear or perhaps consider transforming the predictor before including it in your model.
