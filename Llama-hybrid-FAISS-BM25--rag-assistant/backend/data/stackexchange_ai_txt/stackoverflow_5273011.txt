Look at the table view delegate and data source. They have methods with "drag" and "drop" in their names. Implement those and you're golden. There's a lot of documentation on "Drag and Drop" in Apple's developer docs at http://developer.apple.com Don't try to code without the documentation. There be Tygers.
