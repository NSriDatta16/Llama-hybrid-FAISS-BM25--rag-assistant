Both bounded and non-bounded series could be stationary or non-stationary. In simple language, stationarity means "doesn't change over time". Clearly bounded variables could change over time. You can change any continuous time related variable to a bounded one by changing it to % of maximum. So, suppose you regressed "Dow Jones Industrial Average" (as a % of 20,000) to "Population of China" (divided by 8 billion). There would be a strong relationship. One solution is to remove the non-stationarity before doing the regression.
