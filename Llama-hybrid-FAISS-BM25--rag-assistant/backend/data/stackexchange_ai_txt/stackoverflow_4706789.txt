HTML listing of recordset, resulting from a join on two tables that relate one-many

I have two tables, that relate via a one-to-many relationship i.e tableOne (1)----------(*) tableTwo Given the basic schema below tableOne { groupID int PK, groupTitle varchar } and tableTwo { bidID int PK, groupID int FK } Consider the two tables yield the following record-set based on joining the tables on the tableOne.groupID = tableTwo.groupID, tableOne.groupID | tableOne.groupTitle | tableTwo.bidID | tableTwo.groupID ________________________________________________________________________________ 1 | Physics Group | 1 | 1 2 | Chemistry Group | 2 | 2 2 | Chemistry Group | 3 | 2 1 | Physics Group | 4 | 1 I would like to list such a record-set in an HTML table as follows: tableOne.groupID | tableOne.groupTitle | tableTwo.bidID | tableTwo.groupID ________________________________________________________________________________ 1 | Physics Group | 1 | 1 | Physics Group | 4 | 1 2 | Chemistry Group | 2 | 2 | Chemistry Group | 3 | 2 I'm interested in finding out if this can be done in SQL, or alternatively finding out ways of listing such a record-set in HTML using good standards. The solution that comes to mind is simply iterating through the record-set and leveraging a sentinel to list all records with the same tableOne.groupID grouped in a single row - and also listing tableOne.groupID s once as a unique identifier of that record-group. However I don't want to go down that path as I would like to avoid mixing code with HTML if possible.
