I wouldn't refer to this situation as "resampling", a term which has a technical meaning in statistics. If you took a sample, then took a random sample of that, you still have a sample that is as representative of your population as before, just with a smaller $N$. So long as you use the appropriate $N$ (i.e., the smaller one), no problems will arise. On a different note, I don't fully follow your situation, but if your "counts" are just $1$ or $0$ for each case, then you should realize that you are dealing with Bernoulli trials rather than counts. We typically refer to data as counts if it is possible for the values to be any natural number $[0, +\infty)$, whereas is is only possible for the 'counts' from $N$ Bernoulli trials to be $[0, N]$. These facts have some important implications: if you are dealing with true counts, you would analyze your data with some form of Poisson regression , whereas if your data are the outcomes of Bernoulli trials, you would use some form of logistic regression .
