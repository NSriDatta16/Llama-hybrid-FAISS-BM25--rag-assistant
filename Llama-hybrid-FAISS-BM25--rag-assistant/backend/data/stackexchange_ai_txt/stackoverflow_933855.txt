A problem somewhat related to yours is called the " The Britney Spears Problem " which is about the difficulty of determining hot topics algorithmically. In an AI point of view, it is a difficult problem because first of all, there're no fixed number of topics, so classification is out of the question. And since trends changes from time to time, the model need to take time into factor (typical Neural Network doesn't, unless you're talking about Time Delay Neural Network). Finally, what's hot and not is subjective and differs from person to person, which means you may need to take person's past interests into account ( Collaborative Filtering ).
