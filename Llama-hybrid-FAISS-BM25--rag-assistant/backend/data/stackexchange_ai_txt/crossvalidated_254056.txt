How to adjust neural network weights for several inputs?

Currently I'm working on solving the XOR problem with a homemade NN in C++. Several (worthy) people have recommended my weight adjustment formula to be: $$ weight=weight + (error \cdot input) .$$ That's all fine and dandy, but considering there are multiple inputs in XOR how does one decide the current input to be multiplied by the error for the new weight? Also, in the future I may need several outputs. In that case, which error do I use to find the new weight?
