Overview over Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

I'm currently searching for an Overview over Reinforcement Learning Algorithms and maybe a classification of them. But next to Sarsa and Q-Learning + Deep Q-Learning I can't really find any popular algorithms. Wikipedia gives me an overview over different general Reinforcement Learning Methods but there is no reference to different algorithms implementing this methods. But maybe I'm confusing general approaches and algorithms and basically there is no real classification in this field, like in other fields of machine learning. Can somebody maybe give me a short introduction or only a reference where I could start reading into the different approaches, the differences between them and example algorithms that implement this approaches?
