How do I detect if a user is using the Lotus Notes browser?

We provide a web based platform to our clients and some content doesn't work properly when viewed through the Lotus Notes internal browser. Despite various warnings about not opening in Lotus, users are still doing it. Therefore I need a reliable way to detect the Lotus browser and therefore block and display an appropriate message. I can't see from the user agents in use any particular evidence of the agent specified and I have been advised Lotus may even spoof this. Does anyone know how I can detect the Lotus Notes browser?
