A couple of things: BindingList doesn't always work too well with DevExpress, and it's suggested to use XPCollection instead. Do you have any more info about how you setup your columns in the xtragrid? If you use incorrect field names in the column, then they won't show what you're looking for. If the params you're using (1, 2, 3) are ids stored as fkeys to other objects (not sure if you're using xpo or not) then they won't show up correctly either (there'll likely be a '+' in the cell instead of any values). [aside] be sure that blottertrade implements INotifyPropertyChanged for better interaction with the grid.
