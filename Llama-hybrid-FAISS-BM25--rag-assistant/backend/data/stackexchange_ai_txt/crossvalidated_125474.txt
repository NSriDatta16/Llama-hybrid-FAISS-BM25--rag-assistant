I would not use either chi-squared tests or McNemar's tests. The chi-squared does not take the dependency in the data into account, and neither incorporates information about both items into a proper, unified analysis. Instead, I would use a generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM). You will have a logistic regression model with fixed effects for group and item, and a group X item interaction. In addition, you will have random effects for the subjects to take their dependence into account. At a minimum, you should have a random intercept; you may want to have a random slope as well, I'm not sure. (If the model will fit, it probably wouldn't hurt.) The test of the interaction is the critical test of your hypothesis: if it is significant, then the increases in the rates significantly differ. The directionality of that estimate (i.e., a positive vs. negative coefficient) will tell you which is a larger decrement, but it will depend on which levels are taken as the reference levels of your variables. At any rate, which is larger is clear enough from your summary statistics, all you need is a test of its significance. One last thing to bear in mind is that you phrase your question in terms of raw risk differences, whereas the model will test odds ratios, you will need to be clear on that.
