Can Visual Studio 2010 do Code Coverage analysis on F# modules?

Though I ask it to, Visual Studio 2010 does not appear to generate code coverage statistics for my F# modules. The unit tests are Ms Tests written in C#, so are run natively by Visual Studio, and execute cleanly. But there does not appear to be any coverage information created for the F# library being tested. The C# libraries involved are analyzed just fine. Am I missing something?
