There is no such thing as a generic enough dataset . If you are planning for an academic study, I would suggest to use multiple different datasets that cover a huge variety of characteristics. Most good data science studies do so. If you are looking for real world datasets then it would be best to search repositories like kaggle , openML or UCI for datasets that suit your case. Note: Depending on the subject of the study, one should be careful to generalize from low-dimensional datasets to general aspects of neural networks. But without knowing more about the study, I can not say whether this would be a point.
