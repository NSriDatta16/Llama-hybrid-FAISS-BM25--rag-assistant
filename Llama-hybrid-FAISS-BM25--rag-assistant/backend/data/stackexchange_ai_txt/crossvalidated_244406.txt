It seems that you are trying to determine whether the model is significant based on the t test for the fixed intercept. However, the insignificance of the fixed intercept only indicates that the population average of the outcome is not significantly different from 0. In contrast, the variance estimation results reveal that the outcome varies a lot both within and across schools, with an ICC of 0.24.
