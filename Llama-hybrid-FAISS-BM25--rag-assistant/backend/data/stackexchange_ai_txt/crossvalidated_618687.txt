The hazard function $h(t)$ is the instantaneous incidence rate, and is probably the least ambiguous incidence rate to cite. If the incidence rate isn't constant over time, I find it confusing to think about an average incidence rate over a finite time interval. Such an "incidence rate" depends on the choice of starting time and the length of the time interval beyond that. If you do insist on such a value, however, it's pretty simply related to the cumulative hazard function, as you intuited. The cumulative hazard function, $H(t)=\int_0^t h(\tau) d\tau$ , is related to the survival probability starting from $t=0$ by $S(t)=\exp\left(-H(t)\right)$ . So if you've already reached some time $t_0$ and want to know the fraction of those still at risk who will have an event before a later time $t_1$ one time unit later, you could calculate: $$\begin{align} \frac{S(t_0)-S(t_1)}{S(t_0)} & = 1- \frac{S(t_1)}{S(t_0)}\\& =1-\exp\left(H(t_0)-H(t_1)\right)\\& =1-\exp \left(-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h(\tau) d \tau\right). \end{align}$$ That gives what you want, expressed in terms of the difference in cumulative hazard between the two time points.
