How to make NN to output a higher value when one of the input variables is higher

When a neural network has multiple variables as input, and I know from prior knowledge (e.g., laws of physics) that when the one important variable is high, the output value should also be high, I want to reflect this in the model. However, when I train an NN, I leave it up to the model to decide whether the one important variable will be used and in which direction the output value will change. What is the best way to add such prior knowledge when training the model?
