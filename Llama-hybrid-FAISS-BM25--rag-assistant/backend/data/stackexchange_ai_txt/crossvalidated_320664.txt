Where do artificial neural networks belong in the 'taxonomy' of statistical learning methods?

I'm a non-stats person trying to learn more about statistical learning methods, and to organize my thinking I am trying to construct a mental taxonomy of the methods I'm learning about. For instance: Statistical learning methods can be divided into supervised and unsupervised categories. Supervised methods can be divided into linear and non-linear methods. Supervised linear methods include generalized linear models and their derivations. Non-linear methods include tree-based methods, support vector machines, etc. Unsupervised methods include K-nearest neighbours, PCA, etc. What I'm struggling with is the position of artificial neural networks in this taxonomy. Neural networks allow us to reframe the variation in a dataset -- so are they an unsupervised learning method, similar to PCA? However, we can train them to perform a classification task -- so does that make them a supervised method? Or, are they better understood as an implementation of statistical learning methods? For instance, I have seen (but not necessarily understood) references to using support vector machines within a neural network. My apologies if this is a basic question. I have tried reading around it and remain confused but direction to further resources would be appreciated. I'm working through ISLR, and in part my confusion stems from the fact that that text makes no mention of neural networks.
