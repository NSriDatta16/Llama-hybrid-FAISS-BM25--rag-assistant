In principle, permutation score (MeanDecreaseAccuracy/MeanIncreaseMSE) is an average over trees, so there is also standard deviation over trees; randomForest stores it in the importanceSD element of the model and uses when executing importance with scale=TRUE . However, experiments show that the assumptions required to use this value for any parametric reasoning are violated in practice (see this for an overview), thus it is not a good idea to plot confidence intervals based on this. So, if you wish to make some statistically significant claims about the importance order of attributes I would recommend doing a bootstrap and plotting boxplots of importance over iterations (possibly with notches). And if you wish to establish a threshold between relevant attributes and noise, you really want to do feature selection, a task that will be done better by some feature selection algorithm than by visual judgement.
