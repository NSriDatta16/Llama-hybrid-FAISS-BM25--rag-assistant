Novice question about Averages - Sports Analytics

I came across a post by the SEC showcasing teams’ home record during the past 5 seasons. Although Alabama ranks first for having the most won games at home, I questioned the fairness of the average win rate as some teams played less/more home games than others. From my understanding, normalizing scales each input variable separately to the range 0 – 1, making it useful when dealing with multiple variables measured on different scales. And, standardization tells you how many standard deviations from the mean. So, in this case, would standardizing the data be the better option in calculating the average home win rate although the data isn't Normal? I tried simplifying the question, by comparing two teams with the same win average. Would statistics be the wrong method for this problem due to the sample number of observations?
