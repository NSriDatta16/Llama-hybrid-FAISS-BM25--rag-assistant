I think the question is asking "how many parameters would be required to choose among any probability distribution compatible with this Bayesian network?". Any compatible distribution must be represented as a product of conditional probability tables (CPTs). So the question is asking how many parameters do you need to specify all of the CPTs in the given network (assuming all the CPTs can be different).
