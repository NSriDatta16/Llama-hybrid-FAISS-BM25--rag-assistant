You're perfectly right. You have to enter the reference to the "selected" cell. E.g. if you click into cell A1 and then drag and select cells A1..A7 you will see that A1 has different background than the other cells. This is your current cell for the conditional formula. I.e. =OR( IFERROR(FIND("foo",A1),0) > 0, IFERROR(FIND("baz",A1),0) > 0 ) would be correct in this case. For the other cells the formula will then be adjusted accordingly.
