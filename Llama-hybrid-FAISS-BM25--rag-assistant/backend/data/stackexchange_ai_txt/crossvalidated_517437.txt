Note : Recommendations of general approach and/or software are usually off-topic. Though as publicly available work on specifically A/B Geo-experiments region matching (as opposed to general propensity score matching between entities) is so few and far between, I think the question is objectively answerable. Barajas et al. [1] has described an algorithm to find good matching pair of markets (i.e. 1 control state vs 1 treatment state in your case). Au [2] described how they find near-optimal matching sets of geo-regions (i.e. multiple control states vs multiple treatment states) using a hill climbing algorithm. Both work utilises Bayesian structural times series to capture the pre-experiment relationship between the treatment and control group metric(s), and produce a counterfactual during the actual experiment period that can be compared to what the treatment group actually attained. One popular R package for this line of work is CausalImpact (see this doc ).
