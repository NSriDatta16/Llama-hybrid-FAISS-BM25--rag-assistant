Apparently there's no way to do this directly. I wound up working around it by re-parenting the content when there are no tabs. For example, suppose I have a panel ( panel1 ) that contains the tab control ( ultraTabControl1 ), whose shared page ( sharedPage1 ) normally contains a grid ( grid1 ). I run code like this every time I change the list of tabs: var anyTabs = ultraTabControl1.Tabs.Count > 0; ultraTabControl1.Visible = anyTabs; grid1.Parent = anyTabs ? sharedPage1 : panel1; Inelegant, but at least it works.
