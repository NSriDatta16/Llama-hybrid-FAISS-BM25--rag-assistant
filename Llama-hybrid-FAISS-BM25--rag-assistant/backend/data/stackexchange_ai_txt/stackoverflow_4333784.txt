Jquery Animation Troubles

I'm having difficulty with a jquery animation. When the image slider selects the next image, I want the previous one to slide down underneath it (while still remaining somewhat visible) Can someone fix this? Is it a jquery problem or CSS. For simplicity (and failure at knowing how to organize my code here) here's the URL to edit: JS Bin Thanks in advance
