Why is Log4Net ignoring my logName?

Okay so I have a WCF service writing to the Event Log. All is well except for one detail..it won't pay any attention to the logName attribute,..here's the config. ..and the initialization code. //Create an instance of the log from the declaring type. var stackTrace = new StackTrace(); var frame = stackTrace.GetFrame(0); log = LogManager.GetLogger(frame.GetMethod().DeclaringType); BasicConfigurator.Configure(); The event log does get written to but in the Application log (using the MyCustomEventSource" source) rather than my own. Clearly I'm missing some important point but I don't see what that might be... I'm running on Win 7 and IIS 7.5 if that makes any diff. Any help would be appreciated.
