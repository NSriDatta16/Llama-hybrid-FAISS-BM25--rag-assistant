Personally, I find writing code that I know works is quite exhilarating. But if you don't want to be bored writing unit tests then you'll need to cultivate a fascination for debugging. To be serious, if you think that writing unit tests is boring and slow, you really need to re-address how you write them. I suggest you investigate using Test Driven Development. Write the tests in the programming language and run them automatically. Use the feedback from the tests to shape your code. There are Test First frameworks for pretty much any language you care to mention, inspired by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma's work with JUnit. The Wikipedia article on TDD has more info, including a helpful link to a list of frameworks organized by language. Find out more .
