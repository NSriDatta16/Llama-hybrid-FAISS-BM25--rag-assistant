Scoring items which are not easily compared

First of all, I apologize since this question has probably been asked many times and is easily answered. However, as a statistics amateur I simply couldn't figure out what keywords are relevant to my question. Suppose you have 100 merchants and 100 products. Each merchant sells a certain range of products, ranging from only one product to all 100 products. Also, products are sold in widely different proportions, which differ among merchants, and are subject to the merchant's individual (irrational) preferences. Whenever a merchant makes a "pitch" on the market, we observe whether or not he manages to sell the product he's pitching. We assume the probability of success depends (a) on the skill of the merchant and (b) the attractiveness of the product. The products' prices are fixed, so that's not a factor. The data we have consists of millions of pitches. For each pitch, we know whether or not it was successful, the merchant, and the product. Obviously, if we compare merchants by their average success rate, this information is useless because every merchant sells different products. Likewise, if we compare products, we gain no information since every product is sold by different merchants. What we want is a skill score for each merchant, which is independent of the products the merchant is selling, and an attractiveness score for each product, which is independent of the merchants who are selling it. I don't need a comprehensive explanation, just some keywords to point me in the right direction. I literally have no idea where to start. Edit: Note that our assumption is that the product attractiveness is merchant-independent and the merchant skill is product-independent, i.e. there are no merchants which are better at selling certain products but worse at selling others.
