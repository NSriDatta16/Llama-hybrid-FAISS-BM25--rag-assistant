the simplest and most straightforward (but not necessary most elegant) option, is to use php's date('W') and the modulus operator. Basically, you need to add the following to each menu item's class == ) echo 'current' ?> for example, for "corsham-menu" the TOTAL NUMBER will be 6 and ITEM will be from 0 to 5, so the code needs to be like "> Menu A "> Menu B "> Menu C "> Menu D "> Menu E "> Menu F ps really nice site you have there! ))
