A cool algorithm to check a Sudoku field?

Does anyone know a simple algorithm to check if a Sudoku-Configuration is valid? The simplest algorithm I came up with is (for a board of size n) in Pseudocode for each row for each number k in 1..n if k is not in the row (using another for-loop) return not-a-solution ..do the same for each column But I'm quite sure there must be a better (in the sense of more elegant) solution. Efficiency is quite unimportant.
