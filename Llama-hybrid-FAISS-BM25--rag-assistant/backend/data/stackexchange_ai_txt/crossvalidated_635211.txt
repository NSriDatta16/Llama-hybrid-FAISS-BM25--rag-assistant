I suspect you are misunderstanding what they did. Logistic regression models the log odds as a linear function of the inputs. But by adding nonlinear transformations (eg splines) of the inputs as extra inputs, logistic regression will model the log odds as a nonlinear function of the original inputs. eg adding $X^2$ as an input as well as the original X.
