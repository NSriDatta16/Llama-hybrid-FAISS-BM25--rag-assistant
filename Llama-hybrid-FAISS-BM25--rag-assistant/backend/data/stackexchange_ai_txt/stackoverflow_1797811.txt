How to get a list of product categories and their ID's from Magento?

I'm trying to import a large number of products from a DB into Magento. The DB has many different product categories, which I've recreated within Magento. However, when importing the products via a CSV, you must list the category ID rather than the name. Is there any way to bring up a list like the following: id | category 1 | pies 2 | guns 3 | cars The only way that I can see at the moment is to manually create a product 'Pie', 'Gun' etc and then export to CSV, but this will take a depressingly long time. Just as an aside - does anyone really truly understand all of Magento - it seems insanely complex? Thanks
