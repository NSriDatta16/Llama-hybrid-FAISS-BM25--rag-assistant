Practically, how to update a Bayesian distribution for a single parameter

First of all let me say that I have looked at this very helpful answer , but I don't believe it fully answers my question. Background Let's say I have a single parameter $\theta$ that I want to know the value of. At the moment I am unsure on the true, physical value $\theta$ , and so I quantify this uncertainty via a probability distribution $p(\theta)$ . For this question, we can just assume it to be Gaussian , $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ . This parameter causes some signal $s$ which I can measure. Given this signal I can update my prior via Bayes' as, $$ p(\theta| s) = \frac{p(s|\theta) p(\theta)}{p(s)}$$ i.e. what is the probability of the parameter $\theta$ given $s$ ? Question How exactly do I update the distribution and obtain the posterior? $p(\theta)$ is a distribution, but $p(s|\theta)$ and $p(s)$ are just scalars right? So I pick some value of $\theta$ , calculate the probability $p(s|\theta)$ , multiply the corresponding value in the distribution $p(\theta)$ , repeat for all values of $\theta$ ? And then divide by $p(s)$ ? I am a bit confused and a clear worked example (or pointing to the relevant material) would be much appreciated
