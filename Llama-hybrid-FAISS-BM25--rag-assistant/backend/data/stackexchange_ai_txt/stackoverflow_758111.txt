There is no single 'best' canned solution, it depends on what you need. For instance, you might want to average the values as you say, but using weighted averages where the old values do not contribute as much to the result as the new ones. Or you might try some smoothing. Or you might try to see if the distribution of events fits a well-kjnown distribution (like normal, Poisson, uniform).
