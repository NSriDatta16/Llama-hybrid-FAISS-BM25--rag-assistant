How do I interpret the output of logistic regression coefficients once they have been transformed from log odds to probabilities?

I used the brms package to carry out a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis with random intercepts. I'm having trouble interpreting the coefficients, in particular the transformation of the coefficients from log odds to probabilities with the plogis() function, which is equal to exp() / 1 + exp() . Here are the results: Family: bernoulli Links: mu = logit Formula: OUTCOME ~ PREDICTOR + (1 | WORD) Data: lang.data (Number of observations: 584) Samples: 6 chains, each with iter = 5000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; total post-warmup samples = 24000 Group-Level Effects: ~WORD (Number of levels: 196) Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS sd(Intercept) 3.57 0.65 2.45 4.99 1.00 7968 13158 Population-Level Effects: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS Intercept -5.49 0.79 -7.19 -4.09 1.00 13082 15203 PREDICTOR:LEVEL1 6.45 0.80 5.00 8.14 1.00 18012 16581 PREDICTOR:LEVEL2 0.80 0.74 -0.64 2.27 1.00 26702 20032 Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1). The PREDICTOR variable has three levels and the OUTCOME is a dichotomous variable, with the values 0 for absence and 1 for presence. Here are my questions: When I transform the estimate of the intercept with plogis() , I get the following: plogis(-5.49) [1] 0.004110875 Does this mean that when PREDICTOR is at the reference level, the probability of OUTCOME being 1 is 0.41 percent? When I add the transformed intercept and the estimate of PREDICTOR:LEVEL1 , I get the following result: plogis(-5.49 + 6.45) [1] 0.7231218 I understand this to mean that the probability of OUTCOME being 1 is about 72 percent when PREDICTOR has the value of LEVEL1 . When I add the transformed intercept and the estimate of PREDICTOR:LEVEL2 , I get the following result: plogis(-5.49 + 0.80) [1] 0.009103059 What I don't understand is why the three values above ( 0.004110875 , 0.7231218 , 0.009103059 ) do not sum to 1. If these values exhaust the space of predictor-variable values, the outcome has to occur in one of these three conditions, so why then do they not sum to 1? How do interpret the value of sd(Intercept) ? I know that it refers to the standard deviation around the value of the intercepts, but what do I make of the value 3.57? Is it high? Is it low?
