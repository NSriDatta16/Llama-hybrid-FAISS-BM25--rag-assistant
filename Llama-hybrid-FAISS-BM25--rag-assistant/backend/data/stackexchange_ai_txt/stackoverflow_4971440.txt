How to parse HTML to modify all words

This seems to be a recurring question, but here goes. I have HTML which is well-formatted (it comes from a controlled source, so this can be taken to be a given). I need to iterate through the contents of the body of the HTML, look for all the words in the document, perform some editing on those words, and save the results. For example, I have file sample.html and I want to run it through my application and product output.html, which is exactly the same as the original, plus my edits. I found the following using HTMLAgilityPack, but all the examples I've found look at the attributes of the specified tags - is there an easy modification that will look at the contents and perform my edits? HtmlDocument HD = new HtmlDocument(); HD.Load (@"e:\test.htm"); var NoAltElements = HD.DocumentNode.SelectNodes("//img[not(@alt)]"); if (NoAltElements != null) { foreach (HtmlNode HN in NoAltElements) { HN.Attributes.Append("alt", "no alt image"); } } HD.Save(@"e:\test.htm"); The above looks for image tags with no ALT tags. I want to look for all tags in the of the file and do something with the contents (which may involve creating new tags in the process). A very simple sample of what I might do is take the following input: Some Title This is my page This is a paragraph of text. and produce the output, which takes every word and alternates between making it uppercase and making it italics: Some Title THIS is MY page THIS is A paragraph OF text . Ideas, suggestions?
