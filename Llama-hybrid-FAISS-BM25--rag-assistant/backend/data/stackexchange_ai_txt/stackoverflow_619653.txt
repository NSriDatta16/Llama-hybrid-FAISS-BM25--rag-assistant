A better way of writing this : growing array

Was looking at some code earlier, and am thinking that there has to be a more elegant way of writing this.... (returnVar.Warnings is a string array, it could be returned as any size depending on the number of warnings that are logged) For Each item In items If o.ImageContent.ImageId = 0 Then ReDim Preserve returnVar.Warnings(returnVar.Warnings.GetUpperBound(0) + 1) returnVar.Warnings(returnVar.Warnings.GetUpperBound(0)) = "Section: " & section. . .ToString & " , Item: " & item. .ToString End If Next
