In their book, An Introduction to the Bootstrap (Chapman and Hall, New York 1994), Efron and Tibshirani give an example of estimating a ratio with the patch data study. The ratio of the averages is a biased estimate for the average of the ratio. So Efron and Tibshirani use the patch data to show how the bootstrap can correct for this bias. These data are based on a clinical trial where the effect of a hormonal patch produced at a new manufacturing plant is compared to the effect at the old (approved) manufacturing plant. The parameter of interest in this problem is $$\theta = \frac{E(\text{new})-E(\text{placebo})}{E(\text{old})-E(\text{placebo})}.$$ $E(.)$ is the expected level of hormone in the bloodstream by "new" = patch produced at new plant, "old" = patch produced at the approved plant, and "placebo" = patch without hormone. The FDA requirement for approval of the new manufacturing plant is that the new patch produces at least 80% of the effect that the old patch produced over placebo. So the idea is to estimate $\theta$ and show via a confidence interval (or hypothesis testing) that it is greater than 0.80; or, equivalently, that $1-\theta$ is less than 0.20. In this problem the numerator and denominator both have distributions concentrated on the positive half of the real line and bounded away from 0. So the problem that Bill Huber mentioned does not occur. In the book, Efron and Tibshirani compute the biased point estimate along with its bootstrap estimate of bias. They show that the bias-corrected estimate of $1-\theta$ is well below 0.20. Bootstrap confidence intervals could be used for this by again separately bootstrapping the two samples and computing the ratio estimates, say $B$ times, by Monte Carlo.
