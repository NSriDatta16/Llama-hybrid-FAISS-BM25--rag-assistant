Binary output recommender system: Bayesian network vs Neural Network

I am going to build a recommender system. My projects determines a binary output. What are the advantages/disadvantages of using a Bayesian network instead of a Neural Network? My data set has around 10k observations with around 20-30 features within. It is a time series with a duration of a few months.
