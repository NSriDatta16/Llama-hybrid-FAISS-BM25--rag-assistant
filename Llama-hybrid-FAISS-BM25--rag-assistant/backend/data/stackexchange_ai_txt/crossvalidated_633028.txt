How to interpret main effect and interaction between factors that have more than two levels (logistic regression)

I'm new to stats and I'm not sure how to interpret the output of my glm model. I have two fixed factors, task which has two levels (task A and task B), and condition which has four levels (conditions a, b, c, and d). Both factors are sum-coded (because I don't have a clear baseline/reference level). > contrasts(data $condition_c) contrasts(data$ condition_c) [,1] [,2] [,3] a 1 0 0 b 0 1 0 c 0 0 1 d -1 -1 -1 > contrasts(data $task_c) contrasts(data$ task_c) [,1] taskA 1 taskB -1 My dependent variable is binary so I'm using logistic regression. The model output looks like this: Call: glm(formula = DV ~ task_c * condition_c, family = "binomial", data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.3678 -1.0629 0.3536 0.9301 1.8400 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.26432 0.07572 3.491 0.000482 *** task_c1 0.20972 0.07572 2.770 0.005611 ** condition_c1 -0.22247 0.11058 -2.012 0.044237 * condition_c2 -0.09502 0.11226 -0.846 0.397350 condition_c3 1.98070 0.16615 11.921 Can anyone help me understand the main effect of condition and the interaction between task and condition? Thanks! Am I correct to say that for the main effect of condition, the model summary says that while conditions a and c are significantly different from the grand mean, condition b isn't? What about condition d? And I'm completely lost for the interaction.
