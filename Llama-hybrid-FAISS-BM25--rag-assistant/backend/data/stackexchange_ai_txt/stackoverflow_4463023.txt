I did finally resolve this, it turns out that the code is not the issue in my case, but instead, I had used a 32 bit version of the System.Data.Sqlite.dll and compiled my test assembly as x86 to get it to work correctly, and my other assemblies as AnyCPU, which on my system meant 64 bit. For some reason this worked for some things, but began to manifest itself in the CheckValue call, which was throwing me off the scent a bit. I was able to locate a 64 bit dll for Sqlite at http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/ that works beautifully. And now life is good with no custom IEqualityComparer, or explicit persisting of the objects before hand with the session.
