What is a good test for two variables who are roughly poissonian?

I have a dataset of user answers to various questions, I compute the average number of attempts that it takes for users to get a certain question right, and I need to compare whether the "new" versions of the questions take significantly fewer attempts, on average, than the "old" versions. Right now I'm simply splitting the averages into two groups based on whether they refer to "new" or "old" versions. I can perform a direct comparison because I have a bijective mapping between old and new questions. For example, without accounting for any confounding factors, I know that about 70% of the "new" questions require, on average, fewer attempts. The two sets of averages have distributions that look like this (superimposed, not stacked) The "old" mean is 2.73, the "new" mean is 2.13, but they look poissonian enough to me that I'm not sure what is a good way of determining whether they are significantly different. I tried a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but I got a $p Any thoughts?
