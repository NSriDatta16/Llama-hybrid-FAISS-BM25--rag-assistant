Nested sampling integral on a previously obtained MCMC sample

This question concerns the calculation of the evidence, or marginal likelihood, from an existing MCMC sample without having to resample. There is an exhaustive and very helpful answer here: [ Computation of the marginal likelihood from MCMC samples I'm still not clear about nested sampling. Is this algorithm below right or wrong? The question is this: Is the method below right or wrong? I have an MCMC sample with N points in parameter space. Each point has a likelihood L. I order the N points by increasing L. So I obtain a series of L[i] where L[i+1]>L[i]. i runs from 0 to N-1 I calculate X[i]=(N[i]-1)/N[i] where N[i] runs from 1 to N I therefore obtain a column of X and a column of LX. I integrate LX over X to obtain the Evidence.
