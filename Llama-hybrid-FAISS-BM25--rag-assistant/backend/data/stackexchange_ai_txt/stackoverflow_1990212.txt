Best approach for one view to call a tabbed view on iPhone

EDIT Let me simplify the question: Suppose your application has two views, the home view and a tabbed view with 3 tabs. The home view has three standard buttons named "Tab1", "Tab2" and "Tab3". When you click on "Tab1", the tabbed view should be opened with tab 1 selected and the same goes for Tab2 and Tab3. Any hints? /EDIT What I'm trying to do: when my iPhone app initializes, it displays a view with one button. When I click this button, it should go to a tabbed view. The way I'm doing and it's not working (getting an uncaught exception): I started by creating a project from the view-based template. On the view controller that was auto-created, I've declared another view controller called TabbedViewController. Here's the header file: #import @class TabbedViewController; @interface DZBluePagesViewController : UIViewController { TabbedViewController *tabbedViewController; } @property (nonatomic, retain) TabbedViewController *tabbedViewController; -(IBAction)goToTabbedView:(id)sender; @end I've created a xib called TabbedView and set the class identity of the file owner to the TabbedViewController. I've also dragged a Tab Bar Controller to it. I've added a button on the home view and here's the action that I've associated with it on the main view controller file: - (void)viewDidLoad { TabbedViewController *tvc = [[TabbedViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"TabbedView" bundle:nil]; self.tabbedViewController = tvc; [tvc release]; [super viewDidLoad]; } -(IBAction)goToTabbedView:(id)sender { // [self.view removeFromSuperview]; [self.view insertSubview:tabbedViewController.view atIndex:0]; } I'm getting an uncaught exception on the insertSubview call... I've done 3 or 4 tutorials (from the iPhone Development - Mark and LaMarche - book) on multiview apps so far and I thought I was ready to do one without anyone holding my hands... obviously wrong. Anybody can help?
