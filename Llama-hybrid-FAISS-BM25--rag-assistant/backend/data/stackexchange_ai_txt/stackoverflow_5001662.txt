this a working example => http://www.jsfiddle.net/steweb/sLpCA/ Just some 'additions' to what Alejandro said (that is correct), no constants in JS. So you need to 'declare' var FPS at the beginning. Moreover, you have to set an 'intervalID' variable, that is what the setInterval returns when you call it. BUT, before each setInterval call, you need to remove the 'active' interval actions you called (note that the first time there's nothing to clear) var myInterval; /* ... */ clearInterval(myInterval) myInterval = setInterval(draw,1000/FPS)
