Animations also help to draw the user's attention to a portion of the screen. Used carefully, they can make the system much easier to use. Some of the eyecandy in windows just exists to slow things down and forces the user to wait. My biggest issue with scroll out menus in windows is that I already know what I am looking for and where to find it. The menu just adds a delay. That might not be true in your web-app because the user is exploring your system. If a system is attractive and presented well, it puts the user in a better mood and makes them more confident that they can solve problems. When a problem presents itself "how do I do xyz" they find the problem easier to solve. Putting time and effort into making the UI nice will pay off both through a better user experience and also a better marketing image. It also makes you proud to work on the system, which is crucial to having a great product. The hallmark of a great product is one that the developer themselves uses on a regular basis.
