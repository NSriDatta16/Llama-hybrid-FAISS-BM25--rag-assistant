Making a table row animate upward movement in sortable UI

I'm using Sortable jQuery UI to allow users to drag and drop table rows. This allows users to rank items in a table based on their preference. Once a user has finished ordering his list, they press a save button which executes an Ajax call. The new rank is saved into the database and the table highlights briefly. I have now added an additional button that will send an item straight to the top of the list. It's also ajax. It works very well except that I would like to add a transition effect where by the will break away and drag itself to the top of the table, and push the following rows down. Is this possible? Here is the code I'm using: This code handles the call to save changes to the database from the "drag-and-drop" feature: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#sortable").sortable(); $("#saveButton").click(persist); }); // Persist function (save order) function persist() { var data = $("#sortable").sortable('toArray'); $.ajax({ traditional: true, url: "/gz/index.cfm/membros/rankListByAjax?order="+data, type: "POST", success: function(msg){ $("#sortable tr").effect("highlight", {}, 1000); } }); } The following code is the new "send-item-to-top" button I added. This is when I would like the transition to happen:
