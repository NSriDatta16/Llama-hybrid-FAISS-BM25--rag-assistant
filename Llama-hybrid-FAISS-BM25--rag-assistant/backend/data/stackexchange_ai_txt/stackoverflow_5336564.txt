The resources provided by Abhijeet Kashnia may help, but I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. You can do unit testing with mocks to verify your code, that won't test concurrency but will provide coverage. You can write an integration test to verify that the threads are being created and joined in the fashion you expect.However this will not guarantee against concurrency problems. Most concurrent problems are caused by timing bugs which are not predictable and thus can't be tested for accurately.
