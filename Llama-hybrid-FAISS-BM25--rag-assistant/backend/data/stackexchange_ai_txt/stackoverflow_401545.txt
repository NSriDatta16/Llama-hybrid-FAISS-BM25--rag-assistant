Why not store the documents etc. in a database, then have the web-app access the database and allow users to pull files that way? Does it have to be a mapped network drive? Otherwise if it's a matter of knowing what is there, you could always construct the jnlp file dynamically and pass file lists, etc. in as arguments (if they are server side). Guess we need to know a little more about what you are trying to accomplish.
