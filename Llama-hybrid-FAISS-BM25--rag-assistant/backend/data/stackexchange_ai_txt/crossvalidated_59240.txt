How to standardise cases within groups to perform ranking across groups and over time?

I am trying to create a method to rank ships according to their fuel burn rates. There are two different classes of ships, with different burn rates, so I am trying to create a mean and standard deviation for each class, then rank the ships according to how many standard deviations they are below the mean of their class. I will need to do this each month and each quarter. There are three ships in one category and 7 in the other. In the category with three ships, there are also 9 ships in another area that I do not wish to rank, but have data for. In the category with 7 ships, there are 23 other ships I have data for, but do not wish to include in the ranking. Questions: Is this the correct way to rank ships in two different classes? Any suggestions? Should the mean and standard deviation remain constant, or change every month / quarter? should the standard deviation and mean calculations include the other ships that I will not be ranking? I have data that lists the ships' average burn rates over a three year period, but these averages are not all based on the same amount of data (some ships were underway all year while some were underway only for a month). Can I use this data to create the standard deviation and mean, or do I need the monthly / quarterly data?
