your store image code could be like this.... img = Image( name=name, data=file.read() ) img.put() return ( str(img.name), img.key() ) doing base64encode of binary data may increase the size of data itself and increase the cpu encoding and decoding time. and Blobstore uses the same storage sturcuture as datastore, so it is just making easier to use file upload store download.
