Build a regular expression to find id in an href

Could someone show me a regular expression that would look through this document and select the href value of every href that has RELATION_ID on the end of it? Then if it does, I have to get the Id that is before the question mark (example href="dctm://ISDOFSDdev/ 37004e1f800021f3 ?DMS_OBJECT_SPEC=RELATION_ID ") Thanks!
