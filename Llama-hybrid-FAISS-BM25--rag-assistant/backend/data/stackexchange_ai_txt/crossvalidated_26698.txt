Anomaly detection or "Intervention Detection" has been championd by G.C.Tiao and others. To do science is to search for repeated patterns.To detect anomalies is to identify values that do not follow repeated patterns. We learn from Newton "Whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways". One learns the rules by observing when the current rules fail. Consider the time series 1,9,1,9,1,9,5,9 . To identify the anomaly one needs to have a pattern. The "5" is as much an anomaly as "14" would be . To identifY the pattern simply use ARIMA and in this case the "anomaly" becomes obvious. Try different software/approaches and see which one suggests an ARIMA model of order 1,0,0 with a coefficient of -1.0 . Use google/search procedures to find "automatic arima" or "automatic intervention detection". You may be disappointed by free stuff as it might be worth what you pay for it. Writing it yourself might be interesting if you have a heavy time series background and a couple of years to waste.There are serious limitations to distance based methods http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/SCE/pakdd2006/tutorial/chawla_tutorial_pakddslides.pdf
