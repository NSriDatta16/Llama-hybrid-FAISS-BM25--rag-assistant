iPhone Auto-scroll UITextView but allow manual scrolling also

I have a UITextView that has a lot of content. I have a button that allows the UITextView to automatically scroll + 10 pixels in an NSTimer loop: scrollPoint = CGPointMake(scrollPoint.x, scrollPoint.y + 10); [textView setContentOffset:scrollPoint animated:YES]; This works really well, as the animation makes the scroll rather smooth. I want to allow the user to skip ahead or back by scrolling with their finger, however due to this code after the scroll animation, the scroll snaps back to where it would have auto-scrolled. I need to reset the scrollPoint variable after a manual scroll, but I'm not sure how to do that. I've tried implementing the delegate method - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:(UIScrollView *)scrollView; but this method fires on my automatic scroll as well. Any ideas?
