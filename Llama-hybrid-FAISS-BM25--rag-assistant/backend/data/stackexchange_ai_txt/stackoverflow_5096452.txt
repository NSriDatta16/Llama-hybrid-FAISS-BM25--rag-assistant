Identify Row as having changes excluding changes in certain columns

Within our business rules, we need to track when a row is designated as being changed. The table contains multiple columns designated as non-relevant per our business purposes (such as a date entered field, timestamp, reviewed bit field, or received bit field). The table has many columns and I'm trying to find an elegant way to determine if any of the relevant fields have changed and then record an entry in an auditing table (entering the PK value of the row - the PK cannot be edited). I don't even need to know which column actually changed (although it would be nice down the road). I am able to accomplish it through a stored procedure, but it is an ugly SP using the following syntax for an update (OR statements shortened considerably for post): INSERT INTO [TblSourceDataChange] (pkValue) SELECT d.pkValue FROM deleted d INNER JOIN inserted i ON d.pkValue=i.pkValue WHERE ( i.[F440] <> d.[F440] OR i.[F445] <> d.[F445] OR i.[F450] <> d.[F450]) I'm trying to find a generic way where I could designated the ignore fields and the stored proc would still work even if I added additional relevant fields into the table. The non-relevant fields do not change very often whereas the relevant fields tend to be a little more dynamic.
