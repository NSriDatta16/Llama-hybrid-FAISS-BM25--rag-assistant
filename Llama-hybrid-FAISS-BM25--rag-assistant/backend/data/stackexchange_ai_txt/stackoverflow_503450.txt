This is almost an exact copy of the question I asked 2 days ago: Session containing items implementing IDisposable InstanceScope.Hybrid just stores the object inside HttpContext.Current.Items if it exists or ThreadLocal storage otherwise and InstanceScope.HttpSession works the same way other than it uses the HttpSession and ThreadLocal. The items collection lives per request, so if you implement the pattern pointed out on my question you should see Dispose firing at the end of the current request.
