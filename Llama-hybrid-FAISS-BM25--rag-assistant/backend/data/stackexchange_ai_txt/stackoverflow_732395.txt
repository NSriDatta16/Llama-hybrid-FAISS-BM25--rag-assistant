Not directly answering your question, but have you tried using a javascript library such as jQuery UI? It provides good drag/drop support & you can do the sorts of things your talking about... eg. you can make certain elements of your page draggable & others droppable & then handle the events when the user drags an element around. It provides a tolerance on the dropables that includes 'touch' (as well as 'fit', 'intersect', 'pointer'), so then you could handle the 'over' event of your dropable targets & you'd get an event handler that fires when the corner of your div is over a given element. This event handler gives you a reference to the element being dragged as well as the element its being dragged over. (a bit backwards to how you asked the question, but should be usable in solving the same problems). Hope that's of some help...
