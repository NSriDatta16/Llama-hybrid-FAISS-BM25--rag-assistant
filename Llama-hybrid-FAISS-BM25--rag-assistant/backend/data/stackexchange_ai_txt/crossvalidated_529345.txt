How to quantify and sum up the effect of each record of two time series on their correlation?

Let's say I have two one-day time series data. Each has 24 points (24 hours). import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import datetime import numpy as np np.random.seed(0) x = np.array([datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, i, 0) for i in range(24)]) y1 = np.random.randint(100, size=x.shape) y2 = np.random.randint(100, size=x.shape) plt.plot(x,y1) plt.plot(x,y2) plt.show() I can calculate the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the value will change when I remove a point. How can I quantify the effect of each point (hour) on the R 2 ? I want to quantify the effect of each point and then sum the quantified criteria of a subset of points so that I can compare the effect of different subsets on the R 2 . For example, an ideal metric that I am looking for enables me to attribute the R 2 of the two time series (y1 and y2) to each time step (e.g. 18:00 contributes 20% and 15:00 contributes 15% of the R 2 ). And the metric is also additive so that I can quantify the contribution of a subset of time steps (e.g. the contribution of 15:00 and 18:00 is 20+15=35%). I would calculate R 2 with and without a point and use the difference as the effect of the point. However, this way of quantifying may not additive.
