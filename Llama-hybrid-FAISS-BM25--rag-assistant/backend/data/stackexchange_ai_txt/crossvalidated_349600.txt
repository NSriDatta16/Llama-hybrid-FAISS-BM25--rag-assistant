Why is the performance of a neural network so different every run?

I'm working on a recurrent neural network (LSTM), and the accuracy of the network is completely different every run. I understand that there are differences because of random factors, but this extreme? The settings are completely the same in each run. I use the rmsprop optimizer (using keras and tensorflow) with default values. The test accuracy (random taken test set, 25%) is also between 50% and 98% Can anyone tell me a reason for this?
