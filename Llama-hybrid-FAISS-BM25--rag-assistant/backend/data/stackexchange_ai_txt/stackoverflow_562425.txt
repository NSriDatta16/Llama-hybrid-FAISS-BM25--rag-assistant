It looks as if you have placed an error handler on the source document XML parser, but are trying to catch errors from the transformer. So place the error handler on the Transformer rather than the XMLReader tHandler2.getTransformer().setErrorListener(myHandler); IIRC, I've always kept it simple and used Transformer directly rather than go for ContentHandler / TranformerHandler . As alternatives you could go for an implementation specific extension or cause a special URI to be resolved and handle that (although as XSLT is a functional language, I guess it could technically resolve a URI that wont actually impact the result).
