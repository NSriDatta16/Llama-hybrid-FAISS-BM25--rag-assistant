Having a single 2 gigabyte object is not a good idea. If memory is fragmented you won't be able to allocate one even if the amount of free memory is enough. I would suggest that you try to use a list of smaller objects. (I remember how in Turbo Pascal (the predecessor to Delphi) a variable couldn't be larger than 64 kilobyte... Oh, the times... ;)
