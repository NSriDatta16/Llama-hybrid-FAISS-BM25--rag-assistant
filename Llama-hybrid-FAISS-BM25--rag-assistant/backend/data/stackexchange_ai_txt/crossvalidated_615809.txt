Help with Bayesian model averaging

I am new to statistical modelling and I need some help with Bayesian model averaging. I have 3 models and I would like to derive a BMA of these models. I am using the BIC estimate for the different models and a uniform prior probability of 0.33. Model 1, BIC= 4420 Model 2, BIC= 3940 Model 3, BIC = 4325 I am stuck trying to calculate the Posterior probability for each model and I donâ€™t know how to use that in estimating the BMA . Any help would be greatly appreciated.
