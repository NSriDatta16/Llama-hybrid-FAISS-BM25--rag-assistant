How to get a measure for the average "frequency" for wave-like data that changes frequency constantly over time?

Sure I can measure the average amplitude, but I'm interested in trying to get a measure for the frequency given the list of amplitude values within a certain time frame. Any ideas? Maybe not even frequency exactly but I'd like to measure the intensity and speed of the cycle of the wave.
