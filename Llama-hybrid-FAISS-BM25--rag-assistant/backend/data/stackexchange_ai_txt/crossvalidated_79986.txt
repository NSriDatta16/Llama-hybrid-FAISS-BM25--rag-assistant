What is precision on prediction given precision of rules

I'm new to statistics and have a question about my machine learning method. This method can distinguish between positive/negative examples. The result is a set of rules to define only positive examples. For each rule I have calculated the precision as follows: precision = $\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP+FP}}$ where: $\mathrm{TP}$ = true positives covered by the rule. $\mathrm{FP}$ = False positive covered by the rule. I use the method to predict an unknown example. The example is predicted as deleterious by three independent rules, which have precisions of 30% (a bad rule) 95% 88% What is the final precision score for the unknown example?
