Codeigniter comes with its own image library which can resize images. This example is from the documentation, just edit the $config variable: $config['image_library'] = 'gd2'; $config['source_image'] = '/path/to/image/mypic.jpg'; $config['new_image'] = '/path/to/new/image.jpg'; $config['maintain_ratio'] = TRUE; $config['width'] = 75; $config['height'] = 50; $this->load->library('image_lib', $config); $this->image_lib->resize(); You can also create thumbnails dynamically (that is, without saving them to the hard drive) but that requires a lot of memory so I would discourage that. The image class can also crop the image if you need that. I use it to create thumbnails in the application I am currently working on...
