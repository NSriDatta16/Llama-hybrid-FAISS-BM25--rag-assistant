You want to look into using the "compound modification set" as described here: Page 69 of Pragmatic Project Automation http://www.nabble.com/How-I-can-use-compound-modification-set-with-triggers--td19397718.html http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/main/configxml.html#compound Does StarTeam support "triggers"? Instead of having your CruiseControl machines checking the repository every minute for a change, you'd have your StarTeam machine letting CruiseControl know when the code has been changed by touching a file. Basically, when an update is made to a project your VCS touches a file that CruiseControl monitors (like project-a-update.txt). Once it notices that the file has change CruiseControl knows to go bother doing an update from your VCS. So it's polling a single text file per project every N minutes, instead of the entire repository.
