Polygon in rectangle algorithm?

I have an algorithm which can find if a point is in a given polygon: int CGlEngineFunctions::PointInPoly(int npts, float *xp, float *yp, float x, float y) { int i, j, c = 0; for (i = 0, j = npts-1; i given this, how could I make it check if its within a rectangle defind by Ptopleft and Pbottomright instead of a single point? Thanks Basically you know how in Adobe Illustrator you can drag to select all objects that fall within the selection rectangle? well I mean that. â€“
