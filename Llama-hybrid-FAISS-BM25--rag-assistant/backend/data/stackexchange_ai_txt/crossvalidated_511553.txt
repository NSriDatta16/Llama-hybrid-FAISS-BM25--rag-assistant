Do I need to include only whole seasons in training/test sets of time series?

I have a daily time series, with weekly seasonality, but it starts and ends in the middle of the week (Wed/Thu, during the season peak). I have two questions: Should I drop the first and last partial weeks from the data before modelling? When splitting into training and test sets, should I also make sure to include only whole seasons in each set?
