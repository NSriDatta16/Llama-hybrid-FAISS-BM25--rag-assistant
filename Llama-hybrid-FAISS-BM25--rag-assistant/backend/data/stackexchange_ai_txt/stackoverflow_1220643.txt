It seems like you could do this quite simply by just rotating your team list. e.g. given teams 1..10, do this: Team A: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Team B: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 so in game one, team A plays team B. For game two, rotate again: Team A: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Team B: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 Nine games will give you a full round-robin, and then you can start at the beginning again. Take the games in pairs for your nightly matchups. EDIT Kylotan points out that this doesn't actually work, as it has every team playing twice at once. Oops. If you came up with something that genuinely works, I encourage you to post it and accept it :-)
