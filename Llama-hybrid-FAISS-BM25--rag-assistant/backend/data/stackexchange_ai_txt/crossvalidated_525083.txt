Rejecting a model in favor of another

Let's say currently there is a specific time series forecasting model A in use for some case and I want to test and prove whether another model B is significantly better and should replace model A. What will be the way to do that statistically? I thought of getting both models MSE and then check if the difference is significant but I saw somewhere that this will work when I need just to choose a model and not try and reject one for another.
