How to quantify the similarity between three sets of complex numbers?

I have multiple groups of measurements, each containing three sets of complex numbers (impedances of the same thing measured under three conditions). The Nyquist plots belows shows two of such groups. As can be seen in the Nyquist plots, there is a larger dispersion between the top group then the bottom. I'm looking to generate a single value that represents this dispersion for each individual group, i.e. a number for the top plot and another for the bottom that would tell me the top one is more dispersed than the bottom. I tried to calcualte the deviation from the mean at each point, and can take the average of all points in the set as a representation of the difference - which is essentially the mean absolute deviation. But I came up with this on my own without much statistics background and was wondering if it there are more established ways to go about this. I'm looking for a single value because I want to later calculate the correlation between the amount of variations and other factors. Thank you in advance for any insights! Here are the Nyquist plots of two groups of data, each containing three sets of complex numbers:
