Am I interpreting the output of my logistic regression probabilities correctly?

I have conducted a logistic regression in R looking at if fish feed in the presence of a decoy predator. Here is a shortened sample: Condition Feed No Decoy Y No Decoy Y No Decoy Y No Decoy Y No Decoy N No Decoy N No Decoy N Decoy Y Decoy Y Decoy Y Decoy N Decoy N Decoy N Decoy N N.B This data has 206 rows with no decoy/decoy conditions split 100:106. I have run the following code in R to conduct the model and convert normal probability from the logits: ##Logistic1$Feed = Feeding Data, Logistic1$Condition = Decoy Data## model1 The output of this gives me 216 values. Rows 0-100 show: 0.17821782 and rows 101-206 show: 0.06666667 From reading guides online, the final command results in a single value which is the probability. I'm assuming something to do with my data and coding means this is showing the probabilities that feeding occurs in the no decoy (18%) and decoy conditions (7%) but it's just showing it for every value?
