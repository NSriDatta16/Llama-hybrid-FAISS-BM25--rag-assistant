One thing to look at is narrowing. You can use narrowing to get around a lot of the bouncing back and forth you're doing. (mark-paragraph) (narrow-to-region) Will limit the scope of your function to the current paragraph and move point to the beginning. You can then start your forward search without worrying about moving past the current paragraph. When you're done, (widen) restores the rest of the buffer to view.
