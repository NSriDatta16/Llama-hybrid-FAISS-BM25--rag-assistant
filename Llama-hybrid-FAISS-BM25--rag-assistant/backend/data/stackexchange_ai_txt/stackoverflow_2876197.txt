How can I identify whether a browser/reader is being used by someone who is visually impaired?

I have to provide a 508-compliant version of a page for the visually impaired and it isn't practical to just modify the page. Thus, I have created a new "reader-compatible" version of the page for the handicapped. The question is how I can tell if someone is using a reader rather than a standard browser? Is there a "header" or "useragent" value typically used by these non-standard browsers that I can look for? Thanks in advance!
