No connections shown in new xib file

I am trying to add a new view to a working nav controller app. I edited the DetailViewController.h and DetailViewController.m files for the new view (shown below), created a new DetailViewController.xib file, added the web view. My issue is that I cannot link the file owner to the webview. when i control drag from file owner to the webview, the webview label does not show up, it seems like the xib is not connected to the .h and .m #import @interface DetailViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIWebView *webView; } @property(nonatomic,retain) UIWebView *webView; -(IBAction) goBack:(id)sender; @end the top of .m is #import "wwgt3AppDelegate.h" #import "DetailViewController.h" #import "RootViewController.h" @implementation DetailViewController @synthesize webView;
