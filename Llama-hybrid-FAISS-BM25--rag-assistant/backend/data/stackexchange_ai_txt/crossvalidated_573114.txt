Examining stationarity, mean and variance of time series

Hi guys, I encounter this question for a Business Forecasting module and I am very confused by it. Firstly, this looks like an autoregressive model of order 1. From the looks of it, the φ coefficient is 1. Doesn't this mean that the time series cannot be stationary and the ACF will be 1 at all lags? Also, how can we find mean and variance? These are the formulas I was given: But if φ = 1, then the denominator for both formulas would be 0, and there would be no mean or variance. How exactly do I solve this question? Does this have something to do with inverting the AR(1) process into a MA(infinite) process?
