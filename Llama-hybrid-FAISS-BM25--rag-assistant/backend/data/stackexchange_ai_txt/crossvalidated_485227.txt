is there anything harm filling missing values with more than one values for a single column? No. In fact, you should not just fill in missing values with potentially different values within a single column, you should do so repeatedly to get multiple versions of imputed data sets. That's the correct way to avoid bias or incorrect standard errors when dealing with missing data. Section 1.3 of Stef van Buuren's book examines several approaches for filling in missing data, discussing the conditions under which they can produce unbiased results and give correct standard errors when you only generate one data set with imputations. Except under specific circumstances they have substantial problems. The best approach is to use a probabilistic estimation of the missing values, based on the other information you have about the cases, and repeat the process several times to get multiple imputed data sets. With sex having missing values, you could use methods based on logistic regression to combine information available from the relationships of the other predictors and of the outcome values with sex . You then do the analysis separately on each of the imputed data sets, and combine the results across the imputations. In that way you correctly incorporate the uncertainty that comes from both the modeling itself and the imputation process. See the book for details, and the mice package in R for one implementation.
