Can feature engineering be replaced by metaparameter selection in Random Forests?

Random forests model perform at the level of each tree a partitioning of space with is aligned with feature space. Does this mean that there are cases where performing feature engineering (e.g. performing dimensionality reduction aligning better features or applying a non-linear transformation to the input features), we can improve the results of a rf model? Or can we suppose that, if we are in such a case where we managed to improve performance using feature engineering, since any preprocessing would just modify the shape of the boundary and every boundary can be approximated with a sequence of boundaries aligned to the input features, with the appropriate choice of metaparameters we can always perform as well as the preprocessed model, without preprocessing ? I cannot find a conclusive answer to this question in previous questions on CrossValidated. ps: I am not interested in the computational time here but I consider fixed the dimension of the dataset.
