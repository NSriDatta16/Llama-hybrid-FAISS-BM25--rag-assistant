I get zero by two methods, a Mathematica simulation, and a counting argument. Mathematica simulation: results = {}; results2={}; Module[{n = 10000000, outer, inner}, AbsoluteTiming[ For[k = 1, k The counting argument: only six sums are possible -5,-3,-1,+1,+3,+5 and the averages are those divided by 5. The sums of equal absolute value have an equal number of terms. Since the negative and positive values cancel each other out, the average is zero. Here is a count of the number of sums of each kind: Tally[results2] -> {{-1, 312475}, {1, 312595}, {5, 31378}, {-3, 155964}, {3, 156121}, {-5, 31467}}
