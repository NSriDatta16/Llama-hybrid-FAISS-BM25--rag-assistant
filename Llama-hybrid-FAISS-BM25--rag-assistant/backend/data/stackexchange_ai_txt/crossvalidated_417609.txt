How to aggregate time-series data?

I have two types of short length time series data (from day1-day5) as follows. Type1 (Temperature at location1): sensor1, 38, 38, 35, 33, 32 sensor2, 33, 32, 35, 36, 32 and so on .... Type2 (Temperature at location2): sensor1, 18, 18, 12, 11, 09 sensor2, 13, 12, 15, 16, 12 and so on .... Since, the sensor that we use in both locations are same, I am just wondering if it is correct to aggregate the two time-series as follows and anaylyse the pattrens. Aggregation of Type1 and Type2: sensor1, 38, 38, 35, 33, 32, 18, 18, 12, 11, 09 sensor2, 33, 32, 35, 36, 32, 13, 12, 15, 16, 12 and so on .... The reason why I thought to aggregate the data is that I thought it would give me more patterns than analysing them alone. Please let me know your thoughts. I am happy to provide more details if needed.
