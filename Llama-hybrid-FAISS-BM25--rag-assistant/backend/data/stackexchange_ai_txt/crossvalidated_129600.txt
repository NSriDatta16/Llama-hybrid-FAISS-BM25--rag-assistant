Linear independence vs statistical independence (PCA and ICA)

I'm reading this interesting paper on application of ICA to gene expression data. The authors write: [T]here is no requirement for PCA components to be statistically independent. That is true, but the PCs are orthogonal, are they not? I am a bit fuzzy as to what is the relationship between statistical inedpendence and orthogonality or linear independence. It is worth noting that while ICA also provides a linear decomposition of the data matrix, the requirement of statistical independence implies that the data covariance matrix is decorrelated in a non-linear fashion, in contrast to PCA where the decorrelation is performed linearly. I don't understand that. How does lack of linearity follow from statistical independence? Question: how does statistical independence of components in ICA relate to linear independence of components in PCA?
