I think the paper "Machine learning in automated text categorization" (you can Google and download the PDF file) is worth reading. The paper discussed two crucial part:one for feature selection(translate text to feature space), the other for building a classifier on feature space. there is a lot of feature selection methods, and several classification methods(decision tree, naive Bayes, kNN, SVM, etc). you can try some combination to see if it was working on your data set. I did something similar before, I use Python for text manipulation, feature selection, and feature weighting. and Orange for classifier. Orange and Weka already included naive Bayes, kNN... , but nowadays I might write the classifier with Python script directly, it shouldn't be very hard too. Hope this helps.
