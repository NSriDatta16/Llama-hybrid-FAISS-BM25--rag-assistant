Use a good issue tracker to track and organize everything that has to be done (create issues for that). As a project leader, triage and prioritize them carefully depending on their importance. Plan the scope of release milestones and assign issues to them. The project vision and roadmap should be clear for all contributors. As a developer, use search queries/features to find the most important issues for the current iteration. Ideally, pick up an issue providing high value, or just something that you can do. Update the status of the issue when you start working on it, when you're done, etc to let others know something is happening.
