After much investigation, it really does look like Proguard is essential to keep the size and speed of deploying the application to reasonable levels. Sadly, there is no suitable way to embed proguard as a build step. Using scripts might be a possibility, but I also need to support Windows, Linux and OSX environments. I was also unsure about the twin-project solution, as it prevented Scala code from using the generated resources file R.java, which I wanted to be able to do. In the end, I was able to make both SBT and Ant build an android 2.1 application using Scala 2.8. Ant was the favourite final solution as it works with the same file organisation as Android's eclipse plugin. I've written up the solution here: http://scala-ide.assembla.com/wiki/show/ae55a-oWSr36hpeJe5avMc/Developing_for_Android Eclipse then launches Ant as an external tool to package and install the application.
