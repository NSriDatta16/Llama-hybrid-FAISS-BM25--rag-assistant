It depends, there definitely can be some positives in going to the monthly level. First off, as you pointed out, you can actually build a model at the monthly freq. With 3 points you will just use some naive forecast for the annual level which can work unless the annual freq is masking an underlying trend which would be evident at the monthly level. It all really comes down to signal vs. noise ratio. As you go from annual to a frequency like hourly we typically begin to have more noise creeping in which can make it significantly harder to forecast. But going from annual to monthly we gain more data points and may uncover trends which would be beneficial to forecast. So you just need to find the right balance. If you look at monthly/daily and everything is noise it might just be optimal to average the years.
