What features can improve the usability of a WebApp

i am looking for new features and ideas to improve the overall usability of our internal webapp (straight LOB-App with some CRM features) i bet there is ton of those waiting the get found. as an example: recently i tried out rememberthemilk.com a task tracking application which has the feature to enter dates in natural language, so instead of using the date picker or entering the date itself, because grabbing the mouse actually takes longer (but forces you to think about what the date is), you can just write "today" or "tomorrow" or "end of month" or "in 2 weeks". that feature really got me, every time i use another application now, i wonder why i cant do this here. i wonder why other application make me thing about what date "next friday" is. i dont care! but i do care that my boss just said "i need this till next friday". 1 feature/idea per answer please.
