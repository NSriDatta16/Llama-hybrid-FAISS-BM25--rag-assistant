How to model multiple multivariate time series for binary classification?

The data consist of repeated measurements of multiple individuals, where more variables are measured at each time point. Individuals fall into mutually exclusive groups. Number of measurements may differ with respect to individual, i.e some individuals have longer and some have shorter history. The the grid of time points is equidistant. Each observation has a binary label, typically long history of 0-s and some of them then switch to 1. How to predict the probability of the label being 1 in next step given the history? Ideally the model should be interpretable, i.e. if I say there is 80% chance that the individual A1 will become 1 in next time step and 60% chance it will become 1 in second step given it did not become 1 in first forward step, I would like to have some explanation why there is this chance...
