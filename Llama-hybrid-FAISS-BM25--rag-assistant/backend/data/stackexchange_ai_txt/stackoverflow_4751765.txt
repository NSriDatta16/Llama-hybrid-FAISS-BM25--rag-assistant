Rails/Authlogic: restrict login/session to one record

I've taken over a membership database for a small organization. The data is quite out of date, it's just name and address information (no email addresses). I've ported it into a Rails3 app. I want the members to be able to log in and update their own information. How would I do that with Authlogic (or Devise for that matter)? Say I have a "Household" model. Should I add the Authlogic fields into this model, or is it better to keep separate Users and Sessions models? How would I make it so that user A can only access views for user A? Any nifty ideas?
