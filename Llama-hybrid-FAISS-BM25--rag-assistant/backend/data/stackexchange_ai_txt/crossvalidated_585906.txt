Imagine this was a general equation such as $$y=1.6x+0.7z$$ and the question is how can you "solve" this if you do not know $z$ ? You can't. You will either have to make something up for $z$ , or in your case - since $z$ is a dummy binary variable (I assume) - try both cases and report both results or maybe some average of them. Example if you have two genders coded as 0 for males and 1 for females then the log odds equation for males is $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})=-300+0.5 \cdot Age+80 \cdot 0$ and for females it's $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})=-300+0.5 \cdot Age+80 \cdot 1$ , so a difference of $80$ in log odds. You can report both these values or maybe some average of them on the original scale.
