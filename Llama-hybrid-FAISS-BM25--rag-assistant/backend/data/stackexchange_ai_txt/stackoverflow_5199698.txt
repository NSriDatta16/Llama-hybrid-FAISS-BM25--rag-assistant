So a quick look at the SimpleWikiParser source code on sourceforge suggests that as of 1/29/2011 the parser handles the following entities: comments references code blocks internal links and external links properties tables. Presumably all wiki other content ends up in TextNode objects. Looking at the wiki markup feature set , there would be a non trivial amount of work to strip out the wiki syntax elements let alone convert them further into structured elements. For alternative or code you can leverage, look at the following Alternate Parsers page. For a self contained but imperfect solution, you could perform a bunch of regular expression replace on node.text .
