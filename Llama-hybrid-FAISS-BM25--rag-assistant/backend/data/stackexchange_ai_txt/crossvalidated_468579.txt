I'm guessing that statements in my Comment are true, and supposing that you have results from $n$ tests of which $a$ give positive results. Then you have an estimate for $\tau,$ the number of positive tests: $\hat \tau = t = a/n.$ Confidence interval for proportion testing positive. Also assuming that the sample size $n$ is large enough for a Wald confidence interval to be valid, you would have the 95% CI for $\tau$ as follows: $$t \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{t(1-t)}{n}}.$$ But the proportion testing positive is not the prevalence (or in your terminology the percentage immune). Confidence interval for proportion immune. Letting $\pi = P(\mathsf{Immune})$ and $\eta =$ Sensitivity, $\theta =$ Specificity (both as in my Comment), one has from the Law of Total Probability that $$\tau = \pi\eta + (1-\pi)(1-\theta).$$ Solving for $\pi$ one has $$\pi = \frac{\tau + \theta - 1}{\eta + \theta - 1}.$$ So you can get a point estimate for $p$ for $\pi$ from the point estimate $t$ for $\tau$ by substitution: $$p = \frac{t + \theta - 1}{\eta + \theta - 1}.$$ However, the estimate $p$ does not arise from binomial sampling, so one cannot use $t$ to make a Wald interval directly. A 95% confidence interval for $\pi$ results from using the displayed equation just above to transform the endpoints of the Wald interval for $\tau.$ For example, suppose $t = a/n = 700/1000 = 0.7$ and the Wald interval is $(0.672, 0.728).$ Then the corresponding 95% CI for $\pi$ is $(0.781, 0.846).$ (c(0.672, 0.728) + .9981 - 1)/(.86 + .9981 - 1) [1] 0.7809113 0.8461718 Notes: In cases where $t$ is near $0$ or $1$ and sensitivity and/or specificity are poor, the 95% CI for $\pi$ found by this method may not be contained in $(0,1).$ Then the Gibbs Sampler in the link of my Comment can provide a way to get a reasonable Bayesian posterior probability interval ('credible interval'). If a beta prior distribution [which has support $(0,1)]$ is used for the parameter $\pi,$ then the posterior distribution must also have support $(0,1)$ and the Bayesian interval estimate must be contained in the unit interval. (2) If your $n$ is in the low hundreds or below, then use the Agresti-Coull confidence interval for $\tau$ instead of the Wald interval.
