How to reset ML model's memory?

I have been working on binary classification problem using algorithms such as Random Forest, neural networks, Boosting methods and logistic regression. However, during my model building process, I tweaked my model based on the performance in test set ( X_test ). Meaning, I do the below step-1) I apply .fit() on train data, assess the performance (identify best parameters through grdisearchcv) step-2) Later, I apply .predict() on test_data When performance was not good on test_data, I did the below a) Changed the algorithm (or hyperparameters,cv folds, scoring etc) and repeated step 1) and step 2) While I found out by reading online that this is not a good approach as I am exposing the model to test data (multiple times) and model may overfit for my test_data (and not perform well in future for new data from real world). So, now I want to erase my model's memory/make it unsee whatever it has already seen. How can I reset ML model memory? Does resetting my jupyter notebook, laptop etc would make it forget everything?
