You can't add a "foreign key" to the Entity Model without adding it to the database - the FK is a database design construct to link to tables, and as such would have to be added to the storage model (the physical database model) in EF - but that has to be 1:1 what exists in the acutal database. But what you could do is to add an Association to your conceptual model; this is the side of things that is not tied 1:1 to the database, but represents your domain model. You can add this by means of right-clicking on an entity in your EDMX designer and choosing "Add association" from the context menu. This will popup a "Add Association" dialog in which you can pick what two entities to link, and how: With this, you should be able to add Associations and thus relationships between entities on the conceptual side of the EF model, without touching the underlying database schema.
