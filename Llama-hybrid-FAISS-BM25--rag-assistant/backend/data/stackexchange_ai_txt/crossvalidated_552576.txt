Method selection - multivariable non-parametric

I am not sure about the method selection for my data. Dependent variable: Continuous variable and grouped in ordered categories. As continuous it is not normally distributed but skewed to the right. As categories, they are similar in size in the number of observations except for baseline which is defined based on clinical cut-off. Explanatory variable: Continuous variable grouped as binary based on clinical cut-off. As continuous it is normally distributed. Potential risk factors looking into: 2 binary, 1 with three non ordered categories I looked at potentially using ordered logistic regression, but are now considering a non-parametric method. Was recommended to use the Whitney U test, but not sure what method I can use for multivariate analysis. Considering non-parametric series regression. What method and test would you use?
