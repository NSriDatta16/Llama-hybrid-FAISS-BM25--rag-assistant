For the case of neural networks, this is a promising approach: WTTE-RNN - Less hacky churn prediction . The essence of this method is to use a Recurrent Neural Network to predict parameters of a Weibull distribution at each time-step and optimize the network using a loss function that takes censoring into account. The author also released his implementation on Github .
