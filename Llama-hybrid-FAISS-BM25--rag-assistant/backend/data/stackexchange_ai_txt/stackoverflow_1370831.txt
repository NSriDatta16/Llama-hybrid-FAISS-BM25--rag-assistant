Safari's user agent: which WebKit version to trust?

I'm trying to extract not just the browser and its version number but also the rendering engine and its version number from common user-agent strings. Most browsers report this just fine, e.g.: "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident / 4.0 )" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv: 1.9.0.12 ) Gecko /2009070611 Firefox/3.5.12" Safari also reports the WebKit version number, but it seems to do so twice. Here's my own UA: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit / 531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.3 Safari/ 531.9.1 " In this case, it seems that one is just more detailed than the other. But when I look at databases of Safari UA strings, e.g. useragentstring.com , the two versions are often entirely different. "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/ 532+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.2 Safari/ 530.19.1 " "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; cs-CZ) AppleWebKit/ 525.28.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.3 Safari/ 525.29 " "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/ 530.19.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.2 Safari/ 530.19.1 " "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_4; en-us) AppleWebKit/ 528.4+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0dp1 Safari/ 526.11.2 " Etc. Which one do I use? It's not a major issue, but just wondering. Thanks!
