it is easy to compute a Monte Carlo approximation of the probability that a student belongs to the top 20% as follows. Simulate $M$ realizations of $X_1,…,X_N$ , sort each of them and construct a vector of binary variables $S_i$ taking the value of 1 when a realized test score is above the 80% quantile of the distribution of the realizations. The average over these $M$ binary variables is an estimate of the probability that a student is in the top 20% group. Denote this estimate as $π_i$ . When the $X_i$ 's are iid, the $S_i$ 's are iid and $\pi_i=.2$ for all $i$ 's.
