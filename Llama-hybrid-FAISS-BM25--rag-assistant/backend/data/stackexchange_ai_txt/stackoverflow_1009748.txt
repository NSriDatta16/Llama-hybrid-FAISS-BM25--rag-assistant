There are a few things that could be causing it. Here is one. Does your table have a primary key? It looks like you are trying to update the primary key to a value that already exists in the table before changing it. Is this happening on a form? If so Access can get upset at you for changing a recordset behind it's back. a me.undo() before making changes can help. Also if you are on a form you can acomplish the same thing this way. It's a bit hacky, but it is the easy way. DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSelectRecord DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNewRec DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdPaste As an alternative, I would recommend something along these lines. Dim sSql As String Dim sUpdateSuffix as string sUpdateSuffix="B2" Const sTableName As String = "[Tote Log] " sSql = "INSERT INTO "[Tote Log]([number],[whateverelse]) " & _ "SELECT [number]" & sUpdateSuffix & ",[whateverelse] FROM [Tote Log] WHERE Number = " & Me.tbScannerRead.Value CurrentProject.Connection.Execute sSql If you want to build the sql string dynamically use the same method as you already used to loop through the fields and build the query string. me.requery will rebuild the form recordset. Hope that helps you
