jQuery traversing problem

I have a potentially infinitely nested tree of ol > li given an li in the tree, i need to apply some function to all other li s below the given li , except within the current ol . As an example: for example: Do not apply to me Do not apply to me Do not apply to me Do not apply to me I am the "given" li Do not apply to me Do not apply to me Do not apply to me Do not apply to me Apply to me Apply to me Apply to me Apply to me Apply to me Apply to me What's the most elegant way to achieve this? Thanks
