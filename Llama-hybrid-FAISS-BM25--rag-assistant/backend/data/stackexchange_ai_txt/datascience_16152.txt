What is wrong with simply enumerating them? i.e. 0= apple, 1 = banana, 2 = orange? By definition of one hot encoding , only one of them may be set at a time. No need to jugle with bit encoding (i.e. power set) or prime encoding (bag-of-x). But thrmain question is how do you (plan to) use the data , not so much how you encode it. Sparse data can be stored compactly by compression and sparse formats (which pretty much reduces to above approach). But the storage must fit you access pattern or performance will be bad.
