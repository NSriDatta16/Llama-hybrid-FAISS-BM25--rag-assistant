Alternative methods: Any distance-based method - such as Single, Complete, Average Linkage of Hierarchical clustering or Partitioning Around Medoids clustering - can be used with an appropriate distance on binary sequences, such as Simple Matching or Jaccard. There is also a standard mixture model for such data that is usually called latent class model, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model . Clusters are modelled as subsets within which variables are independent ("local independence"). The R-package poLCA can do this. One could also use distances, run multidimensional scaling on them, and then run a GMM on the MDS output as is done in our R-package prabclus , function prabclust . There's also BayesLCA for Bayesian latent class analysis. I add that somebody once told me that despite originally being designed for continuous data, k-means can work well with binary sequences (if the dimension is not very low - not sure about very big). I think I've never tried it, but this person may be right and it could be worth a try. The prabclus -package has example data sets veronica and kykladspecreg , although both come without ground truth in the package. (I have something of a ground truth vector for veronica , and you can contact me off site about it, however these "true species" are not necessarily reliable.) poLCA also has example data sets, but I don't know whether these have ground truth information. Some general considerations regarding cluster benchmarking are here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10496 You may also think about generating artificial data with known truth for benchmarking.
