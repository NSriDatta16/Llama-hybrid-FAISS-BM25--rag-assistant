I would grab SQLite either in its pure or a .NET-friendly form (doing a Google search for 'sqlite .net' will give you a few options there). It's super-portable and, in my opinion, easier to set up and distribute than SQL Server compact. The important thing is to make sure you are not too tightly coupled to your persistence mechanism in your code, so in the future you could easily substitute any storage strategy you want.
