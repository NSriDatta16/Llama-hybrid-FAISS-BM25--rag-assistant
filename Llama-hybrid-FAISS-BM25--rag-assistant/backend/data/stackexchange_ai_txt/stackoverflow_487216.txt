Finding a free area in the stage

I'm drawing rectangles at random positions on the stage, and I don't want them to overlap. So for each rectangle, I need to find a blank area to place it. I've thought about trying a random position, verify if it is free with private function containsRect(r:Rectangle):Boolean { var free:Boolean = true; for (var i:int = 0; i and in case it returns false, to try with another random position. The problem is that if there is no free space, I'll be stuck trying random positions forever. There is an elegant solution to this?
