Probability and limits

I've been having some trouble with this story problem. Any help you could give me would be really appreciated. A store manager monitors the store's temperature by taking 4 independent temperature readings at 4 locations where, if the system is working correctly, the temp. is normally distributed with a mean of 68 degrees F and a standard deviation of 3 degrees. What's the mean and standard deviation of the average of these 4 readings if the system is working correctly? What upper and lower limits should the manager set for the average of these 4 readings for there to be a .01 probability of violating a limit when the system is working correctly? Thanks for any advice/help you can give me!
