I've found the solution to this issue... I'm using Rails 3 and my class looks like this (and the problematic methods was this too) class Organization ['is_company = ? ',true] select_choice = I18n.t("select") + " "+ I18n.t("segments.description") @organization_parents = [select_choice] for organization in @organizations @organization_parents I did have to hack a lot in the code to find out something was wrong with the named_scope on the line @organizations = self.find :all, :conditions => ['is_company = ? ',true] So I had to change it to something like this @organizations = Organization.where("is_company = ?",true) But it was wrong too.. So I decided to add an scope for this below the class name so the final code looks like this: class Organization So using this line with the scope @organizations = self.company it worked flawlessly in every part of the code. I was wondering if the named_scope is deprecated when using class methods or they are not supported from now and throws an error and not a warning before Thanks for your help Leo
