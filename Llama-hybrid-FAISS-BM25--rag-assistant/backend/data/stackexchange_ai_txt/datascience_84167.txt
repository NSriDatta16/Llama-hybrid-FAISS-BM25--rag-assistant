What is momentum in neural network?

While using "Two class neural network" in Azure ML, I encountered "Momentum" property. As per documentation , which is not clear, it says For The momentum, type a value to apply during learning as a weight on nodes from previous iterations. Although that is not very clear. Can someone please explain?
