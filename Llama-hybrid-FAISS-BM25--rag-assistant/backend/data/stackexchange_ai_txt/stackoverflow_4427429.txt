Once I had the same issue, and I solved it the same way as you did... I remember I found some topic about why that wasn't working. It was something about Apache's library implementation on the server side. Unfortunately I can't find that topic now, but if I were you I would just leave it working and wouldn't worry so much about the "elegance" of the code, cause probably there isn't much you can do, and if you can, it's not practical at all.
