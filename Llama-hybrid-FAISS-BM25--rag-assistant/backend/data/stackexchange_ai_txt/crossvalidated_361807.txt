As pointed out in the comments, smoothing will influence the model because it will tend to make the model's decisions more conservative (or, in Bayesian terms, the posterior predictive distribution will be pulled toward the prior implied by the smoothing). What this means in terms of "performance" of a model depends on how you define "performance" -- what problem are you trying to solve?
