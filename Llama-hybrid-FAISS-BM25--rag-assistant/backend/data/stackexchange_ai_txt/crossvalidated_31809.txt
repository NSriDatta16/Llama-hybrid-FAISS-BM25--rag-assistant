If you're using MSE as the usual measure of predictive accuracy in the data, then departures from normality are not going to hurt your predictions at all. A consideration, though, is whether high leverage / high influence points are affecting your estimates. Usually, a scatter plot of fitted values versus residuals can show this as residuals will not appear evenly spread around the 0 horizontal line. Another consideration is whether the linearity assumption doesn't hold and whether a slightly more advanced non-linear method such as smoothing splines or loess curves would give you better predictions. In using the loess, it will throw out highly influential points.
