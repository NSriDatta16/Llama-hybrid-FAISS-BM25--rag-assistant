Since you mention waiting times . Assume that $\alpha$ is an integer, and that $X_1$ is the time of occurrence of (equivalently, the waiting time for) the $\alpha$-th arrival after $t = 0$ in a Poisson process of rate $\lambda = \theta^{-1}$. Recall that in a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$, there are (on average) $\lambda$ arrivals in any time interval of unit length, and the average spacing between arrivals (average waiting time) is $\lambda^{-1} = \theta$. Furthermore, $X_1$ is a Gamma random variable with parameters $(\text{order}, \text{scale}) = (\alpha,\theta)$ and so its mean $E[X_1] = \alpha\theta$ is the average time of occurrence of the $\alpha$-th arrival. Next, define $X_2$ the time elapsed between the occurrence of the $\alpha$-th arrival and the $(2\alpha)$-th arrival, and more generally, $X_k$ as the time elapsed between the occurrence of the $((k-1)\alpha)$-th arrival and the $(k\alpha)$-th arrival. Then the $X_i$ are independent $Gamma$ random variables with parameters $(\text{order}, \text{scale}) = (\alpha,\theta)$. OK, with that as prologue, consider that $$Y_n = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$$ is the waiting time for the $(n\alpha)$-th arrival after $t=0$. Over this long period of time, a total of $(n\alpha)$ arrivals have occurred, and so $$Z_n = \frac{Y_n}{n} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}$$ is an estimate of the waiting time for $\alpha$ arrivals to occur, obtained by taking $n$ measurements over a long period of time and averaging the results; a method dear to the heart of every statistician. What you have determined is that as $n\to\infty$, the distribution of $Z_n$ converges to a degenerate random variable (called a constant by statistically illiterate folks) that takes on value $\alpha\theta$ with probability $1$. What this result is saying is that when $n$ is very large, $Y_n$, the waiting time for the occurrence of the $(n\alpha)$-th arrival will be approximately $n\alpha\theta$ while $Z_n$ will be very very close to $\alpha\theta$. Note the difference in wording here. $Y_n$ can have substantial deviations e.g. $O(\sqrt n)$) from the nominal value $n\alpha\theta$ which itself is increasing without bound as $n\to\infty$, but $Z_n$ will deviate from its nominal value only very slightly with the deviation being $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ which is getting smaller as $n \to \infty$.
