In order to calculate a CI for an "aggregated range" you will need to first be really clear on exactly what you mean by this ---i.e., what quantity are you seeking a CI for? There are many possible statistics that could be formed for the aggregate of all stores, so you need to specify which one you are interested in, and this will then lead you to a method for getting an appropriate CI. One commonly used quantity of interest (that would constitute an aggregation) is the mean number of customers over all stores, which would lead you to a CI that is very narrowly concentrated around the mean value averaged over the stores (or taking a weighted average of the stores). This is obviously not what you are interested in here. What you seem to be interested in here is the range of the expected number of customers at each store (i.e., the interval from the minimum expected number of customers at a store to the maximum expected number of customers at a store). The CI for this would not necessarily be given by taking the endpoints of the two most extreme CIs, so you would need to look further into how to form this CI. This is not a well-established method, mostly because this is not a very useful thing to know. There is a huge loss of information in going from your initial plot showing all the individual CIs to going down to your final aggregated CI range (even assuming that this were corrected to use proper methods) and the latter does not really tell you much of interest. In my view, there is little reason to try to get an "aggregation" of this kind rather than just presenting the plot showing the estimates/CIs for each individual store. It might be useful to add an overall CI for the mean number of customers aggregated over all stores, but that would be all.
