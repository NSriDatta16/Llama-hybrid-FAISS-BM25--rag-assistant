In both scenarios, we pick one or more performance measures and validate the model based on them. In classification, one may choose to use accuracy , precision , recall , or F-score . In regression, other metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) , Mean Absolute Error (MAE) , and R Squared Score (R^2) might be useful. In regression/classification problems that the order of data points matters (eg time series), we cannot use conventional cross-validation. Instead, some special variations of cross-validation procedure must be used to make sure we do not train our model on the current samples and validate on past instances. p.s. In regression problems, the labels do not need to be "continuous" (as we define in the continuity of a function in calculus). They can be discrete but real-valued.
