Effect of event on average probabilities given different base rates

I am trying to solve the following question with my very rusty stats expertise: I have a data set of people of which some do exercise with different frequencies per month and other don’t exercise at all (base rates of exercise). My data contains all the dates when each person did exercise. At some known point (or multiple times) some people go to a physio/doctor and get told to do exercise – this event is independent if they do exercise by themselves anyway. Some of the people who were told to exercise, do exercise in the week after the visit. I would like to calculate the impact the visit to physio/doc has on exercise the week after a visit. I was thinking of increase of average probability of exercise the week after the visit, but I am flexible to use other sensible measures.
