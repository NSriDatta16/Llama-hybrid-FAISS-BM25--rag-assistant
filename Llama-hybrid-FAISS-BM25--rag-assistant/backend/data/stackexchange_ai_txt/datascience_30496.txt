What are the individual models within a machine learning ensemble called?

I am aware that an ensemble machine learning model is a stack of two or more machine learning models. Is there a word to refer to those individual models that go into the ensemble model? (i.e. a specific term/jargon?) I wish to refer to them and am not aware of any specific terminology to describe them. I've considered: "sub-models" "component models" even "pancake models" (since people generally understand what's being referring to when they hear 'one of the pancakes in the model')
