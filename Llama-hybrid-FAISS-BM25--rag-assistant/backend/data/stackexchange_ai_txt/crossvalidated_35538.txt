Yes, you are fine; Christopher Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" is an excellent book for general reference, you can't really go wrong with it. A fairly recent book but also very well-written and equally broad is David Barber's " Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning "; a book I would feel is slightly more suitable for a new-comer in the field. I have used "The Elements of Statistical Learning" from Hastie et al. (mentioned by Macro) and while a very strong book I would not recommended it as a first reference; maybe it would serve you better as a second reference for more specialized topics. In that aspect, David MacKay's book, Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms , can also do a splendid job.
