Eclipse IDE is an open-source IDE platform written mostly in Java and primarily used for Java development through the use of the Java Development Tools (JDT) plug-ins. It is notable for its rich ecosystem of free and commercial plugins and that it is predominantly itself composed of plug-ins. Eclipse IDE is built on an OSGI implementation called Equinox; the same OSGI -based framework is used for managing its plug-ins at runtime. Eclipse can also be used as a development environment for non-IDE GUI applications, leveraging many of the same plug-ins as the IDE to form a more general Rich Client Platform, called Eclipse RCP. For C/C++ development, the Eclipse CDT Project provides plug-ins to create a C/C++ development environment within Eclipse IDE. The Eclipse Web Tools Platform project supplies plug-ins for developing Open web standards-based and Java web applications, and frameworks for building higher-level web tools. For PHP development, the Eclipse PDT Project provides a plugin to create a PHP development environment within Eclipse IDE, building on features of the Web Tools Platform. The popular commercial Zend Studio is also based on Eclipse IDE. For Python development, PyDev provides plug-ins, called PyDev, to create a Python development environment within Eclipse IDE. For Perl development, the EPIC project provides a plugin to create a Perl development environment within Eclipse IDE. Note that Google has ceased developing the Android Development Tools in favor of another solution. When combined with Cygwin (or MinGW), Mono, and its many plugins, Eclipse IDE provides a crucial part of viable open-source alternatives to using Microsoft Visual-Studio as a Windows software development platform in Windows, whilst also including comprehensive native support for Java.

Consider what changes your question would require if you were using vi to edit and ant to build; if your question would remain unchanged, then it is not an Eclipse question, so you should not give your question the eclipse tag. Use the java tag instead.
