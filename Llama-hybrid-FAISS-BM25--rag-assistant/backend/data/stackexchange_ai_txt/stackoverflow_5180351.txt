As far as I know, no, but as aioobe answered, you can use templates for it. Instead of that keyboard combo, you'd instead type something like par Ctrl + Space to get Eclipse's autosuggest for creating an paragraph open / close tag (with the cursor in the middle). This'll either display a dropdown if Eclipse is unsure, or just chuck your template down if it has no doubts. Note also that, when editing HTML files (or anything XML~like), you can get Eclipse to auto-close tags, so typing will automatically add a closing tag too. This might of course be a bit trickier due to the Shift + keyboard combo's (depending on your finger's agility and, possibly, keyboard configuration). I have no trouble with it though.
