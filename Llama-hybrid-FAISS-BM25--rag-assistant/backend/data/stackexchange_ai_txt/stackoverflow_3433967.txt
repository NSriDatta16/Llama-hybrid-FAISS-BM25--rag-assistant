adding a node to a nodeQueue on creation

How can I automatically add a node to a specific nodeQueue when this is created (I'm using nodeQueue module: http://drupal.org/project/nodequeue ). The reason is that I want an sortable (by dragging the nodes) list of the nodes and I want them to be automatically added to it.. thanks
