With a minute processing time your dataset doesn't sound large enough to require partitioning of the result set. So with that assumed, loading it all into memory would be fine. However, mysql caches the query anyway, so successive duplicate queries shouldn't be a large issue either. It does sound like IO write to file on disk is your slow point. I don't know much about how styles and formating works for xls files but I'm pretty sure you could reduce a lot of pointless writes by reducing formatting or organizing it so that you are not doing any in-line formating, if thats even possible. The best thing I would advise is optimizing your query. That is usually the first optimizing place I look with this type of issue. If you could edit your post and include the sql I could have a look.
