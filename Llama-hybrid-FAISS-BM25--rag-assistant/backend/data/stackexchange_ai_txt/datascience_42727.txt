How to benefit Data augmentation when it yields to different classes

I'm trying to classify rooftop sky images orientations, whether it is horizontal or vertical. Knowing that the most obvious feature here is known: orientation. I can simply augment each class by rotating it 90Â° so it belongs to the other class. It is like dynamic augmentation to different classes. Using keras image classification capabilities, obviously defeats the purpose: datagen = ImageDataGenerator( zoom_range=0.2, # randomly zoom into images # rotation_range=90, # mistaken the model horizontal_flip=True, # randomly flip images vertical_flip=False) # randomly flip images I am using keras for classification but open to other libraries, and techniques other than deep learning.
