Usually in these cases it pays to customize the data format for the device. For example depending on the restrictions you face in terms of network or storage size, you can go for streaming compression or prefer full compression. Also the type of data you want to store is a big factor. If really your biggest problem is ease of parsing you should go for xml, but on an embedded device ease of parsing is usually much less of a concern compared to transfer speed, storage size and cpu consumption. JSON and YAML, much like XML are primarily focussed on parsing ease first and foremost. Protobuf might squeeze in there, binary packing is what people usually do. Encryption and compression you should rather do on the transport level, although functionally you should aim to put as little information as possible in a message. I know I'm not giving you a clear cut answer, but I think there is no such thing to such a generic question.
