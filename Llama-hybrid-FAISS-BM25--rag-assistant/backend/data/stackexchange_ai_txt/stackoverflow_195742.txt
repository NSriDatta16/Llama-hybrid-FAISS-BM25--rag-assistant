I can't connect to my server over the internet

I can run the server on my local machine and connect to it on the same machine, but when I try to connect to it from a different computer over the internet, there is not sign of activity on my server, nor a response from the server on the computer I'm testing it on. I've tried both XP and Vista, turn off firewalls, opened ports, ran as admin; nothing is working. :( Here is my code that I'm using to accept an incoming connection: int port = 3326; Socket socket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp); try { TcpListener listener = new TcpListener(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, port)); listener.Start(); Console.WriteLine("Server established\nListening on Port: {0}\n", port); while (true) { socket = listener.AcceptSocket(); socket.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.SendTimeout, outime); socket.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.KeepAlive, true); socket.DontFragment = true; NewConnection pxy = new NewConnection(socket); Thread client = new Thread(new ThreadStart(pxy.Start)); client.IsBackground = true; client.Start(); } }
