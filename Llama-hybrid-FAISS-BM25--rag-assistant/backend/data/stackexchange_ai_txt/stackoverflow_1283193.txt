(disclosure: I'm the author) Once you have everything sorted as described above, you could take the next step and use Devel::CoverX::Covered to e.g. Given a source file, list the test files that provide coverage to that source file. This can be done on a file, sub routine and row level. Given a test file, list the source files and subs covered by that test file. Given a source file, report efficiently on the coverage details per row, or sub. See the synopsis for concrete command line examples. In Devel::PerlySense there's Emacs support to display the coverage information in the source code buffer ( screen shot ), and to navigate to/from covering test files.
