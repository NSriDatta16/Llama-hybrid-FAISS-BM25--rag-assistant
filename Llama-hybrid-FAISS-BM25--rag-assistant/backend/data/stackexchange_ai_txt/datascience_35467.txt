Predicting a random variable Y will increase within n minutes if random variable X increases

I am starting to learn machine learning and I would like advice of how to model that random measure Y will increase within n minutes if random measure X increases. X and Y have different units (GBP and USD) so I am using returns (percentage change) to make them the same unit. My data looks like this Time, X, Y 00:00, 1%, 0% 00:01, 0%, 1% 00:02, 2%, 0% 00:03, 0%, 2% Just from observing this data you can see that Y increases after one second after X increases but not sure the best way how to model this!
