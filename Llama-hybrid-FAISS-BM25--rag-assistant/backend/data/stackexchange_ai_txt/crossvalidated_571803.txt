Well that's what statistics is about, right? All those variables you mentioned are unobserved and can impact the outcome, therefore we choose to encode this uncertainty about the problem as probabilities. If you have no data, there is no way to answer the problem especially when probabilities are interpreted as relative frequencies. If you interpret probabilities as uncertainty about the problem as Bayesians do, then you can make a statistical conclusion based on that. For example in the absence of knowledge, you might assume that $Pr(tree) = 0.5$ which serves as your prior beliefs. Then whatever data you do observe, you update these beliefs and end up with some posterior beliefs. Obviously the more data you observe the better your estimates will be.
