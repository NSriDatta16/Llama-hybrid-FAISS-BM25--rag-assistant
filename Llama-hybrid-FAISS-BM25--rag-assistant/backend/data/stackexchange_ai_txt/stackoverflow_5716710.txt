create control dynamically vs drag and drop

Are there any differences as far as performance, memory usage, etc. between creating controls (picturebox, button, textbox, etc.) by drag and drop into the form vs created it dynamically in code for ASP.NET in C# or C++? Which method is preferred by the pro?
