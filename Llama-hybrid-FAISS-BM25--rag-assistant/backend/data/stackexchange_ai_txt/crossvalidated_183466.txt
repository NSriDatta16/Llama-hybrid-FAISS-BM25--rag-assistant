Your expanded dataset still has only $N = 15$ observations, so @NickCox's point still applies. The rule of thumb I've heard for logistic regression is that you should have $15$ of the less frequent outcome for each variable to avoid a model that approaches saturation. (That is, a minimum $N = 30$ to support a single variable when your response is perfectly $50\%-50\%$.) This contrasts with the rule of thumb for linear regression where you need $10$ data per variable. Something to bear in mind here is that there is little information in a binary data point. You have enough data to estimate the marginal proportion, but not enough to add a single predictor variable to your model. Stepwise variable selection is generally not a good thing to do. (It may help you to read my answer here: Algorithms for automatic model selection .) You have tried to mitigate against those problems by using cross validation. That is certainly an improvement. But it is nonetheless possibly valid only for out of sample predictive accuracy (and your model is almost certainly overfit even for that). You cannot use or interpret p-values after stepwise variable selection. You do have separation in your dataset, albeit not in any single variable. There are several hints that this is the case: the number of Fisher scoring iterations is 24 , a very high number (4-5 is typical); also your coefficient estimates are large with huge standard errors. Here are some bivariate scatterplots of some of your predictor variables with the responses marked by color and symbol, and the separation marked with a dashed gray line: The separation is the single biggest cause of your high p-values. (Stepwise selection makes p-values invalid, but will make them too low .) Consider—even with insufficient data—you get standard errors that are on the order of $10^0$ (not $10^5$), just 5 Fisher scoring iterations, and lower p-values using only WDR66_rna and HAVCR2_rna (which overlap a good deal): summary(glm(response~WDR66_rna+HAVCR2_rna, d, family=binomial)) # ... # Coefficients: # Estimate Std.
