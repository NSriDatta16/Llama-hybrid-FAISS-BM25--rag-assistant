Need info on Excel and VBA string processing and storage limits -- and suggested workarounds

According to this Microsoft blog post the max string length per cell is 32k for MS Office 2010; I've also confirmed this via testing. Problem is that I've got strings (DNA sequences) that are well above that length, and I'm matching sub-sequences of DNA on the whole 32k+ sequence that could match anywhere on the main sequence; meaning that I can not simple break the main sequence out into 32k chucks, since I need to be able to string match the "sub-string-sequence" to the entire "main-string-sequence". One thing that is not clear is if VBA supports processing of strings large than 32k, if VBA supports string concatenation in excess of 32k that might be a work around; meaning I chunk the "main-string-sequence" into 32k chunks on a row to the N-th column, then when I need to process a match just concatenate the strings in a row from column 1 to the N-th, process the match, then dump the temp "main-string-sequence" being stored in VBA. So, basically the issue is MS-Office 2010 only supports strings per cell up to 32k in length, and I've got strings that are much larger than that which need to be processed in whole form in order for the string matching to work.
