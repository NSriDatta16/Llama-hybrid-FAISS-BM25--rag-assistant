You can't and you shouldn't. You are not dealing with the real world guys, but with accounts, so treat them as abstract entities which have the equal rights to live. Some options I can imagine on the fly: -- Only one account for email address. But I can create more then one email... or use Mailinator. -- Long and tedious verification procedure. But that will discourage the users from registration -- bind the IP to the account and block(temporarily?) that IP from creation of another account. But two different users with the same gateway will be blocked... -- Use the cookies. But the user can delete them.
