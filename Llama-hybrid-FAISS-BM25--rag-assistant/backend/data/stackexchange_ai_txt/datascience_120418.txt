Pattern Matching You can explicitly give Spacy patterns to use. It turns out that identifying phone numbers in text is one of the examples they give in their documents. From the docs: import spacy from spacy.matcher import Matcher nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab) pattern = [{"ORTH": "("}, {"SHAPE": "ddd"}, {"ORTH": ")"}, {"SHAPE": "ddd"}, {"ORTH": "-", "OP": "?"}, {"SHAPE": "ddd"}] matcher.add("PHONE_NUMBER", [pattern]) doc = nlp("Call me at (123) 456 789 or (123) 456 789!") print([t.text for t in doc]) matches = matcher(doc) for match_id, start, end in matches: span = doc[start:end] print(span.text) Note that you'll have to give all the possible formats that you want to cover in the spacy format. Potential formats include: x(xxx) xxx-xxxx xx xxx xxx xxxx (xxx) xxx.xxxx xxx-xxx-xxxx xx xxx xxx xx xx etc.
