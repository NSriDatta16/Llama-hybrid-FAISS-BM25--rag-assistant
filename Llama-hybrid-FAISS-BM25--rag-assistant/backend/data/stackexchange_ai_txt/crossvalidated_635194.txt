Should You Simulate the Effect of Confounders on Other Confounders to Test an Estimator?

Imagine that I am trying to simulate a data generating process where I make the following assumption about $Y$ : $Y$ = $X$ (0.15) + $Z_1$ (0.23) + $Z_2$ (0.08) + $Z_3$ (0.19) + $Z_4$ (0.05) + Error Also, consider that I am interested in several estimators and I am trying to find which estimator recovers the defined treatment effect of 0.15 the best. However, $X$ is confounded by several variables, so I adjust for them accordingly. What I understand well is that, for variables that I assume to be confounders, I need to simulate effect sizes for each confounder on the treatment and outcome. For example, if $Z_1$ has an effect of 0.23 on $Y$ , I would also need to simulate an effect of say, 0.04 on $X$ , otherwise, it would not be a confounder. However, in more complex data generating processes, the confounders may impact the value of other confounders themselves. That is, it may be inappropriate to define each confounder as a distribution completely exogenous to the other confounders of interest. For example, rather than saying that $Z_1$ is just a normally distributed variable with a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$ , I may also say that $Z_2$ has an effect of 0.33 on $Z_1$ and that $Z_3$ has an effect of 0.07 on $Z_1$ . For the goal of this hypothetical simulation (testing different estimators to see which recovers the treatment effect the best), is it necessary to define the effect that each confounder has on the other? Or, as long as I specify the effect that each confounder has on the outcome and treatment, is the simulation analysis good to go? On the one hand, I see benefits in fully detailing the assumed data generating process for all variables in the system. However, on the other hand, I see problems with me embedding further assumptions into the analysis for effect sizes that are not of interest (i.e. I would have no actual interest in knowing/pondering how $Z_3$ might impact $Z_1$ , $Z_2$ , $Z_4$ , etc.).
