Preface: There is another initial issue here, which is that your outcome looks like a continuous-style measure expressed as a proportion rather than a truly categorical outcome per se. So it may be that you can analyse these data treating the outcome as continuous, for example using a linear mixed model with a linear link: for estimating differences in means it seems unlikely that you'd be pushing the assumptions of such a model. I have addressed the question as written about estimating ratios from below. Main answer: For categorical outcomes, the answer is yes, you can take a logistic regression model and calculate absolute marginal differences (as you have here using emmeans ) or relative marginal differences (the ratio of the two proportions). Calculating these ratios (where sensible) might be possible using emmeans , but the package marginaleffects in my opinion wraps up some of these marginal estimation methods a bit more succinctly. The function in question is comparisons , and you can request ratio-type estimates using the comparison = "ratioavg" option. https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/ https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/comparisons.html Addendum on emmeans There is some discussion of how this can be achieved in emmeans on the GitHub issues tracking page as follows: https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans/issues/48
