I would do it in two steps. First a oneway anova to check whether there are any significant differences between the individuals at all: fit If the anova is not significant then the differences between individuals are no larger than measurement to measurement variation on the same individual, so there is no point in proceeding further. If the anova is significant, then compute average temperature per individual and perform a linear regression to explore whether the between-individual differences can be explained by age.
