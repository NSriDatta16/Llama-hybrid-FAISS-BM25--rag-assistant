How do you quantify the success of a billboard?

For example if an internet company puts up a billboard for 3 weeks in a city with the words "Try our product". How do we statistically quantify this ad worked? Let's use website traffic as our metric. My thought was to use a 1 sample t-test of the website traffic during the billboard campaign against the regional website traffic average. I wondering if this satisfies the assumptions for a 1 sample t-test, and if there are other ways to quantify the success of billboard (ex. measuring affects later on).
