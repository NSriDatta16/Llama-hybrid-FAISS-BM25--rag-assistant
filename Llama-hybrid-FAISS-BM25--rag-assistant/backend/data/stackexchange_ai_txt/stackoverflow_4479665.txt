This is way too vague. Notation changes between papers and different approaches. Generally speaking that formula is doing some averaging within a neighbouring set of the i,j point (defined by the points in \Omega_{ij}) w is some normalization constant and f(m,n) is some function which typically assigns a value to m,n proportional to its distance from i,j As I said your question is a bit too vague to say anything else...
