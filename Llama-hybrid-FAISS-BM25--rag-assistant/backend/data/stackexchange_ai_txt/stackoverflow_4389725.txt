As others have said, variables of static storage duration are always initialized. If you don't provide an explicit initializer, they're initialized to zero. If you want to be able to reset them all to zero as a group later using memset , you need to put them all in a struct . Otherwise their locations are independent. Keep in mind that from a standards perspective, memset to zero is not required to be the same thing as zero-initialization. It's allowed for null pointers and floating point zero values to have representations other than all-zero-bits. In practice, this is an idiotic liberty the standard gives implementations and you will never encounter such implementations in the modern world, so I would ignore the (non-)issue.
