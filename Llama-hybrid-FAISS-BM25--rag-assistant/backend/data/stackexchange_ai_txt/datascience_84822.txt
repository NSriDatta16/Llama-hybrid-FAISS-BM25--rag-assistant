(1) For the sake of keeping it short in your case: yes 0.1 is bad. To avoid philosophical discussions let's just assume you have to get this higher. (2) It definitely makes sense since your dataset is highly imbalanced. Do not expect to have one metric where you fail miserably and on the other one, you succeed. That's not how it works, they are most often correlated. (3) This is a very General Question. Do more machine learning. But here are some propositions worth exploring: up-sampling, more complex models (lgbm, nn), feature Engineering (understand your data!), Analyse the failed predictions here you can see what you need to improve etc... Finally, I just want to make it clear that not everything can be modeled. Maybe from your dataset you cant make this conclusion. This is for you to decide when you exhausted all of the possible potential solutions.
