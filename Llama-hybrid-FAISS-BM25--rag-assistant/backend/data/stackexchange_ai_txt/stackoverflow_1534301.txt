securing sessions

I know SO isn't traditionally used this way (or maybe it is), but I've been learning about webapp security and was thinking it would be nice and encouraging to hear from SO experts what they think of this article (I'm reading it now, it's on session security). http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/how-to-create-bulletproof-sessions/ Maybe we can have a discussion of some kind, point out what the author misstated/forgot and what better practices are there? For example when it comes to a different security topic like sql injections, many people recommend things like mysql_real_escape_strings, but the experts will tell you that nothing beats prepared statements. From the comments, this article seems to have its problems, so I'm wondering how far on the good or bad side his content is.
