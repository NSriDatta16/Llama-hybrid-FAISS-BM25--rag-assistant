iOS, Windows and Android should not be viewed as strings but as categories . Categories should be one-hot encoded, and should not share the same input as they are not related to each other. So let's assume we work with two operating systems: iOS and Windows. So for iOS, input is: 1 0 and for Windows input is: 0 1 . But now we want to add another OS: Android. iOS becomes: 1 0 0 , Windows 0 1 0 , Android: 0 0 1 . Note that by adding android, you do not actually change the input! You only add an extra 0 for iOS and Windows, and 0's don't get computed in neural networks 0*weight = 0 . So by adding an OS, you do not affect what the network has learned for the previously trained OS's.
