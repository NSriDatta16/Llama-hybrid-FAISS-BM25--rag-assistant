Models like logistic regression , or Naive Bayes algorithm, predict the probabilities of observing some outcomes. In standard binary regression scenario the models give you probability of observing the "success" category. In multinomial case, the models return probabilities of observing each of the outcomes. Log probabilities are simply natural logarithms of the predicted probabilities.
