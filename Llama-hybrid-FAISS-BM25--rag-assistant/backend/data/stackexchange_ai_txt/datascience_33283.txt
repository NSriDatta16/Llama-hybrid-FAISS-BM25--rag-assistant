How can I minimize features of the trainded model?

I have real technological process, that explained with complex model (xgboost). I.e. current mass of a product (y) depends on current temperature (x1), pressure (x2) and so on. I would like to solve optimization task: which minimal values of the features can be selected, that mass of a product can reach the maximum? It looks like simple optimization task: ||y-y0||^2 where y - equation of the model process and y0 - maximum or some of the closest to maximum values. But it is impossible to get weighted coefficients of the xgboost, so I can`t use skopt and even if I can get the coefficients, the real equation will be very difficult. Only decision that I have right now is sort out all possible values for all possible features, make predictions for this features and choose optimal, if y will reach maximum or close to it. Could you give an advice, how can I solve this problem?
