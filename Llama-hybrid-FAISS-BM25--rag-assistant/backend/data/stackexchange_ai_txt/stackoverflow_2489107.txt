Unless you're expecting a lot of duplicates, on average you're not going to compare many pixels before determining that 2 files are different. Especially if each pixel you test is located far from pixels already tested. This will help with e.g. line art files that have the same background color. Also, how accurate do you have to be? For example, if 10 pixels tested in this way are the same, can you safely conclude that the images are identical? 10 RGB pixels = 240 bits, so the false match rate with random images should be 1 in 2^240 = 1 in 10^72!
