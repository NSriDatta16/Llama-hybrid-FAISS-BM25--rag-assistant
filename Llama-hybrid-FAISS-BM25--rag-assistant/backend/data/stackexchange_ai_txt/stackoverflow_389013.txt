Certian kinds of math I think are indispensible. For instance, every software engineer should know and understand De Morgan's laws , and O notation . Other kinds are just very useful. In simulation we often have to do a lot of physics modeling. If you are doing graphics work, you will often find yourself needing to write coordinate transformation algorithms. I've had many other situations in my 20 year career where I needed to write up and solve simultanious linear equations to figure out what constants to put into an algorithm.
