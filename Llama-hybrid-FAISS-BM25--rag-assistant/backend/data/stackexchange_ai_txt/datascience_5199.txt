What is a good hardware setup for using Python across multiple users

This question is likely somewhat naive. I know I (and my colleagues) can install and use Python on local machines. But is that really a best practice? I have no idea. Is there value in setting up a Python "server"? A box on the network where we develop our data science related Python code. If so, what are the hardware requirements for such a box? Do I need to be concerned about any specific packages or conflicts between projects?
