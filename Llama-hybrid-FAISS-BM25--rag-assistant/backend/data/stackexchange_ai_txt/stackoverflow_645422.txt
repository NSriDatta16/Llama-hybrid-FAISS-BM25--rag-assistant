MySQL for ToDo lists?

I regularly have lists such as "To-do" and "Done-works". It would be useful if it worked something like: mysql add-to-column-in-table "Blog corrected" mysql read-column-in-table-where-match-blog "Blog" Can I use MySQL for the job? Are you using it for day-to-day things? [Clarification] I need to organize my things to tables. I have over thirty dirrerent To-Do lists alone. They have different relations to other lists. They are cumbersome to organise, and some lists tend to get old. A reason for the question is that I am unsure of the configuration on Ubuntu. There are too many mysql-files, such as "mysql-admin" and "mysql-common". I need some simple package that is easy-to-use and easy-to-get-started. It should work only locally.
