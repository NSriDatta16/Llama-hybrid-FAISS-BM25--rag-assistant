Is it possible to give a single Odds Ratio for two independent variables?

I have been asked by co-authors on a paper to fill in the Odds Ratios marked as (?) in a table like the one below. Country of origin Land A (Odds Ratio) Land B (Odds Ratio) Number of people who meet the outcome of interest 12 (?) 4 (?) Median age 33 (?) 28 (?) Number of males 16 (?) 14 (?) Number of females 17 (?) 14 (?) Would you need to run a multivariate logistic regression to obtain an OR while considering both independent variables (Land A = Yes, Male = Yes) in relation to the dependent variable (Outcome of interest = Yes)? Or am I on the wrong track entirely? Intuitively I feel like this isn't right somehow.
