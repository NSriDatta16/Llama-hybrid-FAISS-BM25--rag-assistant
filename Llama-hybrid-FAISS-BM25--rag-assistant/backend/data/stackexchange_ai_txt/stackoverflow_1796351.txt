Flex AIR Sqlite as embedded database

I am devloping an editor with spell check feature in Flex + AIR using Sqlite as an embedded database. In database I have a table with the words. The table contains lacs of words. I have written the code to search for the word in table. I have used the sync method for all this. This pauses my application while searching. I would like to use async method to stop application pause. The code for Search word is as follows: public function searchInDictionary(word:String):Boolean { if(word == "") return true; connection= new SQLConnection(); var query:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement(); query.sqlConnection = connection; query.text = 'SELECT id FROM tbl_'+ CommonLanguageCode +' WHERE word LIKE "'+word+'"'; try { connection.open( dbfile,SQLMode.READ ); } catch(ex:Error) {} if(!connection.connected) connection.open( dbfile ); query.execute(); var result:SQLResult = query.getResult(); if( result.data == null ) { return false; } else { var numRows:uint = result.data.length; var id:String; if(numRows>0) return true; return false; } return false; } If this function returns false(word not found) then i have to call the function to to red underline that word. Please suggest me if I am going wrong. As I am using Sync method & it takes some milli seconds to search a word. & if I am wrting a paragraph then it makes my application sluggish. Is there any other way I can store the words & search more fastly. If yes then please et me know. Thanks in advance.
