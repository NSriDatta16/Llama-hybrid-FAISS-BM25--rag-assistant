My suggestion is that you consider approach than ARIMA if necessary, which is typically used for forecasting. Anomaly detection appears to be the goal here. There are several options available in R and SAS (where I have experience). You didn't mention a particular language or software so I won't comment on all the ones I'm aware of for now, though I will show one example below. Time series anomaly detection will use a time series forecasting framework to detect outliers-- you might even find one in your software that uses ARIMA as its base, in which case you could get away with not explaining a different method. You need a method that does both time-series anomaly detection and can include regressors. I like using tsoutliers in R. Using the built-in R dataset LakeHuron, there's a one line call to produce a plot showing the presence, magnitude and type of outliers (level shifts, temporary pulses, outliers): plot(tsoutliers::tso(LakeHuron)) . The tso function accomodates regressors as well. Perhaps most importantly for you, "The original framework is based on ARIMA time series models" (direct quote from the documentation). SAS example, per request. I no longer have SAS so I can only talk about it more generally. I have done this previously with PROC UCM (Unobserved Component Models), so this is not an ARIMA based approach. It is probably possible to get something out of PROC ARIMA. PROC UCM includes many statements-- it can be quite complex. There's no automatic optimisation, unlike R, so you will need to specify the appropriate components for the model (such as trend, level, season). The Model and RANDOMREG statements allow you to include regressors. One of the optional statements is OUTLIER. This allows you to set the threshold for outlier detection and will output the outliers that are identified. You can use ODS tables to output this to a data set.
