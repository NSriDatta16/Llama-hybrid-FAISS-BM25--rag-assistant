Saving element position and size (JQuery ui resizable and draggable)

I'm new to jquery and even javascript. I'm trying to create a system where you can edit very simple, static page by logging in and just dragging and resizing divs. The system works to the point where you get to edit the site, but the problem is how to save the coordinates and sizes of the divs. The system doesn't use mysql, since the login is just for the site author. I'd also like to try to not require javascript to just view the page (get the coordinates and sizes from a file via php). So, basically I need a way to check div width, height, left and top and store them into a file when the author hits the save-button.
