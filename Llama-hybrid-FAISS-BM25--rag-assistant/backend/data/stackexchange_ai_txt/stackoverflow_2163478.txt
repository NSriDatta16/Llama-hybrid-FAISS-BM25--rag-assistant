Calculating a polygon's center of mass: Simplify your body into a polygon, and find its centroid , because ( quoting wikipedia ): If an object has uniform density then its center of mass is the same as the centroid of its shape. This approach is faster if there are lots of particles, uniformly distributed within the polygon. Calculating the mean location of all particles: If you're having n particles, calculate the mean of their X and Y coordinates; That's the center of mass. Quoting wikipedia again : The center of mass of a system of particles is defined as the average of their positions, weighted by their masses: Your particles have the same mass, so your denominator equals n . The code in @tkerwin's answer calculates that fraction. This approach works well if you don't have too many particles. Edit: Probabilistic calculation: If you have too many points to efficiently calculate their mean location, try picking up some random points. Calculating their mean location would give you an excellent approximation of the entire mean. The more points you pick, the better is your approximation - according to the Law Of Large Numbers .
