Does the predict function in machine learning understand categorical data

I understand that before feature engineering one has to split the dataset into train and test data, so as to avoid bias in the analysis. I also understand that the machine learning model does not understand data apart from numerical data, thus encoding is required, which is a part of feature engineering. My question is, do I encode the test data separately or does the prediction function understand categorical data.
