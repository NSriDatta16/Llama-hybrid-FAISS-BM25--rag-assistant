There are various methods to handle words like usage of UNK, Char encoding, Subword encoding, Byte pair encoding. Let's see how to use each of them in following code snippets. Replace with UNK : To use this just add UNK or unknown word inside your vocab i.e. words list. Whenever you want to come across unrecognized word replace with UNK or unknown id. e.g. text = [word2idx.get(w, word2idx.get('UNK')) for w in text] Subword encoding : It is little different than word2vec and glove which considers word as a smallest entity but algorithms like Fasttext brakes down rare word into sub words to calculate it's vector based on Skipgram and CBOW. e.g. Check fasttext python implementation and play with it to get idea Byte pair encoding : BPE is slightly modified in its implementation such that the frequently occurring subword pairs are merged together instead of being replaced by another byte to enable compression. BPE is slightly modified in its implementation such that the frequently occurring subword pairs are merged together instead of being replaced by another byte to enable compression. e.g. Check huggingface library for it's implementation as Transformers uses BPE.
