The way you have your model set up (which are usually intended to reflect the causality in these setups), it looks like it's $x_1$ that has an implicit and explicit effect on $z$, not $x_2$ ($x_1$ affects $x_2$ which affects $z$, and $x_1$ also has a direct effect on $z$). $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$ As for how to tackle it, you want wish to look at the mediation methods (especially post Baron-Kenny) and at partial least squares and path models more generally; there's been a lot of work in recent years on Bayesian causal DAG models. If you stick with the simultaneous equations approach, you at least want to be clear about which way your causation is intended to go.
