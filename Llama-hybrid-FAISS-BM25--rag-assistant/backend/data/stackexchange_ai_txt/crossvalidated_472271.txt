Target Score and Target Odds in Credit Scorecard development

I am working on building a Credit Scorecard model. Till now I have performed the following steps: Data preparation and cleansing Calculate WOE and IV values Model Fitting Now I working on calculating scores for each variable. For this, I need to know 'Target Score', 'Target Odds', and 'pdo'. How these 3 variables are calculated? I have gone through some article but everywhere they assume some Target Score and other variables. One of the article link : Before this standard approach, I did the following: Data cleansing, transformation(select transformation with best predictive power), and stepwise logistic regression. Use the variables selected by the stepwise model and build the final model on it. I have a couple of question from this: Which is the best way out of the above 2 approaches? What if the variables selected based on IV and stepwise are different? Is it right to compare both the approaches? Thanks
