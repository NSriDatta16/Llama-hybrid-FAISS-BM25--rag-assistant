Yes of course: unsupervised means that it doesn't learn from the labels, but you can use those labels to see if your unsupervised algorithm work well or not. In your case, I would recommend dimensional reduction algorithms. PCA is a good option, but you will have better results with non linear ones like t-SNE or UMAP.
