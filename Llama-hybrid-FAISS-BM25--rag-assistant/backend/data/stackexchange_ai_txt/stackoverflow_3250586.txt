Making this parallel would be a bad idea unless you're running on a SSD. The limiting factor is going to be the disk IO--and if you run two threads the head is going to be jumping back and forth between the two areas being read. This will slow it down a lot more than any possible speedup from parallelization. Remember that drives are MECHANICAL devices and insanely slow compared to the processor. If you can do a million instructions in order to avoid a single head seek you will still come out ahead. Also, once the file is on disk make sure to defrag the disk to ensure it's in one contiguous block.
