Assuming that your question is how to convert the file formats, please describe your source. Do you only have an SWF file? Or do you have an SWF video player which is playing a video in a separate format (like FLV, F4V, MP4, etc.)? If your video is in a separate file (FLV, etc), then most any application that converts video formats should do the trick. If you have both a video file (FLV..) plus a SWF file, the SWF probably just contains a player (i.e. play/pause buttons, etc.), and you can probably ignore it and just convert the video. (Also note that for some formats, like MP4, depending on the codec the video may already playable in Quicktime! If you have a separate video file try dragging it into QT to check if it plays before worrying about converting.) If you have only a SWF, however, then not all apps will convert for you. In general, SWFs can be interactive, and they don't have any particular "length", so some applications will convert a SWF into other formats, but in actuality they're playing the SWF and capturing the output and encoding it into a new video. (And note that this will not work well if the SWF has any interactivity - like buttons that need to be clicked, etc.)
