No going back case only I'm addressing the zero-length jumps case only, i.e. no going back and the frog is allowed to remain still at a given step. Without considering a clock-like device and assuming that remaining still in one clock tick counts as one jump means just considering the other's puzzle conditions. It does not have to be a precise clock or stick to equal time intervals, just give a tick every now and then which trigger the need for a jump by the frog. When on leaf 1, there is a probability $\frac12$ to jump to the target leaf 0 and $\frac12$ to remain on leaf 1. The probability of taking exactly $k$ jumps to land on the target has probability $\left(\frac12\right)^k$ , that is $\left(\frac12\right)^{k-1}$ of remaining still in the first $k-1$ ticks and $\frac12$ to land on leaf 1 on the $k$ -th tick. So the expected value is: $$J_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k\left(\frac12\right)^k = \frac{\frac12}{\left(1-\frac12\right)^2} = 2$$ ( thanks wikipedia ). Generalizing for $n > 1$ , we can land on leaf $0..n$ at the next tick, each with probability $\frac1{n+1}$ . Each case implies taking the jump of the tick, then taking the average number of jumps from the leaf we land on: $$J_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac1{n+1}(1+J_k) = \frac1{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(1+J_k) = 1 + \frac1{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}J_k$$ Interestingly, this allows us to find $J_1 = 1 + \frac12J_1 = 2$ but without much sweating with the harmonic series. Evolving the equation: $$(n+1)J_n = n + 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{n}J_k$$ This relation does not hold for $n = 0$ because it would lead to $0 = 1$ . Assuming $n > 1 \Rightarrow n - 1 > 0$ : $$nJ_{n-1} = n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}J_k$$ Subtracting the last two equations: $$(n+1)J_n - nJ_{n-1} = 1 + J_n$$ $$nJ_n = 1 + nJ_{n-1}$$ $$J_n = \frac1n + J_{n-1}$$ that is exactly the same relation we have if the frog is only allowed to advance, although with different edge conditions ( $n > 1$ and $J_1 = 2$ ). So, the bottom line is: $$ J_0 = 0 $$ $$ n>0 : J_{n} = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac1k $$ i.e. on average there will be exactly 1 jump more than the previous case where the frog can only advance, except for $J_0$ in which case the frog will always just remain still. It is interesting that the recurrent relation holds for $n>1$ but the non-recurrent formula holds also for $n = 1$ . A few simulations seem to support the result above.
