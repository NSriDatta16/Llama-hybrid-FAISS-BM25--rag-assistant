Your problem is that you copied server-specific libraries into your /WEB-INF/lib because it seemingly solved the compilation errors. This is however the wrong solution. You will still run into trouble during runtime because the libraries in /WEB-INF/lib get precedence in classloading and due to the wrong location some mandatory stuff is missing and everything will break. You should keep those server specific libraries there where they originally belong and not move/copy them around. All you need to do is to just include their disk file system path in the compiletime classpath. The average IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans, etc) can do that in a single click.
