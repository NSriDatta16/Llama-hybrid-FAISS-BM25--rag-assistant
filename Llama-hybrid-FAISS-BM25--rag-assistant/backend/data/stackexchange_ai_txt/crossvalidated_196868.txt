Can you perform hypothesis testing on mutual information values?

I am working on a project that uses mutual information to determine how much information is shared between two "variables" x and y in two separate populations. Essentially, I have two groups and calculated a mutual information value indicating the degree of the relationship between x and y for 10 subjects per group (so 10 MI values in group 1 and 10 MI values in group 2). Can mutual information values be averaged (average MI group 1 vs average MI group 2) and then used in hypothesis testing ( i.e., t-tests, anovas, etc) or are they more like correlation coefficients, or neither?
