NSTextFields don't have an enclosing scroll view, generally; the user has to drag-select to scroll. Would an NSTextView (with enclosing scroll view) work? Otherwise, you could add some logic to resize the text field (and possibly the window) when the string is too big, but that's obviously a bit more complicated.
