Credibility: I lead the team that builds a rather large CMS* and we have a lot of the same demands you describe. For example, editors needing to create a hundred pages of marketing material, images, movies; translate that into 65 languages and deploy it all at the same time worldwide. How to approach it? There's plenty of approaches, and the one you're suggesting has its own set of difficulties. The model we've found works quite well is the single-page-review model combined with batch scheduling . Most content management systems allow editors to create pages but check-in as "Draft" rather than "Publish". To a non-logged-in user, that page will return a 404, but to a logged-in user, they will see the latest draft version. Once an approver has validated all the content, they can schedule all n pages to be published at the same time. This does indeed scale up and out quite well. I can't recommend a specific solution without knowing more about your unique problem set, but I encourage you not to lock yourself in to a specific system model this early in the process. Based on what you've said, most good CMS systems should be viable candidates with a small amount of customization. *Nearly a million pages, over 65 languages, thousands of editors, millions of hits a day - http://www.volvo.com
