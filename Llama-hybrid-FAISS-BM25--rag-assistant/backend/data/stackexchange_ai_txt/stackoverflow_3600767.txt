We archieved our goal :D. Thanks to Dr. Wily's Apprentice for giving us a tip about the solution. Here is what we did: We created a view, named VIEWFILEEXTRA, with just the fields we’d like to use in the association; After that, we created an entity based on this view, named FileExtra; Map FileExtra to VIEWFILEEXTRA, if not done yet; Change FileNumber and FileType from FileExtra Entity Key flag to true; Delete FileNumber and FileType scalar properties from File; Create an 1 on 1 association between file and FileExtra; Set the scalar properties in the association mapping to point to File’s database fields FileNumber and FileType; Create an 1 to Many association between FileExtra and TransactionLine; Point the association mapping to TransactionLine, and set the fields. And that’s it. Thank you very much for your attention and tips :D.
