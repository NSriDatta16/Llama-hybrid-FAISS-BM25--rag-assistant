nuqqsa : Yep, the expected log files do not appear. The tests do seem to be run though as I had to fix my require_once paths. In the command prompt I would do the following in my source folder: phpunit.bat --log-junit "C:\Program Files(x86)\CruiseControl\projects\myProject/build/logs/phpunit.xml" --coverage-clover "C:\Program Files(x86)\CruiseControl\projects\myProject/build/logs/phpunit.coverage.xml" --coverage-html "C:\Program Files(x86)\CruiseControl\projects\myProject/build/coverage" tests/ I hope it's nothing to do with the space in the path or the slashes the other half of the paths. I have had a thought. I have debugged (using PHPEdit) when running the build and PHPUnit does seem to be executed but I haven't put a breakpoint in any of the tests to see if they are executed. I will do that when I get home and report back.
