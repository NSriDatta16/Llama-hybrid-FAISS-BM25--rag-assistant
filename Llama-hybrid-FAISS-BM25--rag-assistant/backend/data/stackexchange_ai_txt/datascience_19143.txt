Imputation of missing values and dealing with categorical values

I have a dataset (10 million rows, 55 columns) with many missing values. I need to predict those values somehow using other non-missing values, i.e. replace them with something that is not NaN. Mean and median are not the solution here. I tried to research other methods for that but none of them works since I have many categorical variables. I also tried to use one hot encoding to convert categorical variables to integers but I am not sure if that is a solution in my case since from only 1 categorical column I would get 600 new columns. If I do the same with other categorical columns, I would get many millions of new columns. One of the categorical columns is URL string and it is different for every row, so I have 10 million different URLs for example. The other categorical column is a description and it is also different for every row. I could probably remove the URL column, but I can't remove description, title, location and others for example. I tried PCA, but it also doesn't work with categorical data. I have missing data for both categorical and integers/floats values. Would get_dummies method be a good approach to deal with this? For missing values imputation I tried KNN and maximum likelihood but I am getting errors due to categorical variables. Missing data is completely randomly missing. Do you have any suggestions how to approach this problem and also which packages should I use?
