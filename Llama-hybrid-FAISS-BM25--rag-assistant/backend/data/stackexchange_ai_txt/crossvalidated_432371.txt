How would I calculate the standardized value of y given the standardized value of x and

If the correlation between two variables, $x$ and $y$ , is $-1/2$ , and the standardized value of $x$ is $-4$ , how would I predict the standardized value of $y$ with just those two pieces of information? To figure out the standardized value of $y$ , wouldn't I also need to know the standard deviation of $y$ ( $s_y$ ) and the average of $y$ ( $\bar{y})$ ? $z = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}$
