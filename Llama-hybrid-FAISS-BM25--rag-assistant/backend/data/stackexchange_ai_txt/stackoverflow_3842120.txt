Memory usage for a container class is handled by the container's allocator (which is passed in as a constructor argument to std::list , and is std::allocator by default). The implementation of the default allocator may choose not to return memory to the system straight away, in order to prevent excess fragmentation of the heap. If you want more direct control over this, you'll probably have to implement a custom allocator.
