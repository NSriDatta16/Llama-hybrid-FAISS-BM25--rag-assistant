Just to be clear, the index is on the (presumably varchar or nvarchar) field in the table, correct? Not the PK? ok, after your edit: You're doing an indexed lookup on a large (n)varchar text field. Even with the index that can be pretty slow -- you're still doing 2 big string comparisons. I can't really thing of a great way to do this, but some initial SWAGS: compute a hash of the to-be-logged text, and store that in the database for subsequent lookups as another poster suggested, store all of the rows, and filter out dupes in the query (or with a nightly batch, whatever don't check for duplicates. Catching an exception may still be cheaper than the lookup* hire someone with a really good memory who's fast with a mouse. When a message is going to be logged, flash it to their screen with an accept/deny prompt. If the entry is a dupe, ahve them click "deny" * yeah, I know I'll be down-modded for that, but sometimes pragmatism just works.
