It is not a bad practice. The fact that the function returns a malloc -ed (or calloc -ed) memory becomes a part of its external specification. It becomes a the caller's responsibility to free it when it is no longer necessary. It is inelegant though. It is inelegant since it 1) forces the use of dynamic memory, when the caller might prefer to avoid it, and 2) forces the use a specific kind of dynamic memory - the malloc -ed one, when the caller might prefer to use its own allocation mechanism.
