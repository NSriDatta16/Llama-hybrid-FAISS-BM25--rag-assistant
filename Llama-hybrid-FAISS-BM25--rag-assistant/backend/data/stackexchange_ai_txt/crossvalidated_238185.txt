Very generally speaking, you are repeatedly decreasing the uncertainty of your derived values by averaging, which you already saw in your formulas. As an intuitive example, let's say, you are glueing sticks (let's say three at a time) with different lengths end to end together and then saw them into three equal length sticks. When you do this with all your sticks, the lengths of the resulting sticks will be closer together than the original population. If you do this repeatedly you are amplfying the effect. Note that this will only work if you combine new sticks everytime. This is because only new sticks add new information about stick lengths to the process. Glueing and cutting the same three sticks repeatedly does nothing more than doing it once, it's an idempotent operation.
