You are getting an empty resultset because the timestamp 2010-08-24 11:59:59 is not between 2010-07-29 23:59:59 and 2010-08-23 00:00:00 (see last paragraph if this isn't a typo and you really meant between 2010-08-23 00:00:00 and 2010-07-29 23:59:59 ). Here are two queries to test this out. This query returns 0 (False): SELECT '2010-08-24 11:59:59' BETWEEN '2010-07-29 23:59:59' AND '2010-08-23 00:00:00' This query returns 1 (True): SELECT '2010-08-24 11:59:59' BETWEEN '2010-07-29 23:59:59' AND '2010-08-25 00:00:00' Moreover, the order of the inputs also matters: you should swap the start and end dates such that the start date precedes the end date.
