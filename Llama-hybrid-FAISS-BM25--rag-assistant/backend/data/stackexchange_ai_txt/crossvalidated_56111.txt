A binary logistic regression would work, for the same reason that you can use a regression when you want to compare two sample means. However, it may be more apparatus that is required. With a small sample, one might consider a binomial test . In this case, your sample sizes are nice and big, so a straight out proportions test should be effectively indistinguishable from it and a little simpler to deal with. However, since you have three experimental runs it might be worth including experimental run as a covariate (even though if all is well it should not have a covariate effect). In that case, you could use logistic regression to do teh comparison incorporating the experimental run variable, or you could look at a chi-square test to achieve basically the same thing (though if you want a one-tailed test, the first thing would be better).
