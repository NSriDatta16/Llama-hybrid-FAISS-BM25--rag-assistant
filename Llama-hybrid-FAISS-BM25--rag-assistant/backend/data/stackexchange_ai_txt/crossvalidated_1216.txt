I suggest he stocks $y_s$ pairs of shoes of size $s$ where $y_s$ is chosen so that the probability of running out of stock before the next delivery is set to some acceptable level (e.g., 5%). It seems reasonable to assume $y_s$ is Poisson with rate $\lambda_s$. You can estimate $\lambda_s$ as the average sales of that size over the last few delivery periods. Then all that remains is to find the 95th percentile of the Poisson distribution with mean equal to the estimated rate for each size.
