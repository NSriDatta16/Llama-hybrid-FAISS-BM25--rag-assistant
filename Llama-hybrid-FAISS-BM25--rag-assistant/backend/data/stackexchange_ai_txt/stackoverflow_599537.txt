They are all linker errors of the same pattern. Linker errors are related to every single private static data member of classes I have defined in my own header files. All static data members must have a definition in a .cpp file somewhere . Error 38 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "private: static double SingleDelay::dry" (?dry@SingleDelay@@0NA) Delays.obj testall The linker is telling you that there is no defined storage for that variable. This line must appear somewhere in exactly one .cpp file: double SingleDelay::dry = 0.0;
