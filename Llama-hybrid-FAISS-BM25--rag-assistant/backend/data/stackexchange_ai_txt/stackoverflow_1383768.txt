Cloning Lua state

Folks, is there a way to clone a Lua state? In my game application the initialization procedure of the Lua virtual machine is pretty heavy(about 1 sec, since many scripts are loaded at once). I have a separate Lua VM for each autonomous agent and once the agent is created its Lua initialization affects FPS pretty badly. I'm thinking about the following schema: what about keeping "preforked" Lua state which is then simply cloned for each agent? Is it possible?
