Do I read that right? For each of those operations you're starting a new process? If so there's your problem: Once a process terminates all the memory it allocated is freed. What you need is persistent storage. In the usual operating systems process memory is not persistent (there are some OS in which allocated memory is persistent, but still bound to a certain process, so even in such a OS this kind of program won't work).
