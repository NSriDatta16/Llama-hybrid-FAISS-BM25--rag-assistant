However if a method is used to combat this (a high percentage of dropout on the input for example) then it seems unlikely that overfitting would be a problem. Actually, dropout doesn't always suffice to compensate for the increased overfitting resulting from the addition of CNN filters. E.g., from {1}: References: {1} Dernoncourt, Franck, and Ji Young Lee. " Optimizing neural network hyperparameters with gaussian processes for dialog act classification. " In IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT), pp. 406-413, 2016.
