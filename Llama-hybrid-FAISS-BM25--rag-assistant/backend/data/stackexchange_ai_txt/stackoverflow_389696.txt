Yes. Which coverage tool are you using? The Cobertura plugin for Hudson definitely supports this. On the project configuration screen you can specify thresholds. Alternatively, you can make Ant fail the build (rather than Hudson), by using the cobertura-check task. EDIT: I'm not sure you can do precisely what you are asking for. Even if you could, it could prove problematic. For example, assume you have an average coverage of 75% but for one class you have coverage of 80%. If you remove that 80% class and all of its tests, you reduce the overall coverage percentage even though none of the other code is any less tested than previously.
