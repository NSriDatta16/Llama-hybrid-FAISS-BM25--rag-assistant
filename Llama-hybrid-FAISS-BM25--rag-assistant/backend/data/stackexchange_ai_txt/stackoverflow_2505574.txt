Backup is at least as much about the importance of recovery using whatever backup you make. The right way to back up source code is to keep source files in a VCS (version control system) , and back up the VCS repository. Exclude any auto-generated easily-replaced files (like those *.pyc files, etc.) from the VCS repository. I recommend Bazaar for very efficient storage and user-friendliness, but your team will likely already have a VCS they prefer. For backup of a PostgreSQL database, it's best to use pg_dump to regularly dump the database to a text file , compress that, and back up the result. This is because the backup then becomes restorable on any machine, by re-playing the database dump into another PostgreSQL server. As for how to automate it: you would be best using a Bash program for the purpose, since it's just a matter of connecting some commands to files, which is what the shell excels at.
