Ultrawingrid - how to display #1/1/1800# as blank ( as if null )

Ultrawingrid 9.2 VS2008 .net 3.5 My wingrid uses a bindingsource. All datetimes which are null in SQL Server are delivered to the bindingsource as #1/1/1800# I would like Ultrawingrid to display this date as blank as it would a null from source. Also, if the date is null in the grid ( i.e. blanked out ) I would like to update the data source to the date #1/1/1800# ( the framework takes care of getting that date back into the backend as a null ) This seems like it should be a trivial matter but I can find no documentation on just where to intervene so the grid will see a particular date as a null and save a null as a particular date. This is the direction I've been headed but I don't think either is the right place and I can't even get the syntax to work in the BeforeRowUpdate as I cannot see how to set a value that is passed to the data binding without setting the value of control itself, which I think has to remain null in order to display as blank Private Sub ugPropMaster_BeforeRowUpdate(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As _ Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.CancelableRowEventArgs) Handles _ ugPropMaster.BeforeRowUpdate If e.Row.Cells.Item("Exdate").Value Is Nothing Then e.Row.Cells("Exdate").Value = CDate(#1/1/1800#) End If End Sub Private Sub ugPropMaster_InitializeRow(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As _ Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeRowEventArgs) Handles _ ugPropMaster.InitializeRow If CDate(e.Row.Cells.Item("Exdate").Value) = CDate(#1/1/1800#) Then e.Row.Cells.Item("Exdate").Value = Nothing End If End Sub Guidance much appreciated
