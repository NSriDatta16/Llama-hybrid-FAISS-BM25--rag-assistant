What is the purpose of the +1/-1 constraint in Support Vector Machines (SVMs)?

It is common knowledge that all SVMS try to optimize some permutation of the following equation with the provided constraints: However, my question lies on the purpose of the constraint >= 1 and I feel as if +1/-1 is a bit arbitrary, and feel as though its only purpose is act as two disjoint decision boundaries that can be adjusted separately, as opposed to a binary decision boundary such as (>0 positive, else negative) - which when adjusted, impacts both the positive decision boundary and the negative boundary at the same time, well because they are the same boundary If this is true, then would it follow that all svms would work equally fine with the constraints +0.5/-0.5 or +500/-500? Since the only requirement we really need is number thresholds that give us two disjoint intervals that can be independently adjusted. Is my understanding of this concept accurate? Can someone verify my comprehension?
