The reason why the confidence interval has this coverage property is due to some probability manipulations. It might be instructive to do some math. The Central Limit Theorem states that as $n \to \infty$ , $$ z=\dfrac{\bar{X}- \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) $$ Let $z_\alpha$ be the $\alpha^{th}$ quantile of a standard normal distirbution. If $\alpha>0.5$ , then $$ P( \vert z \vert \leq z_{1-\alpha/2} ) = 1-\alpha $$ and $$ P \left( -z_{1-\alpha/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \bar{X} - \mu \leq z_{1-\alpha/2} \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = 1-\alpha $$ Rearranging to put $\mu$ in the middle of the inequality $$ P\left( \bar{X} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{X} + z_{1-\alpha/2}\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) = 1-\alpha$$ The argument in $P$ is familliar, right? These are the end points of a confidence interval.
