The code coverage report shows three different scores: classes, methods and functions, and lines. Classes is a report on the number of classes tested in an entity. So, if you have one class per file, and you test a part of that class, it shows as you testing 100% of the classes. If you have two classes in a file, and you test one class, you'll have 50% class coverage.
