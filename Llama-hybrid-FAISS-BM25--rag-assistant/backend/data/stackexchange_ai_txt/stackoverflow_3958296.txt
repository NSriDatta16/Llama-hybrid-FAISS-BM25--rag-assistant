Why I'm getting this error in a actionscript project using flash Builder? I'm not even embedding anything, I'm just extending an OSMF class 'NetStreamLoadTrait' which has some metadata, that's it. [ExcludeClass] I'm using another OSMF project insted the one coming with the Flex SDK 4.0, but I have deleted the osmf package inside the SDK ( using the Actionscript Build Path ) This is so frustating...
