Depending on your level, a good starting point might be the overview article Bian and Scornet (2016) A random forest guided tour . "The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests." You might also find a recent theoretical contribution, such as Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019) Generalized random forests , and look at references therein. A good search strategy in general is to find a seminal theoretical paper (other than Breiman, 2001, as it's cited too widely; some of the ones cited in Athey et al. or Bian and Scornet will do) and look for articles citing it on Google Scholar.
