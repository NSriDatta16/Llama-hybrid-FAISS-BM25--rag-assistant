Merge several data.frames into one data.frame with a loop

I am trying to merge several data.frames into one data.frame . Since I have a whole list of files I am trying to do it with a loop structure. So far the loop approach works fine. However, it looks pretty inefficient and I am wondering if there is a faster and easier approach. Here is the scenario: I have a directory with several .csv files. Each file contains the same identifier which can be used as the merger variable. Since the files are rather large in size I thought to read each file one at a time into R instead of reading all files at once. So I get all the files of the directory with list.files and read in the first two files. Afterwards I use merge to get one data.frame . FileNames Now I use a for loop to get all the remaining .csv files and merge them into the already existing data.frame : for(i in 3:length(FileNames)){ ReadInMerge Even though it works just fine I was wondering if there is a more elegant way to get the job done?
