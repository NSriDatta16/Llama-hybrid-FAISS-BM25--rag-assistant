You could always set your window to be a top most window, make it full screen, and activate it. It would be very, very hard to miss... Granted, it would also be very annoying, and not something I'd do to other users... My "real" suggestion would be to use sound along with standard notification methods if this is going to be used by other people, as that's an easy way to grab attention without necessarily killing their workflow. A modeless window that appears in a corner of the screen, especially if combined with sound and color, can be very effective to grab attention.
