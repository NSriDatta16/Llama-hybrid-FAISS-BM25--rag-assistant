I highly doubt that the job itself will going to be at risk. It is rather the other way around: Data science and machine learning will replace a lot of other jobs. In the end there, at least, always needs to be someone providing the data to the machine. It seems like your question rather should be "will there be enough data science positions in the future to have good chances of getting a job". While I can not give you a concrete answer to this question, I can tell you that, I think, most other jobs have a way higher risk. Data science or, maybe, even more machine learning, seems like a good and future-proof choice for me.
