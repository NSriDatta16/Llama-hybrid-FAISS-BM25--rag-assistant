+1 to both @MichaelChernick and @juba. I have heard of that rule, I believe Agresti also mentions it in his books on categorical data analysis. Note however, that both that rule, and Cochran's original rule (i.e., that all cells have expected values >5), apply to expected counts , not the observed counts. This is very slippery, and it looks a little bit like you are slipping between the two from your first to your second paragraph. The best resource I know of for these issues is: Campbell Ian, 2007, Chi-squared and Fisher-Irwin tests of two-by-two tables with small sample recommendations, Statistics in Medicine, 26, 3661 - 3675 I list a lot of related information about chi-squared and related tests here: Contingency tables: what tests to do and when? On the other hand, with small contingency tables with few actual counts there's a legitimate question of whether we ought to always just be using Fisher's exact test these days. (Note that this is what @juba is referring to, as you can see at the end of the quote.) There's a really good discussion on CV here (albeit one that mostly argues against using Fisher's test): Given the power of computers these days, is there ever a reason not to do a chi-squared test rather than Fisher's exact test?
