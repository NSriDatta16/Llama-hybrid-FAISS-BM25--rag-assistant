Strange encoding of Atom feed XML

I am creating some OPDS reader application in C# on WP7 while I found strange behavior (at least strange for me). OPDS is Atom-based XML and I am using RestSharp library, which provides some XML deserializer. Most feeds are downloaded and parsed right. But there where some exceptions while parsing certain feeds. I investigated a little why the exception is occurring and found this: Exception is occurring on these pages (for example): http://pragprog.com/magazines.opds http://bookserver.revues.org/?sort=Authors&letter=Q When I copied the code of those XMLs, pasted it into Notepad++ and applied Tidy: reindent XML function on that pasted code, Notepad/Tidy reported some errors. When I looked where the errors happened, it was typically on some accent characters (or accented characters). To be concrete: on the first link, there is error on line 161 column 26, which is word Whatâ€™s , specifically the apostrophe-like character. When I looked what is realy downloaded (through Wireshark), there are three bytes between the char 't' and char 's'. Values of those bytes in hex are { e2 , 80 , 99 }. None of them is something similar to apostrophe char. I bet this is the cause of the parsing problem, but I don't really get it. What conversion is my browser (Opera) doing? Opera shows the feed 'ok', it shows even code 'ok', but it copies the original bytes, and Notepad's Tidy "crash" on them. Can someone clear this for me. Maybe I am missing something basic about encoding...? (question is not specifically about WP7 solution, but about general encoding of chars)
