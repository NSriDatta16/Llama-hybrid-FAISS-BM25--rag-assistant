To reverse the order of the bits: procedure SwapEndiannessOfBits(var Value: cardinal); var tmp: cardinal; i: Integer; begin tmp := 0; for i := 0 to 8*sizeof(Value) - 1 do inc(tmp, ((Value shr i) and $1) shl (8*sizeof(Value) - i - 1)); Value := tmp; end; To reverse the order of the bytes: procedure SwapEndiannessOfBytes(var Value: cardinal); var tmp: cardinal; i: Integer; begin tmp := 0; for i := 0 to sizeof(Value) - 1 do inc(tmp, ((Value shr (8*i)) and $FF) shl (8*(sizeof(Value) - i - 1))); Value := tmp; end; I think the last one is what you are looking for. Most likely there are faster and more elegant solutions, though. Disclaimer: I might be totally wrong. I feel a bit confused at the moment. Hopefully someone else will see this question and provide a more definite answer!
