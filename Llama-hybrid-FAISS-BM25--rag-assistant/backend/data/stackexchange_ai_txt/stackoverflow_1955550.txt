Your suggestion that mixing code with the HTML as ... more elegant is arguable. ... In general this is discouraged as it leads to maintenance problems. If I understood you correctly, on the onReady event being activated you want to call all these functions. One way to do it actually is to use a REL or anything else you might want to use as an expando attribute. On document ready capture all the elements and read the attribute's value, then eval(). (People will tell you eval() is evil, but is quite harmless here). $(document).ready(function(){ var v= $('.class_name').attr('rel'); eval(v); }) It will actually eval() and activate all your javascript within your REL attributes.
