You read C declarations from the inside out, first moving right to highly bound operators like [] and then moving left. So, you have: strings, an array, of constant, pointers, to NSString, that is static. That's perfectly reasonable but not what you said you wanted. To create pointers to constant strings you will need the const on the other side of the * , so you will have strings, an array, of pointers, to constant, NSString, which are static. You can put const in both places, if you want. Using static storage class is a bit like defining a class variable. It is the same as static in C99, a module-level lexical scope.
