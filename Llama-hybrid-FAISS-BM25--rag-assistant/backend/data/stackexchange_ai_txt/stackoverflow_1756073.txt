jBoss Profile - how?

I want to profile my jBoss Apps on a remote server. I've tried the Eclipse TPTP project but with an invoked agent my jBoss Portal doesn't start and it ends in unlimited lines of exceptions. jProfiler doesn't work either, portal doesn't boot. Netbeans IDE Profiling seems only to work on local machines or did I missed something? How do you profile your web apps?
