You may wish to look at Build Your own DAL . It has a section on hydration that you probably will find interesting. But hydration from a really simple view means means take from the raw persistent storage module and map into an object/a list of objects. Update Look at Understanding Lazy Loading Strategies or Lazy Loading - Eager Loading . I think this is what is happening for the hydration of the objects in the video you describe. Example This is a really simple hydration example (Not an NHibernate example) Say we have run a query like: select name, breed from tblDogs and that has these results K9, GermanShepard IBeBlind, Labrador SmallAnoyance, Shitsu Trigger, GermanShepard And say we have the following object: public class Dog { public string name { get; set; } public string breed { get; set; } } Now we can write our own hydrator: public List Hydrate(results rs) { List dogs = new List (); foreach(Record rec in rs) { Dog d = new Dog(); d.name = rec["name"]; d.breed = rec["breed"]; dogs.Add(d); } return dogs; }
