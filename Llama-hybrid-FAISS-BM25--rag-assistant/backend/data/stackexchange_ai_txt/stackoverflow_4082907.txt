The *.dat files stores various type of media content. What I can say so far is, that: images are stored as JPEGs without additional info. That means just renaming *.dat is enough to get the original image. Such a files starts with #{FFD8} images are stored in some internal RAW format. Using reverse engineering I can say that for example bitmap with raw pixel data #{FFFFFFFF} (1x1) is stored as: 0305 ;raw bitmap identifier? 0400 ;length of decompressed row data 0100 ;width 0100 ;height 00000000 ;unknown 14000000 ;width in twips 00000000 ;unknown 14000000 ;height in twips 00 ;some flags - 01=image has transparency variant 1.: 01 ;compressed data flag 0200 ;length of compressed chunk 7801 ;compressed chunk 0A00 ;length of compressed chunk FBFFFFFF7F0009FA03FD ;compressed chunk 0000 ;end of compressed stream variant 2.: 00 ;data are uncompressed 00000000 00000000 ;unknown data - always zero? FFFFFFFF ;raw uncompressed ARGB data where the decompressed data are pixels with storage type: ARGB, so with the size info it should be enough to get the image from it. It's using ZLIB compression (www.zlib.net) Flash is using compression level 1, but it's possible to use any level (but it's not necessary as the sources are normally compressed altogether. SOUNDS are stored in DAT files in RAW format, it's possible to make WAV files from it easily using the information from the DOMSoundItem. The rest is unknown yet. The rest of the *.dat types is unknown yet. The name of the DAT files is important as well! Flash somehow gets numbers from the name, using name like checksum in hexadecimal form (9BB551621D3E2138FECA2F04469531D7.dat) crashes Flash! Using chars like [_.-] will cause the content unloadable as well (but not crash)
