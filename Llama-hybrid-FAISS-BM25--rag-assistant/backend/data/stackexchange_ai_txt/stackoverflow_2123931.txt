I highly suggest http://fivebean.com/account/aff.php?aff=092 Yes, it is an affiliate link but they are the best VPS that I have ever used. Plus they are cheap. That host officially powers http://twurla.com/ which processes and filters thousands of tweets and urls per minute on their mid-range VPS. Their support is great too, the average response time is 10-15 minutes tops. I understand you didn't really want a VPS but this host is very easy and shouldn't be too hard to set up at all. OTher than that, I don't know of any shared hosts that open manual ports for you. I use Dreamhost, Bluehost now and I have used many others and I know that most will not let you. Thanks, James Hartig
