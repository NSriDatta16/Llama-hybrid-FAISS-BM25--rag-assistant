Using Minkowski's inequality in a proof

Hi: I'm reading a proof in Halbert White's "asymptotic theory for econometricians" and I don't understand one of the steps. The theorem supposes the following: $E(X^2_{thi})^{1+\delta} for some $\delta > 0 $ and all $h = 1, \ldots p, ~i = 1, \ldots k$ , and all $t$ . Then, it starts off the proof by saying the following: By Minkowski's inequality: $$E \left|\sum_{h=1}^{p} X_{thi} X_{thj}\right|^{1+\delta} \le \left|\sum_{h=1}^{p} (E|X_{thi} X_{thj}| ^{(1+\delta)})^\left(\frac{1}{1+\delta}\right)\right| ^{1+\delta}.$$ Can someone show or explain how the relation above is obtained from A) the stated assumption and B) Minkowski's inequality ( or any other inequality in case it's a typo and it's using some other inequality ). The rest of the proof makes sense so no need to state the rest. Minkowski's inequality is : Let $q \ge 1$ . If $E(|Y|^q) and $E(|Z|^q) , then $$\left(E|Y + Z|^{q}\right)^\left(\frac{1}{q}\right) \le E(|Y|^q)^\left(\frac{1}{q}\right) + E(|Z|^q)^\left(\frac{1}{q}\right).$$
