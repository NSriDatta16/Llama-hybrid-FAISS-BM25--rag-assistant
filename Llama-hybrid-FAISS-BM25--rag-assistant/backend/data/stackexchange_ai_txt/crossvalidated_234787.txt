A more relevant paper about the convergence of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms is the one by Mengersen and Tweedie (1996) since it is both quite readable and general. In this paper, two major results can be singled out: The independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with target $p$ and proposal $q$ leads to a uniformly ergodic Markov chain when $p/q$ is bounded; In the case of a target with a non-compact support, the random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm cannot produce a uniformly ergodic Markov chain. There exist some conditions under which the Markov chain is geometrically ergodic. If you want a deeper entry on convergence properties of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, the series of papers written by Gareth Roberts (Warwick) and Jeff Rosenthal (Toronto) contain a wealth of results.
