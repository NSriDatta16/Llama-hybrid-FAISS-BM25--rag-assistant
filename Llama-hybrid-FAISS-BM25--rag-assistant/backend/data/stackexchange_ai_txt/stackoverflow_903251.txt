Organizing lists in HTML/CSS

I have a list and I need two sections in each item. I also need the first section to be of fixed width. How should I code it? I've tried using definition lists: foo bar ... ... and user lists with span: foo bar ... Neither worked. Are there any canonical ways to do that?
