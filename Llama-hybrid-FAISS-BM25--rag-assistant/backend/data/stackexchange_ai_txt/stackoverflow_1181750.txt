I can't speak for the content of the exported XML, but I'd expect it contain your coverage data as a summary. The usual thing to do with XML data like this if you want to see it in a web browser page is to convert it to HTML by writing and running a custom XSLT script. This will presumably get you HTML text and tables containing your data. If you want to see the coverage data as decorations imposed on the source code, I think you have a much harder problem.
