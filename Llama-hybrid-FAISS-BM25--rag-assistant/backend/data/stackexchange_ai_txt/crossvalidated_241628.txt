What's the state-of-the-art in learing human (motion) behaviour from videos?

Dear fellow colleagues, I’m currently working on a research project that involves predicting human behavior from video streams. Since I’m mostly working on other fields of research, and thus I’m not up to date in the field of machine learning, I thought it might be a good idea to discuss the challenge here. tl;tr What is the current state of the art in learning temporal human behavior (movements) from training data, which can include additional process knowledge? Introduction Assume that we are given a 2D color video stream from a single camera mounted on the ceiling, observing a limited indoor workplace. In this environment we observe worker(s), larger parts to be worked on and additional points of interest (such as pickup stations, PCs and trashcans). The larger parts being mostly stationary, while worker(s) move around. Problem statement Our goal is to design a system that is able to predict the worker's (actor) movement for time $t+1$ up to $t+N$ (with increasing uncertainty). Approach Our approach currently decouples image segmentation and learning. Given a working segmentation the following sketch illustrates our environment. We discretized space into a rectangular grid (white dashed lines). Now we’d like to develop a behavior model for an actor that gives us probabilities for each cell the actor might be in for $t+1$. The model to be learnt should be able to incorporate the * the current state $t$ * possible past states $t, t-1,...$. * Additional process knowledge: We’d like to model information about points of interest (e.g if an actor is close to the PC/Part he/she is likely to be there for a while). We are currently assuming that probababilistic dynamic graphical models are were our research should start, but we are unsure. Questions Assuming unlimited training data (either from a simulation or hand-labelled real world data), how would learn such a behavior model? What are the state-of-the-art tools to tackle this?
