You can use open-face to yield a 35-dim feature vector for each frame, as you said, and then treat each video as a sequence of features of shape (num_frames, 35) such that the entire dataset is of shape (300, num_frames, 35) . Then you can train a recurrent neural network classifier, like a LSTM that takes in a sequence of num_frames 35-dim vectors and yields a single number: the binary class. Alternatively, I think you can replace the feature extraction by open-face with an end-to-end model by using 3D convolutional layers, and then an LSTM, with a final dense layer.
