You might want to try a Bayesian classifier instead of SVM or Decision Trees. Your problem is a generalization of the spam filter problem, i.e. classifying emails into 'Spam' (class 1) or 'Not Spam' (class 2). Most Spam filters use Bayesian classification instead of the more common supervised learning method.
