Does t-SNE in 3 dimensions offer any additional information to 2 dimensional t-SNE?

t-SNE is a data reduction technique that primarily gives information about local similarities. Clustering in a t-SNE graph usually ( but not always) indicates some hidden structure in the higher-dimensional data. While there are some shapes and features in 3d space that cannot be translated onto a 2d space (things like chirality and knots), how usual, practically speaking, is it to come across real life data (including things like word-vectors and neural network weights of image-classifiers) that only reveals structure/intelligible features in three dimensions and not two?
