Power calculations, logistic regression with continuous exposure--cohort

I'm trying to estimate power in a logistic regression with a continuous exposure in a cohort study (ie, the ratio of the sampling probabilities is 1). I have population cumulative incidence (probability) and population exposure variability and exposure mean and an expected odds ratio. I also have a total sample size. I'm using R and it seems like Hmisc::bpower is only for logistic regression with binary exposure and I can't seem to find any packages that estimate binomial power with continuous exposure. I've attempted the following simulation but it's quite slow given my total sample size and I'm not sure if it's right: p Is there anything wrong with this approach? One concern of mine is that the cumulative incidence (ie, probability of event over the given time period) comes from a population that did not have 0 exposure. In fact, it's reasonable to assume that the value i'm using for an intercept is actually from a population that has an exposure variability similar to mine. In that case, how would I estimate the unexposed probability given an odds ratio (and other information that I would find in say, a published paper) to use in my power calculation?
