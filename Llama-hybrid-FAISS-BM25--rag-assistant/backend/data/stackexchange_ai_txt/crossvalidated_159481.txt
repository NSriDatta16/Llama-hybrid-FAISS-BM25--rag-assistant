Although this question has already an accepted answer I'd like to add something to the point of the question. "PCA" -if I recall correctly - means "principal components analysis"; so as long as you're analyzing the principal components, may it be without rotation or with rotation, we are still in the analysis of the "principal components" (which were found by the appropriate initial matrix-decomposition). I'd formulate that after "varimax"-rotation on the first two principal components, that we have the "varimax-solution of the two first pc's" (or something else), but still are in the framework of analysis of principal components, or shorter, are in the framework of "pca". To make my point even clearer: I don't feel that the simple question of rotation introduces the problem of distinguishing between EFA and CFA (the latter mentioned /introduced into the problem for instance in the answer of Brett)
