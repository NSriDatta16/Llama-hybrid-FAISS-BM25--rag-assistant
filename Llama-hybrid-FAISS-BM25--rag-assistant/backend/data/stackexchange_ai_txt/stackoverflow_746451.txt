We logged the user-agent, it is some suspicious "XXXagentXXX" in most cases, but a genuine Mozilla (as above) in others. Referrer is "-" for all these requests. However, there is one curious thing I noticed today. We redirect our requests from apache (80) to jboss. Apache access log shows above request as completely encoded: GET /r/%3Fclient_id%3D3%26redirect_url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.de%252Fgp%252Fsearch%253Fie%253DUTF8%2526keywords%253DCyberlink%2BPower%2BDirector%2526search-alias%253Dsoftware HTTP/1.0" 400 965 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10)" while jboss access log has everything except %3F decoded. Now this makes me think apache is screwing up somewhere in the decoding?
