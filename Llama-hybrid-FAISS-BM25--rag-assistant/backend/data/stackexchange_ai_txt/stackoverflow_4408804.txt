Unless your program uses some "edge" block sizes (say, near to a power of two), I don't see that block size (or a small difference in block size compared to the program with standard allocation) may affect fragmentation. With millions of allocation, a good allocator fills up the space and manages it efficiently. Thinking the other way around, imagine your program originally used the blocks of the sizes the same as the one with the modified allocator. Would you then bother about memory fragmentation in that case?
