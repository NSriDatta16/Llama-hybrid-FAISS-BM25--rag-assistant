Training my neural network to overfit my training dataset

I want to train my neural net to overfit the training data. Should I just keep fitting my model with the same training data by using K-fold validation and setting epochs to infinity? Then, after it reaches nearly 100 percent prediction, I can just stop the training. Is it the right way to do it?
