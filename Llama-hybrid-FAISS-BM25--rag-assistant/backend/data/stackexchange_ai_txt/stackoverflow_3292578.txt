Iphone Drag'n'Drop MapKit generates "unrecognized selector sent to instance" exception

Recently downloaded "MapKitDragAndDrop 3" package ( http://github.com/digdog/MapKitDragAndDrop ) to use in my app. The demo project runs smoothly. Both DDAnnotation.h+m and DDAnnotationView.h+m files were imported as they are. The method of calling the class was also copied/pasted. DDAnnotation *annotation = [[[DDAnnotation alloc] initWithCoordinate:theCoordinate addressDictionary:nil] autorelease]; annotation.title = @"Drag to Move Pin"; annotation.subtitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%f %f", annotation.coordinate.latitude, annotation.coordinate.longitude]; [self.mapView addAnnotation:annotation]; The first run resulted in "unrecognized selector sent to instance" exception. Debugger suggests that I implement setCoordinate methods in DDAnnotation class; yet the demo files has neither @synthesize nor methods implementation. DDAnnotation.m: #import "DDAnnotation.h" @implementation DDAnnotation - (id)initWithCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinate addressDictionary:(NSDictionary *)addressDictionary { if ((self = [super initWithCoordinate:coordinate addressDictionary:addressDictionary])) { // NOTE: self.coordinate is now different from super.coordinate, since we re-declare this property in header, // self.coordinate and super.coordinate don't share same ivar anymore. self.coordinate = coordinate; // CHECKPOINT } return self; } @end Upon tracing the DDAnnotation.m it falls into DDAnnotation.h on CHECKPOINT in debugger. In my app, it doesn't. I really expect the mistake to be stupid, yet I just don't know where to look. Thanks.
