In a case like this you need to look at the residuals after you run each model to determine whether log transformation is needed at all. There is not enough info on data structure so it's hard to comment. If you have a time series structure then there are a host of other things you need to check for like serial correlation for example. If it's a panel then a bunch of different issues need to be addressed. Finally, there are specification tests out there whuch may guide you with picking the right model.
