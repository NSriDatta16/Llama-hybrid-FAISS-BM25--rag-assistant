This is a pretty bad idea - using dicts as intended ends up with a much less confusing solution. A quick hack dirty way of making the key=value pairs into non-dict string variables is as follows: for key in data: exec("{0} = '{1}'".format(key,data[key])) This is fragile and breaks with complex data types, aside from being ill-advised, but it does what you've asked.
