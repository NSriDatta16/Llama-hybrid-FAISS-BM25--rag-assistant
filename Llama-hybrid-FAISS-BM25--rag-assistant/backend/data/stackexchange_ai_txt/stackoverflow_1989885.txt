When you want to save different information in the same file, there are two popular ways to go: fixed-length fields and delimited fields. With fixed length field, each part is stored in the same size chunk. So if you wanted to store 5 things, and you store them in 80-character blocks, you can go to offset 160 in the file to read the third one. In delimited files, you put a character (or series of characters) between each piece of data, which can be of any length. Since your data can vary greatly in length, I would suggest using delimited storage, probably with each one on a separate line ("\n" printed between each one).
