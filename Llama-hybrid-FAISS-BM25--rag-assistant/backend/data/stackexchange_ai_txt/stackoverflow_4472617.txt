If AppSettings is a collection then this is not going to work. You need to bind SelectedItem to a scalar value and unfortunately the "Silverlight 3.7" on WP7 doesn't support indexers in bindings. Also, please don't use exceptions as flow control in your program, instead do something like this: try { // If new value is different, set the new value if(!settingsStorage.ContainsKey(key)) { settingsStorage.Add(key, value); valueChanged = true; } else if(settingsStorage[key] != value) { settingsStorage[key] = value; valueChanged = true; } } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine("Exception occured whilst using IsolatedStorageSettings: " + e.ToString()); }
