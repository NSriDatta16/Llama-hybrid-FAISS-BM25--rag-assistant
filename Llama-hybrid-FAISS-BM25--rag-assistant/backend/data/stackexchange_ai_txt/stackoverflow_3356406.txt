Make sure you grasp the different between wrap_content and fill_parent on the layouts. In in elements that are arranged vertically (like a list), you will almost always want wrap_content on the height and fill_parent on the width. Vice versa for elements arranged hortizontally. As Profete162 said, always prefer the dip unit (it can be thought of as an abstracted pixel size). It helps insure that different resolution-densities don't break your hard-coded widths and heights. Ideally, there should never be a mention of dip in your theme code, but what is good in theory is not always pragmatic in practice. These days, you should never use px for the size of something.
