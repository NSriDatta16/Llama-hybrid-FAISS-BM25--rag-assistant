Push Notification not working in Sandbox mode

In our organization we are trying to get familiar with push notifications.Our administrator generated a SSL certificate and an app id which one of my colleagues used for developing an app having push notifications which was working nicely.After that administrator disabled the certificate which stopped push notifications working.Now I am working on the same and for that purpose the certificate is enabled again.But When I used it on my machine in a sample app it didn't work.More strangely I ran the app which was on my colleague's machine and it also doesn't receive any notifications now!!!I tried to replace old certificate by the re-enabled one but that also doesn't do the job.What should I do?
