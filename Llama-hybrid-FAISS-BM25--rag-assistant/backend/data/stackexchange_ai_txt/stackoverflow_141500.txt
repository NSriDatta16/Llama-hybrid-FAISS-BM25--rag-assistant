Visual Studio 2008 source control for small teams

I work on a small web team where I am the only .NET developer currently using Visual Studio 2008 Professional to build and maintain a few web applications. I am about to start training another member of our team so we purchased him a copy of Visual Studio 2008 Professional. I've looked into Visual Source Safe, but I'm dubious. I don't like that is file system based. Ideally, the system would work with SQL Server 2005 and plug into Visual Studio. Windows based solutions are the best because of the IT environment of the organization I work for. What are my options for a source control system? (Forgive me if the answer exists in another thread.)
