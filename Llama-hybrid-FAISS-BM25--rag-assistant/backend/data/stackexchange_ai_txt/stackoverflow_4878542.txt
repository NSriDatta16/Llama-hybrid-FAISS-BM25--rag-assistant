Switching from the in-row types to BLOB types is always a big decision. You have to internalize that the BLOB types ( VARCHAR(MAX) , NVARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) ) are a completely different type internally from the in-row types: They go into a different allocation unit, see Table and Index Organization They cannot be indexed The are subject to different storage options in sp_tableoption They use a completely different handling code path, see Performance comparison of varchar(max) vs. varchar(N) Online operations are not allowed on tables with BLOBs (see Exception at ALTER INDEX ... REBUILD ... WITH (ONLINE= ON) . Reckon that since your table already have BLOBs, this won't be an issue So switching all columns to BLOB types might bring in a lot of side effects you have not considered: impossibility to index the BLOB columns, lack of online operations, general performance degradation due to BLOB inherent slower code etc etc. the most serious hurdle may be the fact that you won't be able to index the columns after making them BLOBs. If this is not a show stopper, then you'll have to test and measure the performance impact. The data modeling concerns other have raised are in general valid, but I understand that often in the real world the theory works only in theory...
