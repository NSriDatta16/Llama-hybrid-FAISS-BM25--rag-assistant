This won't give you a magic answer, but it might make it quick to get an answer without any VBA. 1) Insert a blank row at the top of your document 2) In cell A1, enter the following formula: =CELL("width", A1) 3) Apply the formula to all the other columns by dragging A1's slim-black-crosshair (it appears upon hover on the bottom-right corner of your cell). What you'll get is a rounded Pixel value of each column's width. Then, simply select the the cells in row one for all the columns you want to add and look at the bottom of your Excel window. You should see the sum of your values as you make your selection. For example, if you want to sum the widths of columns A, B and D, select A1 CTRL+click B1 and CTRL+click D1. In the bottom right, you'll see their summed widths. I hope this helps.
