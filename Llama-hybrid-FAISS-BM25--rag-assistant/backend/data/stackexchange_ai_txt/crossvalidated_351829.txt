How long should I run the network at each iteration of the Bayesian optimization? - I chose to run it about a 10th the number of epochs I would till the network was fully trained. Each iteration of BO should do whatever you do when you have a final parameter configuration. If you use early stopping, use early stopping. If you're training for a fixed number of epochs, do that. what should be the term which I optimize? I chose the minimum validation loss during the short training. Should I maybe fit my loss to some exponential decay function and try to estimate the loss at the end of training given that it remains a smooth learning curve. I don't know what this means. how many iterations should I run the Bayesian optimization given that I have about 15 hyperparameters that I am trying to tune ( most of which are continuous over a small range). What's your budget, in terms of computational resources, or time? What's your tolerance for having a sub-optimal network? I can't answer these questions for you. That being said, as a basis of comparison, oure random sampling has nice probability guarantees, so you might use 60 iterations as a baseline for comparison.
