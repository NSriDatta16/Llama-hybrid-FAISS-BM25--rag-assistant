Let's assume "find" bails when it finds the key. Let's further assume that you code the "switch" sensibly, and it quits checking after it finds a match. We will also assume you don't bother to code it to bail on the whole process once all 8 have been found (that would probably be a pain to code up). The "8 find" approach can expect (iow: on average) to perform 50 * 8 = 400 comparisons. The "switch" approach can expect (iow: on average) to perform (8 * 100) - 28 = 772 comparisons. So in terms of comparisons, the 8 finds approach is better. However, the number of comparisons is small enough that you'd be better off just going with the option that is easier to understand. That will probably be the 8 find approach too though.
