How can I calculate the probability of model $g_i$ given a set of $n$ models and AIC values?

Background I have a data set $Y$: set.seed(0) predictor and a set of models g$_i$: fits Problem I can find the best fit using library(plyr) ldply(fits, AIC) I am revising a manuscript with results originally presented as raw AIC values, but I find the actual AIC values are fairly uninformative and difficult to interpret Question Can I calculate the probability of each model given the set of models e.g. g$_i$ $$\frac{P(Y|\textrm{g}_i)}{\sum_{j=1:n}P(Y|\textrm{g}_j)}$$ An approach that most similar to using AIC wins, because I would like to minimize the amount of revisions to the methods and results that will be required. Other considerations: I have considered using ANOVA although this does not appear to have as straightforward of an interpretation as the above, or does it?: anova(fits[[1]],fits[[2]],fits[[3]],fits[[4]],fits[[5]],fits[[6]]) A Bayesian approach would require more work on both implementing statistics and because it would fundamentally change the interpretation from the likelihood interpretation of $P(Y|g)$ to the Bayesian $P(g|Y)$.
