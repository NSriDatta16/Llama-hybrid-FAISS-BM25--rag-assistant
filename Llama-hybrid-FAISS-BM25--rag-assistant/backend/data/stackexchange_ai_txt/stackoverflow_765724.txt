What you need to do is not supported by SharePoint, along with a many other cross-site and cross-farm operations. Let us hope this will improve with future releases. You should check out products from AvePoint . They have many of these capabilities and more, but are reputed to be expensive. They provide an API if you do not have qualms about 3rd party dependencies. You mentioned that DocAve is single-site only but that is not the case. You might want to contact the company to learn more. The programming approach requires you to build all your own scaffolding using the object model API or the web service API. The web service API is easier to use and allows your code to be more location independent, but it lacks too many features if you need a fine level of control. In addition to files and folders you need to worry about users, content types and any other list item your application needs. The object model approach requires the code to run on a machine that is a member of the farm. This means you will need a local "agent" in a multi-farm deployment and create the associated distribution logic. All this may sound daunting and while it is not trivial but can be done.
