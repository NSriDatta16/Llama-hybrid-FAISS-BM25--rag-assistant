Changing languages just for the sake of changing languages is rarely a good idea. If the app is doing its obj then let it do its job. If you've got a corporate mandate to only use C#, that may be a different story (estimate the work involved, give the estimate to management, let them decide to pursue it or write up an exception). Even if there isn't a strong (or any) knowledge of Python across the organization, developers are rather proficient at picking up new languages {it's a survival thing}, so that tends to be less of a concern. Moral of the story, if an app is to be rewritten, there should really be more of a justification to do the rewrite than just to change languages. If you were to add features that would be significantly easier to implement and maintain using another languages library/framework ... good justification. If maintaining the environment/framework for one language is causing a significant operational expense that could be saved by a re-write, cool. "Because our other code is in c#" ... not cool.
