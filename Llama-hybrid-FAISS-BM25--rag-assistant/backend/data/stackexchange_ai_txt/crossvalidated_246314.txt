If this is one of those multi item scales in the social sciences where respondents are asked many very similar questions, you might just use it without the missing item. (I'm talking about those scales that have many more questions than underlying dimensions where you typically perform cronbach's alpha for internal consistency and a PCA with varimax rotation.) There is no hard reason why the scale would only work with 18 items but not benefit from item number 19 and break down as soon as there are only 17 items. One researcher has come up with the 18 items at one point in time and tested their consistency. Since then, other researchers use the same scale and cite him. The only problem I see with dropping an item is replicability. Future researchers will want to use the original scale and not randomly drop an item like you did.
