Elegant way of finding items within a latitude / longitude rectangle in an MySQL database?

I have a MySQL database where each record contains, as well as many other things, a latitude and longitude. At the moment these are of type TEXT, though I would be happy to change this if necessary. One variable each for latitude and longitude, ie latitude: 51.258215 longitude: -0.123456 So what I would like to know is the fastest, most elegant way of getting a list of records when a php script receives four POST variables... co-ords representing the top-left and bottom-right corners of a rectangle on a map..? Are there any ways to get the speed really optimised for this?
