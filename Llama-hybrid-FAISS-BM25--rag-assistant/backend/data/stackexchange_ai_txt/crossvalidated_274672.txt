Clearly you have good statistical intuition, because you are exactly right! Because of correlations between the individual terms, the standard error of the mean of the observations is not an accurate estimate of the error bar on the population mean from time series data. The actual variance of the sample mean $m$ is $$(\delta m)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \left[ g_0 + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{n-k}{n} g_k \right]$$ where $g_{k}$ is the co-variance between $x_i$ and $x_{i-k}$. It turns out to be a bit of a pain to apply this result. If you just plug in the estimated co-variances for the $g_k$, you get quite wrong results, essentially because of correlations between the $g_k$ estimators. There are a number of different ways you can proceed, with various pros and cons. One relatively simple approach without too much downside is to just drop the higher co-variances, for which you don't have good estimates anyway; it turns out that using a cutoff $k_{\rm max} \approx \sqrt{n}$ works out alright. For more discussion of these issues, see papers like Ryo Okui, “Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation of Autocovariances and Autocorrelations with Long Panel Data”, Econometric Theory (2010) 26: 1263 . An earlier comment-er suggested just doing an ARIMA fit and taking the error bar on the mean from the error bar on the mean parameter of the ARIMA model. That's fine if the data are actually well-fit by an ARIMA model. But the approach I am suggesting here is model-independent.
