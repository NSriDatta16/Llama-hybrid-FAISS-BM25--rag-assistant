jquery: update src, update html created by script

This is a strange question, I think... I am embedding a video player using a plugin (from "bitsontherun"). When the page loads, a video is displayed based on the url of the script's src : where "123ABC-DEF456" is the unique id for the video. I would like to be able to reload the script with a new video id, and the player that it creates when a link is clicked. Does anyone have any insight on how to do this. I feel like I should be able to manipulate the DOM, but am unsure what function to use ( getScript() ?). edit I have decided to go another route, using an iframe and updating the src of the iframe with the video id in the query string.
