Xcode 4 has a new feature "Automatic Device Provisioning". It's located in the organizer under library/provisioning profiles. If you have this enabled it will automatically download your provisioning profiles from the apple developer provisioning server and thus you get the error of having duplicates. The easiest way to fix it is to delete all provisioning profiles and press refresh for the "Automatic Device Provisioning". This will load your provisioning profiles from the server and will fix your problem.
