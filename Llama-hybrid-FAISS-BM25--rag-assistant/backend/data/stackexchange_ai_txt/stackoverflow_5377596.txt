I too came across this issue today after upgrading to Win7 and VC++ 2010 pro. I first thought perhaps my manifest was corrupt and what made it worst was this was my second project in VC++ 2010 and the first one worked fine on Win7 and XP. So I came to the conclusion that including InitCommonControls() at the beginning of my program fixed this issue, why? So I added this at the top of my code: #include #pragma comment (lib, "Comctl32.lib") And this in my init code: InitCommonControls(); Plus further to my searching for answers, VC+ 2010 now has the SysLink control in the list of controls, and this is the reason my first project run fine. Add one of these to a dialogbox and as long as code is added to handle a notification the Comctl32.lib and InitCommonControls or InitCommonControlsEx isn't needed? The built program will too run in Win7 and XP as long as a manifest with the common controls is embedded!
