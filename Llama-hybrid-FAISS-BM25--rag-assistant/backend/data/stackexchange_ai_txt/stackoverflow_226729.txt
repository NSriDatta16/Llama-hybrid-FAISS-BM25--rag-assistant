I don't believe that this problem is at all language specific. You could construct similar (flawed) conditional statements in a wide variety of other languages. Also, I don't think that there is a legitimate reason for the conditional statement to be structured this way. As you state in the comment, the statements in the third block will just never be done. You could probably find mistakes like this most effectively with code review. However, since that requires quite a bit of time from at least one developer, you may be better served by developing quality unit tests and inspecting code coverage. In this case, you probably would have noticed that the third portion of the conditional statement was never used.
