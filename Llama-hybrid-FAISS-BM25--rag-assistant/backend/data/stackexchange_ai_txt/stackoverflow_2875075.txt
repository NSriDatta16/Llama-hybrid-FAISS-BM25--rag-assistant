Windows Forms: Unable to Click to Focus a MaskedTextBox in a Non TopLevel Form

Like the title says, I've got a Child form being shown with it's TopLevel property set to False and I am unable to click a MaskedTextBox control that it contains (in order to bring focus to it). I can bring focus to it by using TAB on the keyboard though. The child form contains other regular TextBox controls and these I can click to focus with no problems, although they also exhibit some odd behavior: for example if I've got a value in the Textbox and I try to drag-click from the end of the string to the beginning, nothing happens. In fact I can't use my mouse to move the cursor inside the TextBox's text at all (although they keyboard arrow keys work). I'm not too worried about the odd TextBox behavior, but why can't I activate my MaskedTextBox by clicking on it? Below is the code that shows the form: Dim newReportForm As New Form Dim formName As String Dim FullTypeName As String Dim FormInstanceType As Type formName = TreeView1.SelectedNode.Name FullTypeName = Application.ProductName & "." & formName FormInstanceType = Type.GetType(FullTypeName, True, True) newReportForm = CType(Activator.CreateInstance(FormInstanceType), Form) Try newReportForm.Top = CType(SplitContainer1.Panel2.Controls(0), Form).Top + 25 newReportForm.Left = CType(SplitContainer1.Panel2.Controls(0), Form).Left + 25 Catch End Try newReportForm.TopLevel = False newReportForm.Parent = SplitContainer1.Panel2 newReportForm.BringToFront() newReportForm.Show()
