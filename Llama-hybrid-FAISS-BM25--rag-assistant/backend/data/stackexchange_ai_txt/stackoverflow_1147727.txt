There's no right or wrong here - it depends on what you're trying to achieve. You can safely use static controls when you know your layout is not subject to change (i.e. a grid with a fixed number of columns), or any future possible changes are likely to be of static nature (a new column in your grid). This approach is perfectly fine and obviously faster in the average real world case. If you need flexibility then you need to generate the controls programmatically (i.e. you need to generate a variable number of grids - or any other controls). For flexibility we mean that your layout needs to take into account variable values you won't be able to know till runtime.
