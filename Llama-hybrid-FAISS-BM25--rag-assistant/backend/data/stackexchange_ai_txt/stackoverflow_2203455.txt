The only thing I've had an issue with in the past is passing the wrong Type when calling GetWebResourceUrl. You have to have the Type be a Type that comes from the same Assembly as the Embedded Resource. Using this.GetType() can present problems embedding resources ( as described by Rick Strahl ) Everything else looks ok to me.
