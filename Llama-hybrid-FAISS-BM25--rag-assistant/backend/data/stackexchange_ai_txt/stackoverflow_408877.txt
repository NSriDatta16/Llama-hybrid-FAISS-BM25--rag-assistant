Requirements analysis, specification, design, and documentation will almost never fit into a "template." You are 100% of the time better off by starting with a blank document and beginning to type with a view of "I will explain this in such a way that if I were dead and someone else read this document, they would know everything that I know and see and understand now" and then organizing from there, letting section headings and such develop naturally and fit the task you are specifying, rather than being constrained to some business or school's idea of what your document should look like. If you have to do a diagram, rather than using somebody's formal and incomprehensible system, you're often better off just drawing a diagram that makes sense, with a clear legend, which actually specifies the system you are trying to specify and communicates the information that the developer on the other end (often you, after a few years) needs to receive. [If you have to, once you've written the real documentation, you can often shoehorn it into whatever template straightjacket your organization is imposing on you. You'll probably find yourself having to add section headings and duplicate material, though.] The only time templates for these kinds of documents make sense is when you have a large number of tasks which are very similar in nature, differing only in details. "Write a program to allow single-use remote login access through this modem bank, driving the terminal connection nexus with C-Kermit," "Produce a historical trend and forecast report for capacity usage," "Use this library to give all reports the ability to be faxed," "Fix this code for the year 2000 problem," and "Add database triggers to this table to populate a software product provided for us by a third-party vendor" can not all be described by the same template, no matter what people may think. And for the record, the requirements and design diagramming techniques that my college classes attempted to teach me and my classmates could not be used to specify a simple calculator program (and everyone knew it).
