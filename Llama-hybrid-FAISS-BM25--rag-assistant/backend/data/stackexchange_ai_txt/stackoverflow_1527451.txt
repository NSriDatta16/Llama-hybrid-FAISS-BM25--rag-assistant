CMYK + CMYK = ? CMYK / 2 =?

Suppose there are two colors defined in CMYK: color1 = 30, 40, 50, 60 color2 = 50, 60, 70, 80 If they were to be printed what values would the resulting color have? color_new = min(cyan1 + cyan2, 100), min(magenta1 + magenta2, 100), min(yellow1 + yellow2, 100), min(black1 + black2, 100)? Suppose there is a color defined in CMYK: color = 40, 30, 30, 100 It is possible to print a color at partial intensity, i.e. as a tint. What values would have a 50% tint of that color? color_new = cyan / 2, magenta / 2, yellow / 2, black / 2? I'm asking this to better understand the "tintTransform" function in PDF Reference 1.7, 4.5.5 Special Color Spaces, DeviceN Color Spaces Update: To better clarify: I'm not entirely concerned with human perception or how the CMYK dyies react to the paper. If someone specifies 90% tint which, when printed, looks like full intensity colorant, that's ok. In other words, if I asking how to compute 50% of cmyk(40, 30, 30, 100) I'm asking how to compute the new values, regardless of whether the result looks half-dark or not. Update 2: I'm confused now. I checked this in InDesign and Acrobat. For example Pantone 3005 has CMYK 100, 34, 0, 2, and its 25% tint has CMYK 25, 8.5, 0, 0.5. Does it mean I can "monkey around in a linear way"?
