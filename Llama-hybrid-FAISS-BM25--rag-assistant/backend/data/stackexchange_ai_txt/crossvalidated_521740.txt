For covariance matrices there is a distance metric called Riemannian distance. It's the length of geodesic in the space of positive definite matrices. The geodesic preserves the determinant of the matrix. The definition in Encyclopedia of Distances Section 12.3 is as follows: $$Sym^+(A,B)=\left(\sum_i\log^2\lambda_i\right)^{\frac 1 2},$$ where $\lambda_i$ - eigenvalues of matrix $AB^{-1}$ . For correlation matrices I don't find this metric applicable because they are on their own manifold within symmetric positive definite matrices space where covariance matrices live. So, for instance on this manifold the trace should be constant, not just the determinant. There is a metric of correlation matrices too. It has been suggested in his PhD thesis "A Riemannian Quotient Structure for Correlation Matrices with Applications to Data Science" by Paul David.
