Our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is the foundation for arbitrary customizable tools. It has a PL/SQL front end that can be used to build arbitrary source code quality checks. Yes, it has a command-line version. There are a variety of PL/SQL COTS tools based on DMS that could be used to check quality: Formatter - Cleans up layout. Side effect: static check for legal PL/SQL syntax Source Code Search Engine - enables fast search of indexed source code base. Computes Halstead and Cyclomatic metrics as a side effect of setting up the index. CloneDR - finds and reports duplicated PL/SQL code Test Coverage - determines part of PL/SQL code not executed by tests (ad hoc, unit, or functional tests) All these have command line versions.
