What is your ratio Bug fixing vs Enhancements?

In the spirit of this question I wanted to have a sense of what is the proportion of time split between fixing bugs and implementing new features. If possible try to give an estimate for the product as a whole as opposed to individual developer stats and try to make an average over the course of a typical year. Do provide a general descriptive of the product/project to allow comparison. Specifically : Maturity of project Is it still actively developed or strictly in maintenance ? Size estimate of the product/project Size of team developing it (all inclusive) What is your team score on the Joel test . Ex : approx 80% time spent bug fixes 20% new stuff Mature software (20 years old) Actively developed 1.5M Line of Text, approx 700k - 900k LOC 12-15 actively coding in it. we got 5/12 for sure, some would say 7/12.
