Cross Validation folds in LibSVM

how the folds in cross validation of libSVM are done?, I mean, the splits are done aleatory? for example if I have 100 data and it is 4-fold then when it is an aleatory folding then can be splited like this? 20-45 : fold1 45-70 : fold2 70-95 : fold3 95-20 : fold4 or it make the folds always starting from the first one: 1-25 : fold1 25-50 : fold2 50-75 : fold3 75-100 : fold4 so how can I choose which kind on folding I want to use? Thank you for your answers
