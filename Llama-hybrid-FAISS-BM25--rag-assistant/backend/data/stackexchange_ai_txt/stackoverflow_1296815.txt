I use Akismet , which is really just very similar to an email spam filter, but quite powerful as it continuously builds a Bayesian profile with the combined spams of every site using the service (about 18 million comments per day). Their web service is extremely simple and very fast - just sent the comment over the wire and they will send back a "spam" or "not spam" response. There are existing Akismet libraries for almost every platform. On my site, if the comment passes, I put it in the database, otherwise I just silently ignore it.
