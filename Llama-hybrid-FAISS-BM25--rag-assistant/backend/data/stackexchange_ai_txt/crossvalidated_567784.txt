Deep learning model comparison

I have a question regarding my deep learning model, I have trained 2 models with different hyperparameters, the second model got loss results higher than the first model, first model loss = 0.0047057-best second model loss = 0.0075174-best but when it comes to the predictions, the second model predictions are more satisfying and the predictions MAE is lower does anyone have explanation for this ? as I know the less the loss the better the model, but statistically the second model performs better on the predictions. Thanks
