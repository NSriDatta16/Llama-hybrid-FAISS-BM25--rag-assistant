Different prediction score for two SVM-based classifiers

As a validation study, I use two libsvm-based svm classifier against the same data set. One classifier is libsvm implementation in Rapidminer. Another classifier is Libsvm itself. Both of them assume the same parameter setting. However, the prediction score of these two classifiers are different. What might be reason to cause this kind of difference?
