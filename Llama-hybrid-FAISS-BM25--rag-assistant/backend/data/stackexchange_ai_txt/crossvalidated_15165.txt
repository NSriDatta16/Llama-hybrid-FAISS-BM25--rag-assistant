Assuming the two groups represents two non-overlapping groups of subjects, and all subjects without group are measured at two times, I suggest you turn the problem around to get a perfect multiplicity correction by using binary logistic regression to predict group from the ten measurements. The global null hypothesis tests whether any of the 10 is associate with group, which is another way of saying that there is a group difference for at least one of the 10. Do this whole analysis separately at the two times. Use the likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ test with 10 degrees of freedom. A reference is below. Peter C. O’Brien.
