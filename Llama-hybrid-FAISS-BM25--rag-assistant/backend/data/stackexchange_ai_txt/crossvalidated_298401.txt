Your picture shows the averages of different groups, but not how spread out the data are. You will likely find your answer here: Even though the averages appear to show a different pattern, the data are quite spread out, and the difference is not significant. When you omit the interaction, you have smaller standard errors for the effects you do test, and you find a significant effect. However, in general, you should use p-values cautiously and only for pre-specified hypotheses, not for model comparison.
