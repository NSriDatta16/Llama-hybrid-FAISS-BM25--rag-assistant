Here's where you begin. Insert the specifications as documentation, then do one at a time, testing along the way. # Print instructions to the user ### 'print "xyz"' will output the xyz text. # Start with the variables high = 1000, low = 1, and tries = 1 ### You can set a variable with 'abc = 1'. # While high is greater than low ### Python has a while statement and you can use something like 'while x > 7:'. ### Conditions like 'x > 7', 'guess == number' can also be used in `ifs` below. # Guess the average of high and low ### The average of two numbers is (x + y) / 2. # Ask the user to respond to the guess ### Python (at least 2.7) has a 'raw_input' for this, NOT 'input'. # If the guess was right, print a message that tries guesses were required # and quit the program ### Look at the 'if' statement for this and all the ones below. # If the guess was too high, print a message that says “I will guess lower.” # If the guess was too low, print a message that says “I will guess higher.” # If the user entered an incorrect value, print out the instructions again. I've also added a small comment detailing what language elements you should look in to for each section.
