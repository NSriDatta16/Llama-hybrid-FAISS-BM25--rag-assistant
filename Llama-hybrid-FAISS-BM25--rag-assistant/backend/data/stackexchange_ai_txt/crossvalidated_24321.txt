To give a different opinion: why not include it as a random effect? That should penalize those levels with weak support and make sure their effect size is minimal. That way you can keep them all in without worrying about getting silly predictions. And yes, this is more motivated from a Bayesian view of random effects than the whole "sample of all possible levels" view of random effects.
