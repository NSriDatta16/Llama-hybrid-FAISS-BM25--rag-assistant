Using id attributes as a placeholder for information is common practice and safe, as long as you pay attention to some guidelines: Ids must be unique Ids aren't allowed to start with a number What is more controversial is to use a custom attribute for placeholder. Using jQuery it is very easy to assign and retrieve the value from the attribute. This will make your code easier to read and maintain, however it will break HTML validation.
