Currently, without reverting to cutting-edge (and possibly hacky/unreliable) techniques, your PHP server cannot initiate communications with a page you've already loaded into a web browser. This is a result of the way the HTTP protocol works. One way to solve this would be polling on the "receiving" end for data. Something like a publish-subscribe pattern. One way to do this would be: One client sends data to the server using an HTTP request (XHR aka AJAX) specifying the target for this data (the other client). The server stores this data in a persistent storage (local file, database, etc). The second client periodically sends a request to the server asking if there's any new data for it to consume. This can be done using setInterval and XHR in JavaScript. I would suggest you take a look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe And also, for a cutting edge way to do this, check out Socket.IO: http://socket.io
