what sort of app is this - upload an image on to an existing one for previewing

quite a vague question i'm looking to develop an application that essentially allows the user to upload their company logo and have it appear on an image to simulate what a product might look like with their branding on if that makes sense does this kind of app have a proper name or search term i could work from? ideally there'd be a prebuilt solution as my flash isn't very good..i have an idea to achieve this with say PHP and a combination of jquery and css but i think a flash solution would be more elegant thanks for any pointers!
