Can overfitting occur in Advanced Optimization algorithms?

while taking an online course on machine learning by Andrew Ng on coursera, I came across a topic called overfitting . I know it can occur when gradient descent is used in linear or logistic regression but can it occur when Advanced Optimization algorithms such as "Conjugate gradient", "BFGS", and "L-BFGS" are used ?
