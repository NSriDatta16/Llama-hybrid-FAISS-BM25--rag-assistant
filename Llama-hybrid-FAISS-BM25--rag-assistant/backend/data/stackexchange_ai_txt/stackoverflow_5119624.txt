static initializers must be constant, as your error message indicates. Assign it NULL , then in some other function, test if it's NULL, allocate the resources it needs (some sensible default) and go from there. Ensure you do clean up after you're done, and if this is a threaded environment, I suggest you go a different route put this in other storage that you pass along wherever you need it.
