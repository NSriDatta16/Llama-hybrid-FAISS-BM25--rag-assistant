Using jQuery plugins inside Greasemonkey scripts

I am writing a simple GreaseMonkey script that has a jQuery plugin called hoverIntent embedded in it. (I am embedding it rather than hosting it because it's a very small plugin.) My problem: after the plugin attaches its event handler to a DOM object, the event triggers an error message that says: "jQuery is not defined." Is it a scope issue? Here is my entire script: if(unsafeWindow.console){ var GM_log = unsafeWindow.console.log; } (function($){ //HoverIntent $.fn.hoverIntent=function(f,g){...}; //Removed the plugin code. You can see it in the link at the bottom //of the post. //DOM is ready //Fetch all the rows with arrows $('.arrow') .each(function(){ $(this).hoverIntent(mouseOver,mouseOut); }); //mouseOver function mouseOver(){ //THIS IS WHERE THE ERROR HAPPENS $(this).click(); } //mouseOut function mouseOut(){ //nothing here. } })(unsafeWindow.jQuery); It works fine when I copy paste it, removing all GM specific tags, and run it from my console. And this is the plugin I am embedding .
