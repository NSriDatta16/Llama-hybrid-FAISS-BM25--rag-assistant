I had this same problem, but your code got me thinking. I believe the bug occurs because the item you are clicking is in both lists, and thus ambiguous. So, IE incorrectly decides to move what you are clicking, as well as any parents that are also sortable. The solution I found was to add a 'handle' definition to the shallow list (e.g. "#experienciasProfissionais > li > ul"). This eliminates the ambiguity so that the thing being dragged can only refer to one sortable list.
