Some applications put files into the /Users/Shared-directory. I know it's the standard way to share files between users, but I'm not 100% sure it's thought for application data storage. The there's the /Library*-folder which is thought for systemwide common data, similiar to the /Users/Usernames/Library. But you certainly shouldn't write data to the Application.app-directory. Users without admin rights won't even have the right to write to these directories. * = Or /System/Library. Need to verify.
