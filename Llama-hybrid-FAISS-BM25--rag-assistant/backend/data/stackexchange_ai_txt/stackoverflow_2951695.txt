You can use a LinqDataSource with a Linq-to-SQL model. If Orders has a foreign key field that references Customers table, then the corresponding association will be created for you automatically by Linq-to-SQL designer when you drag out the tables into the designer. If the FK relationship does not exist in the DB, you can still model it in Linq-to-SQL very simply. Once the association is defined, the Orders class acquires a new Property, likely called Customer, that will expose a Customer object. You can then access it either declaratively or programmatically by simply using the dot notation, like so: DataField="Customer.Name"
