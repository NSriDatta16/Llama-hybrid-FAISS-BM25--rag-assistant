There are many possible ways to approach this problem, depending on exactly what data you have and what your goals are. The most standard type of solution would be from the family of Kalman Filters . This is a Bayesian model, which updates our estimate (and uncertainty) for a quantity based on noisy measurements. There are basically three components to the model: Modeling the internal dynamics of the state. In the traffic case, this might say that traffic speeds change slowly over time, but can sometimes decrease very rapidly (e.g. due to an accident). Modeling how external driving forces (which we know about) will affect the state. This could be time of day in the traffic case. Modeling how noisy measurements are generated from the state. Perhaps traffic data comes from large trucks, so we say that measurements will be slight underestimates of the true speed except when the speeds are very low, and we have quantified how noisy the estimates are. You can then plug in your assumptions and get the optimal estimator. Note that the vanilla Kalman filter assumes that all these models are linear, but more complex versions can allow for arbitrarily complicated models.
