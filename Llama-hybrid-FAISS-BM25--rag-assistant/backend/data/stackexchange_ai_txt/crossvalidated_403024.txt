What statistical signifcance test should I use?

I would like to compare the averages of two list of numbers, and see whether one average (from one "system" output) is higher than the average of another in a statistically significant way. I already know which system I want to have a higher average. It does indeed have a higher average (pfjew). However, what is the right statistical significance to test whether the population average for my system is indeed higher? I looked at a variety of tests, such as t-test or Wilcoxon nonparametric test, and they seem to have a null hypothesis that says the systems are identical and that the H1 hypothesis is that the means are not identical. That doesn't quite sound right to me. I think I need: H0: other system is better or equal to my system H1: my system is better I suppose I want a one-tailed test, but can someone direct me better the exact name of the test? Telling me for example what I want to do from here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/ttest.html would be best (I am fine also with Wilcoxon nonparametric test)
