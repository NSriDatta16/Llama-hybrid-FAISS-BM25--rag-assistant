I find that many high performance packages just store the whole matrix, but then only read the upper triangle or lower triangle. They might then use the additional space for storing temporary data during the computation. However if storage is really an issue then just store the n(n+1)/2 elements making the upper triangle in a one-dimensional array. If that makes access complicated for you, just define a set of helper functions. In C to access a matrix matA you could define a macro: #define A(i,j, dim) ((i then you can access your array nearly normally.
