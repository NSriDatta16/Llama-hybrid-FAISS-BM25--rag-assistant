Doesn't that really depends on the complexity of the system, and the in-house conventions? At the moment I am working on a neural network simulator that is incredibly complex, and the accepted style that I am expected to use is: Class definitions in classname.h Class code in classnameCode.h executable code in classname.cpp This splits up the user-built simulations from the developer-built base classes, and works best in the situation. However, I'd be surprised to see people do this in, say, a graphics application, or any other application that's purpose is not to provide users with a code base.
