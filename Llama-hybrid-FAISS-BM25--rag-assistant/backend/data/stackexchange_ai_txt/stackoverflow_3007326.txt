Integrate F# into existing .Net Application

I am interested in leveraging F#'s strengths in the area of parallelism into an existing .Net application. That is-I would like to factor in an F# component that would handle only the concurrent messaging of my application while leaving most of my existing .Net project as is. The existing app would call into the F# component. 1) Is this architecture advisable? 2) If so, are there any examples out there that demonstrate a best practices approach to this design? Thanks, John
