A "sophisticated" idea of doing this/thinking the problem: I've seen this kind of analysis (although for stock prices) done with Independent Component Analysis (see this 1997 study , for example, or this other 2011 study which integrates neural networks to the problem; these studies are only to exemplify, and are not extensive at all). The main idea is that you want to decompose your revenue time series into different independent components so you can then compare them with respect to the "independent components" that form the process (this analysis assumes that the process is made by the same independent components, only that they are weighted differently). Explicitly, you model every revenue $R_i(t)$ of market $i$ as: $$R_i(t)=\sum_{k=1}^Na_{i,k}S_k(t),$$ where $a_{i,k}$ are the weights of the source proccesses $S_k(t)$. The idea is that then you can compare the other features (population, days since launch, etc.) to the source processes (and the weights $a_{i,k}$ which in short tell you "how much of a given source process does the $i$th market has") instead of comparing them directly to the time-series, which is much more enlightening and easy to work with. Of course, in order to use ICA you first have to obtain the time series at each time $t$, which is in fact a problem in the case of incomplete series which complicates the issue and calls for a more sophisticated attack to the problem, such as ICA for incomplete data . However, you said that you want to compare the markets on a day by day basis, so this should not be a problem for the kind of analysis you want.
