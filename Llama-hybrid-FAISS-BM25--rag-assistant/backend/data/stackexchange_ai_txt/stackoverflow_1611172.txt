If you want to have a valid xhtml document then you cannot put a div inside of a paragraph. Also, a div with the property display: inline-block works differently than a span. A span is by default an inline element, you cannot set the width, height, and other properties associated with blocks. On the other hand, an element with the property inline-block will still "flow" with any surrounding text but you may set properties such as width, height, etc. A span with the property display:block will not flow in the same way as an inline-block element but will create a carriage return and have default margin. Note that inline-block is not supported in all browsers. For instance in Firefox 2 and less you must use: display: -moz-inline-stack; which displays slightly different than an inline block element in FF3. There is a great article here on creating cross browser inline-block elements.
