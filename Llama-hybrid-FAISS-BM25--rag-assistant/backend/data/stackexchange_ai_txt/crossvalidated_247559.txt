In the Journal of Quality Technology article " The Usefulness of Monte Carlo Tests ", a similar question was asked. The solution given was based upon a method by Clarke and Evans (1954) "Distance to Nearest Neighbor as a Measure of Spatial Patterns in Biological Populations" Ecology 35, pp. 445â€“453. For each of the N points, the nearest neighbor was found. The statistic evaluated is the sum of those N distances. Small values are used to indicate clustering as a one-sided test. For your test, random locations would be compared to the mining sites. Distances to nearest neighbors is found, and the distances are summed. Replications of random tests are conducted with the observed statistic. The significance level is obtained from the position of the observed statistic in the ordered list. (With 999 trials and the observed statistic, measures as low as .01 can be obtained. Trials would need to increase by factors of ten to increase the levels of significance.) You may want to consider a $\chi^2$ goodness of fit test or Binary Logistic Regression to solve this problem or to give greater meaning to your results. If you want to continue with your coins example, you would need to use a Binomial distribution. To calculate a Z score relative to this distribution based upon proportions, then $$Z=\frac{\left(p-p_0\right)}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 \left(1-p_0\right)}{2}}}$$ where the target proportion is $p_0$ and the process proportion is $p$ when $nP>5$.
