You forgot to return a value when there is failure to find a prime: for div in range(2,candidate//2,1): if candidate % div == 0: prime = False print candidate, "is not prime - divisible by", div return next_prime(candidate) Recursion isn't really suitable here though. It isn't much more elegant than the simple iterative approach. Also, you could overflow the stack if you hit an area where there are lot of non-primes between two consecutive primes.
