How do I organize my code when developing forms to meet the following requirements?

I'm simply trying to figure out the correct way to lay out the architecture for my forms to meet the following requirements: The form must have server side validation. If a user is filling out a form on domain.com/register and the form doesn't pass server side validation, they should be brought back to domain.com/register with the errors displaying. (continued from point #2) If the user is brought back to domain.com/register to fix validation errors, the data they have already entered in to the inputs should automatically display. If a user clicks back or forward on the form page the browser should not throw the "Confirm Form Resubmission" warning. I'm a bit confused on where the form submit should be posting to. Should the form on domain.com/register post to a different page that simply handles the validation? If so, how do I pass the validation errors and inputed data back to domain.com/register? Or, should the form be posting to itself? If so, how do I prevent the browser from throwing the "Confirm Form Resubmission" warning when clicking the back or forward button?
