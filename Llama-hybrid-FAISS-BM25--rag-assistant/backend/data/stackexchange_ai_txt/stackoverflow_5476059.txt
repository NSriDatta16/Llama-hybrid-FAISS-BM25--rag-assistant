Handling Multiple Roles in MVC - Action-based Accessibility

I currently have a project that I seem to have ran into an issue regarding Roles and thought I would get some opinions on how to best handle the problem. The system will require editable, flexible roles that control not only the access of specific areas, but also the use of system functions (Adding Users, Editing Users, Viewing Reports etc.) The system currently allows users to have multiple roles, each of those roles has explicitly defined areas of access/actions, for example: Role A can access areas 1,2,3 and can Add Users. Role B can access areas 1,5,7 and can Modify Users. Role C can access areas 4,6 and only View Users. so a User could be in Roles A and C, and thus access : 1,2,3,4 and 6, and could Add and View Users. My first solution was to create a dictionary that would store all of the possible areas of access/access options into a Dictionary like so: Dictionary then when it is instantiated it pulls all of the properties from the database and then iterates through the roles to determine if they are accessible. All of that currently works just fine - however the project is quite Javascript/jQuery intensive so many of these options are called by client-side functions. I am trying to avoid having to wrap all of these client side functions with: So basically, I am wondering about the following things: After a user logs in, what is the best way to store this Dictionary? Statically? In the Session? What would be the best method of storage such that the Dictionary will be easily accessed in the View? (As I currently see no way around wrapping my client-side functions) Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated!
