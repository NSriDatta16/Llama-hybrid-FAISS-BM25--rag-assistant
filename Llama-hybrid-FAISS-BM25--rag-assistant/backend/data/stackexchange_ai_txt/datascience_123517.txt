Answer from Bard - The confusion matrix shows the following: There were 200 actual fraud transactions, and the model correctly predicted 200 of them as fraud (true positives). There were also 300 actual non-fraud transactions, and the model incorrectly predicted 300 of them as fraud (false positives). To stop one fraud transaction, the model will block 5 non-fraud transactions. This is calculated as follows: Number of non-frauds blocked / Number of frauds stopped = 300 / 200 = 1.5 The answer choices are: 19: This is the number of non-frauds blocked if the model predicts all transactions as fraud. This is not a good measure, because it will block a lot of legitimate transactions. 5: This is the correct answer. It is the number of non-frauds blocked per one fraud stopped. 3.5: This is the average of 19 and 5. 1.5: This is the number of non-frauds blocked per one actual fraud. This is not a good measure, because it does not take into account the false positives.
