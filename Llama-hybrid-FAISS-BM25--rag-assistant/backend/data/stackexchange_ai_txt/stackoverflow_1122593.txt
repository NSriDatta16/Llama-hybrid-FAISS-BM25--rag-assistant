In A.h have you actually got the extern declaration within the actual class A? Your question currently says this in words but then your code snippet suggests it is at file level. The only way I can get the error you are talking about i.e. "storage class specified for foo" is for the following in A.h: class A { public: extern std::string foo; }; Perhaps this is your problem? Edit: Looking at your own answer I think this is what you've done. You want to replace extern with static and then define that static in A.cpp with a line like std::string A::foo; You can then subsequently access it in other places as A::foo eg. std::cout
