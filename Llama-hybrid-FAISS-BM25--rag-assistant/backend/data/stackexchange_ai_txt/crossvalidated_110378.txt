SVM in R package e1071

I am trying to use SVM to make a prediction (True or False) on a dataset with many independent variables. I am wondering how I can identify the most useful variable in making the prediction. I understand that there is a function that allows me to calculate the "weights" of the variables in R package e1071 . w=t(model$coefs)%*% model$SV But I am not sure how I can decide which are the important variables, based on these weights.
