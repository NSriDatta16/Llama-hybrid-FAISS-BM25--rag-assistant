In this case, it is parameters. Parameters are random in subjective Bayesian thinking and are uncertain in objective Bayesian thinking. For a bivariate normal distribution, you would have five dimensions. You would have both means, the variances and the one covariance which is identical to the other covariance and so does not get separate treatment. If your posterior would be a Polya distribution for classification purposes, then you would have one parameter per variable. With one hundred features you would want to use some other algorithm if this one is not recommended for more than nineteen.
