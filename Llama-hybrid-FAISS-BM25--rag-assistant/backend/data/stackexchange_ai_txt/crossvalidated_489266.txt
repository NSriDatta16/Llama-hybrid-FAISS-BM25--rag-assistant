Which categorical variable encoding should I use if I want the model intercept to have the interpretation of the global mean?

In a mixed effects model $$ y_{ij} = \beta_{00} + \beta_{01} x_{1i} + \beta_{02} x_{2i} + \beta_{03} x_{3i} + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$ where $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are dummy variables coding the levels of a discrete (multinomial) variable $\tilde{x}$ that has more than two levels (here four), I want to give the intercept $\beta_{00}$ the interpretation of the (global) population mean, which is $E(y_{ij})$ . Right now the covariates are coded in a way that the intercept is interpreted as the mean of the reference category of $\tilde{x}$ . Is there a way to achieve this? I have found a good overview on effect coding, but this type of mean coding is not part of it. Edit: I just remembered how to do this for a variable $\tilde{x}$ that has two categories only. Then we have the model $$ y_{ij} = \beta_{00} + \beta_{01} x_{1i} + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$ where the Dummy $ x_{1i}$ is defined to be $(1-p)$ if $\tilde{x} =1$ and it is $(-p)$ if $\tilde{x} =0$ , where $p$ is the proportion with $\tilde{x}=1$ . Edit 2 : Following the reply by Robert Long , deviation coding can be used when the number of observations for each level of $\tilde{x}$ are the same. However I am looking for a solution for multinomial $\tilde{x}$ possible with unequal class probabilities. Here is some code to implement deviation coding with multinomial $\tilde{x}$ demonstrating that this coding does not estimate the global mean. I suspect some sort of category weighting on the deviation coded dummies is needed instead (like I did for the two-category case above). # Code to assess deviation coding for multinomial $xt$ library(MASS) library(dplyr) n = 1000 set.seed(13) xt = rmultinom(n, 1, c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)) xt = as.factor( apply( t(t(xt) * c(1,2,3)), 2, sum) ) X % coef() # default treatment coding contrasts(xt) % coef() Edit 3 : Originally the question was titled "Which effect coding (categorical encoding) to use if I want the model intercept to have the interpretation of the global mean?" The title wrongfully suggested that my objective could be reached by effect coding alone . The answer by Robert Long applies to balanced categories and then deviation coding should be used.
