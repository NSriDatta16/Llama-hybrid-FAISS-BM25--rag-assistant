I was doing something similar a while ago, serving files through php (in my case, not to rename them, but to check that the person downloading them was logged in and was allowed to see those files). I found that pdf downloads didn't work in IE unless I also added these headers: header('Pragma: public'); header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); I'm not sure why. Experiment and see what happens.
