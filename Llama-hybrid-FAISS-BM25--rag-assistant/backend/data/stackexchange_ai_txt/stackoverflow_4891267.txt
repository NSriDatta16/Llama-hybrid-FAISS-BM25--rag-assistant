Android SDK setText confusing char[] element with int

I'm still rather new to Java programming, so maybe there is an obvious answer to this but I've searched my code and the web and can't find the root of this problem. I have created this method in a layout file for my application: public void setNumLabels(char[] labels){ int niCC = getChildCount(); for(int c = 0;c The problem I'm having is that the compiler (and apparently Dalvik ) sees " labels[c*3+rc] " in the setText as an int instead of a char. What am I missing? For now, I've read the char[] element into a String and used that for setText but that seems kinda inelegant.
