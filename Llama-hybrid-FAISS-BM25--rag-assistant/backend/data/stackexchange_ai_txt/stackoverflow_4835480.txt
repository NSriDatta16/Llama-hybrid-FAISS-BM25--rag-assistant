See the documentation on binding parameters in Firefox's documentation for storage . You should never try to construct SQL statements on the fly with values inserted in them. By binding the parameters, you prevent possible SQL injection attacks since a bound parameter can never be executed as SQL. var statement = dbConn.createStatement("SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = :row_id"); statement.params.row_id = 1234;
