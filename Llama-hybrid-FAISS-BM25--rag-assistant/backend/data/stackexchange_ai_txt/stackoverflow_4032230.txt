How to extract words from text as per the context

I want to extract relevant words from a text statement provided by the user. eg. For a question "How many sides are there in a rectangle?" The words should be 'rectangles' , 'sides', 'many' , 'how'. We've discovered that what exactly I'm aiming to do is a NLP Question answer system. But right now I want to only extract the required keywords from the question, The domain of the questions is not very vast. I've come across various data mining tools but not very sure if they actually will be useful for this. They seem to be a bit too advanced or not exactly related. Please let me know if there is any tool that suits the requirement or should I go on and try coding myself. Please provide any kind of pointers, that you think might help.
