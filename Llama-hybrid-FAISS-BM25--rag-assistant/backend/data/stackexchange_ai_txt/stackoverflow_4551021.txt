Adding to SUBDIRS has no effect for any TEMPLATE other than subdirs, and you cannot have multiple TEMPLATEs in a single .pro file. In other words, you can't have a single .pro file to both build some binaries and invoke some subdirs projects. You need one top-level .pro file which only contains subdirs. For example, your test.pro could be: TEMPLATE = subdirs SUBDIRS = test1 test2 ... and you would then have subdirectories for test1 and test2. If you don't want to reorganize your code into a subdirectory, you can also put the names of .pro files (instead of directory names) into SUBDIRS. For example, your test.pro could be: TEMPLATE = subdirs SUBDIRS = test1.pro test2 ... where test1.pro may exist in the same directory as test.pro, and have the usual TEMPLATE=app stuff.
