so in practise your MCMC parameter samples are fed into your model to generate many realisations of the outcome for your particular $x_t$ .see eg stan generated quantities . Then you are free to use any density estimator to create a smooth density. Though most use cases work directly with the samples of the outcome... So why do you need the probability density of the outcome?
