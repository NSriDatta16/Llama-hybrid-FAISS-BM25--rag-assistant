Multiple (>1500) timelines- which model to use?

I'm new to Data Science ( I only have quarterly numbers for about 20 years, so my timeline data isn't very wide- but I do have timelines for about 1,500 different cities/states. Most of the research on time-series data focuses on a single very wide timeline and trying to predict future data points. I'm instead trying to predict how many quarters it will take for a dip to recover. Edit- some clarity on what I'm trying to do here: Here is a small sample of the type of data I'm working with: idx Q12000 Q22000 Q32000 Q42000 Q12001 Q22001 Q32001 Q42001 Q12002 Q22002 Q32002 Q42002 0 4085280.0 4114911.0 4108089.0 4111713.0 4055699.0 4076430.0 4043219.0 4039370.0 4201158.0 4243119.0 4231823.0 4254681.0 1 21226.0 21566.0 21804.0 22072.0 21924.0 23232.0 22748.0 22258.0 22614.0 22204.0 22500.0 22660.0 2 96400.0 102000.0 98604.0 97086.0 96354.0 103054.0 97824.0 95958.0 115938.0 123064.0 120406.0 120648.0 3 23820.0 24116.0 24186.0 23726.0 23504.0 23574.0 23162.0 23078.0 22306.0 22334.0 22152.0 22080.0 4 7838.0 7906.0 7714.0 7676.0 7480.0 7520.0 7102.0 6722.0 8324.0 8166.0 8208.0 8326.0 Is this appropriate for an RNN or CNN? I've not seen any examples of them being used on this type of problem- but I'm also not sure what this type of problem is called, so maybe my searching isn't hitting the right keywords. Edit: Some clarity on what I'm trying to do: I'm looking at economic data for the past two recessions. Specifically, the number of jobs in the economy (see the third chart at this blog post calculatedriskblog.com/2012/05/â€¦). But I have specific job number breakdowns by industry (as defined by the BLS)- so I have one time-series for each industry. For my target, I'm trying to predict how long it will take for an industry to achieve its peak job numbers before a recession. I know that's confusing, so here is a chart that hopefully will make it more clear: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jyztzjjcslwrkye/Screenshot%20from%202020-12-30%2018-12-45.png?dl=0 My target is the distance between the peak and the recovery.
