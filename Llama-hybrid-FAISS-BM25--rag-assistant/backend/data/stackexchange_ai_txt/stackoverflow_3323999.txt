insn-modes.c should not be gigantic or filled with whitespace; genmodes is malfunctioning. I don't know why it would fail that way, but I'd be very curious to have a look at insn-modes.c (if you put it in a .zip file that should shrink it down to the point where you can reasonably upload it somewhere and edit the URL into your question). Manually stripping all the extra whitespace out of the file ( tr -s ' \r\n\t\v\f' ' ' ) may get you something that can be compiled. EDIT: I looked at the min-insn-modes.c you uploaded, and I think Bryan is right, there's a bug in tagged_printf : every time it's called, it's emitting something like 7 million space characters. Bryan's change should get you past this hurdle, or you could help investigate a little further by changing the definition to this: #define tagged_printf(FMT, ARG, TAG) do { \ int count_ = printf (" " FMT ",", ARG); \ printf ("\t/* %s [%d], */\n", TAG, count_); \ } while (0) That should also make your build succeed, and I'd like to see min-insn-modes.c with that change made. (No need for insn-modes.c as well.) ADDITION: Please take a look into emit_insn_modes_h() function. It also contains printf with %n specifier which needs to be modified similarly to above: int count_ = printf (" %smode,", m->name); Without this change insn-modes.h is also gets filled with a huge amount of spaces.
