Is your personal method more reliable than the self-reported information (SRI)? If so, then forget about the self-reported information. If your method does not make use of the SRI then you could specify the SRI as a model predictor (as a control variable). First thing I would do is to cross-tabulate the 2 variables - Eventually you could specify another logistic model of the matching proba. Or you could also use a multinomial logistic regression with 3 modalities: (1) FTB (The 2 methods are in agreement); (2) Not FTB (The 2 methods are in agreement); (3) Uncertain (The 2 methods disagree).
