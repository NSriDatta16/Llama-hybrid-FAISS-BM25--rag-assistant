PHP Command Line running, zend framework set up problem

Im trying to learn how to set up a Zend framework web application from scratch. Ive been using Magento and I understand how powerful Zend is, but im over my head it seems like. So I bought a book, developing web applications with Zend 1.8 by Keith Pope, and I cant even follow past the first chapter. The thing that is confusing the hell out of me is the whole command line deal. Here is a passage from the book -- Once we have downloaded the Zend Framework release package, we need to do some basic installation before we can start creating our application. First, create a new directory within your web server's document root, from which the application will be served. The examples in this chapter use the directory name of helloZend. Next, copy the library and bin directories from the release package into the newly created directory. The library directory contains all of the Zend Frameworks source files, and the bin directory contains the command line interface for the Zend Framework. The Zend Framework is now installed and ready for use! Creating the project structure We are now ready to start creating the directory structure for our project. In order to do this, we are going to use the command line interface provided by the Zend Framework. This interface uses the Zend_Tool component that provides a whole host of commands that makes it very easy to get up and running with the Zend Framework in just a few minutes. In order to create the project structure, open up your command line and change into the hellozend directory, and then run the following command: For Windows users: bin\zf.bat create project For Linux and Mac users: bin/zf.sh create project Ok so Ive done all that. But up above in first part he says upload it to your web server, did that already. But then "open up your command line", how exactly do I do this? The only command line I understand I can access is Terminal, do I do something with Terminal or??? (Im on a mac) - I tried navigating straight to bin/zf.sh on my webserver and it brought up a what do you want to open this link with, I chose terminal and nothing happened. Can someone clarify this for me? I realize this may be a stupid question, but I have zero experience working with non live servers and what not....
