Laplace smoothing and Dirichlet prior

On the wikipedia article of Laplace smoothing (or additive smoothing), it is said that from a Bayesian point of view, this corresponds to the expected value of the posterior distribution, using a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter $\alpha$ as a prior. I'm puzzled about how that is actually true. Could someone help me understand how those two things are equivalent? Thanks!
