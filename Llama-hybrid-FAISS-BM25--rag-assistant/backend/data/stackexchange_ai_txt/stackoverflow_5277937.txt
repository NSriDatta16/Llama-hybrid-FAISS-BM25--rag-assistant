I assume you are talking about the yellow infobar style notification like page2rss uses . There is no official support for such a notification. They have it implemented in HTML on their site and trigger it based on browser user agent. I would recommend against implementing notifications that mimic chrome design and make users think it is a notification from the browser though. Just have a download button next to a Chrome icon that asks the user to install. Update: Chrome now supports inline installation which makes it very easy to check if an extension is installed and if not install with just a couple of clicks. Update 2: Inline installation is no longer available .
