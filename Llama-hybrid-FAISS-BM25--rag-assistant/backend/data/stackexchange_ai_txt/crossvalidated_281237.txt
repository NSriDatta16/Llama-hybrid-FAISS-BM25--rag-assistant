Communicating confidence in an R forecast's correctness with non-mathematicians

I work for a software company that is building its first data science application, a program which forecasts sales based on previous sales. We have certain groups within the organization who are asking for assurances that the forecasts are "correct": in the past they have run into data models that were poorly explained which shook their confidence. Our current plan is to capture the data for a forecast and try and recreate the forecast using the tool this application is replacing, probably some kind of spreadsheet. Are there better strategies than this? Do any of them not involve learning a bunch of maths as the first step?
