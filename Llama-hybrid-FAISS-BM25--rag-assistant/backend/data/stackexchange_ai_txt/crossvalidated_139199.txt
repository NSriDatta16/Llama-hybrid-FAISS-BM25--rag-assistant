I can't post comments yet, but I have the following remark. With multivariate data, I usually think of different "types" of data, e.g. a mixture of bool, multiselection, or floating point data ( here it is called mixed-variate). As I see it, the input of different audio signals is therefore not multivariate, but multidimensional, because you probably have same data type (real valued data) for all channels. I think most of the basic RNN can handle highdimensional time series inbut. See e.g. here . Maybe a combination of the two above links will lead to a reasonable algorithm.
