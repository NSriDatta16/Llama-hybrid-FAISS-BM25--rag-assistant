You need to create an ad-hoc distribution profile through the Apple Provisioning portal . You also need to register the device UDID as a test device. Than you can send your tester the provisioning profile and the application bundle, which will allow them to deploy by simple drag/drop to iTunes. Note that you can specify up to 100 devices in an ad-hoc provisioning profile and those devices count against the per-year quota of test devices.
