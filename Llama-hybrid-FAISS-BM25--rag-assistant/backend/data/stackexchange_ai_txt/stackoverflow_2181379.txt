If you're using a (MAX) data type, then anything above 8K goes into row overflow storage, not the in-page storage. So you just need to put in enough data to get it up to the 8K for the row, making that take up the in-page allocation for the row, and the rest goes into row-overflow storage anyway. There's some more here . If you want to pre-allocate everything, including the row overflow data, you can use something akin to (example does 10000 bytes): SELECT CONVERT([varbinary](MAX), REPLICATE(CONVERT(varchar(MAX), '0'), 10000))
