Classification in noise

I'm new to machine learning but am interested in decoding applications like the Higgs Boson challenge on Kaggle. I just wondered, what are the best algorithms or approaches for classifying such a small signal in large amounts of noise? I think supervised and unsupervised are equally fine to use for my project, but hearing about your thoughts in general would help a lot! I wanted to start with the Higgs Boson challenge to explore machine learning methods for improving discovery significance of scientific data. The experiment and data are available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson . The code used by the winner was released here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/forums/t/10425/code-release . I know the basic theory of supervised and unsupervised learning, and have studied and used Linear Regression and SVM. I've read about neural networks also but on a basic approach level. I'm just learning about deep learning coming from the natural sciences, to improve data analysis, and found SVM very useful but otherwise don't know more advanced techniques.
