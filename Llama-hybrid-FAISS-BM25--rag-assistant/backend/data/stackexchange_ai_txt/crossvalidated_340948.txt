Continuous Markov Chains: Deriving the Transition Matrix from the Generator Matrix

A continuous-time Markov Chain has generator matrix, $$ Q = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & -4 \\ \end{pmatrix} $$ (i) Exhibit the transition matrix of the embedded Markov chain. (ii) Exhibit the holding time parameter for each state. I'm struggling to understand a lot of the methods and was hoping someone could show me how this works/walk me through it? I assume I need to start with making sure $Q$ is diagonalizable but I'm not really sure how to express the following; $P(t) = e^{tQ} = Se^{tD}S^{-1}$ But I've never seen a matrix be in the exponential.. I know $D$ is the diagonal of of eigenvalues but I don't know how to express $e^{tD}$. Thank you in advance for your help!
