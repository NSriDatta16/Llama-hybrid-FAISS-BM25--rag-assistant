Disable full window drag

when I use AWTUtilities.setWindowOpaque(this, false); to make my JFrames' background transparent, you can change the location of my JFrame by dragging it anywhere in the window. My problem is, that I have Objects I want to use for drag and drop on this Frame, but when the JFrame moves when I try to drag an object its impossible to drop it anywhere else. Is there any way to solve this problem? By the way, I am on Mac using Mac OS 10.6.6 Thanks for your help!
