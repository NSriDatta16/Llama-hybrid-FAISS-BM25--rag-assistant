In principle, the only limiting factor to how large input sizes you can handle is the amount of memory on your GPU. Then of course, larger input sizes will take longer time to process. EfficientNet uses an image size of 600x600 pixels in its largest setting, and Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection and Mask R-CNN , which perform object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively, resize the input image so that their scale (shorter edge) is 800 pixels. There is an interesting trade-off between input size, network depth (the number of layers) and network width (the number of feature maps in a layer), which is the reason why you usually only use moderately large input sizes. The optimal balance between these parameters has been analyzed and exploited in EfficientNet , leading to a series of new convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with image classification performance superior to previous CNNs (see image).
