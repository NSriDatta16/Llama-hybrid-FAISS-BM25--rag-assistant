There is no "current" organization in an ASP.NET page as long as you do not have an initialized CrmService. You will of course want it to be the organization that is being used within the browser instance from which the page was called, but that will have to be passed in the page's QueryString from which you can get it via Request.QueryString["orgname"] (or whatever you call the QueryString parameter).
