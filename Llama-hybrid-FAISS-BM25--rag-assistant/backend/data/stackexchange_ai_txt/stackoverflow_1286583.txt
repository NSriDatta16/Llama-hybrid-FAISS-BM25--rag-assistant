Some people suggested to use serialization. Beware that there are a number of disadvantages to serialization. The versioning problem. If you change something in the classes that are serialized, then serialized files written with the old version of your program can't be read easily anymore. You don't know the exact file format. It will be really hard if you want to write a different program later, possibly in a different programming language, that needs to read the file. Serialization is not well-suited for long-term storage. I would suggest using a small, embedded database instead. (An embedded database is a database that runs in the same process as your program). Note that Sun's Java includes Java DB , which is a version of Apache Derby. There's also HSQLDB , which is another small and pure Java database that can be used as an embedded database.
