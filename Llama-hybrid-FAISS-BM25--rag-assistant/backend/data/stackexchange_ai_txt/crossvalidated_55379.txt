This is actually a widespread situation, for example in industrial quality control, you want to decide whether a batch of product is fit for sale. Also medical diagnosis (if it isn't a differential diagnosis) often faces the same problem. So-called one-class or unary classifiers address this. The idea is to model the "in" class independently of possible other classes. In chemometrics, SIMCA is a popular approach to this. Basically, you compress your class into a PCA models and then develop a boundary outside which you deem it sufficiently improbable that the case belongs to that class. (For multiple independent classes, you do this for each class separtely.) D.M. Tax: One-class classification -- Concept-learning in the absence of counter-examples, Technische Universiteit Delft, 2001 develops a one-class SVM.
