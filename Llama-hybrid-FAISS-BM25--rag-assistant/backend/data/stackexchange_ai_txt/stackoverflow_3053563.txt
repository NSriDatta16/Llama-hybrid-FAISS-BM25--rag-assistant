Old thread but I thought I could expose my method here anyway, maybe it could help someone. This is the way I define __autoload() in my website entry point /path/to/root/www/index.php for example : function __autoload($call) { require('../php/'.implode('/', explode('___', $call)).'.php'); } All PHP files are in organized in a tree /path/to/root/php /Applications /Website Server.php /Model User.php /Libraries /HTTP Client.php Socket.php And classes name are : Applications___Website___Server Model___User Libraries___HTTP___Client Libraries___Socket It is fast and if the file is not present, then it will crash and your error log will tell you which file is missing. It may seem a bit harsh but if you try to use the wrong class, it is your problem. NB : it was for PHP 5
