To my understanding, the number in fuzzy logics means a degree of membership (quantifying to what extent something belongs to some class). An example could be a somewhat cloudy sky, and you say the weather is somewhat sunny. This is not to be confused with a probability. Here the number means the extent to which something might happen (or the degree to which some agent thinks something is true; we're now talking about Bayesian probabilities here). An example can be person claiming "I think it will rain tomorrow with a 90 percent certainty.". Note that we are dealing with a binary proposition (either it rains, or it doesn't rain), although the probability of the variable being true is a real number between 0 and 1. And here 0.75 doesn't mean it will rain more than at 0.25, it's just more likely that it rains at all. Note that both concepts can be combined. For example you can have uncertainty over the degree of sunniness of the weather. Maybe you're sitting in the basement and only get some indirect sunlight. Then you have a probability distribution over a continuous variable in the intervall $[0,1]$ (like a uniform distribution, or a truncated Gaussian). However, using my interpretation it doesn't make sense to call the number in fuzzy logics "degree of belief".
