You could also use this to check if the Visual Studio Designer is running the code: public static bool DesignMode { get { return (System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName == "devenv"); } } Then in Form_Load: if (!DesignMode) { // Run code that breaks in Visual Studio Designer (like trying to get a DB connection) } However, this is less elegant than using the LicensManager.UsageMode , but it works (until Microsoft changes the name of the process Visual Studio runs under).
