You can create all nice wrapper functions that wrap existing event-handlers and supply them with object ids, but you will still have to store the resulting delegate explicitly to unsubscribe the event. The only nice way I see to do it without ugly wrappers is using reactive extensions. It essentially allows you to transform your event to an IObservable, and then you can apply any operator to the resulting IObservable (for example Select will do the job in your case). But it's still no that elegant.
