You have plenty of potential solutions, the easiest one is decision tree models like Random Forest. Then, you can try more complex models based on LSTM or Reinforcement Learning. Here are 2 code examples using RF: https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-predict-stock-prices-change-with-random-forest-in-python-f707e101d5c4 https://tcoil.info/predict-stock-price-trend-with-machine-learning-random-forest-scikit-python/ Here are 2 code examples using RL: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/reinforcement-learning-stock-price-prediction/ https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-automated-stock-trading-f1dad0126a02
