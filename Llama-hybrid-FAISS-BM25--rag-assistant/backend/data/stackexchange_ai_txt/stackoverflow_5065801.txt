What are the consequences of adding a column to an existing HIVE table?

Suppose that a couple hundred Gigs after starting to use HIVE I want to add a column. From the various articles & pages I have seen, I cannot understand the consequences in terms of storage space required (double ?) blocking (can I still read the table in other processes) ? time (is it quick or as slow as a MysqL change ?) underlying storage (do I need to change all the underlying files ? How can it be done using RCFile ?) Bonus to whoever can answer the same question on structs in a HIVE column.
