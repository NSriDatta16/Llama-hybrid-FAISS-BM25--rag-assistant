What algorithm/approach is best for a multiclass classifier where there are a significant amount of misclassifications in the source data?

I am using document embeddings (100 dimensions) to train a classifier on text data, however, I am getting poor results which I am attributing to the fact that there are a large proportion of misclassifications in the source data used to train the model (~10%) I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how best to deal with this issue and the best algorithm to use?
