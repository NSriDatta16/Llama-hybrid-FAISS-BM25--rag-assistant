Getting Requester Info In WCF Service

I am working on a service that will support mobile applications on the Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and WP7 platforms. These applications will connect to various REST-based WCF services that I am working on. I would like to see what information a client application passes to my service. In an effort to do this, I've written the current operation in my WCF service: [OperationContract] [WebGet(UriTemplate = "/GetRequesterInfo")] public string GetRequesterInfo() { OperationContext context = OperationContext.Current; string message = "Session ID: " + context.SessionId; return message; } When I call this code, I notice that the SessionId is an empty string. In addition, I would like to get as much information about the client as possible. For instance, if this were ASP.NET, I could use the HttpRequest object and get: HttpMethod IsLocal IsSecureConnection RequestType Url.AbsoluteUri Url.OriginalString UserAgent UserHostAddress UserHostName Browser.Id Browser.Browser Browser.CanInitiateVoiceCall Browser.ClrVersion.Minor Browser.Cookies Browser.EcmaScriptVersion Browser.GatewayVersion Browser.InputType Browser.MobileDeviceManufacturer Browser.MobileDeviceModel While there are more properties, I'm sure you get the idea. This leads me to several questions: How do I get the request thread associated with the request to my WCF service? I thought that's what OperationContext was for. But I'm open to correction. How do I get all of the property name / values associated with a request to a WCF service? Am I asking for something that makes sense or am I off my rocker? It seems like I should be able to get some info about the requesting client.
