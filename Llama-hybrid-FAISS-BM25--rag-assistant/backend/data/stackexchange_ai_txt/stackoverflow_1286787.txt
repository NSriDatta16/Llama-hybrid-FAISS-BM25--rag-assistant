Any approach to peek memory data structure of C/CPP application?

... like how many memory consumed by what / how many objects, as in JVM heap dump file. Our service process is consuming remarkable memory, which is being complained by others living in a same OS. The applications structure is weird, it leveraged reverse JNI to call java interface from c++ code, also it's a network application, all these make it almost impossible to use tools like valgrind or purify. Any suggestion would be appriciated.
