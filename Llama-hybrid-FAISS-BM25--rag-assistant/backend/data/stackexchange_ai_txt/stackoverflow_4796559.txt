Dynamic Grid Measurements in WPF - Rendering Controls

I am working on a Drag and Drop Editor that is creating items and adding them dynamically to a WPF Canvas. For each item, it is creating a dynamic grid and addign that to the canvas. I need layout state information about each one of these grids as it is added so that I know its coordinates on the canvas. The problem I am having is that when I try to access the Height/ActualHeight/RenderedSize information of each of these Grids that I add, it always turns out to be 0. I am assuming that I might need to render the items so that the new state information is registered, but I am not quite sure how to do this. I have seen support through the InvalidateXXXX() methods that are provided, but I am not sure if/or which one I should be using. there is also an UpdateLayout() function, but I am not sure if this is what I need. Here is the code that I have running through a loop and adding Grids, which represent LineItems in the Canvas. /*Initialize Grid Layout*/ Grid newGrid = new Grid(); newGrid.MinHeight = 50; newGrid.Width = PreviewWindow.ActualWidth; newGrid.Background = Brushes.Beige; newGrid.ShowGridLines = true; /*Define Column Definitions*/ List columns = new List (fieldItemList.Count); foreach (ColumnDefinition column in columns) { ColumnDefinition labelColumn = new ColumnDefinition(); newGrid.ColumnDefinitions.Add(labelColumn); newGrid.ColumnDefinitions.Add(column); } /*Define Row Definitions*/ RowDefinition row = new RowDefinition(); newGrid.RowDefinitions.Add(row); int colCount = 0; for (int i = 0; i There is reference to a StackPanel, all of these Grids are being added to a stack panel, and they will eventuall be arranged by the coordinates(which I currently cannot grab). The problem is right now it is adding all these items to a list that will need to be sorted by the Top coordinate, but since the Top coordinate is 0, it will not sort correctly.
