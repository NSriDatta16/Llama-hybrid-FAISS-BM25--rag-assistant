How to produce to standardised regression coefficients in R for multivariable logistic regression

I am very new to R and epidemiology and am trying to create a model of how metabolic syndrome is associated with disease 'Y'. I have been asked to calculate a standardised odds ratio for the effect of BMI on 'Y'. My model is > METABOLICfit exp(coefficients(beta(METABOLICfit))) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.002283022 1.034872 8.693510e-78 1.000000 SEX.z 0.982666829 1.032443 5.783098e-01 1.793081 AGE_2018.z 1.073146291 1.034939 7.811410e+00 1.040626 DM.z 1.170444708 1.022757 1.090366e+03 1.000000 HTN.z 1.227583387 1.033393 5.140717e+02 1.000000 SMOKER.z 1.014942921 1.032379 1.592752e+00 1.899517 BMI.z 1.227770586 1.028971 1.319658e+03 1.000000 I receive a standardised odds ratio for BMI of 1.23. My question is, is it possible to only standardise specific variables for example only BMI? This is because my other variables e.g. DM, HTN and SMOKER are binary (i.e. either 0 or 1). Is it then reasonable to present the data by showing some odds ratios as standardised and others not? I am also unsure how to calculate a confidence interval for the standardised odds ratio. I tried using this: > exp(confint(beta(WHRnewfit))) 2.5 % 97.5 % Another question if, if I am also looking at biochemical variables e.g. Cholesterol, HDL, LDL etc. do these also need to be standardised to allow comparison between variables? Would an alternative be to feed in standardised data inputs for all continuous variables before fitting a glm model? Thanks in advance
