There are OCR libraries that convert typing (OCRopus, tesseract, etc.) There are also Java based handwriting libraries. I am not sure if OCRopus has that ability, one library I was looking into to do handwriting recognition was: Online Video Java Neural Networks Conceivably you could take the pdf, convert it into a tiff if need be (according to the software), and it would give you something.. Good luck!
