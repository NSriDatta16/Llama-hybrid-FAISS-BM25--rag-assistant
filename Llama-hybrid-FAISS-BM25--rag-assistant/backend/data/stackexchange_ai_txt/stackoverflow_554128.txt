javascript/dom -- how expensive is creating vs rearranging dom nodes?

I'm trying to optimize a sortable table I've written. The bottleneck is in the dom manipulation. I'm currently creating new table rows and inserting them every time I sort the table. I'm wondering if I might be able to speed things up by simple rearranging the rows, not recreating the nodes. For this to make a significant difference, dom node rearranging would have to be a lot snappier than node creating. Is this the case? thanks, -Morgan
