How meaningful are the results when you difference the time series dataset before clustering?

On a certain task where I need to perform K-Means Time Series Clustering with DTW algorithm, I would like to know how credible the results are when performing clustering on the original vs a dataset where first and second order differencing has been applied. The original dataset is highly non-stationary and high correlation is present between the variables, so I decided to make the dataset stationary by differencing and only then perform clustering. On the differenced dataset , the silhouette score for k=2 is 0.68 and for k=3 the score is 0.541 , while on the original dataset for k=2 the score is 0.79 , and for k=3 it is 0.434 . To summarize, I would like to know if: Clustering results with non-stationary time series variables, even if clustering evaluation score is higher less preferable than clustering results with stationary variables? I also would like to know if applying differencing is a common methodology for such tasks, as I have not found enough relevant literature. If you can, please feel free to provide links to relevant publications. Thanks.
