For the second problem, why not make use an existing program for comparing sequences and infering phylogenetic trees, like RAxML or MrBayes and call that? Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference are very sophisticated models for these problems, and using them seems a far better idea than implementing it yourself - something like a maximum parsiomony or a neihbour-joining tree, which probably could be written from scratch for such a project, is not sufficient for evolutionary analysis. Unless you just want a very quick and dirty topology (and trees inferred via MP or NJ are really often quite false), where you can probably use something like this
