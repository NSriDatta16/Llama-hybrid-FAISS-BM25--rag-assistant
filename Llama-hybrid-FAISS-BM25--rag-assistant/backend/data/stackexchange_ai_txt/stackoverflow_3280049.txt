Try the simple LPCSTR str = &vec[0]; A vector already contains the contiguous storage that C strings require. But be careful that vec is already null-terminated, and that vec cannot be destroyed while str is still used. Generally vec can be destroyed as soon as it is not used anymore, so storing pointers into vec is dangerous and will lead to crashes. OTOH, passing the pointer as argument might be fine: f(&vec[0]); // f takes a LPCSTR parameter
