No not all browsers support SVG. I believe IE needs a plugin to use them. Since svg is just an xml document, JavaScript can create them. I am not certain about loading it into the browser though. I haven't tried that. This link has information about javascript and svg: http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/svg/SVGAnimations.htm
