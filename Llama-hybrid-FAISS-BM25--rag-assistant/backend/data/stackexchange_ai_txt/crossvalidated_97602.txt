This variable seems inapplicable to the people outside your subset. If they weren't at the meet-and-greet, why would the mixture of customers who were there improve your prediction for the people who only attended the event? It seems to me like you'd have to treat the variable as missing for the group that only attended the event. You definitely shouldn't set it to zero for them â€“ for the purpose of your logistic regression, those zeros would be treated as zero percent, assuming the variable is entered as continuous like you want. However, coding those observations as missing will probably cause SPSS to exclude all the event-only attendees by default when fitting a model that includes the variable that only applies to attendees of the meet-and-greet. That may cost you a lot of power depending on how many only attended the event. There's a lot to be said about alternative methods for handling missing data, so rather than going into it here, I recommend checking out David C. Howell's Treatment of Missing Data . He covers a lot of bad options and a few good ones, and then gives a dedicated treatment of SPSS in Multiple Imputation Using SPSS . At a glance, it looks like it will be important to determine whether observations are missing completely at random, and if so, to consider your imputation options carefully.
