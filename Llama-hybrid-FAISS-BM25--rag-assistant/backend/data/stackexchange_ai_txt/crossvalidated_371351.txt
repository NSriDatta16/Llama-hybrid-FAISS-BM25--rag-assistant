Temperature time series forecasting predictions converging to a certain value

I am trying to forecast the value of the ambient temperature based on given data on Python. The data frequency is 15 minutes. In order to predict future values, I am using a simple autoregressive model and I have tried different orders. I have also split the data into train and test datasets, with the the train dataset being the 70% of the whole data and the test being the remaining 30%. Here is a plot of the whole data. The problem that I encounter is that the predictions deviate quite a lot from the real values. Moreover, the prediction converges to a certain value after some steps, which makes the prediction useless. You can see an example of the prediction vs the real data here. As you can see, the AR model seems to capture the periodic behavior of the real data, but it also has some attenuation as the peaks get smaller and smaller. Here is the code of my implementation in Python: from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import AR from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error from matplotlib import pyplot import pandas as pd data = pd.read_excel('one_year_data_celsius.xlsx') # split dataset Nparam = 100 X = data.TAmb_meas upto = int(len(X)*0.30) train, test = X[1:len(X)-upto], X[len(X)-upto+1:] # train autoregression model model = AR(endog=train,dates=train.index,freq='15min') model_fit = model.fit(maxlag=Nparam) until = 24*4*14 predictions = model_fit.predict(start=train.index[-1], end=test.index[until-1], dynamic=False) pyplot.plot(test[0:until]) pyplot.plot(predictions, color='green') pyplot.legend(['real data','prediction']) I would like to know: is this behavior of the AR normal, or am I making a silly mistake somewhere? Or maybe the behavior is related to the fact that I am trying to predict quite far away (1344 steps, although already after 100 steps the prediction is not good)?I have tried with different AR orders but the only "improvement" that I get is to make the "attenuation" smaller. I apologize in advance for any beginner mistake that I may have done since I am new in this topic.
