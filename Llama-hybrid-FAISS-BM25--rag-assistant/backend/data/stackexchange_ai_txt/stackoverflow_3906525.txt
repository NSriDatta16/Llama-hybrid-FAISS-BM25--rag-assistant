Standard says about initialization (6.7.8): 4 All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals. (That's from C99, but C89 says almost exactly the same thing.) So it looks as though GCC is more correct than 15-year old abandonware. (Who'd a thunk it?)
