Error when trying to filter on a property of an entity inheriting from another in Entity Framework

When I have entity B inherit from entity A using table-per-type for storage and try to write a Linq query that filters on a property on B, for example Function(b) b.name="Joe" I get the error The specified type member 'name' is not supported in LINQ to Entities. Only initializers, entity members, and entity navigation properties are supported. Filtering on any of the properties that exist in the base table works fine. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
