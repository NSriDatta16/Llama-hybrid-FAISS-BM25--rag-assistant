MS Surface drag & drop SurfaceListBoxItems

Hey guys I'm working on the Microsoft Surface Table and I'm attempting to drag an item from 1 SurfaceListBox to another and recognize which SurfaceListBoxItem the other SurfaceListBoxItem was dropped on top of. The SDK help as a great tutorial for dragging items from 1 SurfaceListBox to the next and just adding the content and removing it from the other. If I set AllowDrop=True on the SurfaceListBoxItem the SurfaceListBox still captures the drop. If I set it to false on the SurfaceListBox it doesn't recognize the drop at all. Somehow I need to bury deeper on that drop or something.
