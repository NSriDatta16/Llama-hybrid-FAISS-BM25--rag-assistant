For some historical material, see here Angle brackets are sometimes used, but not much in mainstream statistics in my experience. Thus we might have $\langle x \rangle$. I associate this notation with physics. I've seen on occasion the text $\text{ave}(x)$, for example in writings by J.W. Tukey when mixing words and more conventional algebraic notation. (To me $\text{avg}()$ is an ugly abbreviation.) Peter Whittle has used $A()$ for an averaging operator in various editions of his text Probability (various changes of name and publisher since the first edition in 1970, Harmondsworth: Penguin). There is some similarity with the much longer established and much more widely used $E()$ for expectation. A key difference is that the latter would be not used in practice to refer to empirical calculations, whereas $A()$ could be. A deeper discussion of this point might refer to whether we have here a function, a functional or operator. I surmise that all senses could be valid, but not necessarily in the same cases.
