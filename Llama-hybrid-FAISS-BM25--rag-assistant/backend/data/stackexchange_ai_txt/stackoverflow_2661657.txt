ASP.NET can write to a folder if the account under which it is running (the application pool user) has write permissions on it. If this is indeed a temporary file, you can get a filename from the Path class using GetTempFileName() : string tempPath = Path.GetTempFileName(); You can use this in conjunction with IsolatedStorage to be sure you have permissions to write to a folder.
