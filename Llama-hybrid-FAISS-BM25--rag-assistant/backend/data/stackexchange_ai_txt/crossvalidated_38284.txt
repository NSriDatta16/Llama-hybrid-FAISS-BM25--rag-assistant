It depends on the nature of your dependent variable: Gaussian is for continuous DV (this is ordinary least squares) Binomial, as you note, is for logistic regression . Poisson is for count data (non-negative integers). See also quasipoisson. Gamma is for continuous DV that is always positive (although often you can use Gaussian here, if the mean is $>> 0$ and the sd isn't huge - that is, if all the values are quite far from 0). Inverse Gaussian is, I believe, used for survival data (time to event).
