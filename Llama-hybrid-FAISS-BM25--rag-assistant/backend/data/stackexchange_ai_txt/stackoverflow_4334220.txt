Every color has an RGB value, indicating the levels of Red, Green and Blue in the color. You could calculate the sum of all RGB values for each pixel and then divide by the number of pixels, to get the "average" color of an image. Another way to do it is flatten the colors (change all last digits in the RGB values to 0, for instance #F8824A becomes #F08040) and then find the largest surface in the image with the same color. Imagine a photo of someone in front of a white wall - by using the first method you would get a mix of white and the person's clothes and face. Using the second method you would get white, unless the "color-constant" area of the person's shirt is bigger than the visible part of the wall. There must be other ideas, but this should get you thinking about what you want.
