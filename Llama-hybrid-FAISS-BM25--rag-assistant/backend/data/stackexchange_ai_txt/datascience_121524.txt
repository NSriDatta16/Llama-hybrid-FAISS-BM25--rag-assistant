Your drawing looks correct (assuming a stride of 1 and no dilation). We can talk about the receptive field for any layer in the CNN - so the receptive field of your 1st conv2d is 5 x 5, and of your first pooling layer is 6 x 6. But a reference to the receptive field of the network is (as you said) the receptive field of the last layer before flattening.
