I think the most reasonable thing to do would be to include this as an additional feature. So in addition to your bag-of-words features you now have another feature which takes value 1 if there is a 3 digit string in the title and 0 otherwise. This type of feature engineering can be really useful when working with textual data. It is very common for people to use features like "word starts with a capital letter", "word contains a hyphen", "looks like a url", etc. The type of features you employ will obviously depend a great deal on the task you're trying to perform. That being said, one needs to be careful when doing this type of feature engineering. If you're looking at all your data to decide what features to include based on the relationships with the desired output, using this same data to assess the accuracy of your final model will result in biased estimates. This will be the case even if after deriving features you use a proper procedure like cross-validation to estimate metrics of interest (accuracy, precision, recall, etc). Lastly, I think your statement there is a 50% chance to be deterministic is somewhat vacuous. For example if I have a fair coin, then the coin comes up heads 50% of the time. So I could claim there is a 50% chance the coin is deterministic (always comes up heads), but I haven't really said anything new. Maybe I misunderstood what you mean by 50% chance to be deterministic?
