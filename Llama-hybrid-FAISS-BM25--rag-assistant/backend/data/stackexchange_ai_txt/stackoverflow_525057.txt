Why can't I get Apache's CustomLog directive to work?

I'm trying to use Apache's CustomLog directive to create some custom log files, but can't get it working. Here is the configuration I'm using for the custom logs: LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent CustomLog /var/log/apache2/jb_common common CustomLog /var/log/apache2/jb_referer referer Apache creates both of these custom log files on startup, so it definitely sees the CustomLog directives, but it never writes anything to these files; however, the default access log ( access.log ) is being written to. Any ideas? I'm running Apache 2.2 on Ubuntu 8.10.
