Do experienced data scientists use Excel? I've seen some experienced data scientists, who use Excel - either due to their preference, or due to their workplace's business and IT environment specifics (for example, many financial institutions use Excel as their major tool, at least, for modeling). However, I think that most experienced data scientists recognize the need to use tools, which are optimal for particular tasks, and adhere to this approach. Can you assume a lack of experience from someone who does primarily use Excel? No, you cannot. This is the corollary from my above-mentioned thoughts. Data science does not automatically imply big data - there is plenty of data science work that Excel can handle quite well. Having said that, if a data scientist (even experienced one) does not have knowledge (at least, basic) of modern data science tools, including big data-focused ones, it is somewhat disturbing. This is because experimentation is deeply ingrained into the nature of data science due to exploratory data analysis being a essential and, even, a crucial part of it. Therefore, a person, who does not have an urge to explore other tools within their domain, could rank lower among candidates in the overall fit for a data science position (of course, this is quite fuzzy, as some people are very quick in learning new material, plus, people might have not had an opportunity to satisfy their interest in other tools due to various personal or workplace reasons). Therefore, in conclusion, I think that the best answer an experienced data scientist might have to a question in regard to their preferred tool is the following: My preferred tool is the optimal one, that is the one that best fits the task at hand.
