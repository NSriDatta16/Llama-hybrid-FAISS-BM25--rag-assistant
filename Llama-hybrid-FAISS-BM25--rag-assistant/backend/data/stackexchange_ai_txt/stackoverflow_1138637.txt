You will encounter problems with this approach if you try to put a versioned directory inside a versioned directory that is not its parent. Other than that, you shouldn't run into anything other than the paperwork headaches associated with a disjoint working copy. Is there a reason you can't use svn move to reorganize the project in the repository? you won't lose any history that way, and you will make your life much easier.
