Prediction variable in random Forest data set

I am doing regression with random forest (randomForest library), my question is if in my test_set do I have to include the prediction variable? For example, my prediction variable is X and my training set has variables X, Y, Z, A, B, when I want to apply the random forest to a new data, should I include the prediction variable X, or should I only use Y, Z, A, B? yhatCom.rf = predict(rf_, test_set) If I have to include the prediction variable, and since it is the value that I am trying to predict, which value should I use? Thank you
