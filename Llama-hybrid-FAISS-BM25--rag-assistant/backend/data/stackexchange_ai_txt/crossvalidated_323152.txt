Admittedly, any answer to this question is more opinion than objective fact, but I will try to lay out my logic why I think the answer is never . Any so-called machine learning expert or instructor only reveals their ignorance by representing linear regression as such. Delineation of academic disciplines is more about delineation of communities than methods. Scientific disciplines borrow methods across disciplines all the time. Also, in the 19th century (when linear regression was developed) and prior to that, scientific disciplines were not so clearly delineated as they are today. So particularly when methods were developed in the 19th century or prior, we should be careful to assign them to a particular discipline. That being said, one can look at the history of a discipline and reasonable conclude that particular methods "belong" to one discipline or another. No one would say today that calculus belongs to the field of physics, even though Newton, who was one of the inventors of calculus, was definitely trying to apply this to physics. Calculus clearly belongs to the discipline of mathematics, not physics. This is because calculus is a general mathematical method that can be used completely outside of a physics contexts. By the same reasoning, linear regression belongs to the discipline of statistics, even though it is commonly used as a simple example of fitting data to a model in the context of machine learning. Just as calculus can be used outside the context of physics, linear regression can (and is) used outside the context of machine learning. Machine learning instructors would be wise to point out that linear regression has been in use since the late 19th century long before the modern notion of machine learning came into existence. They should also emphasize that machine learning utilizes many concepts from probability and statistics, as well as other disciplines (e.g. information theory). However, these concepts do not themselves represent machine learning or an "algorithm" of machine learning.
