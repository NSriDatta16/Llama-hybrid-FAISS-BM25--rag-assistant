Plone: How to sort folder items

I have a folder called myfolder , that has some items inside, like: item1 , item2 , item3 , and etc. When I added the portlet Navigation to the left column of the page, and entered on the folder myfolder , it showed me the links on the portlet like this: item1 item2 item3 I want that the Navigation portlet shows me links on this exact sort: item2 item1 item3 I know that I can go on the Content tab of myfolder enter code here , and drag each item to the position that I want. But using this way, if I reinstall all my product on a new Plone Site , I lost my configuration. So I want to have this navigation order configured on my product, instead of only on a installed plone site , so that this change stays forever. How can I do that?
