Help to fix jquery sortable for ordered list

Please see the demo here http://trainee4.afixiindia.com/pratap/ui/shopping_cart.html When I click on the number and try to drag for sortable,its not happening.But when I drag the li ,its working "It mayn't be done with an ordered list because the numbers aren't represented in HTML. I have to use an unstyled, unordered list and manage the numbers myself.":-Its a solution I think Is there any solution.?
