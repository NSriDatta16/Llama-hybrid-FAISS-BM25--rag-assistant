Issue in graph construction

I have a symbolic representation of time series obtained from SAX toolbox . I was wondering if it is possible to construct a graph where each node represents a unique symbol and the edges represent the transition providing that there is no transition to itself. For ex, let the time series T of n=20 data points be represented as T=[1 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 2 3 3 1]' where number of alphabets used to symbolize = 3 and they are (1,2,3). I have combined co-occuring symbols together so, the compressed time series becomes T' = [1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1]' In order to construct a graph (Esp. fuzzy cognitive map ) with fuzzy membership values from T' where the nodes will be (1,2,3), there will be an edge from $Node_i$ to $Node_j$ and it will have a weight $W_{ji}$. How do I find the weights ? I do not know which theory to search for this kind of problem and so if there are any ideas as to what can form the weights. Thank you
