I was looking at a site recently that lists average UK wages based on technologies. Can't find the link now (typical!) but I remember that the average C# wage was around Â£5k higher than the average VB.NET wage. If you're not going to learn both (and there's really no reason not to, as the only real difference between them is syntax) I'd go for C#.
