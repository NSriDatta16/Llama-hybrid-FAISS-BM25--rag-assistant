Check significance of variable before loading in neural network

I'm programming a recurrent neural network that is supposed to predict inflation. Now given the huge amount of variables that could predict it, I thought it might be useful, to check significance in an OLS regression beforehand (at least in the test run, to go easy on my PC). Is it bad practice to use information of a statistical model on a black box model, or could one do that? Greetings, Nick
