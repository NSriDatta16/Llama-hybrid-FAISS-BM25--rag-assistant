This sounds like a good candidate for Thibault Imbert's AS3 GIF Animation Encoding Class . I've used it about 2 years ago for a project at University. You can check it out here . In my opinion you would have 3 steps: //1.Create a Camera object //this code comes from the LiveDocs var camera:Camera = Camera.getCamera(); var video:Video; if (camera != null) { video = new Video(camera.width * 2, camera.height * 2); video.attachCamera(camera); addChild(video); } else { trace("You need a camera."); } //2. Take one or more 'screenshots' using BitmapData var screenshot:BitmapData = new BitmapData(video.width,video.height,false,0x009900); screenshot.draw(video); //you would probably save more of these in an array called screenshots maybe //3. Create a GIFEncoder and send it to the server: //assuming screenshots is an array of BitmapData objects previously saved var animationEncoder:GIFEncoder = new GIFEncoder(); animationEncoder.setRepeat(0); animationEncoder.setDelay (150); animationEncoder.start(); for(var i:int = 1 ; i That should be it. Make sure you check out Thibault Imbert's AS3 GIF Animation Encoding Class and this Web-Cam-Stop-Motion fun app :) Lee Felarca's SimpleFlvWriter is worth looking at as well, depending on your needs.
