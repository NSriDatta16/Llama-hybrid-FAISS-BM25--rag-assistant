This question may be better suited to serverfault, but it's interesting, so here goes :) Magento mostly uses InnoDB tables, so take that into consideration as you read this and this I would also recommend APC per @philwinkle's suggestion, that's made a huge difference to the performance for me. Ditto to using a CDN to take off the load of serving small files (img/js/css)
