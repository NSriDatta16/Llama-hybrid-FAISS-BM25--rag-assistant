You can fit a hierarchical bayesian (HB) model without pooling and do an ordinary OLS by pooling the data and compare the models in terms of model fit, hold-out predictions etc to evaluate whether pooling outperforms the HB model. The model very briefly will look like so: Model $y_i \sim N(X\ \beta_i,\sigma^2\ I)$ $\beta_i \sim N(\bar{\beta},\Sigma)$ Priors $\bar{\beta} \sim N(\bar{\bar{\beta}},\Sigma_0)$ $\Sigma \sim IW(R,d)$ $\sigma^2 \sim IG(sp,sc)$ While I do not use R, I do know that there are packages that will do the above for you. Someone more knowledgeable about R can perhaps help you out.
