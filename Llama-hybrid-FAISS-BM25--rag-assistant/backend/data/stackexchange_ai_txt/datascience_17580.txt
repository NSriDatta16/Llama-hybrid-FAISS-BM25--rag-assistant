how to use machine learning or network analysis to prevent contagious disease

I would like to share a question about my research. I have data about networking of a contagious disease. I have 60 pigs, and I have the contact time with others pigs of each individual in 28 study day. So the structure of data would be Day ID Network_friend (s) Network_time (s) 1 1 200 20000 1 2 300 3000 . . . Those 60 pigs are in similar age and body condition so there is not too much variety among the sample. I am wondering if there is a way to predict the individuals who will get sick in 2 days to prevent the spread of the disease. Should I use any network analysis for it? I appreciate any replies! Thank you!
