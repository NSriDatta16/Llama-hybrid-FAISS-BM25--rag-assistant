Distinguishing between beans loaded from different spring configuration files

our project is based on Spring IoC which provides easy extensibility, meaning the functionality of our project is extended by what we call extensions (or plug-ins) that provide a few additional Spring xml configuration files + new code. The problem is I have to somehow distinguish between beans that have been loaded from different xml files. Example: two extensions (let's call them A and B) installed two additional spring files: A.xml and B.xml. Both these files define beans of the same Java class. The framework loads all beans of this class (using autowiring) to some factory and later uses this list of beans in specific algorithms. But it should be able to know that what extension a bean is defined by. Of course I can add an additional required property (for example name or code of the extension) for the beans and then extensions developers will have to fill it for every bean definition, but this is error prone: the property should be the same for all the beans of some particular extension, while it is filled for every bean. I'm looking for a more elegant solution that is less verbose. Thanks.
