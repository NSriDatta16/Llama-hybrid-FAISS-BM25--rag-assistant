On Windows 7, access to HKLM is only for apps running as admin. If you have no manifest on the app, it will virtualize, meaning write to a different per-user storage. I think you should use a config file in a per-application location that is not per-user, like %PROGRAMDATA%, and have your setup/install (which probably does run as admin) write a single key that tells where this file is. The non admin users can then easily read and write the file while using the application.
