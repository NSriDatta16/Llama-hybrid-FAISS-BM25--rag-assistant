What does "varimax" mean in factor analysis?

In the rotation options of SPSS Factor Analysis, there is a rotation method named "Varimax". If I choose this option, does it mean the orthogonal rotation technique of Principal Component Analysis will be applied on the factor loadings by analyzing the co-variance matrix of the factor loadings? (Because "varimax" sounds a bit like "maximizing variance", which is what PCA does.)
