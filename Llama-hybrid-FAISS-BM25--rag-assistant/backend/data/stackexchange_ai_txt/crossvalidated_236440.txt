I can answer the first question. Here we have two players, PI and PII. Suppose there is one more, "average" player A. PI wins against A 7 times out of 10. PII wins against A 6 times out of 10. We can say that PI is 7/3 times as good as A, and PII is 6/4 times as good as A. Then it's trivial to answer the question by how much PI is better than PII. That quantity will also be equal to the odds that PI beats PII: Odds = (7/3) / (6/4) = 14/9, meaning that the probability of PI beating PII is 14 / (14 + 9) = 0.6086.
