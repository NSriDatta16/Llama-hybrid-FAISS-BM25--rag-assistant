How to monitor Windows services

I'm looking for a way to monitor certain Windows services (on Windows Server 2003) and restart if necessar y. The services are on different servers and include mainly SQL Server services (e.g. SQL Server Agent), but also some proprietary services. Email alerts sent out if a service has stopped would be very useful as well.
