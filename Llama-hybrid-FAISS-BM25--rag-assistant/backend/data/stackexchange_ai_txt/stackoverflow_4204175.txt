First, you have to specify the constructor arg in your bean definition, and not in your injection points. Then, you can utilize spring's @Value annotation (spring 3.0) @Component public class DefaultInterfaceParameters { @Inject public DefaultInterfaceParameters(@Value("${some.property}") String value) { // assign to a field. } } This is also encouraged as Spring advises constructor injection over field injection. As far as I see the problem, this might not suit you, since you appear to define multiple beans of the same class, named differently. For that you cannot use annotations, you have to define these in XML. However I do not think it is such a good idea to have these different beans. You'd better use only the string values. But I cannot give more information, because I dont know your exact classes.
