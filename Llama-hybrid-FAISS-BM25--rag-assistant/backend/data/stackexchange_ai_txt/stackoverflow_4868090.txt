Restricting multiple datepickers to certain days not working

I have the following code in a customdp.js file, for some reason it is not restricting the datepicker to the days I have chosen. You can see the test here and maybe someone can see why it is not working? http://www.healthybrighton.co.uk/wse/node/1841 $(function() { var pickable = { dp1296596522228: [1, 4] }; $('.webform-calendar hasDatepicker').each(function() { $(this).datepicker({ beforeShowDay: function(date){ var day = date.getDay(), days = pickable[this.id]; return [$.inArray(day, days) > -1, ""]; } }); });â€‹ });
