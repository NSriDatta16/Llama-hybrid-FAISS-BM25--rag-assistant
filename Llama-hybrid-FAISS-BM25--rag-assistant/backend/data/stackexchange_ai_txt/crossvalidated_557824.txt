In addition to the other answers, I'll add that usually with machine learning we fit the model by finding the weights that minimise the loss, but we then usually evaluate the model using a different metric that has more "intuitive" meaning (and to be robust this should be on a different dataset that wasn't used to train the model, i.e. a train-test split). For example with classification we often use Cross Entropy as the loss, however when we evaluate the model we use either accuracy, F1 score or some other metric to actually decide if our model is "good enough". For regression problems such as the one you're working on, we more commonly use squared error loss, and it's fairly common to use something like r-squared as a metric (although it's certainly not a perfect one).
