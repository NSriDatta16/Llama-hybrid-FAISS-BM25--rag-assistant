In the IRT literature for complicated IRT models (multiple groups, longitudinal/repeated measures, multidimensional) the recommended framework is Bayesian, because of relative easiness of estimation. I have had good experience using R package "rstan", which implements a flavor of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I had a data set with almost 3000 subjects measured at 6 time points, had 5 dimensions and 3 groups, and rstan worked really well. I was fitting a GRM model to ordinal test with 30 items. Check out the stan user group for example code.
