Output Buffer shows "1"

I have two functions: core_function($atts) { (attributes) (core functions, a few loops, echoes, a lot of direct input) } And that's how I display my function using output buffering (yes, I have to use it!). display_function($atts) { (attributes) $output = ob_start(); $output .= core_function($atts); $output .= ob_get_clean(); return $output; } Everything is perfectly fine, but return $output shows not only core functions but also "1" before them. I have no idea where this "1" comes from. When I deletete ob_start(); and ob_get_clean(); it disappears. So I believe the output buffer is somehow adding this digit. But how, and why? It's a raw "1", not in a paragraph etc. Normaly display_function($atts) shows, for example: This is Core Function! And with output buffering it displays: 1 This is Core Function! Why is it happening? If it has something to do with my functions I'm saying again - the 1 is being displayed exactly BEFORE all the contents.
