One option is the Mantel-Haenszel test. This will test/estimate the odds-ratio between x1 and x2 while allowing the margins to vary between the ID's. In R use the mantelhaen.test function. You could also use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with a term indicating x1 vs. x2 and another for ID (and possibly an interaction).
