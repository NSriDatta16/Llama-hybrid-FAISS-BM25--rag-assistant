From what I can tell, you are going to feed the output from PCA into k-means clustering and then feed the output of that into SVM. If that's correct, it seems to me you'll only need to scale the data once, when it goes into PCA. The output from PCA will then be scaled (since the outputs are the principal components of the scaled data) and the output of k-means will also have the same scaling (since it is finding group means of scaled data). You can verify that the PCA and k-means outputs are scaled by, let's say, running on a relatively small subset of the data. Of course, it goes without saying that it helps to understand what each model is doing, instead of treating each one as an incomprehensible black box. Take a look at Brian Ripley's book, "Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks" and/or Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, "Introduction to Statistical Learning."
