I'm overwhelmed by the number of tutorials for codeIgniter. Shall I switch to it from cakePHP?

Recently I have started studying cakePHP and I love the way it's organized. But I don't seem many useful tutorials for it as codeIgniter. Am I missing anything? Shall I switch? PS I'm a computer engineering student and have only little time to study web dev. so i need to save time.
