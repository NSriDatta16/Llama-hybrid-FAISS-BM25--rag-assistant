Are you including all the necessary CSS? The grid uses a few that aren't part of dijit's tundra. @import "/js/dojox/grid/resources/Grid.css"; @import "/js/dojox/grid/resources/tundraGrid.css"; @import "/js/dojo/resources/dojo.css"; @import "/js/dijit/themes/tundra/tundra.css"; If you have all of those, the next thing to check is that the grid starts off in a visible area. I've run into a ton of trouble where the grid started off in a display:hidden div. Hope this helps. If not, let me know.
