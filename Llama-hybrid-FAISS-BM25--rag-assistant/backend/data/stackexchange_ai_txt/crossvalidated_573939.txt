Cross Correlation Techniques for Time Series Data

I am working with time series data and am currently using cross correlation on my data. I can use different techniques like spearman, pearson, and kendall. I was wondering if beyond that, there are any correlation techniques/methods including ML methods? Is it possible to do cross correlation with SVM or KNN?
