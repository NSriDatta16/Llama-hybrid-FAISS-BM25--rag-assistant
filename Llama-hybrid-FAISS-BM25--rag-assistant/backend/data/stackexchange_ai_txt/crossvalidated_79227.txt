In laymans terms, you are calculating the distance between the actual points and the predicted line, which you can do whether or not the line is linear. You can check it out easily in Excel. If you're using 2007-2010, enter some x and y data, select it, then: 1. Go to the Insert tab 2. Charts section 3. Scatter chart 4. Select the chart to get the Chart Tools tabs 5. Click on layout 6. Analysis section 7. Click on the trendline drop down 8. Click on "more trendline options" (you can also access this by right clicking on the graph, adding a trendline, and then right clicking on the trendline to format it) Here, you can display the R-squared and adjust the type of line being added to your data. Watching your R squared automatically recalculate can help you get idea of what kind of model to use. P.S. Excel won't calculate R-squared values for lines where it doesn't make sense (ex. moving average trend lines)
