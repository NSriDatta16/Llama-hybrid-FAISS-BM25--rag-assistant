What model should be used for vector to scalar time series prediction

I'm new to machine learning and I'm trying to work on a problem and the data looks like the following: Date/Time Tchg Tcold Pchg Qchg Flow CUF dCUF 1999-07-20 00:00:00 479.606 550.187 1238.22 94.1212 0.0 0.00492 0.00001 1999-07-21 10:20:00 480.169 550.187 2238.22 94.3004 0.0 0.00492 0 1999-07-21 00:00:00 479.606 550.187 1238.22 94.1212 0.0 0.00496 0.00004 1999-07-22 00:17:42 279.606 550.187 1238.22 94.1212 0.0 0.00496 0 1999-07-22 03:43:03 279.606 550.187 1238.22 94.1212 1.0 0.00496 0 1999-07-22 00:00:00 279.606 350.187 2238.22 94.1212 1.0 0.00497 10.000011 The data set has 6 columns with 5 of them will be input and CUF to be predicted. The dCUF is just the change of CUF from previous row. During each day the 5 inputs will be collected from sensor for several times and each time they may change. Based on the each collected data, CUF may change but it's only updated at the end of the day. Each row input actually may create a change of CUF from previous row (time history) but it's not shown. I'm thinking of combining the input for each day which is an array of n x 5 (n depends on how many times the input data are collected and is not fixed) and then try to predict the dCUF which is the change of CUF for each day. My questions are: Will this be predictable since we don't have correct CUF at each collected time? If this is predictable, what kind of data manipulation should I do and what model should I use?
