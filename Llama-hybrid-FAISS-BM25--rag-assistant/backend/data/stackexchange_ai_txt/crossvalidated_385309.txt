What is the benefit of a single input single output neural network?

What would be the difference of a neural network with a single input and a single output with e.g. linear activation in contrast to a e.g. linear regression? In my understanding its mathematically the same, even with a changing number of hidden layers within the nueral network. If so, would there still be an advantage of using a NN over using a linear regression? Could you confirm this assumption? Or am I on a wrong track?
