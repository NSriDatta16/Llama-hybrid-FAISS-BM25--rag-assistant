How to do bayesian model comparison for control and treatment

I have a model for a biological experiment which has a typical bayesian structure, that is $\lambda \rightarrow X$. Now let's assume for control the parameters are $\lambda_1 \rightarrow X_1$ and $\lambda_2 \rightarrow X_2$. Here $X_1$ is the observed data in one condition, and $X_2$ is the observed data in another condition. Now I have two hypotheses, $H_0 \sim \lambda_1=\lambda_2$ and $H_1 \sim \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$. Now according to the bayesian hypotheses testing the bayes factor will be calculated as follows, \begin{align} BF & = \frac{\int \int P(X_1,X_2|H_1)P(\lambda_1,\lambda_2|H_1)d\lambda_1d\lambda_2}{\int P(X_1,X_2|H_0)P(\lambda_1,\lambda_2|H_0)d\lambda_1d\lambda_2} \\ \end{align} Now I am unable to move further from it, because I don't know how to reflect $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are differenty in the integration. I can assume $\lambda' = \lambda_1 -\lambda_2$ then I can do anormal hypothesis testing. But my distribution does not alow me to have a closed form with such a parameter $\lambda'$.
