Always display full list of tools in the (Infragistic's) Toolbar

I use some UltraToolbars in a form, and that toolbars fills all the upper space of the form, almost all of them are "truncated" - not all toolbars buttons are visible. For the most toolbars this is not a problem, but for ones I'd like to always display all items. Is it possible to say to the UltraToolbar do not "truncate"(hide) its items (when docked).
