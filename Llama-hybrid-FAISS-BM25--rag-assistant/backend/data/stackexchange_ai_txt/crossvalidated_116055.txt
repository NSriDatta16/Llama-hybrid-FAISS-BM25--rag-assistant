Since you are conditioning on a number of variables, what you seem to want is a mixture of a marginal and a conditional (adjusted) effect of sex. I would not know how to interpret such an estimate, as it can be manipulated by oversampling males according to the number of siblings he has, when obtaining the data. You might consider a sequence of conditional estimates. Here is an example in R for a model with three predictors: sex, sibs, and age, with age and number of sibs not assumed to operate linearly. require(rms) n |t|) 0 1.843579 0.9748423 -0.0925419 3.779700 1.89 0.0617 1 2.743908 0.9072221 0.9420867 4.545730 3.02 0.0032 2 3.694806 1.0995190 1.5110664 5.878546 3.36 0.0011 * 3 4.696273 1.2790347 2.1559993 7.236546 3.67 0.0004 * 4 5.748308 1.3630204 3.0412318 8.455384 4.22 0.0001 * 5 6.850912 1.3617277 4.1464032 9.555421 5.03 0.0000 Redundant contrasts are denoted by * Error d.f.= 92 Confidence intervals are 0.95 individual intervals Note that when sibs=1 for a male the contrast 2.744 equals the regression coefficient for sex. If you really want, you can get a weighted average of the conditional estimates according to some reasonable external distribution of sibs to marginalize on sibs. This can be done by specifying type='average', weights=... to contrast . But I would not recommend marginalization.
