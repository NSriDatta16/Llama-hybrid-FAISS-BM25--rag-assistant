Spurious regression

I am using regression with ARIMA error which modifies the error terms to generate correct results for time series regression. I know that if two variables have a trend in it then you may get spurious regression unless the variables are co integrated. However, every discussion I have run into about this proceeds into error correction models or var models which are very difficult to interpret/run to me. I was wondering if it was valid to use regression with ARIMA error if there are trends in the variables (no discussion of this method I have found answers this).
