Difference between errors and residuals. What is the mean and variance of each of them?

Suppose there is a simple linear model $y=\beta_0+\beta_1x+u$. Can we state that $\bar y=\beta_0+\beta_1 \bar x + \bar u$? I have this question because I come up with $Var(\bar u)$ when doing some exercises. What I have attempted: $$Var(\bar u)=Var(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i)=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$ But I just think of that the $u$ here is the error term, which is the true value, can we use the sample average for this case? To be precise is $\bar u=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$ or just $E(u)$ which is 0?
