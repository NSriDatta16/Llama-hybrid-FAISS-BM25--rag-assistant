Need help finding a specific Magento Javascript file

I'm hoping that someone in this forum can help with finding a specific JavaScript file in a Magento shopping cart. I'm working on fixing SSL non secure items messages and I've found and fixed all of them except for one. The image I'm looking for is called "pager_arrow_right.gif" and it's on a customer account page generated from: app\design\frontend\default\our_theme\template\sales\order\history.phtml The image src code is not in this file though, it looks like the image src is in a JavaScript file generated from that history.phtml file: decorateTable('my-orders-table') Does anyone have any idea where the JavaScript file for the above code is located? I just can't seem to find it.. Thank You !! Janet
