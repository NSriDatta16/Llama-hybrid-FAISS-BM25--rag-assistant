What backpropagation actually is?

I have a conceptual question due to terminology that bothers me. Is backpropagation algorithm a neural network training algorithm or is it just a recursive algorithm in order to calculate a Jacobian for a neural network? Then this Jacobian will be used as part of the main training algorithm e.g Steepest Descent? Hence is it a training algorithm or a numerical way to calculate a Jacobian matrix (partial derivatives of neural network outputs respective to network parameters)?
