time_select with 12 hour time and Time Zone in Ruby on Rails

I have the need to capture a time and time zone from users of a rails 2.3.8 app, but have been unable to think of a clean solution to create and parse the selections. Ideally I would have a drop-down menus for the following: hour (1-12) minute (0-59) AM/PM Time Zone Is there a gem/plugin that accomplishes what I am looking for? Will I need to store both the time and time zone in the database? What is the best strategy for storage? I'll eventually need to spit these values out in UTC, but a user should be able to go back and review the time in the correct time zone.
