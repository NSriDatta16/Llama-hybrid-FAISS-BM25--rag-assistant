Question-answering models require training data where you explicitly have a question and the answer to it. If you don't have such data, then you should be looking into different types of models, probably retrieval-based chatbot techniques. One option to create a QA dataset would be to use large language models, either as a service like GPT-3 or on-premise using BLOOM or something alike, to create questions and answers from your data, and then train a QA model on that. Also, depending on what you want exactly as a result, you may use a large language model to generate text to use as the base for document retrieval, as they do in the article Generate rather than Retrieve: Large Language Models are Strong Context Generators (published at ICLR'23)
