I'd say use both. Store it in the session, but also put it in the get parameters for the page. Why? This way the user is able to carry his options from page to page, but they are also in the URL so if he sends search results to his friend, his friend sees them the exact same way he did. No, the session's performance will not degrade by putting those small variables in there. Unless you're storing monolithic arrays in your session, the vast majority of the time loading a session will be reading it from its storage medium (file, database, memcache, etc).
