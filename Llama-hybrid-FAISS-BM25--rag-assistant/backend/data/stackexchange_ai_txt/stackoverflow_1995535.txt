If you don't wanna use plugins - What about some plain old JS validation? I posted about this on my blog a while ago --> http://dotnetbutchering.blogspot.com/2009/04/definitive-javascript-validation-with.html You'll see that the function in my proposed solution takes a input field ID and a regex (and you'll have to come up with a regEx for your validation needs, should be pretty trivial if you want only aplhanumeric) and sets the background of the control to green or red depending on the outcome of the validation. I know it's not perfect but I think it's enough to get you going, and you can use it as a starting point to roll your own. I am sure there are mote elegant solutions using jQuery or plain JS but something along these lines has been working pretty well for me so far. Hope it helps.
