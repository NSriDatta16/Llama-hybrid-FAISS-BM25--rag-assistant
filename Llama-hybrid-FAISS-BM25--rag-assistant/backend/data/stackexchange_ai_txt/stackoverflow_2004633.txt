Depends on what you really need. Since you didn't 100% specify it, I point you to the possibility of embedding a publicly shared Google Calendar on your site: http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41207 Since you're so strict on having the exact same functionality as on GCalendar it may satisfy your needs.
