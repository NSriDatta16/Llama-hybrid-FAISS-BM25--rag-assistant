For what it's worth, I've been testing for 15 years, and to this day have never seen ROI on tests created in this fashion. Automated testing, is obviously a good thing, but if you are just taking test cases that should be manual test cases and having minimum wage workers "automate" them, you will almost always end up with a mass of unmaintainable fragile tests that save no time in the end and get thrown out quickly. The FitNesse suggestion from paiNie is a great suggestion.
