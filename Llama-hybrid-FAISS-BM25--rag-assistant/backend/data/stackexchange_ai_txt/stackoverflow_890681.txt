While the above answer would work if you already had the files in the local EC2, you'll have to fetch each song from S3 into EC2, either into a pipe for conversion or into a temporary file, then either pipe it back up to S3 or store it in a temp file and then send it back to EC2. Haven't actually used EC2, so not sure what kind of storage you're working with, but you should have plenty of space to store the one temporary mp3. You would probably also want to create some way of tracking status, probably by doing a listing on your bucket before you start. Probably a perl script using the S3 module would be more suited, but I'm too lazy to type that all in here :).
