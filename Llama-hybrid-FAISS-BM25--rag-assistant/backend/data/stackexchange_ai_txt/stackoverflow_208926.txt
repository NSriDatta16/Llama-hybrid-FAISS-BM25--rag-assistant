If you go with AIR you'll have a cross platform solution. You can also leverage some of the new AMF support in Zend Framework for a faster more efficient communications protocol. XML is big, JSON smaller but AMF is binary and much more compressed. AIR also allows you to write an application in two ways. The first is the traditional flash player/Flex combination and the other is to just write a bunch of HTML pages with Javascript in it that utilizes the AIR provided APIs. Aptana produce a functional free IDE plugin to Eclipse to write AIR apps in this second way. FlashDevelop is another free IDE that would be more suitable to the flash/flex way of writing an app. Flexbuilder is also free for 30 days and cheap if you are a student (free IIRC).
