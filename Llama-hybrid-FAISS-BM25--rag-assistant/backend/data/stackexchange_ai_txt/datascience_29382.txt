Found this SO post which says to use the following regex: \b[^\d\W]+\b/g yielding the following: >>> vec = CountVectorizer(token_pattern=r'\b[^\d\W]+\b') >>> X = vec.fit_transform(docs) >>> pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vec.get_feature_names()) aaa is more some text this 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 What I needed in my regex were the \b word boundary characters of which I was not aware of. That does make this a misplaced question as it has nothing to do with data science or that discipline's tools (sklearn).
