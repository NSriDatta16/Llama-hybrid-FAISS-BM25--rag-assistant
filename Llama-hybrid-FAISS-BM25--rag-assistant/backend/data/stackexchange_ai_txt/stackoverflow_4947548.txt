What does this this HTTP Authorization RewriteRule do?

I have an rewrite recursion error somewhere on my website that Google Bot caused, but I can't find the url that caused it because my Loglevel is low. I raised it but it has not happened again so far. RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}] All Rewriterules look fine to me and have the [L] flag, except this one. I can't quite understand it. It is from the open source shop system Magento. As far as I can tell it does nothing but sets the environment variable E. But isn't that a very stupid way of doing that? Shouldn't you use SetEnv if that was the goal?
