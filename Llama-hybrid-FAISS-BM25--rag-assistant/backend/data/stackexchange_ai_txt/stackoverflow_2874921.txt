You shouldn't have to resort to importing or cross-referencing projects. As far as I am aware, the R.java file is generated from the XML files in res. Specifically, it is created based on the "id" in layouts and "name" in the strings.xml file. (There are probably other things that do it, but this is what I know). Perhaps, when copying your files, your ids are not formatted with the "+" that encourages the values to be created if they do not already exist. For example, a TextView in a layout would contain: The plus there is crucial to new creation of values. It may also help to put a basic edit into an xml file, save it, then undo the edit and save again. The saving may trigger the Eclipse plug-in to regenerate the R.java file.
