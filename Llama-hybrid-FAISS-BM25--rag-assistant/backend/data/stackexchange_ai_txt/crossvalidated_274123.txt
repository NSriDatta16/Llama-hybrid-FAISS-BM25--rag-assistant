Evaluating an autoencoder: possible approaches?

Literature suggests that Antoencoders can be effective in dimensionality reduction, like PCA. PCA can be evaluated based on the variance of each principal component generated. How to do the same for autoencoder? One way is to that we can reconstruct the input from the encoded representation from the autoencoder and can check the reconstruction error. But can we check the variance, like in PCA?
