Is there any "standard" for statistical model notation?

In, for example, the BUGS manual or the upcoming book by Lee and Wagenmakers ( pdf ) and in many other places a type of notation is used that to me seems very flexible in that it can be used to succinctly describe most statistical models. An example of this notation is the following: $$ y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(p_i,n_i) \\ \log\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = b_i \\ b_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_p,\sigma_p) $$ which would describe a hierarchical logistic model with no predictors, but with $i = 1\dots n $ groups. This way of describing models seem to work equally well for describing frequentist and Bayesian models, for example, to make this model description fully Bayesian you would just have to add priors on $\mu_p$ and $\sigma_p$ . Is this type of model notation/formalism described in detail in some article or book? If you want to use this notation to write models there are many different ways of doing things and it would be really useful with a comprehensive guide both to follow and to reference others to. Some differences I've found in how people use this type of notation: What do you call distributions? E.g., I've seen $\mathcal{N},\text{N},\text{Norm},\text{Normal}$ , etc. How do you deal with indexes? E.g. I've seen $y_{ij}$ , $y_{i[j]}$ , $y_{j|i}$ , etc. Which parameter symbols are usually used for parameters. For example, it is common to use $\mu$ as the mean for the normal distribution, but what about other distributions? (For this I usually check the distributions of Wikipedia ) Follow up question: Does this notation have a name? (For lack of a better name I called it the probability distribution centric convention in a blog post I wrote...)
