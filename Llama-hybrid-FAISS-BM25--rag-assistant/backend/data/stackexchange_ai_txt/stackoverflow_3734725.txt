WCF OData service with Reflection Provider

We need to provide an API for an Activity Feed (think of Facebook) and we decided to give OData a try. We are using .NET so we went for WCF Data Service but we don't use Entity Framework (or any other ORM) so we will use the Reflection Provider. Because we have complex business logic for our retrieval methods we decided to expose them as service operations. However we want to expose Delete/Update and single entity selection as a normal OData REST resource. My question is how can we implement a data source for the reflection provider that restricts access to collections but allows access to single entities (requested by key), allows DELETE/PUT/POST verbs and also allows accessing child collections of single entities (i.e. service/Categories(1)/Products). Basically I only want to restrict access to base collections (i.e. service/Categories or service/Products)
