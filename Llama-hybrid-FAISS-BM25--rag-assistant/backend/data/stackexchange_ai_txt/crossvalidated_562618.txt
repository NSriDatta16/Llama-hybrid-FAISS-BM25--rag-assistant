It seems that I've made a rookie mistake. It's generally recommended to prep the data before PCA by standardizing it first. Some implementations of PCA automatically do so. This one does not, apparently. withpca %step_center(all_predictors()) %>% step_scale(all_predictors()) %>% step_pca(all_predictors()) %>% prep() %>% juice() vif(lm(alcohol~.,data=withpca)) Now the VIFs look perfect.
