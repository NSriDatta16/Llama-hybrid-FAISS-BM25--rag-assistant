PCA and component scores based on a mix of continuous, binary and categorical variables

My question is strongly related to this one: PCA and component scores based on a mix of continuous and binary variables . I will basically use the same code, but add a new nominal feature (x6) to the data set. I want to apply a PCA on a dataset consisting of continuous, binary and categorical variables. # Generate synthetic dataset set.seed(12345) n Now in order to calculate the component scores, it was suggested to multiply the data set with the loadings L, which works fine for numerical and binary variables, but not on categorical data. The following computation causes the categorical feature to be a vector of NAÂ´s. scores How can I obtain the scores for this feature? Do I have to split it up into dummy variables to make this work?
