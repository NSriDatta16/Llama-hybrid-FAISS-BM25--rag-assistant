Combining regroup with get_foo_display in Django templates

I'm using the regroup template tag to group queryset output on a Choices field. In the model: RESOURCE_TYPES = ( ('tut','External tutorial'), ('read','Additional reading'), ('org','Company or organization'), ) restype = models.CharField('Resource type',max_length=6,choices=RESOURCE_TYPES) in the view: resources = Resource.objects.filter(tutorial=tutorial) in the template: {% regroup resources by restype as resource_list %} {% for type in resource_list %} {{type.grouper}} So type.grouper renders as 'tut' or 'org' on the page, rather than the long form. Normally you would use the get_foo_display syntax to get at the value of the choice, rather than the key. But the value doesn't seem to be available after going through regroup. There's no way I can find to use get_foo_display on {{type.grouper}}. It makes sense when you think about it, but what's the workaround? Thanks.
