how do i use timezone in Twig date filter?

I am using Twig and this date filter http://www.twig-project.org/doc/templates.html#date Apparently they are looking out for DateTime instances in the parameter. looking at this http://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.construct.php I have trouble understanding the php datetime object and how to use the timezone. Given that i know basic PHP and is familiar with simple web programming, how do I use it to display a date and time using the Twig date filter while catering for timezone? If there is a simpler way to do it while using the date filter, but NOT using datetime object, i would be open to it. I am only concerned that the solution works, rather than the "correctness" or "elegance" of the solution.
