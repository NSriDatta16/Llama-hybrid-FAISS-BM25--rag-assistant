java/swing: showing potential drop target rows in a JTable

I want to implement DropTargetListener with a JTable as a target. This is roughly what I would like to do: @Override public void dragOver(DropTargetDragEvent event) { MyItem item = getMyItemFromTransferable(); int nrows = item.getTableRowsRequiredForDrop(); // now highlight rows in the table under the drop cursor. } How can I figure out which row in the JTable is the row under the cursor where the DropTargetDragEvent is?
