There is no rule that says "thou must scale your data with PCA". There are plenty of cases where scaling is bad, for example with you have latitude and longitude. Scaling is often better than not scaling if the axes are very different. PCA is often helpful if you have linear correlations and want to get rid of this redundancy in the data. If you want to retain this redundancy (because it helps solving your problem), PCA can even be harmful! So whenever you have doubt, don't blindly apply any such transformation, but rather try to understand your problem better. What the right approach is depends on your data and objective, not on some textbook heuristic such as using PCA. In your plot it does appear as if you have some near-duplicate variables. You may want to first merge these pairs. Then check for further highly correlated variables. Because these harm PCA, usually the result gets much more meaningful when you have eliminated the obvious relationships. Also get rid of any clearly useless variables.
