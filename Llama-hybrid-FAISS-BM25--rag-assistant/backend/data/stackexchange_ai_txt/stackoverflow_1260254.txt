Optional or boolean elements to specify characteristics in XML schema?

I'm trying to create an XML schema to describe some aspects of hospitals. A hospital may have 24 hour coverage on: emergency services, operating room, pharmacist, etc. The entire list is relatively short - around 10. The coverage may be on more than one of these services. My question is how best to represent this. I'm thinking along the lines of: Basically, the services are optional and, if they exist, the coverage is offered by the hospital. Alternatively, I could have: true true false In this case, I require all the elements, but a value of false means that the coverage isn't offered. There are probably other approaches. What's the best practice for something like this? And, if I use the first option, what type should the elements be in the schema?
