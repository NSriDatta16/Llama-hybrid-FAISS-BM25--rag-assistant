Visual C++ 2008 Express Or Eclipse Ganymede With CDT

I'm learning C++ , and I want to know from those who are very good developers now: What is the best IDE, Visual C++ 2008 Express or Eclipse Ganymede with CDT ? Remember that I'm using Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate . Thanks! The book that I'm reading is from Deitel: C++ How to Program, 5/e , because I don't know if the code of the book supports Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express .
