This site used the elo rating system. They start at 1200 taken from http://gameknot.com/help-answer.pl?question=29 GameKnot rating system is based on Elo rating system with a fixed K = 20 and the following modifications: The first 20 games are used to establish player's rating on the website. During the first 20 games, the player's rating is calculated as an average of the ratings of all his/her opponents, +400 in case of a win, -400 in case of a loss, same for a draw. +/-200 points are used when playing against a player with a provisional rating. PLayer's rating is provisional during the first 20 games, after which it becomes established. Player's rating is considered to be equal to 1200 during the first 5 rated games. Timeouts are counted as wins only if there were at least 3 moves made in the game (losses are always counted for the timed out players, regardless of how many moves were made). The higher of two ratings, at the beginning of the game and at the end, is used to calculate the rating adjustments after the game is over. For example, if during your first 20 rated games, you played 3 games and you won against 1200 player with provisional rating, then against 1400 player with established rating, but lost against 1600 player with established rating, your rating will be: ( (1200 + 200) + (1400 + 400) + (1600 - 400) ) / 3 = 1467 Or, if during your first 20 rated games, you win against 1200 provisional, win against 1400 established, lose against 1600 provisional, draw against 1500, your rating will be: ( (1200 + 200) + (1400 + 400) + (1600 - 200) + 1500 ) / 4 = 1525
