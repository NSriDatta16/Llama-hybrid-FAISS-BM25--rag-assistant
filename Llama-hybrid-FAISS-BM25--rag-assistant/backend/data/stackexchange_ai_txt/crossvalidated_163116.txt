DLM, regression and multiple time series

I'm working with incoming traffic data at multiple spots along a long road. Let's denote the traffic at time t at point $j$ by $x_j(t)$. For each spot, a univariate model, such as local level plus AR(1) is able to capture most variability in the timeseries. However, it seems natural that the information from point $x_j(t-1)$ should be used in someway to better predict $x_k(t)$ where $k$ is on the downstream of $j$. Cross correlation between $x_k$ and $x_j$ is a somewhat symmetric, with few (~5) significant lags. so, to predict $x_k(t)$, I used: $$ x_k(t) = a_t + x_k(t-1) + \beta x_j(t-1) + v_t$$ Now the problem is that the residuals become highly correlated (they were not before adding the regression term), and even adding AR(5) does not remove this correlation. Now given that I would like to use data from other points at the upstream of $x_k$ as well, one might think that this would only exacerbate the problem. I want to model my series in state-space form, since it's good for adopting to real time data, as well as ease of introducing new variables. I have two questions: Is my approach adequate? By which I mean, does it make sense to include this effect as regression factor? Should I change my approach, look into VARs, etc. ? In other words, what is the best approach to take in this problem? I'm using R and DLM package, in case that matters.
