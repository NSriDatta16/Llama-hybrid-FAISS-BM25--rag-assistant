You can do this by using OCR engines like pytesseract . Once the text has been extracted you can either use custom NLP rules for framing the questions and their answers or use a Question Answering model which will do this for you. There are many such models like Layoutlm series. Huggingface hosts many such models. Also do not use PyPDF2 as it is not that robust when compared to pytesseract . I tried it and it only works on certain pdfs. Cheers!
