Unique IDs (e.g. a match ID, when each record is a match) are unneccessary for either data splitting or model creation, so there's no harm removing them. There may be a benefit in removing them, to help prevent a learning algorithm "detecting" a spurious correlation. For non-unique IDs (e.g. ones you have added to facilitate data source joins), if you include both the ID variable for a source and the attributes from that source, there will be a high degree of correlation between the key and that group of attributes. This could cause problems if you use a learning algorithm that assumes independence between the variables, such as linear/logistic regression. As for keeping the ID variables for data splitting - you haven't included links to the posts you refer to so I'm not sure what point they are trying to make. Just including the ID variables in your data when creating the train/test splits isn't going to achieve anything, so I assume they are discussing using ID variables as part of the splitting strategy. Two possible strategies are stratified splitting (where the proportion of records with each value of the stratification variable is the same in the training and test sets) and group splitting (where records with the same value of the grouping variable are either all in the test set or all in the training set). If you want to use one of these splitting strategies you may want to use one of your ID variables for this. However, I suspect in most cases there would be a "real" attribute you could use instead. This would work just as well and would have the advantage of making it easier to explain, if you later need to explain your splitting strategy.
