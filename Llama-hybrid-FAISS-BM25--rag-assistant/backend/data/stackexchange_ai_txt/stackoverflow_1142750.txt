Using ASP.NET Controls without databinding

It appears that I have been using asp.net databinding for so long I have forgotten some of the basics. I am dynamically creating a table in an ASPX page without databinding. foreach (XXX x in TTTT){ %> ' ImageUrl="../images/IMG.png"/> As you can probably see I cannot use the RUNAT=Server or if I do I cannot specify an id for the row. This is just a simple example what I am attempting to do is much more complex and is not conducive to databiding. In Classic ASP we used to just call a JS method and then submit the form with the PKID embedded in a hidden field. It there a more elegant way to solve this(We are using Jquery if this helps) AS I said I am VERY familiar with all the .net controls and use them often, in this instance it is not the correct tool.
