Drag/Drop between medium/high integrity level processes in Windows Vista

In Windows Vista, I am unable to drag/drop files onto my application's window because it is running as a high integrity level process. I need to run it as high, but I also need to be able to accept dropped files from low/medium integrity level processes like Windows Explorer. I believe it is UIPI that is blocking the drag/drop operation. I know that I can use the ChangeWindowMessageFilter function to allow certain Windows messages to bypass UIPI, but I'm not sure which messages to add to allow the drag/drop operation. Is ChangeWindowMessageFilter the right approach to permit this, or is there a better way? Thanks!
