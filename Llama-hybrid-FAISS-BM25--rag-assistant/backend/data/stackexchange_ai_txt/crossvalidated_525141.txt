If you want to know the average height of students at a university, there is a simple way to do this without a Geiger counter or any other random generator. The solution is quite simple: record the height of every student at the university and compute the average height . Of course, this is hard to do in practice because the population size is too large. The natural thing to do is to take a sample of your population and use the average of this sub-sample as a proxy. You can try to take a sample without using randomness, but your resulting answer is susceptible to several forms of bias. Here are two simple examples where you can obtain a biased answer. Suppose you stand at the front door of the gymnasium and measure the height of students as they walk in. This is known as a convenience sample . Are you confident that the height of students that frequent the gymnasium are representative of the student body? What if the Basketball team is arriving for practice today? Suppose you send an email to the entire student body and request that they fill out an optional survey recording their height. Not every student is going to respond: are you confident that those who do are representative of the population? It may be the case that taller men are more likely to respond. This is an example of voluntary response bias (albeit, not a very good one). In this scenario, you also have to deal with the fact that respondents may not be truthful, with a few subjects exaggerating their height. By taking a simple random sample, we are able to avoid these (and many other) forms of bias. The Law of Large Numbers essentially guarantees that you can get as close to the true answer as you would like, by taking a large enough sample. But this result (at least the basic version) only holds under simple random sampling.
