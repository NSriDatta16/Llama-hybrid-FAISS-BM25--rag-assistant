How can you set-up PHP + xDebug + (x)Unit + Eclipse to work with breakpoints in unit tests?

Have tried for quite some time to get this to work correctly but to no luck. Basically, I have Eclipse (3.3) with PHP Development Tools (PDT), and the PDT XDebug plugin as well as the SimpleTest eclipse plugin. What I want to do is debug code invoked by SimpleTest unit tests. SimpleTest clearly can see XDebug, because I can generate code coverage reports, but it just won't stop on breakpoints. Edit : Should add that XDebug and breakpoints work fine in eclipse, just not when invoked by SimpleTest Has anyone set this up successfully? There's a lot of guff docs around and little in the way of useful information. Thanks!
