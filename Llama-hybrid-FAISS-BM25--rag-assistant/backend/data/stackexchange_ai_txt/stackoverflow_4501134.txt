In traditional testing, assuming waterfall process, testing happens after the development phase. Testers create their tests from the requirements gathered at the beginning of the project. In the stereotypical sense, large organizations have a QA department completely separated from development departments where they are handed the final application and documentation to write test cases from. In an agile environment testing occur asynchronously with development so that when a developer finishes a task it is tested so that at the end of the iteration the stakeholders know the task is a fully functional and tested. If bugs are revealed, they can be fixed earlier in the cycle, not in the final stretch. This does not assume that every team writes using TDD or even pair / extreme programming. One of the goals of agile is to improve communication between team members. Testers are included in the iteration planning and review meetings giving them more insight into what a given task is to accomplish. This will help them write tests beyond the sometimes vague black and white requirements. I disagree with the notion that agile does not scale to larger projects that incorporate a QA department. Yes, in many cases and in some author recommendations agile teams are made of less than 10 but testing is integral in delivering a quality project. The challenge is how to proceed when corporate walls limit progress. How can I get a tester in my meetings or on my team? How can we get the QA more involved so that the customers are happy? etc.
