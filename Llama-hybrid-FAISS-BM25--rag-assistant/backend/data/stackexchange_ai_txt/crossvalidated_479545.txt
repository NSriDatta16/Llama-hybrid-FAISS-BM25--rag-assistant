Options for running GAMs with excessive zeros

I am analyzing count data that has 75% zeros, and I want to determine how catch of my species of interest has changed over time. Since I am looking at a 30 year time series I am using a smoother for year, and was able to run poisson and negative binomial models with the gam function in mgcv, as well as a zero-inflated poisson GAM using the ziP family. I believe for several reasons that a hurdle model would be a better fit for my data, but there is no zero-truncated poisson or negbin family option within mgcv. I know glmmTMB has those families, but it seems like that package does not support smoothers. I've come across the brms package, but it is quite complex and very slow, and I only have a surface level knowledge of Bayesian stats. Are there any other options for dealing with excessive zeros in a GAM context without resorting to computationally intensive Bayesian methods? Thank you!
