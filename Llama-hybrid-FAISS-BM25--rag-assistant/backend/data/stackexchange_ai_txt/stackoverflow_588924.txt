About system data rate in H264

I have a engine to check the H264 video is compliance with AVCHD or BDMV spec, the SPEC mentions the MAX system data rate is up to 24 Mbit/s, I want to know how to calculate the system data rate? Does it mean the average of whole file? Or does it mean the average of 1 second?
