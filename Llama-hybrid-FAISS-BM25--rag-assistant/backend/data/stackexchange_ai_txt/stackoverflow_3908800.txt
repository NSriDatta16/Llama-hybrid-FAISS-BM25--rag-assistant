Auto-generated files (Silverlight *.g.i.cs files) dont' seem ignored when Treat warnings as errors is on

I'm trying to be a good dev and turn on treat warnings as errors (as I have always done in the past). The biggest difference is that this time, I'm using Silverlight 4 which generates a ton of code. All of the code starts something like this: #pragma checksum //------------------------------------------------------------------------------ // // This code was generated by a tool. // Runtime Version:4.0.30319.1 // // Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if // the code is regenerated. // //--------- However, the treat warnings as errors is not ignoring it. I was under the impression that including such a header would cause the file to be ignored. Apparently, I'm wrong. Does anyone have a (clean) suggestion?
