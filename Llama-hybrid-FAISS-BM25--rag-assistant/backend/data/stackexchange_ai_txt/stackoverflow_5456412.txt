Internal Server Error - Python CGI

I am currently writing a CGI script that has an end goal of running a java program and then redirecting to a different page. However, the CGI causes a 500 internal server error when I call try to run the java program. I've tried os.system("[command]") and call(["command"]) and subprocess.Popen("command") and all three cause the same issue to crop up. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Edit Also, the apache log gives me next to no information saying only that there is an invalid header. Edit #!/usr/bin/python # Import the CGI module import cgi import random import os import sys import re import subprocess # Required header that tells the browser how to render the HTML. print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n" form = cgi.FieldStorage() userID = random.random() print " " print " Results " print " " command = "java [classname] " user_id = random.randint(0, sys.maxint) command += str(user_id) + " " command += re.sub(r'\s', '', form['key0'].value) + " " command += form['key1'].value + " " command += form['key2'].value + " " command += form['key3'].value + " " if form.has_key('key3') else "0 " ## This is where the problem exists #os.system("ls -l") #call(["ls", "-l"]) #p = subprocess.Popen(command) ## End of Problem print command print " " print "Redirecting..." print " " print " " print " " the entire command is not there, but I believe it is built correctly because I can copy the printed command out and run it in a terminal and it runs perfectly. The command is simply java [classname] [9 args] the java code runs smoothly outside of the python code and all it does is generate a .png file and a .html file containing the .png. The name of the file is [user_id].html, hence the redirect. the internal server error does not occur if only the process commands are commented out. EDIT Ended up giving up and moving to php to execute this script. Thanks for all the help!
