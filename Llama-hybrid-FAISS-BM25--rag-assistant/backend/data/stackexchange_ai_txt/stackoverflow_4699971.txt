PHP is native to the web. While Ruby and Python have much cleaner syntax, more elegance, and more power, there will always be a layer of abstraction between Ruby/Python and the web itself -- after all, they were designed for much wider domains than the web. Newbies to programming are typically newbies to sysadmin, and getting to Hello World in a Rails or Django is pretty painful -- for some even prohibitively so -- compared to PHP. For newbies, it's easy to conceptualize that typing in: http://mysite.com/something.php ...will execute the code stored in the file: /path/to/mysite's/webroot/something.php This simple one-to-one routing also mirrors that of HTML and other static files. Beware, however, because this one-to-one routing also leads to security problems (i.e. people tend to keep all of their executable code within the webroot -- even secure code, which may contain passwords, hash salts, and other Privacy-Important code). Combine this with a lack of sysadmin experience, and many sites on the web are a chmod away from being totally exposed. Responsible PHP like Symfony helps people avoid this, but Symfony requires the same level of sysadmin chops as Rails and Django.
