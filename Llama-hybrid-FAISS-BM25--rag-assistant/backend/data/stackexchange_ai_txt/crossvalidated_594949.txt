Well, in a private conversation you can say many things. What harm does it do? However, personally I wouldn't call this Bayesian, because no computations and no quantities are involved, and people have made conclusions like this without knowing anything of Bayes, and quite certainly already before Bayes's time. Making reference to the headline, in any case it's not the event that could be Bayesian, but rather your reasoning about it.
