your final equation leads to the MA representation of an AR process. Pred[X(t)] = cons + a1*W(t-1) + a2*W(t-2) + .... an*W(t-n) reflecting how previous errors "cause" X. All ARMA models can be presented as pure AR models (weighted average of the past ) or as a pure MA mode ( weighted average of the past errors )
