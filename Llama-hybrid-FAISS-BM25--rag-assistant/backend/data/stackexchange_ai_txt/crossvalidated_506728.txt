I am confused in MAE, MSE and RMSE?

Context: When we talk about the performance of liner regression then we take help of performance metrics like: Mean Absolute Error Mean Square Error Root Mean Square Error We calculate MAE to find an average error and then we compare that error with mean of our data. After that, we try to look at MSE and RMSE. Why we use MSE and RMSE? I read a article where it was written that by using MSE and RMSE we penalize the outlier. What is punish/penalize the outliers means? Why do we need to check the spread using MSE and RMSE? If our MAE is large that means we have outliers in data-set right? If we know our data set have outliers then why we calculate MSE and RMSE? we simply can remove them if not necessary! Suppose our error is 1.2, mean is 14 and RMSE is 1.4 then according to me RMSE is telling that prediction has deviated 1.4 from actual which is exactly what error is telling us. MAE = Mean Absolute Error MSE = Mean Square Error RMSE = Root Mean Square Error
