Gaussian Processes assume an underlying continuum. That being time, space, acidity, or simply the values a regularisation parameter. The error bars in this example are indeed associated with the placement of the know points but that is completely expected; the further away we are from a know point, the more uncertain we are about the estimated value. I would not say " most appropriate for time-series data " but I would note that time-series modelling through Gaussian Processes is a well-accepted application of GPs. Roberts et al. (2012) Gaussian processes for time-series modelling is a pretty authoritative reference to start off if you want to read on this further.
