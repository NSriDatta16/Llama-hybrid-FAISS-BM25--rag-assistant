ML techniques for mathematical inverse approximations

I have some inputs and outputs of a set of functions, and I want to be able to find/approximate any given input vector from its corresponding output vector (In other words learn the inverses of these functions without knowing the form of the function explicitly). What sort of machine learning techniques would work well for this? Naively I am leaning toward neural networks, since that is what I have the most familiarity with, but I am curious what other options there are for these sorts of mathematical approximations.
