What kind of model you are going to train? The residuals is different with frequentist and bayesian statistics. In frequentist statistics, residuals is a kind of MSE (Mean squared error) or risk function. Frequently, you would like to optimize the risk function $\mathbb{E}_\theta\left(L(\theta,\delta(X))\right)$, $L$ is a loss function, $\delta$ is your expected value. You talk model's accuracy. First you should give a mathematical definition for your specific model's accuracy like $L(\theta,\hat{\theta})=\left(\theta-\hat{\theta}\right)^2$ or some loss function is proper for your model.
