Synthetic control method with temporal gaps

I am running into a tricky issue with the execution of the synthetic control method for my data. For reference, my outcome data has an odd temporal gap (uniformly, across all units, no data is avaliable for 1993). However, temporal coverage is sufficient barring this one-year gap. Unfortunatley, across various units, the treatment occurs near 1993. This means that this temporal gap creates an artifical year of missing data in the pre- or post-treatment period. My question is, does this pose a serious threat to the feasability of the synthetic control method for my project?
