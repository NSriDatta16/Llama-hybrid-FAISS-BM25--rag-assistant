One note: you should use 3 as the minimum satellites, not 0. A GPS needs at least three sources to calculate a horizontal location. Every GPS I have used includes a status flag in the data stream; less than 3 satellites is reported as "bad" data in some way. You should also consider "stationary" data. How will you handle the pedestrian standing still for some period of time? Perhaps waiting at a crosswalk or interacting with a street vendor? Depending on what you plan to do with the data, you may need to supress those extra data points or average them into a single point or location.
