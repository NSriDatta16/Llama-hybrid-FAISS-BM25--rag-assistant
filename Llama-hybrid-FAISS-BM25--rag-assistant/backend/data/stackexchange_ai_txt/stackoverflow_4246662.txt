This depends on the scale. If there will be a LOT of client requests to do this, it's definitely "faster" to do it on the client side (e.g. in JS before the Ajax call), since putting it on the server side causes the server to process ALL those requests whch will compete for server's CPU resources, whereas client side you will only do one detection per client. If you only anticipate very few concurrent requests, then doing it in Perl is probably marginally faster since Perl's regex implementation is likely better/faster than JavaScript (I don't have any stats to back this up, though) and presumably the server has better CPU. But I would not really think that the server side margin would be terribly big considering the whole processing shouldn't take that long on either side, so I'd advise to go with client-side checking since that (as per the first paragraph) scales better. If the performance difference between the two really matters to you a lot, you should actually implement both and benchmark under both the average anticipated and the maximum projected client loads.
