Why doesn't this work (javascript + audio player)

I am trying to use the JavaScript audio player(http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone/) on my website. I tried passing PHP variables into the JavaScript but it does not seem to work properly. The JavaScript replaces the html paragraph with a matching id into a flash mp3 player. EDIT: Updated the issue If I pass the url directly, the mp3 player plays but when I pass it through a variable it does not. This works ">Install flash to use mp3 player var id = "audioplayer_" + ; AudioPlayer.embed(id, {soundFile: "http://site.com/mp3file.mp3"}); But this does not ">Install flash to use mp3 player var id = "audioplayer_" + ; var url = " "; AudioPlayer.embed(id, {soundFile: url}); The value of the $url variable is http://site.com/mp3file.mp3
