Forgive my sarcasm, but one obvious good example of the utility of p-values is in getting published. I had one experimenter approach me for producing a p-value... he had introduced a transgene in a single plant to improve growth. From that single plant he produced multiple clones and chose the largest clone, an example where the entire population is enumerated. His question, the reviewer wants to see a p-value that this clone is the largest. I mentioned that there is not any need for statistics in this case as he had the entire population at hand, but to no avail. More seriously, in my humble opinion, from an academic perspective i find these discussion interesting and stimulating, just like the frequentist vs Bayesian debates from a few years ago. It brings out the differing perspectives of the best minds in this field and illuminates the many assumptions/pitfalls associated with the methodology thats not generally readily accesible. In practice, I think that rather than arguing about the best approach and replacing one flawed yardstick with another, as has been suggested before elsewhere, for me it is rather a revelation of an underlying systemic problem and the focus should be on trying to find optimal solutions. For instance, one could present situations where p-values and CI complement each other and circumstance wherein one is more reliable than the other. In the grand scheme of things, I understand that all inferential tools have their own shortcomings which need to be understood in any application so as to not stymie progress towards the ultimate goal.. the deeper understanding of the system of study.
