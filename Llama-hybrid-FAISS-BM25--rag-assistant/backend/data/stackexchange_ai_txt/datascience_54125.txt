I'm not sure, if it's possible with this data set. Word2Vec is used to generate word embedding, which works on the principle of "words association" in a sentence. So I dont think you can apply Word2Vec on this dataset which looks like doesn't have any association, except on some places where you can match(perform clustering) some parameters like: Units Size/dimension of the item-name Interested to know some solution for such types of problems.
