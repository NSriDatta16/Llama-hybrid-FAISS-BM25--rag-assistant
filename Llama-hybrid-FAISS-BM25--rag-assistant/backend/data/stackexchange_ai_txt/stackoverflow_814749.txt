I always try to write programs as much as possible in the language the company mainly uses. It makes no sense to resort to a scripting language (because it is a fragment easier) if there are six programmers sitting doing C++ in the company, increasing the language requirements on the next hire. Personally I resent Perl because, well, the syntax is slightly cryptographic. Moreover it is not such a "corporate" language, specially not here, and outside of the Unix sysadmin corner it is hard to find people that are really versed in it (*) Note that this is just a write-up from my current viewpoint, which is mostly that of a programmer in a small shop with big commercial clients that force their practices on us. YMMV. (*) webdevels do mostly ASP.NET here.
