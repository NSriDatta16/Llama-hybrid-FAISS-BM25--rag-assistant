Orthogonal polynomial contrasts in SPSS (for a binary logistic regression)

I have 4 IVs: gender (male, female), marital status (married, single), threat (continuous variable) and stress with four levels (ranging from 7 to 10 with ten being 'most stressed'). My DV is prosocial behaviour. I'm doing a binary logistic regression. I've been advised to do orthogonal polynomial contrasts on the ordinal variable of 'stress'. I've been advised to follow some resources but the content of those is not clear to me. My questions would be: 1) Do I have to create these contrasts for my gender (male, female) and marital status (married, single) IVs too or just the ordinal variable? 2) One of the resources (youtube video) contrast codes a gender variable like this: if female = female gender coding = 1. if female = male gender coding = -1. How do I translate this rule to my stress variable with 4 levels? 3) Another resource says the following: Polynomial Contrast This contrast gives you the linear effect across all categories (for the first degree of freedom), the quadratic effect (for the second degree of freedom), the cubic effect (for the third degree of freedom), and so on for higher-order effects. It should be noted that these contrasts are orthogonal. For example, the polynomial contrast for age would be: (1 1 1 1) linear (-3 -1 1 3) quadratic (1 -1 -1 1) cubic (-1 3 -3 1) How to apply this to my ordinal IV? 4) The final resource shows me how to do it in SPSS . It does not seem to refer to any of the stuff mentioned above so I guess I don't have to do the contrasts manually after all. This resource (from researchgate) says the following: To perform a polynomial orthogonal contrast analysis by SPSS, one can follow these steps: Define the predictor variable as a factor and assign it a numerical value for each level (My gender IV is male (0) and female (1). Marital status is single (0), married (1). My stress IV has 4 levels. I gave the 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', and 'most' labels a numerical value of 7, 8, 9, and 10). Define the predictor variable as a factor and assign it a numerical value for each level. Go to Analyze > General Linear Model > Univariate. Select the response variable as the dependent variable and the predictor variable as the fixed factor. ( Do I add all of my IVs in the Fixed Factors square? ) Click on Model and select Custom. Then select the predictor variable and move it to the model box. Click on Build Term and select Polynomial. Choose the highest order of polynomial that you want to test (up to k, where k + 1 is the number of levels of the predictor variable). Click on Add and then Continue. Click on Options and select Descriptive statistics, Estimates of effect size, and Homogeneity tests. Then select the predictor variable and move it to the Display Means box. Click on Compare Main Effects and select Polynomial from the drop-down menu. Click on Continue and then OK. The output will show a table with the polynomial contrasts for each order of polynomial that you selected. You can interpret the F and p values to test for significance of each contrast. You can also see the estimated marginal means and plots for each level of the predictor variable. 5) The resource says: "Click on Model and select Custom. Then select the predictor variable and move it to the model box. Click on Build Term and select Polynomial. Choose the highest order of polynomial that you want to test (up to k, where k + 1 is the number of levels of the predictor variable). Click on Add and then Continue." However, there is no 'polynomial' to click and only these options are there to choose under Build terms: 'Interaction' 'Main effects' 'All 2 way' 'All 3 way' 'All 4 way' 'All 5 way' Which one would apply to my stress variable? Also, if I'm adding all of the IVs in the model, then I have factors with 2 levels too (gender, marital status). 6) This seems to be the process for doing an ANOVA but I'm meant to do a binary logistic regression. My outcome variable is binary (yes, no). What do I do, I'm desperate. No textbooks (for social sciences and SPSS) offer any help on this. EDIT EDIT So the Stress IV was ticked as polynomial. The 'Categorical Variables Codings' is as follows. I don't understand how to read the codings. It does not say what code corresponds to the 7, 8, 9, 10 levels of the IV.
