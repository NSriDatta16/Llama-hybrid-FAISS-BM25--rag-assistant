1.) Before encoding your categorical features, you should probably do some feature engineering, so as to reduce the number of categorical features. Once you are sure that you cannot reduce them further without losing valuable info, only then encode them using one hot encoder or any other technique. 2.) You can use the drop feature of One Hot Encoder to reduce the encoded columns. For example the feature gender has 2 dimensions male and female . When you encode them you'll get gender_male and gender_female . If you use the drop feature when encoding, either one of the dimensions will be dropped as the model can work with 1 dimension for the gender feature. This will further reduce the dimensionality of your model. 3.) Other thing you can do is for every feature you can select the top 3-4 most frequent values, drop the others and then encode them. As you mentioned you have some features that have 100+ values. You can choose top 10-20 values for that feature, drop the others and then one hot encode. This will reduce your dimensions by 80% for that variable. 4.) You can check out PCA which is used for dimensionality reduction purposes. I do not have enough knowledge on it. Other than you have to live with the fact that your model will contain high dimensionality (curse of dimensionality!). This haunts each and every Data Scientist.
