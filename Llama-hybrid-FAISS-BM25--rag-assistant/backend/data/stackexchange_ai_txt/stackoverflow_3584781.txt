I think you mean instanceof Iterator , PHP doesn't have an Iterable interface. It does have a Traversable interface though. Iterator and IteratorAggregate both extend Traversable (and AFAIK they are the only ones to do so). But no, objects implementing Traversable won't pass the is_array() check, nor there is a built-in is_iterable() function. A check you could use is function is_iterable($var) { return (is_array($var) || $var instanceof Traversable); } To be clear, all php objects can be iterated with foreach, but only some of them implement Traversable . The presented is_iterable function will therefore not detect all things that foreach can handle.
