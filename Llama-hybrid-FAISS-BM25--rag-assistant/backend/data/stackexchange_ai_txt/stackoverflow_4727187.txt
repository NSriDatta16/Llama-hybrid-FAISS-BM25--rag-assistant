jQuery Drag and Drop table row ordering?

Are there any good tutorials for Drag-and-Drop table row ordering with jQuery-UI or some other plugin? I have been searching and cant seem to find any useful samples. Of course the order of the items would also need to be persisted to my database in some way...
