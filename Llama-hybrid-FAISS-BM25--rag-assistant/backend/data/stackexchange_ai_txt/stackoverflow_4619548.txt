I believe that Chrome is automatically closing your tag, because of the way chrome interprets the tag. If you look at the definition of the figure tag , you'll see it's supposed to be outside the flow of the content, and thus should not be contained within a paragraph. Try using a different item than figure, and I bet it will work. You can read more about flow content here
