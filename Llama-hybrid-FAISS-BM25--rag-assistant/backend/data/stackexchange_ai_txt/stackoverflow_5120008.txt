This does what I want. But is there a more elegant solution? //*[contains(@class, "columns")]//tr[contains(@class, "datarow")][1] | //*[contains(@class, "columns")]//tr[not(contains(@class, "altrow"))] [preceding-sibling::tr[1] [contains(@class, "altrow")]] | //*[contains(@class, "columns")]//tr[contains(@class,"altrow")] [preceding-sibling::tr[1] [not(contains(@class, "altrow"))]] The second part selects each set of consecutive rows with class not containing "altrow" as a single nodeset. The third part selects each set of consecutive rows with class containing "altrow" as a single node set. The first part selects the first set of consecutive rows with class not containing "altrow", because it is not selected by the second part.
