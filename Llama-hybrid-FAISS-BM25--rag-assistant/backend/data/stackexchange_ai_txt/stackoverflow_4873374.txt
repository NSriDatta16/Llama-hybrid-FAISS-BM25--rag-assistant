AJAX Jquery url not working

I have a strange problem with Jquery Ajax with the following code. Situation 1: function leuk(decrease_id, user_id) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: 'http://schoolprove.nl/nieuw/index.php/leerlingen/checkvoortgang/', data: 'decrease_id=' + decrease_id + '&user_id=' + user_id, success: function (msg) { $('#output').html(msg); } }); } Situation 2 function leuk(decrease_id, user_id) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: '/nieuw/index.php/leerlingen/checkvoortgang/', data: 'decrease_id=' + decrease_id + '&user_id=' + user_id, success: function (msg) { $('#output').html(msg); } }); } The AJAX url works sometimes whith http:// and sometimes without. I build and error catch when a error occured. This works very well at IE but Firefox doesn't give a error. So at some computers with Firefox this will not work. It is very strange and i don't know why it will not work. Situation 1: Works sometimes Situation 2: Works sometimes Sometimes situation 1 works and ad a other computer situation 2 works, WHY? Anybody know how to solve? Thank you very much!!
