Comparing mixed effect models fitted to two different datasets

I have two different time series data which are the results of running a simulation model with different sets of parameters and configurations. The datasets each contain 100 time series which indicate the evolution of the target outcome (LGRD) through the simulation steps (Days). There are 70 entry points for each time series, which vary between -0.1 to about 1. Here's an example of one of these time series: My objective is to compare the trends in these two datasets in more detail than just at the aggregated level. For example, I want to know whether one contains more negative trends or if the correlation between intercepts and slopes varies across models... I thought using mixed effect models could help me address such an objective and therefore, I fitted two random slope models to each of these datasets (using the lmer package in R: LGRD ~ Day + (1 + Day|Subject). I can tell from plotting the random effects for each model that one shows more negative trends than the other and overall has more flat trends. Here are the plotted random slopes of the two mixed-effect models: However, I want to draw these conclusions quantitatively... Is there a valid way to compare the outcomes of two mixed-effect models fitted to two different datasets? I can think of some methods but as I am not an expert in statistics I'm not sure if I could trust my thoughts on this matter ...
