There are many way to do this since the DVD drives have several interfaces for this due to legacy and backward-compatibility issues. You could send an IOCTL_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH_DIRECT command to the DVD-drive ( the physicaldevice handle for it). With it you issue a SCSI commands that will be answered by the drive. You can read session information, disk information disk capcity and more. I believe that dvd+rw-mediainfo.exe issues these. Unfortunatly, the interface is a bit tricky and obscure, since it is a command within a command. Th passthrough has a byte buffer you will have to fill in yourself with the command structure. Or you can call IOCTL_CDROM_READ_TOC_EX: http://www.osronline.com/ddkx/storage/k306_2cs2.htm I also believe that the exact set of the IOCTL / commands that will work depends on on the drive and its firmaware. Older drives will not support the newr interfaces and some of the newer drives will not support legacy interfaces. Thus, some of the libraries & tools might use one or more of these interfaces. Accseeing the older sessons is all quite messy, really, since most OS will not care about them, only the most recent ones.
