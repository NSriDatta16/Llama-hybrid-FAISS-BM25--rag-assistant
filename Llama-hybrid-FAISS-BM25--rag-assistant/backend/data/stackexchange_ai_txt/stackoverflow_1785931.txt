I second jonstjohn's opinion on HTTP authentication through creating a .htaccess (to allow only certain addresses to access the script) and .htpasswd (to define users who have access). However, this is true if you only need a quick solution for a few scripts. If there are more scripts that require limited access, the best solution would be to create a class to take care of user logging and keep track of user session. Generally speaking, embedding passwords and magic numbers in scripts is considered to be a bad coding style. Not to mention that those hard-coded "if"s are really hard to maintain.
