Seriously, if your organization is as chaotic and amateurish as you describe, I would start looking for another job before they go under. As Martin Fowler once quipped If you can't change your organization, change your organization If, on the other hand, you feel like they can change, then I'd make an attempt to start that change by introducing retrospectives before anything else on your list. If you can get people talking to each other and starting to identify the waste that goes on, and someone involved has sufficient mandate to listen to that feedback and make changes, however tentative, you'll be on the right track. All of the other practices you've identified are techniques for eliminating particular types of waste - writing unit tests, for example, to reduce the waste of fixing defects later in the project. By holding retrospectives you'll shine a light on these wastes and give people a space do decide they might like to do things more professionally. In the end, it's about self-respect: yours, your colleagues, and the organization as a whole. Are you satisfied to just muddle along the way things have always been, or do you want to try to be as good at what you do as you possibly can be? Good luck!
