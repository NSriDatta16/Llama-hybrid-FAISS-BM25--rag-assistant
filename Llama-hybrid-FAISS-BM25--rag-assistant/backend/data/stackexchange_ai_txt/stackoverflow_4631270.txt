I can't log into my local copy of Magento -- how to use lost password with local copy of software?

I have a local install of Magento on my Mac using MAMP. I need to retrieve my password, but the lost password is obviously not working out of the box. Is there a way with MAMP to use the lost password feature (e.g. by activating a mail sever)?
