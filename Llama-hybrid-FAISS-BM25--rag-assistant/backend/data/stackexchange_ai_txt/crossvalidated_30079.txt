If you keep all the components from a PCA - then the Euclidean distances between patients in the new PCA-space will equal their Mahalanobis distances in the observed-variable space. If you'll skip some components, that will change a little, but anyway. Here I refer to to unit-variance PCA-components, not the kind whose variance is equal to eigenvalue (I am not sure about your PCA implementation). I just mean, that if you want to evaluate Mahalanobis distance between the patients, you can apply PCA and evaluate Euclidean distance. Evaluating Mahalanobis distance after applying PCA seems something meaningless to me.
