I think you can put something together. Generally speaking about component classifiers, overall classification is better when the decision rules of the component classifiers differ and provide complementary information. Having said that, one methodology you might try for suggesting the number of bags is to create an arbitrary statistic that indicates which parts of your feature space is covered by a particular bag. You could stop adding bags when you reach a satisfactory level of coverage of your entire feature space: when you have expert classifiers for each region of your feature space. Your bag size could be found heuristically by starting with a roughly equal number of patterns in each bag ( n1 ). Increase n1 to a value half way between its current value and the maximum if you find that n1 is to low. Conversely decrease n1 to between the current value and the minimum if you find it is to high.
