Nearest Neighbors (NN) is a catch-all term for a whole family of methods that use search among the neighbors for different purposes. Scikit-learn named a whole module like this . $k$ NN is a regression and classification algorithm that works by searching the database to find $k$ points the most similar to an example and average them to make the prediction. The other use may be in a content-based recommender system , where we are searching for some number of similar products to present them as recommendations. In both cases, we use the nearest neighbors search as a workhorse. Also, keep in mind that it is not a single algorithm, but there are multiple algorithms and their implementations for it, including exact and approximate ones (e.g. Spotify's Annoy ).
