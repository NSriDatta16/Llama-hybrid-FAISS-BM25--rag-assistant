One of the major reason for not getting accuracy in your neural network. As this is audio data based classification more better approach is to used convolutional neural network by first performing fast fourier transformation on the data. You can always try following style neural network architecture norm_layer = preprocessing.Normalization() norm_layer.adapt(spectrogram_ds.map(lambda x, _: x)) model = models.Sequential([ layers.Input(shape=input_shape), preprocessing.Resizing(32, 32), norm_layer, layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'), layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'), layers.MaxPooling2D(), layers.Dropout(0.25), layers.Flatten(), layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'), layers.Dropout(0.5), layers.Dense(num_labels), ]) model.summary() For detail idea on transformation and training of above network check out below article. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio
