As per my comment, if you can use Jquery UI and Jquery as it will do all the heavy lifting. With regards to your question try end() stopdrag(), javascript can work very differently across browsers, check in another browser to see if the call actually works... console.debug("method called"); is a good command to add to your code to help with debugging...
