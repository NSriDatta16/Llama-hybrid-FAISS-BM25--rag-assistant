I have used approach 1 on a reasonably sized website I have built and there were no performance issues. Magento handles images in this way as well. So save the image when it is uploaded, then when the php view scripts call for the image, generate it on the fly, saving to an appropriate folder (pretty much a cache). One thing I found difficult when using the method you described in point two, wasn't from a performance or coding point of view. It is a bit of a pain re-creating images when the client or designer changes their mind on the size of the thumbs / images etc. You then need to regenerate all the thumbs. This is ok on smaller sites, but can be a pain on larger ones.
