To tackle the problem from the Bayesian perspective, you first need to define the priors of the win rates (skill) of the players. Since we are dealing with 0-1 outcomes (loss/win) in this case, it is natural to use Bernoulli distribution as the sampling distribution of the wins and losses. Now, there is a convenient choice for the prior and that is the Beta distribution (why convenient - see the notes about conjugate priors). Let's define the sampling distribution of the game outcomes for the $i$ -th player as $$P_i(x|\theta_i) = \theta_i^x(1-\theta_i)^{(1 - x)}$$ where $x\in\{0,1\}$ (0 - loss, 1 - win). Let's define the prior distribution of the $i$ -th player skill as $$ B_i(\theta_i;\alpha_i,\beta_i) \propto \theta_i^{\alpha_i-1}(1 - \theta_i)^{\beta-1} $$ Assuming the game plays are independent of each other, you will find out that the posterior probability of $i$ -th player is yet another Beta distribution (due to the mentioned conjugacy) $$ B(\theta_i;\alpha'_i,\beta'_i) = B_i(\theta_i;\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}x_j^{i} + \alpha_i, \left(\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}1 - x_j^{i}\right) + \beta_i) = \prod_{j=1}^{N_i} P_i(x^j_i|\theta_i)B_i(\theta_i;\alpha_i,\beta_i) $$ where $x^i_j$ is the outcome of the $j$ -th game of the $i$ -th player in total of $N_i$ games. Now we are almost there. Lets say you knew for certain that the 1st player skill is $\phi$ and you hold a belief about the skill of the 2nd player as $B(\theta;\alpha,\beta)$ then the probability of the 2nd player being superior to the 1st is given by $$ \int_{\phi}^1B(\theta;\alpha,\beta)d\theta $$ but since in your case you do not know the skill of the 1st player, but you have your own belief about it, you apply the Bayesian "integrate over what you do not know" approach which gives you the final expression $$ \int_0^1\int_{\theta_1}^1B(\theta_1;\alpha'_1,\beta'_1)B(\theta_2;\alpha'_2,\beta'_2)d\theta_1{}d\theta_2 $$ The choice of the prior $\alpha$ a and $\beta$ s is actually up to you and you should actually notice that they have interpretable meaning. Use $\alpha=\beta=1$ for instance to get a uniform prior. If you know Python by any chance, you may actually code a pretty simple Monte Carlo simulation to get an approximate answer two this integral (where I used uniform priors): import numpy as np num_samples = 1000000 player_1 = np.random.beta(7, 5, size=num_samples) player_2 = np.random.beta(57, 45, size=num_samples) print np.mean(player_1 > player_2) >> 0.574937 I am pretty much sure even if you do not know Python the code is pretty much self-explanatory. Hope this helps clarify some things up :).
