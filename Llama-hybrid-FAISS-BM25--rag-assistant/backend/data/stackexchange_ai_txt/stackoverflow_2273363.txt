The amount of data you are receiving each day is quite a lot (~5GB) but the number of rows being inserted is actually rather low. Consequently you need to design your physical model to make database storage adminstration easy and querying efficient. Having a separate database per town only makes sense if you are going to have a server per database. But you do not need load balancing, as you only have to handle eight inserts every ten minutes. On the other hand that architecture will turn every query which compares one town against another into a distributed query. Having one table per town in the same database might give you some performance advantages if the majority of your queries are constrained to data from a town rather than comparing towns. But I wouldn't like to put much money on it. Even if it did work, it might make other sorts of queries harder. Given that the data is the same for all towns my preferred option would be one table with a differentiating column (TOWN_ID). Especially if I had the money to spring for a Oracle license with the Partitioning option.
