Yes, C# normally compiles a lot faster. Not always fast enough though. My biggest C# codebase with maybe a million lines of code with lots of projects took about an hour to compile. But I suspect much of this time is due to visual studios poor build system. Compile time for C++ on the other hand is usually much longer, but is also much more dependent on how you organize your code. Poor handling of header file dependencies can easily increase compilation time with several orders of magnitude.
