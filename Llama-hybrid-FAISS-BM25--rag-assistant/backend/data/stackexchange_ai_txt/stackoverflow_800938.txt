There are languages and protocols you use when creating web artifacts (pages, scripts, styles, etc.) and there are tools you use to manipulate those artifacts (editors, utilities, interpreters, etc.). Regular expressions would belong to latter set and they belong to more advanced specter of it (based on the fact that average web designer is likely to have no clue). But any computer literate person would benefit from learning and using regular expressions - not just web designers. Anything that makes you stand out (in positive way of course) in comparison to the crowd will benefit you - so go ahead and learn regex - you won't regret.
