Fast algorithms to train a perceptron / neural network / ANN

Can anyone provide a brief overview of the most popular training algorithms for perceptrons? I am currently training my perceptron using standard stochastic gradient descent (online gradient descent) with a fixed learning rate. There seems to be hundreds of different algorithms which claim to perform better, but I have found it difficult to find out which one would be most promising to implement (with complexity and time to code up/understand being costs). Also, I am using theano on python.
