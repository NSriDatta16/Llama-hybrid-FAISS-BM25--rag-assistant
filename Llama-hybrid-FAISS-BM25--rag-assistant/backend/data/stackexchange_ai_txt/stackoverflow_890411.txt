I don't know what language you're using, but if it's Java you can leverage LinkedHashMap or a similar Collection. It's got all of the benefits of a List and a Map, provides constant time for most operations, and has the memory footprint of an elephant. :) If you're not using Java, the idea of a LinkedHashMap is probably still suitable for a usable data structure for your problem.
