Interval between events in a Poisson process is exponentially distributed. If you skip intervals, and only count k-th event, then you get convolution of exponential r.v.'s which gives you Erlang distribution (which is a special case of Gamma distribution). Is this what you meant in the first paragraph? If your growth process is such that it adds an iid Gamma distributed length every time, then you will get a Gamma distributed length per time (sums of Gamma r.v. with same scale is again Gamma). But this has little to do with Poisson process, I'm afraid.
