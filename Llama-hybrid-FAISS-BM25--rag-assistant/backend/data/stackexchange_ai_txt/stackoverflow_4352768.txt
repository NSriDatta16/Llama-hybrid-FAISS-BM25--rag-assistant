How do I declare an array of undefined or no initial size?

I know it could be done using malloc , but I do not know how to use it yet. For example, I wanted the user to input several numbers using an infinite loop with a sentinel to put a stop into it (i.e. -1), but since I do not know yet how many he/she will input, I have to declare an array with no initial size, but I'm also aware that it won't work like this int arr[]; at compile time since it has to have a definite number of elements. Declaring it with an exaggerated size like int arr[1000]; would work but it feels dumb (and waste memory since it would allocate that 1000 integer bytes into the memory) and I would like to know a more elegant way to do this.
