You should test the id of the IEditorPart: private boolean isJavaEditor(IWorkbenchPartReference ref) { if (ref == null) { return false; } String JavaDoc id= ref.getId(); return JavaUI.ID_CF_EDITOR.equals(id) || JavaUI.ID_CU_EDITOR.equals(id); } Testing the instance was only needed in eclipse3.1 . alt text http://blogs.zdnet.com/images/Burnette_DSCN0599.JPG JavaUI is the main access point to the Java user interface components. It allows you to programmatically open editors on Java elements, open a Java or Java Browsing perspective, and open package and type prompter dialogs. JavaUI is the central access point for the Java UI plug-in (id " org.eclipse.jdt.ui ") You can see that kind of utility function (" isJavaEditor() ") used for instance in ASTProvider . The mechanism of identification here is indeed simple String comparison. Anyway, you are wise to avoid cast comparison with internal class: it has been listed as one of the 10 common errors in plugins development ;) .
