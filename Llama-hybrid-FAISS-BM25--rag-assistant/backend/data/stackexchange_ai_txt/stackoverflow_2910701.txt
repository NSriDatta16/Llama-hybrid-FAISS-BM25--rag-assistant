You could use Page.Request.UrlReferrer to see where they've come from, but it isn't a completely safe way of achieving this. If each user has 'their own' data, that other users don't have access to, then it sounds like you may want to look at proper multitenancy - though that is often on a per-organisation basis rather than per-user: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy
