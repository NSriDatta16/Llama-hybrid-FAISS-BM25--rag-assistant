How to test a JQuery UI Sortable widget using Selenium?

We have a sortable list using JQuery UI Sortable that we are trying to automate using Selenium. It looks like the dragAndDrop function should work, but when we call it, the UI does not change. However if we look at the DOM with firebug, we see that the order of the list elements DID change. It seems it's just the UI that does not refresh. Any idea how to get it working?
