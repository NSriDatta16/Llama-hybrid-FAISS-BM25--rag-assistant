For an introduction, I would recommend Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers by Cam Davidson-Pilon, freely available online. From its description: An intro to Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming from a computation/understanding-first, mathematics-second point of view. It's highly visual, cuts straight to the value and backfills gritty details later, has lots of examples, has interactive code (in IPython Notebook).
