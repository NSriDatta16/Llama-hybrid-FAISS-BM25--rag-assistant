WPF Programatically scrolling a canvas in a items control

I have an ItemsControl that contains a canvas within a ScrollViewer . The canvas is large and only a portion of it displays at a time. I want to programatically scroll it (the user clicks and drags the canvas to scroll). I looked through the ScrollViewer methods and tried the following in the mouse event handlers: var scrollViewer = (sender) as ScrollViewer; scrollViewer.ScrollToHorizontalOffset(scrollViewer.HorizontalOffset + deltaX); scrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(scrollViewer.VerticalOffset + deltaY); However, this does nothing. I checked the values of deltaX and deltaY and they are valid values (like 3, 5 etc.). The HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset remain 0 at all times, even after executing the above lines. Here is my XAML: Any help/suggestions is appreciated!
