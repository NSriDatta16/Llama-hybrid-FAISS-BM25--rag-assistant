You are correct in your interpretation that $\{coke\} \Rightarrow \{petrol\}$ represents the proposition, or association rule, that: IF someone buys coke at the petrol station THEN he is likely to buy petrol, too. To understand this rule a bit more and place it in context in terms of usefulness, there are a few concepts that you might look at. Let $D$ be the dataset, $X$ and $Y$ itemsets and $\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\}$ an association rule. Support [1], $supp(X)$, is a measure of how frequently the itemset $X$ appears in the dataset as the antecedent/left-hand-side. $supp(X) = \frac{|\{d \in D ; X \in d\}|}{|D|}$ Confidence [1], $conf(\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\})$, is a measure of how frequently the association rule $\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\}$ is true in the dataset. $conf(\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\}) = \frac{supp(X \bigcup Y)}{supp(X)}$ Lift [1], $lift(\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\})$, is a comparison of the observed support to what would be expected if $X$ and $Y$ were independent. $lift(\{X\} \Rightarrow \{Y\}) = \frac{supp(X \bigcup Y)}{supp(X) \times supp(Y)}$ There are other measures of an association rule's "interestingness" as well such as all-confidence, coverage, entropy, interest, leverage, etc. [2, 3].
