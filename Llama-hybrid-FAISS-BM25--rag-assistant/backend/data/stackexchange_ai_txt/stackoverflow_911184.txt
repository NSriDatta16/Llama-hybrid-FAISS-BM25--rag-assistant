Silverlight, SQL Server & Visual Studio: Making test page publicly available on internet

I'm working on a SQL Server 2008 Express + silverlight project, and so far things are working pretty well on the local machine. I've set it up to where the silverlight app connects to the SQL Server using a service reference and LINQ, and I believe the SQL Server allows remote connections with TCP/IP. However, since the silverlight app is an .aspx file, it needs to run on a web server. When I click "run" in visual studio (2008), IE pops up with the address " http://localhost:1437/SQLTestTestPage.aspx ", and everything works correctly. So that I can use this page remotely, I'd like to be able to access the same page by " http://10.215.22.57:1437/SQLTestTestPage.aspx ", where 10.215.22.57 is the IP of the local machine. This doesn't work right now, and I'm not sure exactly how to enable it. Is this even possible through SQL Server, or do I need to set up a separate HTTP server to host the aspx page? Thanks, -Robert Edit: Actually, since I'm launching silverlight app from Visual Studio, I guess it's actually VS that is setting up the web server that hosts the .aspx page, not SQL server.
