Total number of repetition of array value in PHP

I have an array like: [Organization_id] => Array ( [0] => 4 [1] => 4 [2] => 2 [3] => 4 [4] => 2 [5] => 4 [6] => 4 [7] => 4 [8] => 2 ) Now i just want to know that how many times the vale '4' & '2' does present in this array ie: my result must be some thing like this: [id_repeat] => Array ( [0] => 6 [1] => 3 ) where, 0th location will represent the total number of repetition of value '4' & 1st location will represent the total number of repetition of value '2'. But keep in mind that these values are not hardcoded these values will be come from some table. Thanks in advance.
