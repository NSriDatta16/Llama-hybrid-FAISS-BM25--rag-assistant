WordPress Menu Problem: Dropdown Menu Heading Opens Blank Page

I'm just getting started with WordPress and I need some help creating a menu. I'm using WordPress 3.1 with the Suffusion theme. I've got a dropdown menu functioning. I created a category. Let's call it "My Pages". I want to list the pages in my site (not posts) under this category. In the Menu section of WP, I dragged the required pages and placed them under "My Pages". I indented them. I activated the menu. The menu appears, and I can use the dropdown to select the page I want. The problem is that if I click the heading, "My Pages", then I get "Not Found. Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn't here." How do I solve this problem? I don't want the menu heading to open its own page. I simply want it to be the heading for the dropdown menu. Thank you. -Laxmidi
