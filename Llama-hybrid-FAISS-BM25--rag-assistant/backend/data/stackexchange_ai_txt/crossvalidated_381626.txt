A question about pca and gene function analysis

I'm new to bioinformatics, and I have a pretty basic question. Let's say I have a bunch of genes {Xi} and I want to know which one has the most significant on some measurable phenotypic trait Y. Now I have two questions: 1. Assuming that the amount of data is unlimited and I have as many sets of genome: phenotype as I want, can I do some sort of PCA to find out which gene is responsible to the largest part of the variance in Y? Any better Idea? 2. If so, how is the variance in the gene sequence encoded into numbers, so I can do all the variance analysis with it? Thanks in advance, J
