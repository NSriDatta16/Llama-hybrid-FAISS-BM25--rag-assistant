How to model dependency between input features when building a classifier

I have dataset with the shape of (1000,20) (1000 rows, 20 features) and I want to build a classifier for it. However, most sk-learn algorithms assume the these 20 features are independent. In my features, there is a gaussian dependency between the features. How can I model this dependency as an input for a classifier like SVM or ExtraTreeClassifier? Thanks
