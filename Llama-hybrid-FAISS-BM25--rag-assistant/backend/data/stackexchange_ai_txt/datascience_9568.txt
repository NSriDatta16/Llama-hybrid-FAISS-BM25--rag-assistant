Database options for JSON storage, queried with Apache Drill

I am planning to set up a JSON storage system. It will store tens of millions of JSON records, all in the same format. I'd like to be able to query the data using Apache Drill. It looks like there is Drill support for MongoDB and Postgres. However, I'm unsure of the pros and cons of each, and how I'd structure the schema if I'd choose Postgres.
