It's useful to realize there is a generalized system for counting underlying this. Binary is base-2. Familiar decimal is base-10. Linux permission octal is base 8. A number's value is obtained by adding together the individual values of each of its digits. For any digit, the value is derived from a simple formula. (digit) * (base) ^ (number of places to the left of the decimal point) 123 = one hundred and twenty three = (1 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (3 * 10^0) = 100 + 20 + 3 I learned that in CS211 (not bragging, just remembering)
