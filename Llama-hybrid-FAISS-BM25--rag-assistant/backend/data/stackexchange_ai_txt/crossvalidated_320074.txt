What is the resulting increase in Sales ($ and %) from a treatment?

I have 43 weeks of data ( here ) that show the resulting weekly sales of a group of test stores which received a treatment and sales of other "control" stores that did not. There were 36 test stores and 525 control stores - assumed to be very similar to the test stores. The treatment began in week 41. What is the resulting lift in dollars and % - and in what range? I assume I should use regression to solve this, but I am not really sure of the correct way to do that. I have been looking at using CausalImpact in R, but I am not sure I trust the results. Thanks in advance for your help.
