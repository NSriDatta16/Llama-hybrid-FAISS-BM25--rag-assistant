Why wrap in jQuery at all? I see no gain from this as you could drop it with no additional code needed. Line 10 From div.appendChild(jQuery(html01)[0]); To div.innerHTML = html01; Line 13 From jQuery('#screen1').append(fragment); To document.getElementById("screen1").appendChild(fragment); The gain might not be big, but it will be there. Other than that (and based on the code shown) I don't see any way to make things faster.
