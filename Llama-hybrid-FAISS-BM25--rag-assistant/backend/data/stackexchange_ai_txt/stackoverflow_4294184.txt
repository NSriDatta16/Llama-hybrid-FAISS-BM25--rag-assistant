When talking about speed, perhaps you mean complexity . Insertion and retrieval operations for ArrayList (and arrays) are O(1), while for LinkedList they are O(n). And this cannot be changed - it is 'by definition'. O(n) means that in order to insert an object at a given position, or retrieve it, you must traverse, in the worst case, all (n) the items in the list. Hence n operations. For ArrayList this is only one operation.
