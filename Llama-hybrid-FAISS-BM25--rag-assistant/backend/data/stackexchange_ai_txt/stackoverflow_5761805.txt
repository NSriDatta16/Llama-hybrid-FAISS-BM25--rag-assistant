I don't know that there is really a way to solve this or an algorithm to do it the way you have formulated it. It seems like basically you are trying to reach the maximum number of people with exactly 2 announcements. But without knowing any information about the groups of people in advance, you can't really make any kind of intelligent decision about whether or not to use your first announcement. Your second one at least has the benefit of knowing when not to be used (i.e. if the group has no new members then you can know its not worth wasting the announcement). But it still has basically the same problem. The only real way to solve this is to use knowledge about the type of data or the desired outcome to make guesses. If you know that groups average 100 people with a standard deviation of 10, then you could just refuse to announce if less than 90 people are present. Or, if you know you need to reach at least 100 people with two announcements, you could choose never to announce to less than 50 at once. Obviously those approaches risk never announcing at all if the actual data does not meet what you would expect. But that's always going to be a risk, since you could get 1 person in the first group and then 0 in all of the rest, no matter what you do. Or, you could try more clearly defining the problem, I have a hard time figuring out how to relate this to computers.
