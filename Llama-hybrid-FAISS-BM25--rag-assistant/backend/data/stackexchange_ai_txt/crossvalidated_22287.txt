I think a maximum entropy approach could be useful here. We can assign a normal distribution because we believe the data is "normally distributed" (whatever that means) or because we only expect to see deviations of about the same Magnitude. Also, because the normal distribution has just two sufficient statistics, it is insensitive to changes in the data which do not alter these quantities. So in a sense you can think of a normal distribution as an "average" over all possible distributions with the same first and second moments. this provides one reason why least squares should work as well as it does.
