From the way you wrote the equation, it follows that you pool time series and cross sectional data together, therefore combine all data, run the regression and report t-stats. Say you have 100 companies with 3 measures and an outcome which you assume is linearly dependent on the measures. You take measures in time, thus you also have say 12 monthly measures. Now you are asking: 1) What is the influence of each measure on the outcome in time for a particular company? Well, it is b1_hat_i, b2_hat_i, b3_hat_i, given they are significant (p-values are less than 0.05 for each). I am assuming away autocorrelation which is quite likely with time-series that usually require a different technique, not OLS, but ARMA, etc. 2) Now you are asking what is the overall effect for a company, of measures 1,2,3 on the outcome? Well, pool companies and answer in a joint regression. However, one regression for all companies may be a wrong model like an average temperature for a hospital -- it matters WHAT is the company. Now, if you want to average individual coefficients, because it is your theoretical belief, you can test whether coefficients of the pooled model are different from the estimated value of the average of the individual coefficients. If they are, most likely averaging was not a good idea.
