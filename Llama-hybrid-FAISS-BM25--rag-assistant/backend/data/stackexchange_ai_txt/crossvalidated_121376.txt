The rfcv function creates multiple models based on the number of predictors and the "step" argument (default = 0.5). In your case you began with 9 predictors with step = 0.7 which corresponds to the first row in your output first value = 9, second value = round(9(0.7)) = 6, third value = round(6(0.7)) = 4, and so on. So the first row of the output is just the number of predictors used in each model. The second row in your output is the cross-validation error of each of the models. It becomes clear that as the number of predictors are reduced the error generally increases, but the difference between using 9 predictors and using 6 predictors is low which suggests the 6 predictor model is about as good as the 9 predictor model.
