How to detect an active x component that does not respond any more?

My application is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework. I use the QAxWidget class to access an active x component. Now I need some kind of mechanism that notifies my application each time the active x component has crashed or does not respond any more (due to dead lock or infinite loop). (1) can easily been done by watching the external process of the active x component. But maybe there is a more elegant approach? But how can (2) be implemented?
