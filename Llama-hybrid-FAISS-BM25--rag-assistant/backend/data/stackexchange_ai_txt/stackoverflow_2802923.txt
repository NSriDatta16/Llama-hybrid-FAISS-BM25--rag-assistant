This isn't a problem with your template - it's a problem with the way your data is bound to your list control. ObservableCollection is a collection that implements the INotifyCollectionChanged interface. That interface raises events when items are added or removed from your collection and actually helps an ItemsControl avoid the scenario you're seeing. In your code, are you re-creating the collection each time it changes, or are you just adding items to the existing collection? My suspicion is that you're doing the former, which is why you'll see the behaviour you describe (even if the objects in the collection are the same, the collection itself is different). (Piotr's solution will still cause all of your controls to be recreated every time you re-bind - it just means that you will have to initiate rebinding yourself, which I would contend is less elegant and less intuitive code.)
