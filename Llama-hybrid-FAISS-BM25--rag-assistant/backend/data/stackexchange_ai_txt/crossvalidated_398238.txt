In machine learning, this is referred to as online learning . As @Glen_b pointed out, there are special cases in which the MLE can be updated without needing to access all the previous data. As he also points out, I don't believe there's a generic solution for finding the MLE. A fairly generic approach for finding the approximate solution is to use something like stochastic gradient descent. In this case, as each observation comes in, we compute the gradient with respect to this individual observation and move the parameter values a very small amount in this direction. Under certain conditions, we can show that this will converge to a neighborhood of the MLE with high probability; the neighborhood is tighter and tighter as we reduce the step size, but more data is required for convergence. However, these stochastic methods in general require much more fiddling to obtain good performance than, say, closed form updates.
