Thank you all for your time and your answers. I have now found a solution. Previously I thought the input for the batchtest part of my ant target should be .class files but it is also possible to use .java files. That solved the problem. Now it no longer complains about inner classes missing public constructors. My only problem now is, that I have to filter out the test classes without tests, in order to avoid a "No runnable methods"-error. That is, the helper and util classes. There must be a more elegant solution than mine. One solution could be a naming convention as suggested [ JUnit: how to avoid "no runnable methods" in test utils classes . The helper classes does not contain the @Test annotaion. It must be possible to utilize this in some way...
