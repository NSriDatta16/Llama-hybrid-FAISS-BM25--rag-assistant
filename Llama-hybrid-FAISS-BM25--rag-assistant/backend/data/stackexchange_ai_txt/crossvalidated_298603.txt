You can use a Bayesian maximum a posteriori approach with a weak prior on the fixed effects to get approximately the same effect. In particular, the blme package for R (which is a thin wrapper around the lme4 package) does this, if you specify priors for the fixed effects as in the example here (search for "complete separation"): cmod_blme_L2 This example is from an experiment where ttt is a categorical fixed effect with 4 levels, so the $\beta$ vector will have length 4. The specified prior variance-covariance matrix is $\Sigma = 9 I$ , i.e. the fixed effect parameters have independent $N(\mu=0,\sigma^2=9)$ (or $\sigma$ , i.e. standard devation, $=3$ ) priors. This works pretty well, although it's not identical to Firth correction (since Firth corresponds to a Jeffreys prior , which is not quite the same). The linked example shows you can also do it with the MCMCglmm package, if you want to go full-Bayesian ...
