DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) requires prior normalization?

I'm trying DTW from mlpy , to check similarity between time series. Should I normalize the series before processing them with DTW? Or is it somewhat tolerant and I can use the series as they are? All time series stored in a Pandas Dataframe, each in one column. Size is less than 10k points.
