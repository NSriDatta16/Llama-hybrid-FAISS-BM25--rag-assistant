Scheduled execution of code to conduct database operations in SQL Server

If I want to conduct some database operations on a scheduled basis, I could: Use SQL Server Agent (if SQL Server) to periodically call the stored procedure and/or execute the T-SQL Run some external process (scheduled by the operating system's task scheduler for example) which executes the database operation etc. Two questions: What are some other means of accomplishing this What decision criteria should one use to decide the best approach? Thank you.
