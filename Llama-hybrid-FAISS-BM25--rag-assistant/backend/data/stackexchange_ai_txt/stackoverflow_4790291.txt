As pointed out in the previous posts, SQLite is a great SQL library, but it can run out of gas when the data set gets very large. Berkeley DB recently introduced a SQL API which is completely SQLite compatible. It was added to Berkeley DB in order to provide the best of both worlds to SQLite users -- the ubiquity, simplicity and ease of use of SQLite with the concurrency, scalability and reliability of Berkeley DB. The Berkeley DB SQL API was designed to be a drop-in replacement for SQLite applications, especially those that specifically need the Berkeley DB features and scalability that isn't available in native SQLite. You can read more about it in the Berkeley DB SQL API documentation . Disclaimer: I'm one of the Product Managers for Berkeley DB, so I'm a little biased. But your use case is one of the reasons that we worked with Dr. Hipp and the SQLite developers in order to combine the SQLite API with the Berkeley DB storage manager. It allows SQLite application developers to take their applications into new areas with added capabilities, while remaining compatible with their existing implementation. Please let us know if you have any questions or if there is anything that we can do to help. You can find an active community of Berkeley DB developers on the OTN Forums . Best of luck with your project. Regards, Dave
