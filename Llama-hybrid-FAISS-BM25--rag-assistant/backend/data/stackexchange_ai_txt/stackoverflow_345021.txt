How do you handle "special-case" data when modeling a database?

Our organization provides a variety of services to our clients (e.g., web hosting, tech support, custom programming, etc...). There's a page on our website that lists all available services and their corresponding prices. This was static data, but my boss wants it all pulled from a database instead. There are about 100 services listed. Only two of them, however, have a non numeric value for "price" (specifically, the strings "ISA" and "cost + 8%" - I really don't know what they're supposed to mean, so don't ask me). I'd hate to make the "price" column a varchar just because of these two listings. My current approach is to create a special "price_display" field, which is either blank or contains the text to display in place of the price. This solution feels too much like a dirty hack though (it would needlessly complicate the queries), so is there a better solution?
