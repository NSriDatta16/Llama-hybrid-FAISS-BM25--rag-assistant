What features does Firebug have that Chrome's Developer Tools do not have?

I'm a novice web developer, and I've had Firebug recommended for debugging several times. So far, however, I've just been using Chrome's built-in Developer Tools. It seems to do everything that Firebug does, and is cleaner and more organized as a bonus. As I get more advanced in my debugging, are there features that Firebug has that I'll miss out on with Chrome's DevTools? If so, what are they? Related: Firebug-like debugger for Google Chrome
