I had a long discussion in dsp.stackexchange.com regarding the terminology overlap/confusion between the DSP world and the time series world. At the end we came to the following common understandings: 1) Filter and process are different things. Filter is something that has an input and output, but it doesn't generate any data by itself. Nor it has a preference regarding what kind of input it expects. It simply filters the input and when used with an inappropriate (not designed to handle) input it simply yields something not very useful. 2) A MA process can be implemented using an FIR filter(with appropriate coefficients) by exciting the filter input with a white noise process. The output of the filter will be the desired process. 3) An AR process can be implemented using an IIR filter(with appropriate coefficients) by exciting the filter input with a white noise process. The output of the filter will be the desired process. The article you are referring to is incorrect in the sense that it totally ignores how the filter will be excited. Time series guys don't call $y[n] = a_1y[n-1]+...+a_py[n-p]$ an $AR(p)$ process(or model) as claimed by the article because the excitation noise of $\epsilon[n]$ is missing in its description.
