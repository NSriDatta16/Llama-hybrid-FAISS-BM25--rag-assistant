SQLite Alternatives for C++

I am developing a application that needs to store data with many writes and reads as requiring fast searching of data (the need for indexes of some sort), and also be able to serialize and save the data. Currently I am thinking about using SQLite, which gets the job done, but I am open for alternatives. The SQLite's syntax really doesn't fit elegantly in C++ code (for example I am forced to access the results by column index numbers instead of column names, etc).
