Can I use VBA function to return a (dynamic) list of acceptable values into Excel's data validation?

For a given cell, I select Data/Validation and set Allow to "List". I now wish to set Source like so: =rNames(REGS) but that does not work (name not found). So I go Insert/Name/Define and create "REGNAMES" by simply assigning the formula above (no cell range). I then return to the Data/Validation and when I set Source like so: =REGNAMES Now I get "Source currently evaluates to error". Unfortunately, this error does not go away even after I ignore it. I can create a range formula in the sheet like so: {=REGNAMES} and drag this to the right across a couple cells and the rNames function faithfully returns Option #1 | Options #2 | ... That is, the function returns a range as intended. I know that I can use macro code to manipulate the List setting for that cell out of VBA. I don't like these side-effects much. I would prefer a clean dependency tree built on functions. Any ideas how to get the Data/Validation to accept the array values returned from rNames? Thanks. PS: rNames returns the result range as a Variant, if that has any bearing.
