Since the the rows and columns are increasing monotonically, you can do a neat little search like this: Start at the bottom left. If the element you are looking for is greater than the element at that location, go right. If it is less go up. Repeat until you find the element or you hit an edge. Example (in hex to make formatting easier): 1 2 5 6 7 3 4 6 7 8 5 7 8 9 A 7 A C D E Let's search for 8. Start at position (0, 3): 7. 8 > 7 so we go right. We are now at (1, 3): A. 8 7 so we go right. (2, 2): 8 -> 8 == 8 so we are done. You'll notice, however, that this has only found one of the elements whose value is 8. Edit, in case it wasn't obvious this runs in O(n + m) average and worst case time.
