Do you need a good background in OOP before moving to frameworks?

Frameworks being all OOP, would it not be wise to go into frameworks without having a solid background in OOP? I can write basic classes but nothing too fancy or abstract. How much should I know of OOP before moving to frameworks? Right now I am PHP Object-Oriented Programming to learn OOP. EDIT: Once you start programming in OOP, is there a need to move back to procedural? Or is OOP the way to go because it's more organized and more reusable. (obviously if the site is very small, procedural would be fine)
