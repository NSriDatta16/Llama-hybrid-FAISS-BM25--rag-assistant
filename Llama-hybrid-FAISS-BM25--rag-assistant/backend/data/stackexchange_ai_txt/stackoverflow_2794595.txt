I think the "width" you're considering here isn't really what you want - the width depends on how you assign levels to each node where you have some choice. You noticed this when you were deciding whether to assign all sources to level 0 or all sinks to the max level. Instead, you just want to count the number of nodes and divide by the "critical path length", which is the longest path in the dag. This gives the average parallelism for the graph. It depends only on the graph itself, and it still gives you an indication of how wide the graph is. To compute the critical path length, just do what you're doing - the critical path length is the maximum level you end up assigning.
