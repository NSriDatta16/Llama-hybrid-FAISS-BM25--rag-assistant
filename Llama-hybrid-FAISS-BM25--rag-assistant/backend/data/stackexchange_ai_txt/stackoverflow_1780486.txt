Can a SQL Server Trigger send me an email?

I wish to send an email from a Trigger , on my SQL Server 2008 machine. The data of the email will be, basically, some of the Trigger information. Can someone provide some simple/sample code on how to do this, please? E.g. what's the system stored procedure called? Etc. I've not set up any SQL mail and stuff, so I'm guessing it's built in and I can leverage that. But just to be sure: do I need to install any extra software on the server?
