With regards to your #1, you can edit the project template items by using the instructions here or here . I've done this for VS 2K8 to make StyleCop and FxCop happy by default, but I haven't gotten around to doing it for 2010 as I find the procedure a bit tedious and there's always a likelihood that a VS service pack could overwrite them. For instance, I edited the program.cs in the ConsoleApplication template to look like this: // // Copyright (c) $year$ All Rights Reserved // // // // $time$ // namespace $safeprojectname$ { using System; using System.Collections.Generic; $if$ ($targetframeworkversion$ == 3.5)using System.Linq; $endif$using System.Text; /// /// Contains the program's entry point. /// internal static class Program { /// /// The program's entry point. /// /// The command-line arguments. private static void Main(string[] args) { } } } and the assemblyinfo.cs to look like this: // // Copyright (c) $year$ All Rights Reserved // // // // $time$ // using System; using System.Reflection; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; // General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following // set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information // associated with an assembly. [assembly: AssemblyTitle("$projectname$")] [assembly: AssemblyDescription("")] [assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")] [assembly: AssemblyCompany("$registeredorganization$")] [assembly: AssemblyProduct("$projectname$")] [assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â© $registeredorganization$ $year$")] [assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")] [assembly: AssemblyCulture("")] // Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible // to COM components. If you need to access a type in this assembly from // COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type. [assembly: ComVisible(false)] [assembly: CLSCompliant(true)] // The following GUID is for the ID of the typelib if this project is exposed to COM [assembly: Guid("$guid1$")] // Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values: // // Major Version // Minor Version // Build Number // Revision // // You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers // by using the '*' as shown below: // [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")] [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")] [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")] I've submitted an incident at Microsoft Connect to the effect that their tools' auto-generated code should satisfy StyleCop/FxCop and their coding guidelines documents.
