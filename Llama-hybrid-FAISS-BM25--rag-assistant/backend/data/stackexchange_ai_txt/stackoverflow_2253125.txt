There are some good examples in the Hibernate Reference material that show to use setFetchMode to fetch associations with an outer join. An example is: List books = sess.createCriteria(Book.class) .setFetchMode("chapters", FetchMode.EAGER) .setFetchMode("reviews", FetchMode.EAGER) .list(); There is also information there about different fetching stragies that may be of use to you.
