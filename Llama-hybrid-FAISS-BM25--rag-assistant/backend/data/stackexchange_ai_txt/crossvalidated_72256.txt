Which of these two ways is better to report comparison of paired data?

Suppose I am comparing the computational time of two algorithms A and B . They are solving randomized problem P . Let's say I solved the problem for seeds $ 1, 2, \dots, n $ with both A and B and got the times: $ a_1 , a_2, \dots , a_n $ for problem A and $ b_1 , b_2, \dots , b_n $ for problem B . I can use the Wilcoxon signed rank test to see which algorithm performed better. But suppose that I want to provide the reader with a sense of magnitude . That is I want to show just how much one is better than the other. For example: A is 12 times faster than B on the average. How should I compute this average ? Should I use: $$ avg = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{b_k}{a_k} $$ or: $$ avg = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k }{\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k } $$ ?
