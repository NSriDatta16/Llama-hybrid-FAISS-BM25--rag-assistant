MonoTorrent to distribute software

Just wondering of what people think of using MonoTorrent and the torrent protocol as the core part of an installer.... Essentially I am creating an installer which has the following requirements: Access through Firewalls/Proxies Runs over SSL Authenticated access to the installer/files Background download Handel bad connections (i.e. if a disconnect occurs, pickup downloads that were halfway through a file) Validate integrity of downloaded content Download Throttling So given all of this, I thought that embedding MonoTorrent in the installer package, running a private tracker and having the clients download (no seeding only leaching) from the server would be a good idea. This also has the side benefit of being able to bring extra servers online or offline depending on load. What do you guys think? Can I get this functionality from MonoTorrent and how hard is it to setup? Is there a better alternative that will meet these requirements?
