An additional technique I try to use is to partition your code into two parts. I've recently blogged about it here . The short description is to maintain your production code in two sets of libraries where one set (hopefully the larger set) has 100% line coverage (or better if you can measure it) and the other set (hopefully a tiny amount of code) has 0% coverage, yes zero percent coverage. Your designs should allow this partitioning. This should make it easy to see the code that is not covered. Over time you may have ideas about how to move code from the smaller set to the larger set.
