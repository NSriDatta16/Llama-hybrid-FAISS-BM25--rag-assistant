help on jquery sortable connected lists

Here is the exact copy of my code: jsFiddleCode As you can see I have a two sortable connected lists and when some item is dropped to them they execute functions subFunction and unsubFunction respectively. Now, I also have the code for doubleclicking one of the items so that then they are put in the opposite list (the function switchLists() takes care of that. Now, what I would like to accomplish here is the same behavior as when the items are dragged and dropped (the alert box appearing and saying exactly (for example): "Item 6 just subed". My lack of understanding is how can it be that I have the ui available when the function subFunction is called, and not when I call the switchLists . ( I did try to add ui to the call of switchLists like this: switchLists(e, ui){ //same code as before... //this code doesn't execute var itemText= ui.item.text(); alert(itemText + " just subed"); } But I get an error in FireBug in Firefox saying that the ui is undefined. You are free to edit the code on fiddle and post it here as a link. As a more general questions: how does jquery pass variables to other functions? I mean, the code: receive: subFunction is called without any arguments, so how does the subFunction get event and ui? If you have some good tutorial on all this, it's appreciated. Thank you for your help.
