Fitting data to a Markov Chain

I am looking for the reference/toolbox/note on how to fit a finite discrete-time Markov Chain to given time series. Ideally, there shall also be criteria of whether the fit is good, and whether additional levels of history-dependence are needed to be added. Of course, I can simply count how many times each state appeared, and how many times it led to a given successor state to estimated the transition probability matrix, however I believe that such naive method is not the best one.
