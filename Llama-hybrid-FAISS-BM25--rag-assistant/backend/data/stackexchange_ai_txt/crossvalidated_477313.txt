Why is it OK to model demographics as random effects in bayesian multilevel models?

In Bayesian multilevel models (with, say, people nested within congressional districts) I sometimes see individual level demographic variables like race modeled as random effects. So here’s a slightly simplifed example from this paper: $$ Pr(y_i=1)=\text{logit}^{-1}(\gamma_0 + \alpha^{race}_{r[i]} +\alpha^{gender}_{g[i]}+\alpha^{edu}_{e[i]}+\alpha^{district}_{d[i]}...)$$ $$\alpha^{race}_{r[i]} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{race}), for~r = 1,....4 $$ $$\alpha^{gender}_{g[i]} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{gender}) $$ $$\alpha^{edu}_{e[i]} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{edu}), for ~e=1,...,5 $$ As I understand it this model is treating all the individual level demographic variables as "random effects" just like district. So for race it is assuming that the 4 racial categories that exist in the data (black, white, hispanic, other) are actually just 4 random draws from a larger population of all possible races. To me this seems strange and wrong, since the racial categories we have in the data are meant to be exhaustive and there doesn’t seem to be any reason to think that racial differences will be normally distributed. So my question is: Is my interpretation of this model correct, and if so why is it justified? I know that someone actually asked this question before but the answer they were given was that it is probably NOT appropriate to treat race etc as random effects. But that's precisely what is done in many papers on Bayesian multilevel models.
