Changing LayoutParams programmatically has no effect in Android. Why?

I have a custom view, derived from Button , which I want to position at runtime, relative to another view. Because I don't know that other view's position yet when my view is being inflated (because layouting hasn't started), I leverage the onSizeChanged handler to set my view's position relative to the other view. In onSizeChanged : LayoutParams lp = new LayoutParams(this.getMeasuredWidth(), this.getMeasuredHeight()); lp.leftMargin = x; lp.topMargin = y; this.setLayoutParams(lp); forceLayout(); That, however, has no effect. How come?
