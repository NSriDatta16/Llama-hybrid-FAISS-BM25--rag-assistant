Calling a class which contains a constructor to setup click events etc?

I am trying to organize my JavaScript. What I would like to do is have a class for each PAGE rather then just entering JavaScript straight into a js - is this good practice? Let me explain: thinking along the lines of is it a good or bad idea on my variable naming. Remember that this a kind of class so I have to create the class but then I must call it (see below). I am using the prototype and constructor pattern. // THIS FILE WILL BE SAVED as RESERVATIONPAGE function ReservationPage(){ // Setup click events in this constructor $('submit-button').bind('click',this.submit_click); $('clear-button').bind('click',this.clear_click); // setup other variables } ReservationPage.prototype = { constructor: ReservationPage, submit_click : function () { alert(' you just clicked the submit button'); }, clear_click : function () { alert('button for clearning the form fields!!'); } }; Then each page will need a standard js file i.e. not a class / object to instantiate their Page js like above, so a kind of entry point - so hence: // THIS FILE WILL BE SAVED as ReservationLoad - notice the word Load :-) -- don't know if this is good naning convetion, anybody suggest anything different?? var reservationPage = new ReservationPage(); // CREATES NEW INSTANCE OF THE CLASS/OBJECT .. I don't any other way of doing it; I would really appreciate any input. I will be using jQuery extensively but this shouldn't matter. I need a standard JS file - no objects to instantiate my objects hence I called in load. This in turn instantiates the object and calls the constructor. The constructor sets up the click events and then calls the methods. Is this good? Any idea where I am going wrong? I really appreciate some input as I am little lost and want to do it right. I am coming from a C# .NET background, and I know js isn't a proper OOP language but I am trying to treat it like this for better structuring. This way, all my js files are separate from my HTML and my CSS; there are no events entered into the html, they are all entered via code Look forward to any info
