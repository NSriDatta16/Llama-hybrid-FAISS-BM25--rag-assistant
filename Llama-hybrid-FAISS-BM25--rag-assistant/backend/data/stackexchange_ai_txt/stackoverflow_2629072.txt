m.clear() releases memory back to the heap, but it's common for heap implementations to not release that back to the OS (even when they can, issues such as fragmentation make it hard). This is how the default allocator works, if you've specified your own allocator for the map, it might have its own cache. However, even in that case, it should be cached in order to be reused immediately anyway. Maps don't have a concept of capacity vs size the way vectors do.
