I'm working on a very similar process at the present (a web domain crawlling database) with the same significant transaction rates. At these ingest rates, it is critical to get the storage layer right first. You're going to be looking at several machines connecting to the storage in a SAN cluster. A singe database server can support millions of writes a day, it's the amount of CPU used per "write" and the speed that the writes can be commited. (Network performance also often is an early bottleneck) With clever partitioning, you can reduce the effort required to summarise the data. You don't say how up-to-date the summaries need to be, and this is critical. I would try to push back from "realtime" and suggest overnight (or if you can get away with it monthly) summary calculations. Finally, we're using a 2 CPU 4GB RAM Windows 2003 virtual SQL Server 2005 and a single CPU 1GB RAM IIS Webserver as our test system and we can ingest 20 million records in a 10 hour period (and the storage is RAID 5 on a shared SAN). We get ingest rates upto 160 records per second batched in blocks of 40 records per network round trip.
