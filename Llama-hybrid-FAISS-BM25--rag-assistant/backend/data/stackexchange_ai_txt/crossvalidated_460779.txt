Estimating residuals within cross-validation

I want to estimated residuals (actual - predicted) within a k-fold cross-validation scheme (i.e. predicted residuals ) in a regression problem. The aim is to get a reasonable estimate as the data is high dimensional with p (~ 1000) >> n ( What should I use as the value of k? Leave-one-out is over optimistic and thus the residuals will be closer to 0. Should I use the standard 10-fold, how about 5-fold? Fewer folds (e.g. 2) will create bad models due to small training samples and inflate the residuals. Hard to determine a sensible choice of k. Should I repeat the CV procedure and if yes then how to combine the residuals from the repeats? If I just average across repeats then again the residuals will be closer to 0 as it will be something like a bagging and approach LOO in limit . Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!
