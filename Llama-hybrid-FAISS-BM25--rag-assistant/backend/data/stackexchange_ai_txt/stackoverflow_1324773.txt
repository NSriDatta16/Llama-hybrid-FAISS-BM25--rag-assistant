I don't have any code for this, but I have seen where the shape was tesselated (in this case using polygon triangulation ) so you would have a nice set of triangles. Then compute the combined centroid based on the weighted average of the triangles' centroid. EDIT: There is a blog by the guys working on a product called Insight3D by AGI. In this entry , they talk about triangulation. It might help you do it since they do give some more pointers on algorithms. Depending on your use, you might be able to reuse one of their implementations . It is free for development and non-commercial use.
