Use jQuery to change a class dependent on scroll position

I have a single page website which has a fixed floating nav. I want to be able to highlight which section the user is on by adding a class of say "on" to the relevant navigation a tag. This class will need to be removed when the user is no longer on that section and the new current section then needs to be reflected in the nav. This can't be done via a click function, as the user could still just scroll up and down the page. I have know idea if this can even be done or where to start as my jQuery is VERY limited. Any help would be really appreciated. Here is my current webpage, which doesn't have any active nav highlighting: http://ec2.dragonstaff.com/www.creativegems.co.uk/
