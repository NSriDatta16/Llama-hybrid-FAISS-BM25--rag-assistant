When you write a django application (or any wsgi application, for that matter), you don't know beforehand if your application will end up running standalone on a single server, or multithreaded, or multiprocessed, or even in multiple separate machines as part of a load balancing strategy. If you're going to make the constraint " my application only works on single-process servers " then you can use something like this: from django import settings settings.counter += 1 However that constraint is often not feasible. So you must use external storage to your counter. If you want to keep it on memory, maybe a memcached Maybe you just log the requests to this view. So when you want the counter just count the number of entries in the log. The log could be file-based, or it could be a table in the database, just define a new model on your models.py .
