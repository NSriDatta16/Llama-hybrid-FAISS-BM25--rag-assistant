I think Stanford provides the best resources when it comes to flexibility. They even have a machine learning course online that would provide you with a respectable base of knowledge when it comes to designing algorithms in R. Search it up on Google and it will redirect you to their Lagunita page where they have some interesting courses, most of them being free. I have Tibshirani's books, Introduction to Statistical Learning' and 'Elements of Statistical Learning' in PDF formats and both are extremely good resources. Since you're a mathematician, I would still advise you to not fast track as that wouldn't provide you with a solid base that you might find very helpful in the future if at all you start doing some serious machine learning. Treat statistics as a branch of mathematics for getting insights from data, and that requires some work. Other than that, there are tons of online resources, Johns Hopkins provides similar stuff as Stanford. Although experience always pays, a respectable credential will always reinforce that base. You can also think of the specific fields that you would like to enter; by that I mean whether you want to go into text analytics or applying your math and stats skills in finance. I come in the latter category so I have a degree in econometrics where we studied finance + statistics. A combination can always be very good.
