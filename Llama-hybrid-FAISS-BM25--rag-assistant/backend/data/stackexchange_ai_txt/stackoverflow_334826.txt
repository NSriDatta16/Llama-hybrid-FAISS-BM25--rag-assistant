They shouldn't be unit tested at all! The whole point of those methods is to integrate with the outside world (i.e. the database). So, make sure your integration tests beat the you-know-what out of those methods and just forget about the unit tests. They should be so simple that they are "obviously bug-free", anyway â€“ and if they aren't, you should break them up in one part which has the logic and a dumb part which just takes a value and sticks it in the database. Remember: the goal is 100% test coverage, not 100% unit test coverage; that includes all of your tests: unit, integration, functional, system, acceptance and manual.
