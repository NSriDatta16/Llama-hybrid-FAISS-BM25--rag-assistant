Git is arranged with version trees as first-order objects in principle. That is, you deal with a graph of commit objects, each of which has a one-to-one relationship with a tree that is the state at that revision. Note that how these are actually stored can be very different. Git started out simply compressing each file and tree/commit object individually. As I understand it, packing objects into a single file and storing just deltas for some objects was added much later. So in fact, although patches seem to be ubiquitous in git user interfaces, they are in fact no relation to how the data is stored- the deltas that are stored in the pack files are binary-level deltas, not text-style diffs at all. Git will apply deltas to get objects and then diff them again to produce the patch on demand. This is in contrast to, for instance, CVS which inherited a latest-version-plus-reverse-deltas storage system from RCS. Based on what you quoted, it appears that Git and SVN are actually more similar than either is to CVS, for example.
