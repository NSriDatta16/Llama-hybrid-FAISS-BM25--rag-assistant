What is the preferred syntax for initializing a dict: curly brace literals {} or the dict() function?

I'm putting in some effort to learn Python, and I am paying close attention to common coding standards. This may seem like a pointlessly nit-picky question, but I am trying to focus on best-practices as I learn, so I don't have to unlearn any 'bad' habits later. I see two common methods for initializing a dict: a = { 'a': 'value', 'another': 'value', } b = dict( a='value', another='value', ) Which is considered to be "more pythonic"? Which do you use? Why?
