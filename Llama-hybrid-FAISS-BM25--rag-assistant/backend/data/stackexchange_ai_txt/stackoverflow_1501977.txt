$myStrings = array(); $myStrings[] = 'string1'; $myStrings[] = 'string2'; ... foreach ($myStrings as $string) { // do stuff with your string here... } If you wanted to ensure uniqueness of strings in the array you could do a couple of things... first would be to simply use array_unique(). That, or you could create an associative array with the strings as keys as well as the values: $myStrings = array(); $myStrings['string1'] = 'string1'; ... If you wanted to be object-oriented about this, you could do something like: class StringStore { public static $strings = array(); // helper functions, etc. You could also make the above protected static and write public functions that add things to the array or whatever } Then, in your code you can do stuff like: StringStore::$strings[] = 'string1'; ... And iterate the same way: foreach (StringStore::$strings as $string) { // whatever } SplObjectStorage is for tracking unique instances of Objects, and outside of not working with strings, it's a bit overkill for what you're trying to accomplish (in my opinion). Hope that helps!
