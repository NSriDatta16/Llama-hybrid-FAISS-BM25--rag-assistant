If you need another signature than void func(..) without out parameters, what would be wrong with MyDebugObject Foo(out int justForGrins) { justForGrins = ; MyDebugObject result = ; #if DEBUG .. run code you need for your debugging... #endif return result; } It is more verbose and less elegant than the ConditionalAttribute, but it would allow you a more flexible signature.
