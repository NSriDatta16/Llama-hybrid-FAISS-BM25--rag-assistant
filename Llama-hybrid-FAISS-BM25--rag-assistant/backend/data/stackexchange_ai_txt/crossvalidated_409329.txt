A few things: 1) If you have a regression of the form $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x^2_{1}$ , then taking a derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$ will return $dy/dx_{1} = \beta_{1} + 2\times\beta_{2}x_{1}$ . So $\beta_{1}$ should be interpreted as the expected change in $y$ from a one-unit change in $x_{1}$ when $x_{1} = 0$ . Even though you standardized your $x_{1}$ , the $0$ part does not change, so you should interpret the coefficient on the linear part of $x_{1}$ as the effect of the variable when it is at $0$ . 2) If you look again at the derivative formula above ( $dy/dx$ ), you'll see that each additional one-unit increase in $x_{1}$ is associated not with a $\beta_{2}$ change in $y$ , but with a $\beta_{1} + 2\times\beta_{2}x_{1}$ change in $y$ . In other words, the change in $y$ is not constant, but varies depending on what the value of $x_{1}$ is. So you should not interpret the two coefficients separately, but simply say what each additional one-unit increase in $x_{1}$ does using values of both $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ . 3) You might as well calculate and report the values of odds by exponentiating the coefficients. If you do that with $0.285$ , you will get $1.330$ , and you can then say that a one-unit change in $x_{1}$ is associated with a $33\%$ increase in odds of having the disease (when $x_{1}$ is at $0$ ). Exponentiating $-0.084$ will give you a number smaller than $1$ and you can use it together with the $33\%$ value to say what an additional one-unit change in $x_{1}$ is associated with. 4) You should use "on average" and "holding other independent variables constant" when discussing the effect of an explanatory variable on the dependent variable.
