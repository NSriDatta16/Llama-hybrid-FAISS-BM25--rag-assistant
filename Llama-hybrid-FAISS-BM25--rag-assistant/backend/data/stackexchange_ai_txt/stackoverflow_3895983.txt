function Rand7 put 200 into x repeat while x > 118 put ((random(5)-1) * 25) + ((random(5)-1) * 5) + (random(5)-1) into x end repeat return (x mod 7) + 1 end Rand7 Three calls to Rand5, which only repeats 6 times out of 125, on average. Think of it as a 3D array, 5x5x5, filled with 1 to 7 over and over, and 6 blanks. Re-roll on the blanks. The rand5 calls create a three digit base-5 index into that array. There would be fewer repeats with a 4D, or higher N-dimensional arrays, but this means more calls to the rand5 function become standard. You'll start to get diminishing efficiency returns at higher dimensions. Three seems to me to be a good compromise, but I haven't tested them against each other to be sure. And it would be rand5-implementation specific.
