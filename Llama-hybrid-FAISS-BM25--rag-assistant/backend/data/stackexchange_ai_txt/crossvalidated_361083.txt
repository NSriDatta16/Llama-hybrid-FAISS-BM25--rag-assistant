Reading the summary model from a glm logistic regression in R

I'm learning how to do logistic regression and I have some questions about verifying the model based on output in R. First below you can see the results from AIC analysis that chose the model with just Storage as the predictor to be the most appropriate. Next We have the model summary of this candidate model. So my question here is, I'm looking at the p-value for the intercept and it looks like it is not significant. Is it important for the intercept to be significant given that often it has no meaning in the context of the problem? I.e. is this model invalidated by the insignificant y-intercept? Also, because it is logistic regression I think I have vaguely read that these p-values are not really used in logistic regression. So how about the scenario in which a simple linear regression has an insignificant y-intercept? Is that important? Also look at the Residual Deviance. It is over dispersive I believe, at 5.173> 4 df. Now what should I do? Disregard the model, even though AIC said this is the best one? Next is anova Is there anything i should take away from this read out? Thanks.
