Independent on whether you are a Baysian or a Frequentist - you first have to build a model of what you are investigating. The usual approach to the question of probabilities of heads and tails of a coin would be a binomial test under the assumption of i.i.d. observations. Now in your case, the observations are clearly not independend but dependend on the toss before the next one. Model violations are model violations, independent on Bayesianism or Frequentism. Sometimes, however, Bayesian approaches make it more easy to formulate individual models. Autocorrelation is a term known to Frequentists.
