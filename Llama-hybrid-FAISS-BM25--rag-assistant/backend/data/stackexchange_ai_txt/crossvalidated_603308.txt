Break down the arithmetic. $$ 1(1/3) +2(2/3) = (1+4)/3=(1+2+2)/3 $$ $(1+2+2)/3$ is exactly the usual mean. There are two ways to look at the calculation. Add up the values, and then divide by however many values you added up (the usual way of thinking about the mean). Weight the unique values according to how often they occur, and then add up those products of values and weights (a weighted average of the unique values). You see an example where those coincide, and that applies in general.
