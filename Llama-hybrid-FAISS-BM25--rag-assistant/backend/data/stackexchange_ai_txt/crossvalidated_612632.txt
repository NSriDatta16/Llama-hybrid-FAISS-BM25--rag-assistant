Let's go through each of the specifications that you've suggested one by one. The simplest model you suggest is: bf(mean_answer ~ 1 + Group * Time + (1|ID)) This corresponds to the 'random intercept' model. This will allow you to estimate the mean of mean_answer at baseline and follow-up in each group. The Group:Time interaction will indicate whether the treated group changed relatively more than the untreated group between baseline and follow-up. But it would be nice to use the item-level information, as you suggest. Keeping things on their natural scale (7-point Likert) rather than a relatively artificial average might help for interpretation/presentation. You suggest the following model: bf(answer ~ 1 + Group * Time + (1 | Item|Time|ID)) I don't know what's going on here so I'm going to skip it. The next one is: bf(answer ~ 1 + Group * Time + (1+ ID) + (1|Time) + (1|Item)) There is a mistake in this specification (at least, I think so). We usually don't want to include time (a 2-level variable) as a random intercept. It's already included as a fixed effect so it's redundant anyway. Rather, we want to allow the effect of time, that is, the trajectory from baseline to follow-up, to be different for each participant. In other words, we want a random slope of time. That would look like this: bf(answer ~ 1 + Group * Time + (1+time|ID) + (1|Item)) Here Item and ID are crossed random effects as each participant completes each item. A few issues. Firstly, it is usually suggested that you need about 5-6+ levels of the random effect to reliably estimate the variance and Item only has 3. Likely this will be fine with a little regularisation from the prior, though you might try just including Item as a fixed effect. Secondly, for a pre-post study, you might struggle to estimate a random intercept for ID and a random slope for Time. The reason being that allowing each participant to have their own starting point and their own trajectory can result in a model with about as many parameters as there are data points. Again, the prior might help with this, I'm not sure. Here is one last formulation to consider: bf(answer ~ 1 + Group * Time + Item + (1|ID)) This model differs from the one above in that Item is included as a fixed effect and the random slope for Time is dropped (i.e., participants within groups are assumed to have a constant trajectory). It would be interesting to contrast this model with one that includes a random slope for time and see how they compare. Also, keep in mind, for Likert data, you are better off with an ordinal regression model rather than a metric (Gaussian likelihood) model.
