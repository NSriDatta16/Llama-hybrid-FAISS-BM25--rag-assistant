Mainframe Cobol uses embedded SQL (kinda like SQLj), e.g.: Procedure Division. Exec SQL Select col1, col2 from myTable into :ws-col1, :ws-col2 where col0 = :col0 End-Exec In this case, the host variables ws-col0, ws-col1 and ws-col2 are defined in the working-storage section. The database interface manages getting that data in the right place. Very easy compared to the distributed stuff actually.
