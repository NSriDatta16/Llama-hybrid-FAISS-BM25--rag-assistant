If you want to break out, when your file does not exist any more, just do it: test -f file || break Placing this in your loop, should break out. The remaining problem is, how to break the read line, as this is blocking. This could you do by applying a timeout, like read -t 5 line. Then every 5 second the read returns, and in case the file does not longer exist, the loop will break. Attention: Create your loop that it can handle the case, that the read times out, but the file is still present. EDIT: Seems that with timeout read returns false, so you could combine the test with the timeout, the result would be: tail -f test.file | while read -t 3 line || test -f test.file; do some stuff with $line done
