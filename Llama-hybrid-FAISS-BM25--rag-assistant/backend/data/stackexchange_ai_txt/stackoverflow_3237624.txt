How to use NLP to separate a unstructured text content into distinct paragraphs?

The following unstructured text has three distinct themes -- Stallone, Philadelphia and the American Revolution. But which algorithm or technique would you use to separate this content into distinct paragraphs? Classifiers won't work in this situation. I also tried to use Jaccard Similarity analyzer to find distance between successive sentences and tried to group successive sentences into one paragraph if the distance between them was less than a given value. Is there a better method? This is my text sample: Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone , nicknamed Sly Stallone, is an American actor, filmmaker and screenwriter. Stallone is known for his machismo and Hollywood action roles. Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry as well as having its film props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps.A commercial, educational, and cultural center, Philadelphia was once the second-largest city in the British Empire (after London), and the social and geographical center of the original 13 American colonies. It was a centerpiece of early American history, host to many of the ideas and actions that gave birth to the American Revolution and independence.The American Revolution was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break free from the British Empire, combining to become the United States of America. They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress, or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing states.
