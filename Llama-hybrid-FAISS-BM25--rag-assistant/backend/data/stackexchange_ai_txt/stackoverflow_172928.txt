Best 2D animation library/tech for "iPhone" style animation on WIN32?

All, I have built a nifty demo application that displays data about our internal systems as a full-screen "billboard" style display. You could think of this as something like an application displaying the national deficit - rapidly increasing numbers, animating very quickly, all day. The problem is that the demo works really well and the client would like me to build an industrial strength version! I'd like to do this in C++ but it could be Java or maybe C# (though I'd prefer not to use C#, as I'm not so strong in that env). I'm toying with SDL or Allegro, but I have no experience in either, so I'm open to the best (and ideally easiest) toolkit out there. When I say "iPhone"-style, I mean simple but elegant transitions between panels. The iPhone makes exellent use of slides, fades and blends. My app doesn't need to do any 3D style animations. In terms of graphics, I really only need simple things: 90% text, some images, and simple primitives like lines, rectangles and gradient fills. Of course, I could implement this in "plain old" DirectDraw or OpenGL, but I really don't want to think about writing timer classes and choosing timing methods for animation - some toolkit out there should be just right for this. Thanks for any help! RF
