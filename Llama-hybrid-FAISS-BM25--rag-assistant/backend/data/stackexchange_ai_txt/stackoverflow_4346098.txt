Try this. Set suspend=y , just to make sure you got the JVM line right. This should stop the VM on startup until you connect. If you're on Unix, bring up the terminal and try telnet [host] [port] - this will quickly let you know if there's anything listening to that port on that host. Make sure the connection properties in Eclipse are set correctly. Note that the port defaults to 8000. Use the IP address instead of the host name, to rule out DNS/hostfile problems. Another way of starting the JVM that I use successfully is: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y
