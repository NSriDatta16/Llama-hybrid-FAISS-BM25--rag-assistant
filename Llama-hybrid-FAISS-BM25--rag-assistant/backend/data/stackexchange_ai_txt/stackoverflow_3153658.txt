IMHO, using Evernote to store this information is great. 1) you can go back and search through it easily 2) organize by tags and "notebooks collections" 3) available on multiple platforms (even mobile) 4) available as browser plugins (for direct archiving in-browser) The only drawback is it's copy-paste functionality is a little lacking (it sometimes doesn't import/display the CSS styles correctly). Otherwise, it's a great alternative to store web "bookmarks" (and also archive the content at the same time).
