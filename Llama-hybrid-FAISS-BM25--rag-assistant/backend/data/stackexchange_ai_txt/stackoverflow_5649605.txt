OK you have time series data collected every 5 seconds. That leads to about 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 / 5 = 518400 observations. Why not bin the time series data together, i.e. use a higher aggregation than 5 seconds? I assume you do not actually need 5 second precision on your x axis, or you'd be talking about hundreds of thousands of pixels wide charts. What is your actual question?
