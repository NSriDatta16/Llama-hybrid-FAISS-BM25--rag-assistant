Extra Characters in Trace Function @#$%#$@%

Can someone please tell me where these extra characters are coming from? This is the output: "MECHEL OAO ADS" 21.19 21.70 21.88 "+0.84%" 4736975 1 "MECHEL OAO ADS" 21.19 21.70 21.88 "+0.84%" 4736975 1 "MECHEL OAO ADS" 21.19 21.70 21.88 "+0.84%" 4736975 1 Notice the space and then the 1? Those should not be there... Here's the script, should just plug and play... var quoteTimer:Timer = new Timer(1000); quoteTimer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, getQuote); quoteTimer.start(); var url:String = "http://www.hupcapstudios.com/projects/getDow.php"; var stockInfo:String = "s=MTL&f=nol1hp2v"; function getQuote(e:Event):void { var variables:URLVariables = new URLVariables(); variables.info = stockInfo; var urlRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url); var stockLoader:URLLoader = new URLLoader(); urlRequest.method = URLRequestMethod.POST; urlRequest.data = variables; stockLoader.load(urlRequest); stockLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, addStock); } function addStock(e:Event):void { var stockArray:Array = e.target.data.split(","); var assocArray:Array = new Array("Stock: " , "Open: ", "Current: ", "High :", "Percent Change: ", "Volume: "); for(var i:int=0;i and the php... When I just run the php (or throw the url in the browser with the post"info" concatenated I don't get that extra space and 1 at the end... ***************** THE SOLUTION ***************** I was getting a "\n" in there, not sure why the 1 was being appended, but here is the code I'm using to make this all usable data (I'm seeking out more than one stock at a time otherwise eliminating the last bit space would have been no problem); this is the URL to get the traced results of e.target.data: http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=MSFT+GE+ ^N225+F+ET&f=noghl1p2vs "Microsoft Corpora",N/A,N/A,N/A,26.71,"0.00%",0,"MSFT" "GEN ELECTRIC CO",N/A,N/A,N/A,16.79,"0.00%",0,"GE" "NIKKEI 225",10276.4,10216.14,10290.31,10257.56,"+0.18%",0,"^N225" "FORD MOTOR CO",N/A,N/A,N/A,7.66,"0.00%",0,"F" "ET",N/A,N/A,N/A,0.00,"N/A",N/A,"ET" 1 In order to make that usable I had to break it down into an array with a couple of loops... the new addStock() function (with the results sent to a movie clips containing text fields for the data)... function addStock(e:Event):void { var array:Array = e.target.data.split("\n"); // splits the string into arrays delimited by the "\n" array.pop(); // eliminates the last array entry which is just white space var goodArray:Array = new Array(); // the array I will store the correctly formatted values for(var i:int=0;i
