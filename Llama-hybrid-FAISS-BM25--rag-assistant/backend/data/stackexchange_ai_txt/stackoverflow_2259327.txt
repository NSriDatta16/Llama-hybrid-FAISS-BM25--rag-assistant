are you running the statements back to back or on the next postback? You are just loading an expired cookie because you didn't remove a cookie, you just added an expired cookie, no? Enter what seems like a catch 22 but is actually a code smell.... To delete a cookie on the browser you have to send an expired cookie . But if you are using a cookie as a data object in your code on the same cycle you then have to manage the cookie collection. Either dedicate one postback to just deleting the cookie or use a clr object to keep track of your cart while in the codebehind. e.g. load the cookie into an object on page_load and set the cookie from the object before you exit but do not reference the Cookies collection. p.s. While I haven't wrasseled with cookies for a while, if you want to REPLACE a cookie, try Cookies.Remove() and add the new one, it should replace the old one on the browser while keeping a single valid cookie in the collection for you. But I still don't recommend using the cookie collection as data storage in your code behind classes...
