As far as I can tell, the unicode version isn't stored. The character lookup is implemented by storing the character info in an embedded resource called "charinfo.nlp" in mscorlib.dll, and this is used as a lookup table internally. There is a "version" property on the header to this lookup table data, but it is "0" in the binary data (offset 0x20), so I'm not sure what that's a version of, or if it's just not implemented.
