Metafor package in R: meta regression and scatter plot

I am doing a meta-regression with metafor package in R. The mixed-effect model for proportion is used to assess the linearity between study performed year and medication prevalence. Here below is my script in R: model_A And results I got from R are: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 32; tau^2 estimator: ML) tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 1.6349 tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 1.2786 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 99.40% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 168.00 Tests for Residual Heterogeneity: Wld(df = 30) = 2221.4535, p-val Followed by this model, I would also like to perform a scatterplot in R. So my script is: wi The plot I got is: Apparently, it doesn't seem right!. So my questions are: Did I use the right model with rma.glmm ? How could I weight individual study ( cex=wi ?)? How to calculate standard error for individual study? How could I fit a right estimated line in scatterplot? Many thanks. Updates: Followed by Wolfgang's suggestions, I managed to rescale the bubble and get predicted line fitted (the model remains the same): Obviously, the line wasn't straight! Should I change model into polynomial regression? Or is that normal with this graph? I tried polynomial model like: model1 The error came with "Error in print(model1) : error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'print': Error: object 'model1' not found" And I tried another model: model2: model2 I got exactly the same result as original model, which has only the year as covariate fitted. I am not sure where the problem is.... Many thanks! Min
