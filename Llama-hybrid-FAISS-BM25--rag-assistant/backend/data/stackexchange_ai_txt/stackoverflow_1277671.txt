I highly recommend looking into mindmapping - here's a good book: Mapping Inner Space: Learning and Teaching Visual Mapping and open source mindmapping tool: FeeMind but don't get stuck in wrestling with any software - you can use crayons. mindmapping is sort of a WBS (work breakdown structure) and sort of free formed organized thinking. When breaking a BIG application (project) to smaller pieces you often find that you have repeated functionality down different branches, very defined and very undefined areas and external interactions to make the system work...graphically representing this with some pics also helps
