Since you're vague on the database, here is some good literature: MySQL Look around section 7, this goes in to hierarchy and recursive functions http://www.artfulsoftware.com/mysqlbook/sampler/mysqled1ch20.html MSSQL Good article on the same thing (you're going to find functions the common place, though MSSQL can use WITH). http://www.sqlservercurry.com/2009/06/simple-family-tree-query-using.html PostgreSQL Same type of article. All these have the same premise, working your way up a database tree from child to parent. http://www.paragoncorporation.com/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=24
