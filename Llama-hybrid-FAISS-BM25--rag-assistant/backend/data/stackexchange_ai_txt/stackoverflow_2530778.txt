How to choose programmatically the column to be queried by Linq using PropertyInfo?

I would like to control how Linq queries my database programmatically. For instance, I'd like to query the column X , column Y , or column Z , depending on some conditions. First of all, I've created an array of all the properties inside my class called myPropertyInfo . Type MyType = (typeOf(MyClass)); PropertyInfo[] myPropertyInfo = myType.GetProperties( BindingFlags.Public|BindingFlags.Instance); The myPropertyInfo array allows me to access each property details (Name, propertyType, etc) through the index [i] . Now, how can I use the above information to control how Linq queries my DB? Here's a sample of a query I'd like to exploit. var myVar = from tp in db.MyClass select tp.{expression}; Expression using myPropertyInfo[i] to choose which property (column) to query. I'm not sure if that's the way of doing it, but if there's another way to do so, I'll be glad to learn. EDIT : I believe the right expression the one used by @Gabe. In fact, I'd like to make queries on the fly. Here's the reason: I've (i) a table Organizations (Ministries, Embassies, International Organizations, such as UN, UNPD, UNICEF, World Bank, etc, and services depending on them). I've (ii) an other table Hierarchy which represents the way those organizations are linked, starting by which category each one belongs to (Government, Foreign Missions, private sector, NGO, etc.) Each column representing a level in the hierarchy, some rows will be longer while other will be shorter. Many rows' columns will share the same value (for instance 2 ministries belonging to the government, will have "Government" as value for the column 'Level 1'). That's why, for each row (organization), I need to go level by level (i.e. column by column).
