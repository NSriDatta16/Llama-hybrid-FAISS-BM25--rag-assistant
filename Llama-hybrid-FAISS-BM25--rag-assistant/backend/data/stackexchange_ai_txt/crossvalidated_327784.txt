Convergence of a sequence in finite number of steps

Here is the setup of my problem. It is a sequential problem and there are two possible actions A and B. Now, when either action $A$ or $B$ is taken at the $j$th time point, we observe some outcome say $X_j$. We want to compare the two averages in batches $k = 1,2,\dots, M$ with each batch having $d_k$ time points. We also decide that out of a total $d_k$ points in the $k$th batch, action A will be taken $m_kd_k$ where $0 \beta_k - (1)$$ where $I_j(.)$ is the indicator function and $\beta_k \beta_k \right)$$ I want to show that $m_k \rightarrow 0$ almost surely in a finite number of batches. We also know that event (1) is highly likely to occur, i.e. $p_k\rightarrow 0$ as $k\rightarrow \infty$. Then, intuitively it makes sense that with proper choices of $\beta_k$'s, $m_k$ should become very small quickly (because of the exponential decay assumed), I just don't know how to mathematically prove it. Any help would be much appreciated!
