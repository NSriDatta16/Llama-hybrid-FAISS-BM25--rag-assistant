BlockingQueue - blocked drainTo() methods

BlockingQueue has the method called drainTo() but it is not blocked. I need a queue that I want to block but also able to retrieve queued objects in a single method. Object first = blockingQueue.take(); if ( blockingQueue.size() > 0 ) blockingQueue.drainTo( list ); I guess the above code will work but I'm looking for an elegant solution.
