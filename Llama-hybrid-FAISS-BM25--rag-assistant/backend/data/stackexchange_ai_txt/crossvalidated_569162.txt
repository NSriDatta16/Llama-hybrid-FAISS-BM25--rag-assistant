Finding average error

Consider the following data: 20 +- 2, 25+-1, 30+- 3, 40+-1 If I have to find the average error, I can follow two methods: (2 + 1 + 3 + 1)/4 = 1.75 Sqrt (4 + 1+ 9 + 1 )= 3.9 Since, (20 + 25 + 30 + 40) = 115/4 So the final answer is: 115/4 +- 1.75 OR 115/4 +- 3.9. Which method is correct? Any views, please?
