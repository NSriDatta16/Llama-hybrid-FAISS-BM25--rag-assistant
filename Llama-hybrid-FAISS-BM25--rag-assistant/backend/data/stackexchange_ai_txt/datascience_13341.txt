How exactly does a validation data-set work work in machine learning?

With typical machine learning you would usually use a training data-set to create a model of some kind, and a testing data-set to then test the newly created model. For something like linear regression after the model is created with the training data you now have an equation that you would use to predict the outcome of the set of features in the testing data. You would then take the prediction that the model returned and compare that to the actual data in the testing set. How would a validation set be used here? With nearest neighbor you would use the training data to create an n-dimensional space that has all the features of the training set. You would then use this space to classify the features in the testing data. Again you would compare these predictions to the actual value of the data. How would a validation set help here as well?
