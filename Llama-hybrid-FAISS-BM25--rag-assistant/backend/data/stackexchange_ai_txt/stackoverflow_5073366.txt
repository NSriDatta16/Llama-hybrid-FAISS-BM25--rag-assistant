Yes. 6.5.2.1 paragraph 1 (C99 standard) describes the arguments to the [] operator: One of the expressions shall have type "pointer to object type ", the other expression shall have integer type, and the result has type " type ". 6.5.2.1 paragraph 2 (emphasis added): A postÔ¨Åx expression followed by an expression in square brackets [] is a subscripted designation of an element of an array object. The definition of the subscript operator [] is that E1[E2] is identical to (*((E1)+(E2))) . Because of the conversion rules that apply to the binary + operator, if E1 is an array object (equivalently, a pointer to the initial element of an array object) and E2 is an integer, E1[E2] designates the E2 -th element of E1 (counting from zero). It says nothing requiring the order of the arguments to [] to be sane.
