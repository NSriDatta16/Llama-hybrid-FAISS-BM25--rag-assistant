Simple way to delete a matrix column in Mathematica

I am trying to delete both a matrix in mathematica. An inelegant way of doing it is as I do below, i.e specifying it in a new matrix as S = Table[ Ss[[If[i where the goal is to eliminate row and column t. Indeed delete a line is easy Delete[Ss,t]. For the column column I suppose I could do Transpose[Delete[Transpose[Ss,t]]] My primary concern is to do it in a way that executes the fastest way possible. More generally, is there a Mathematica operator that makes it as easy to slice and dice matrix columns as it is to do for rows without resorting to transpose?
