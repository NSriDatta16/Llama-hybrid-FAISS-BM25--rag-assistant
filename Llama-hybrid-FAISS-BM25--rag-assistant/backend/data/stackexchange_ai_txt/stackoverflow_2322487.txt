What's the proper way of adding anchor links inside a php array?

I changed the single quotes to doubles quotes after I faced th following problem: $lang = array( 'let's do something...' ); Now I have this problem: $lang = array( "tagline_h2" => "A paragraph... this is a link " ); What should I do?
