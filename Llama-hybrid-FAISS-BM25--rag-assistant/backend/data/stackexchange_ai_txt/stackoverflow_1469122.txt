When you use Get-ChildItem with *.jpg you are only going to get files - well unless you have a dir named {something}.jpg. BTW I would use -filter and stay away from the -include parameter. Thar be dragons - see the docs on that parameter. This should do the trick for you: Get-ChildItem 'C:\Users\Mike' *.jpg -r | Foreach {$_.Directory} | Remove-Item -Recurse -Verbose -WhatIf If typing shorten that using aliases to: gci 'C:\Users\Mike' *.jpg -r | %{$_.Directory} | ri -r -v -wh When you are satisfied with the results, remove the -WhatIf to have it really remove the dirs.
