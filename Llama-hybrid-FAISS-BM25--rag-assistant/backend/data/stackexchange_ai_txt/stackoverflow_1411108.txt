Magento & vertnav extension

I'm working on a magento project (v1.3.2.3) and i've installed the vertnav extension. Contents vertnav.xml: This should show the vertnav on every page (correct me if im wrong) Something weird is happening when changing error reporting from "E_ALL | E_STRICT" to "E_ALL | ~E_STRICT" in index.php When set to E_ALL | E_STRICT the vertnav is NOT showed in the left bar. When set to E_ALL | ~E_STRICT vertnav becomes visible. I think this is really weird behaviour, hoping someone knows more about it. Other blocks behave like normal. Another issue we run into, and proberly related to this. We get a strict warning (only variables can be passed by reference; something like that) when accessing the admin directory (only on the live server), this is why we're considering to set error_reporting to ~E_STRICT . Offcourse our goal is to leave error_reporting set to E_ALL | E_STRICT but vertnav should be visible and admin accessible. Going crazy :-) // Roland
