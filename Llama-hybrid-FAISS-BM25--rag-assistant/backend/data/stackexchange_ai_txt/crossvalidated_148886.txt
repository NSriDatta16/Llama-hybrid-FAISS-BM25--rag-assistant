Discordant significance of OR’s confidence interval and p-value in glm(quasibinomial) model [R]

I’m currently trying to test if differences in proportions of people infected by malaria (RDT positive) between clusters with high or low coverage of control intervention are significant. Therefore I’m running a quasi-binomial GLM in R like this: fit My explanatory variable of interest is Coverage_ov75 ; the others are controlling variables. Everything is ok until I test the significance. When I use summary(fit) , p-value is 0.0630, so the result is non significant at .05 level: Call: glm(formula = cbind(RDT_pos, RDT_neg) ~ Coverage_ov75 + rur_urb + pattern, family = quasibinomial, data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.7111 -1.9594 -0.7794 1.0525 3.8943 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I’m not used to quasi-binomial models, so I wonder if my procedure correct. If it’s correct, than how should I interpret these discrepant results?
