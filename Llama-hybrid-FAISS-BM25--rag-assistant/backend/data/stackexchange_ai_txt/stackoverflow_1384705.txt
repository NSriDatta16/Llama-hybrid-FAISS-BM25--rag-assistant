I'll cover the "child touch event set image file of parent" (the touches will be for the whole screen) - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSUInteger tapCount = [touch tapCount]; switch (tapCount) { case 1: [self performSelector:@selector(parent) withObject:nil afterDelay:0]; break; case 2: break; default: break; } - (void)parent { UIImage *img = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile: [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"parent" ofType:@"png"]]; [parent setImage:img]; } } as long as the UIImageViews are in the same view you should be fine and dandy like sour candy OR if you just want it if you touch the child image view, add a UIButton, drag it over the child, and set it as a custom button (will make it invisible) then set the -(void)parent to -(IBAction)parent and add it to the .h
