Should ordinal variables be normalized for PCA?

I need to analyze my (ecological) data with PCA, but the data don't seem to meet the assumption of normality very well. The problem is, that out of my 9 variables only two are continuous and the others are ordinal. So I was wondering if it's possible / recommended to apply any transformations to these ordinal data in order to normalize them, or should I only transform the two continuous variables and leave the rest as they are (and are there any references available on the matter)? I am aware that PCA may not be the most ideal option for analyzing this kind of data, but I must run it anyway. As to interpreting analyses made with normalized / transformed data, I'm also a bit confused if there should be some kind of 'back-transformations' or can the outcome be interpreted just as it is (regarding PCA in particular)?
