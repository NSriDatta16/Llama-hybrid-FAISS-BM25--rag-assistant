The question is fully addressed by meta-analysis (see, e.g., Introduction to Meta‚ÄêAnalysis by Borenstein et al. ), which includes studying of how the effect size vary from one study to another. Indeed, the effect size is subject to variation from one study to another, i.e., it is itself a random variable. Thus, a large effect size measured in one study, does not mean that the effect is really large when measured in a bigger/more representative sample... or indeed that the effect even has the same sign. Furthermore, there may be unaccounted for parameters in the study which vary from one study to another, resulting in different effect sizes (in which case we can talk about study-specific and average effect.) This is dealt with, e.g., by adopting random effects model or using meta-regression .
