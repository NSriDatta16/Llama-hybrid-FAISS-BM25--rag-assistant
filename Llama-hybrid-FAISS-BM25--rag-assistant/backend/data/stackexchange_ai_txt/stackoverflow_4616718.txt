I encourage you to use lazy loading techniques and this case you don't have to load every thing in your tree of object until you need them : class item { int id; string itemName; item partent; List _childs; public List Childs { get { if( _child == null) _child = getitembyparentid(this.id); return _child; } } } something like that and in this case you don't have to bring all rows into memory to handle them .
