I may not fully understand some of the concepts like organically adopted and auto enabled but I will try to answer the question nonetheless. I will talk in terms related to clinical trials since that is a similar randomized setting I am familiar with. Conditioning on post-treatment covariates can be seen as a subgroup analysis among a set of "responders" or "non-responders". If you are interested in the treatment effect for the entire target population you should not condition on these post-treatment covariates. If you are interested in these subpopulations, then definitely condition. In a clinical trial setting we are often interested in inference for the entire target population. In the trial subjects will often switch or discontinue treatment as a result of being a "responder" or "non-responder." One option is to imagine a world where switching would not occur when defining the estimand (e.g. population-level mean). This would amount to censoring subjects after a treatment switch and using an unverifiable missing data assumption to account for their missing values during the analysis. Another option is to incorporate this switching into the treatment definition, i.e. a treatment policy d(A,B):=[start with treatment A; if it doesn't work switch to treatment B]. This amounts to averaging together resonders and non-responders (treatment switchers and non-switchers). For this estimand causal inference remains at the policy level. It sounds like you might also be worried about sampling bias $-$ that the sample of subjects in your experiment are not randomly selected in a way that is representative of the target population. You can use inverse-probability-weighting or propensity scores to re-weight the sample in a way that you think is representative of the population. This is typically an unverifiable assumption and should be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis. An easier approach is to acknowledge potential bias and use a much smaller significance level (larger confidence level) when performing inference. This doesn't remove the sampling bias, but would help to ensure the confidence interval covers the truth despite the bias. Apologies again for not using your same terminology. If you refine your question based on my answer I can make an attempt at improving my answering.
