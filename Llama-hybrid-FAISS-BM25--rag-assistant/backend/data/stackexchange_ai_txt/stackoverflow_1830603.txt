drawing text within a JPanel

I'm looking for the most basic description of how to draw text within a JPanel. I know there are a billion tutorials out there but none of them are clicking with me and I have some specific questions which may help others who are confused. As a setup (a testing app) I have a single class which has a JLabel, a JTextField, a JButton, and a JPanel. The application reads in ints from an external file and should display their average in the panel when the JButton is pressed. I have all the underlying programing sorted out (that is, the button responds and prints the average to the command line) but I just cannot seem to sort out how to print the average to the panel. I guess my biggest question is how to incorporate the paint() or paintComponet() method in along with the rest of the code. Should it be it's own class? Should the JPanel be it's own class? It seems like that's what most of the tutorials are telling me, I'm just not sure what the first step is exactly. The code looks like: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; import java.io.*; public class Main extends JFrame implements ActionListener { private int[] intArray = new int[10000]; private int numOfInts = 0; private int avg = 0; protected JButton avgBtn; protected JTextField indexEntry; protected JLabel instructions; protected JPanel resultsPanel; public Main(){ //create main frame this.setTitle("Section V, question 2"); this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); this.setSize(350, 250); this.setLayout(new GridLayout(4, 1)); //create instruction label and add to frame instructions = new JLabel("Follow the instructions on the exam to use this program"); this.add(instructions); //create textfield for index entry and add to frame indexEntry = new JTextField(); this.add(indexEntry); //create button for average and add to frame avgBtn = new JButton("Click for Average"); this.add(avgBtn); avgBtn.addActionListener(this); //create panel to display results and add to frame resultsPanel = new JPanel(); resultsPanel.setBackground(Color.BLUE); this.add(resultsPanel); //read in from file readFromFile(); //compute average computeAverage(); } private void readFromFile() { try { // Open the file FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream("numbers.dat"); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fstream)); //create placeholder for read in ints String strLine; //Read File Line By Line int i = 0; while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) { //place ints in array and increament the count of ints System.out.println (strLine); intArray[i] = Integer.parseInt(strLine); numOfInts++; i++; } //Close the input stream in.close(); System.out.println ("numOfInts = " + numOfInts); } catch (Exception e) { //Catch exception if any System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage()); } } //compute averaage private void computeAverage() { int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i Any and all help/direction is appreciated. I know I've used this code recently for other questions, I just want to know it all! Ideally the panel would display the average of the read in ints when the button was clicked, and display whatever was entered into the textfeild when the focus was on it and enter was pressed, but I'm taking baby steps, and like I said, I'd like for this thread to be a general tutorial for others with similar questions who aren't finding answers from sun docs or other sites. Thanks so much in advance. Dan :)
