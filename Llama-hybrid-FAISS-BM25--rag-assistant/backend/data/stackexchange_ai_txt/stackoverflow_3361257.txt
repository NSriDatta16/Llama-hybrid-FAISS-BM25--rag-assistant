Just to be sure it's not a data problem, parameterize your SQL. Change the statement: Dim sql As String = "SELECT a.TelNumber, c.AccountNumber " & _ "FROM TelInfo a " & _ "INNER JOIN Customers b ON a.CustID = b.pkguidId " & _ "INNER JOIN Accounts c ON b.pkguidId = c.CustID " & _ "WHERE a.TelNumber = @telNumber" Then do this: Dim cmd As New SqlCommand(sql, conn) cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@telNumber", NumberToCheck) ' Edit I think we're looking in the wrong place. Add this just before if reader.Read() : Value = false AcctNumber = "" This will make sure you're not having a variable-scope problem. (You are using Option Strict On , right?)
