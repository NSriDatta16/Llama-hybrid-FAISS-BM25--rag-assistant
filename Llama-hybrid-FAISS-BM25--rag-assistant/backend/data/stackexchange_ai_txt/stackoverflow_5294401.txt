Problem with Android camera intent & orientation

I'm having the following problem when launching the camera intent in my Android application: if the application is launched in an orientation, say, portray, the camera only works in portray. If you change the phone orientation to landscape, with the application running, or the camera intent running, and try to take a landscape picture, the application force closes and with an error. It is like if the camera intent is able to shoot only in the orientation that the application was when launched. I can take pictures in landscape ONLY if I start my application in landscape, and take pictures in portrait ONLY if I start it in portait. The code to launch the camera intent is quite simple: String path = (new StringBuilder()).append(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()).append("/"+fileName).toString(); File file = new File(path); Uri outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile(file); Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); intent.putExtra("output", outputFileUri); startActivityForResult(intent, CAMERA_RESULT); Any ideas why this is happening? I don't have anything related to camera orientation in the manifest neither... Cheers Aram
