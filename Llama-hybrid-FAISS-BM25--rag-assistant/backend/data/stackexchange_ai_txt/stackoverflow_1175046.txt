No DomainDataSource in toolbox in Visual Studio

In Brad Adams' blogged walkthrough of the new RIA goodies, he mentions that you can simply drag a DomainDataSource from the toolbox to your XAML. All of my RIA kit came from links from that blog and I definitely have the July CTP, yet in my toolbox there is conspicuous absence of DomainDataSource. What arcane rituals must I undertake to be worthy of toolboxification and the accompanying privileges of automated addition of references to project and XAML?
