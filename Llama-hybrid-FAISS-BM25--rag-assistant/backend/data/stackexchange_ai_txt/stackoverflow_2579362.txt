Configurable ruby logger setup: Logger.new().level = variable

I want to change the logging level of an application (ruby). require 'logger' config = { :level => 'Logger::WARN' } log = Logger.new STDOUT log.level = Kernel.const_get config[:level] Well, the irb wasn't happy with that and threw "NameError: wrong constant name Logger::WARN" in my face. Ugh! I was insulted. I could do this in a case/when to solve this, or do log.level = 1, but there must be a more elegant way! Does anyone have any ideas? -daniel
