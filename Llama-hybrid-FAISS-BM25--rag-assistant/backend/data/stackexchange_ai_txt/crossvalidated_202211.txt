Binning Logistic Regression Results by Output in R

I have a logistic regression in R whose goal is to predict the probability of default on some test data. glm(default ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X1:term + term:X5 - 1, family="binomial", data=mydata) What I'd like to do is 'bin' this data so that bins 1 to n each have a certain rate of default. How can I bin the logistic regression results in this way? For example, the bins on a sample set of 1000 might look like: Bin# P(Default) Count 1 4% 400 2 2% 300 3 1% 300 That is, I set in advance the probabilities I want each bin to have (.04,.02,.01) and then bins are created based around those settings.
