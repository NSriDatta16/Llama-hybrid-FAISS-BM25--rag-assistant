JBoss Bean Statistics in Web-Console

I would like to use the JBoss web-console to view bean statistics. I read in a book ("JBoss: A Developer's Notebook") that bean invocation statistics are visible when drilling down through web-console's tree. There's even a tantalizing screenshot of individual bean data showing "the total number of invocations processed is recorded, along with the minimum, maximum, and average processing time." However, when I drill down to my ejb module, I cannot get all the way to my beans. At the ejb module level, I see xml on the right side of the screen, and the line: "Provides Statistics" shows false. I have scoured the net for some way to 'turn on' beans so that they provide statistics. Is there an element in my applications jboss.xml? Oh: I should say that I'm using JBossAS 5.1. Thanks for any help. Josh
