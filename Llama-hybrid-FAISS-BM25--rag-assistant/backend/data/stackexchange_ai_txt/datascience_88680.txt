What is the difference between CountVectorizer() and Tokenizer() or are they the same?

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer I am going through some NLP tutorials and realised that some tutorials use CountVectrizer and some use Tokenizer. From my understanding, I thought that they both use one-hot encoding but someone please clarify this. What I don't understand is why CountVectorizer is not used on Deep Learning models such as RNN and Tokenizer() is not used on ML Classifiers such as SVM, Naive Bayes. Thank you
