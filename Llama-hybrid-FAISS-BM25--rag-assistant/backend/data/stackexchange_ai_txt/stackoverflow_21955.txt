Yes! (except at the "top" of your application) By catching an exception and allowing the code execution to continue, you are stating that you know how do deal with and circumvent, or fix a particular problem. You are stating that this is a recoverable situation . Catching Exception or SystemException means that you will catch problems like IO errors, network errors, out-of-memory errors, missing-code errors, null-pointer-dereferencing and the likes. It is a lie to say that you can deal with these. In a well organised application, these unrecoverable problems should be handled high up the stack. In addition, as code evolves, you don't want your function to catch a new exception that is added in the future to a called method.
