You also have to comply with the Disability Discrimination act - especially as this is a Government resource. Info on the act http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/RightsAndObligations/DisabilityRights/DG_4001068 and http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=169 And some information regarding websites and the act at http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-accessibility/uk-website-legal-requirements.shtml and http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accessuk We deal with quite a few local councils and all of their sites must be accessible via screen readers so that those with visual impairments can use them, as such they need to be able to be navigated if the user has JavaScript and CSS disabled. You need to ensure that if you use any CSS on the site that the navigation and structure degrade gracefully so that they make sense (e.g. don't make the navigation the last item on the page and then use CSS to move it to the top). Don't make any navigation dependant on Javascript either (or at least have an alternative method of navigating if the user has JavaScript turned off). HTML and CSS should be validated to ensure there are no errors. All images need ALT attributes All links need title attributes Any tables should have a summary There are many more items like these but testing should flag these up. In terms of testing the site, there are a few free screen readers available - although we had limited success with these as they were pretty hit and miss as to how they worked. "Jaws" seems to be the industry "standard" at the moment but this is ridiculously expensive so you may want to outsource any testing to another company; although some councils will organise this themselves. You should also test the site on a text-only browser such as Lynx.
