Test if confidence interval by observation is correct

I have calculated a "confidence interval" of the days between purchase for 600K users. The exact method I used isn't relevant but a simple version would be for each user calculate the distribution between orders and then select the percentile 95 (without assuming any distribution for each user). So this way I end up with a "CI" for each users. I look at coverage probability but seems a bit complicated to perform by users and without a distribution assumption. And at the end I will have if the "CI" by users is correct but not if the general estimation is correct. I don't know if there exist something that will allow me to test if the estimation is correct or not but is what I'm asking EDIT So a bit of an example of how i calculate the percentile 95. Suppose I just have 1 user with 6 purchases that where done 10, 15, 20, 7 and 17 days between each other. This is between the first order and the second it took 10 days, and between the second and third 15 days and so on. For this user I calculate the percentile 95 of the empirical distribution of the days between orders. This is done in SQL but in R can be done with a simple quantile(c(10,15,20,7,17),0.95) . I do this for the 600k users which all have different amount of orders, so for some the percentile is actually decent based on the number of orders they have; for others its probably trash. But if in "general" I have more "good" estimations that "bad" ones maybe the overall model is correct. And that's exactly what I want to test.
