I learned something about these two common types of css selection here recently: Use "direct selection" elementtype.class{} or elementtype#id{} to apply style to elements directly. -For styling which is intended to affect once each time the rule is used eg. a margin change, a display change, a noninheriting font change. (Direct selection does not inherit to child elements, it is applied to parent element only.) Use "descendant selection" .class elementtype{} or #id elementtype to apply style to type descendants/children of the named, or classed element. For styling which is intended to change appearance of elementtypes, under an element/within a section of page, where it is applied. eg. inheriting font changes to text sections, inheriting format changes to paragraphs or list elements. (Descendant selection applies to all child elements but never the parent.) There are other useful/essential means of selection. But this is a basic distinction which it took me too long to discover. ps. I would like to find a good css tips thread here.
