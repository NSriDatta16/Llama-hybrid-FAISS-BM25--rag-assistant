Yes. Well... sort of. Dragging plain text from an editor worked fine for me, as for files... When you drop a file onto your app, it's type is "text/uri-list" . For this you will want to use the event.mimeData().urls() method to get a list of PyQt4.QtCore.QUrl objects. You will need to handle different mime data formats differently. You can use the following methods of the mimeData() to find out what attributes it has: hasColor() hasFormat() hasHtml() hasImage() hasText() hasUrls()
