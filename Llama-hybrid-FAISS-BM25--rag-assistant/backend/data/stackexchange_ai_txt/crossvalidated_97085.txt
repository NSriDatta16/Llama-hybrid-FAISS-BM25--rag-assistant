How is the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula affected by questions of differing difficulties?

How are the results of the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula affected by having test questions of differing difficulties or raters who are easy or hard graders. One respected text says the S-B is affected, but does not give details. (See quote below.) Guion, R. M (2011). Assessment, Measurement, And Prediction For Personnel Decisions, 2nd edition. Pg 477 "Reliability can be increased by pooling raters, using the Spearman-Brown equation. ... If the reliability of a single rating is .50, then the reliability of two, four, or six parallel ratings will be approximately .67, .80, and .86, respectively" (Houston, Raymond, & Svec, 1991, p. 409). I like this quotation because the word approximately recognizes that statistical estimates are "on the average" statements of what might be expected if all goes as assumed. Beyond that, the operative word is parallel. Averaging ratings (or using Spearman-Brown) if one rater is, for example, systematically lenient, simply does not fit the assumption. If essays are each rated by two raters, one more lenient than the other, the problem is like that of using two multiple choice tests of unequal difficulty (nonparallel forms). Scores based on different (unequated) test forms are not comparable. So it is with mixing lenient and difficult raters; the reliability of the pooled ratings is incorrectly estimated by the Spearman-Brown equation of classical test theory. Matters are worse if each judge defines a construct a bit differently."
