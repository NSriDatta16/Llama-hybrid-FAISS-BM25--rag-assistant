solid line from a local average series

I have a time series of data taken from a meteorological station, and I have to extract values from it which are located on a precise point of time; problem is that the station time series I have only gives me average values of measures every half an hour. There is some method to get a smoth line from it, so I can take the singular values I need? this drawing could explain it better: the black lines are the discrete values I have, the blue line is what I want. actually, it doesn't have to be necessarily smooth, it must be the most realistic it can, so it has to respect the average constraint; in other words, the expected value of taking a random point of the solid (blue) line should be the (black) local average value I have now. if different options exist, and maybe some books explain them, I'd be happy if you tell me.
