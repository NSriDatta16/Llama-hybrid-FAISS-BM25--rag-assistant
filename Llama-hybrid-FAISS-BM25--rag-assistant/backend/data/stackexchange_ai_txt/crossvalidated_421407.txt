Adjustment for multiple comparison in bayesian multivariate regression model (using brms)

I am investigating age and timepoint effects on different (correlated) EEG parameters in a repeated measurements structure. I chose to use the brms R package to fit a bayesian multivariate model with random intercepts for each subject: [EEG dvs] ~ age * timepoint + (1|id) I am particularly interested on which of the 6 outcomes there is an effect of age. Since I don't have any well informed prior, I only want to interpret the 95% credibility interval and not calculate any Bayes factors. How can I correct for the multiple comparisons (6 EEG parameters) in this case? I don't see how I can build a hierarchical model like the one proposed in Gelman's paper ( http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf ) for the different EEG parameters.
