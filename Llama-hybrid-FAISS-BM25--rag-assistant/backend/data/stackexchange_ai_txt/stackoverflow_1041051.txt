Can I use iPhone 3.0 symbols when building for 2.2.1?

I've been working on iPhone app for awhile and still want to support 2.2.1 One of the features is that the user can start the app via email by clicking a link. In the 2.2.1 world, I accomplished this by implemting the application: handleOpenURL: message. In iPhone 3.0, they've changed things up adding the application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method (which is great, and makes a lot more sense than the old way). In that method, you use the key UIApplicationLaunchOptionsURLKey to find out what the URL was. The problem is, if I use that key my app doesn't build in 2.2.1 since it was introduced in 3.0. What's the most elegant way to get around this and still support 2.2.1? I was thinking of using the actual value for the UIApplicationLaunchOptionsURLKey enum, but I figured that was ugly. Has anybody encountered this and think of a better way?
