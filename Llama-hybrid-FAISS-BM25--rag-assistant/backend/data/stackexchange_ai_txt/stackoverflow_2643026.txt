SSIS 2005 running in SQL Server Agent on local PC connecting to database on remote server produces error

I'm trying to run an SSIS 2005 package from a SQL Server Agent job on my local PC. This package is attempting to connect to a SQL Server 2005 database on a remote server, but it gets the error message, Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON' . What is the problem and how can I solve it?
