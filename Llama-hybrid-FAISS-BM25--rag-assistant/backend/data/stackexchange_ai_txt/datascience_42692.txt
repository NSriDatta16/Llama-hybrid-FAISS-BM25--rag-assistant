First of all, be assured that the kernel matrix (the 2x2 matrix in the figure) in CNN is not constrained to have its diagonal filled with a unique value, and is thus not a Toeplitz matrix. In www.deeplearningbook.org , we can read: "Discrete convolution can be viewed as multiplication by a matrix, but the matrix has several entries constrained to be equal to other entries" This means that the global operation of passing a kernel on the input data of a CNN could be expressed as the multiplication of this input data by a matrix. i.e. by a large and sparse Toeplitz matrix. Authors mention the illustrative simple case of univariate discrete convolution . In univariate discrete convolution, we would be applying a 1-D kernel matrix of length $m$ on 1-D input data of length $n$ . Let us take n=10 and m=3. Doing the convolution could be done by multiplying the input vector data by a n*n matrix, whose diagonal would be composed of the 3 weights of the kernel, shifted of one column to the right at each new row.
