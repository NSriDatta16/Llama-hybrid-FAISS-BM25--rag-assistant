How can validation loss increases than slowly decreases when overfitting?

I'm using CNN to do multi-regression jobs, but some wired results confuse me. Here's my training results curves: As you can see, the training loss first decreases fastly and then converges, while validation loss starts to increase - indicates overfitting begins; However the validation loss starts to decreases again in a slow pace - which seems like the model still not converges. Can anyone explain this? For references, I'm using MSE as loss with Adam as optimizer.
