Re-entrancy is not something that the compiler has any control over - it's up to the programmer to write re-entrant code. To do this you need to avoid all the obvious pitfalls, e.g. globals (including local static variables), shared resources, threads, calls to other non-reentrant functions, etc. Having said that, some cross-compilers for small embedded systems, e.g. 8051, may not generate reentrant code by default, and you may have to request reentrant code for specific functions via e.g. a #pragma .
