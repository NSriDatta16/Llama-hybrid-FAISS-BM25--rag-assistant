viewname.x.vws is the naming convention for view storage for views whose tag is reused. That is the case when the view is not deleted on the client side, but only on the view server side (i.e " cleartool unregister ", followed by a " cleartool rmtag "): The view is essentially gone for ClearCase, but its client-side view storage (which is now useless) remains. (That is what Trent Fisher says in his comment of the Hudson ClearCase Plugin page ) In this scenario, you can re-create a view by reusing the former view tag, but, since a corresponding view storage still exists, a new storage.x.vws is created. I would really-really recommend selecting the option "use existing dynamic view" to avoid that: (but contrary to this picture, I would not select the "Do not reset the config spec").
