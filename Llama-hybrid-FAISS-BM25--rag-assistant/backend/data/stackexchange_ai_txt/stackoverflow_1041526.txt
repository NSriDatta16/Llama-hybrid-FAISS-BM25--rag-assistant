In what way is mt_rand() "bad"? For example: If it favors a certain number. Lets say mt_rand(1, 10) favours low numbers in the range, ie "1" and "2" occurs on average more than 10% each. Then your "improvement" would still suffer from the same problem. Selecting a random number out of a faulty sequence will still be faulty.
