How do I index and make available reusable code?

I have many small files containing code fragments, pseudo-code algorithms, classes, templates, SQL-samples, etc., and I obviously cannot put all these into libraries. I need a practical method to index all of them, and to be able to make this index available to others. What must such an index contain to make searching easiest? Are there any such repositories available on the web? (So I can test the techniques they use.) Are there any applications already written that implement this that I can have a look at?
