MSP 430 wrong values being displayed

I'm developing pressure measuring device. I've used MSP430F133 chip and using IAR embedded workbench. It shows pressure in 3 different units. I'm taking 32 samples and averaging it. Unit selection on P5, according to the unit selected output value is calculated and displayed on LCD. Now a unit "IN WC" is showing binary averaged vale of input, just for analysis. The problem: in default units(MM WC) values are displaying correctly but in a test situation when pressure is released it goes down and LCD read as below +31.8 +31.7 +31.6 +31.5 +31.4 +31.3 +31.2 +31.2 +31.1 +31.5 (wrong reading randomly between *.4 to *.7) +30.9 As you can there is one wrong value is being displayed, I'm not able to figure out the reason.
