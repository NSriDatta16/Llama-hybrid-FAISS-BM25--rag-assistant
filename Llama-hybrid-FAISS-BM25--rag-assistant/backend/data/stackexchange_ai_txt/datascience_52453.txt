Neural networks (keras): predicting a periodic output array

I have a non-linear multiple regression problem where my target arrays have a length of 256 (for a single sample). These arrays have a periodic structure, since it's actually composed of 16 semi-independent sigmoid-like arrays of equal lengths, whose exact form depend on the inputs (see figure). Although I seem to get good results with some basic RELU activations and a few hidden layers already, I was wondering if e.g. a sine activation function might be appropriate somewhere? How might I implement this in Keras? EDIT: ok, adding a sine activation was trivial: def sin(x): return K.sin(x) However, it doesn't seem to increase performance. I guess because the outputs are not a periodic function of the inputs, but because the whole output array is sort of a static periodic array?
