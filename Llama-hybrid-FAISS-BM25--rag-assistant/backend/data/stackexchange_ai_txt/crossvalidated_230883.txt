How to calculate lambda of Box Cox paramater to test stationarity of variants in Time Series

I want to test stationarity of variants using Box-Cox Lambda for Time series assumption (Stationarity). Null-Hypothesis : Lambda is not zero (Data is stationarity of variants) Alternative-Hypothesis : Lambda is zero (Data is not stationarity of variants) But I got confused to obtain that lambda. Do you know the formula to obtain that lambda? Thankyou
