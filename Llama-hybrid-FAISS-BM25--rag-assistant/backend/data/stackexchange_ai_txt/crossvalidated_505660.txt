I assume schizophrenia vs. general population is your "exposure" variable of interest and your outcome is something related to e.g., survival or cognitive decline. You matched on age, sex, and race so that differences in the outcome between schizophrenia patients and the general population would not be attributable to those variables. Typically, one is only interested in the effect of the exposure variable, and the other covariates are there to remove confounding; their coefficients in the outcome model generally should not be interpreted because they don't represent causal relationships (i.e., the only causal relationship that can be assessed is the relationship between the exposure and the outcome). Incorrectly interpreting the coefficients on non-exposure covariates in the outcome model is known as the Table 2 fallacy ( Westreich, 2013 ). I encourage you not to interpret those coefficients, but I'll explain the statistical matter of why they might be significant even after matching. Matching makes the distribution of the covariate unrelated to the exposure . This means if you were to regress the exposure on the covariates, you would likely get non-significant and small coefficients. Indeed, these coefficients can be used as a measure of balance; if they are large, then the exposure groups differ with respect to that variable and your groups are not balanced. However, matching doesn't change the relationship between the covariates and the outcome , which is what the coefficients in the outcome model represent. One way to think about this is to imagine a twin study. If one twin has schizophrenia and the other doesn't, the fact that they are twins, which makes their ages identical, doesn't change the relationship between age and cognitive decline. Older pairs of twins will still have greater cognitive decline. Likewise, in your study, the fact that pairs of units have the same age doesn't change the relationship between age and cognitive decline. Again, I urge you to be extremely cautious in interpreting the coefficients on those covariates in the outcome model. In the MatchIt documentation for estimating effects after matching, the code was written specifically to blind researchers to those coefficients because they are generally not informative and possibly misleading.
