Is there a Windows API hook for "this application wants attention"?

In Windows XP, when a program wants the user's attention, it'll flash its taskbar button orange. Anyone with an IM program is probably familiar with this behavior. But when I'm playing a fullscreen-mode game, I don't see that, and messages go unanswered. Now I'm writing a game engine of my own, and I'd like to be kind to my users. Is there any Windows API call I can write a hook for that will notify my program whenever any other program just set its taskbar button to "orange flashing mode"? That way, I could notify the user when it happens. I'd be surprised if this isn't available. I saw a Mac OS Classic screensaver that was able to do this way back in the mid-90s. That's where I got the idea from.
