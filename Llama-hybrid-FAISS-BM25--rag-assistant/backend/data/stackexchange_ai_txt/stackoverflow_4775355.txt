.htaccess redirect to the hash (url fragment) if specified

I have this .htaccess file in my project: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond $1 !^( {files and folders that should be accessed directly} ) RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /{full url to web root}/index.php/$1 [L] And now I want to add the functionality to redirect directly (not just overwrite the url) to the hash of the url - if such hash exists. For example: site.com/contacts#/company ==> site.com/company But can't do it yet :( ... Thanks in advance ...
