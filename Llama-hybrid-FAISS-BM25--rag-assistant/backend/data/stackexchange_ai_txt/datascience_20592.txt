xgboost - How do I treat document ID in pairwise ranking

I am trying to use xgboost in R for pairwise ranking for an implicit dataset. For simplicity, let's assume that I am dealing with a search problem, where I want to rank documents relative to a given query. Each query has an ID and the documents that were clicked also have an ID. My dataset only consists of the positive feedback and looks like this: queryID documentID features target 1 1 ... 1 1 3 ... 1 1 13 ... 1 2 3 ... 1 2 4 ... 1 3 990 ... 1 I have read, that for grouping my queries together, I have to use setinfo(group, list ). But what do I do with my documentID, do I implement it as just another feature in my feature list?
