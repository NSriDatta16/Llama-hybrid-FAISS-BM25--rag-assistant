This is a vast topic to cover in a few paragraph answer, so I will try and point you in the right direction. Robert Taylor of FlashExtentions.com has done a few talks on this subject. I would suggest taking a look at his Session notes . Make sure to download the Workbook summary PDF , and the Materials ZIP on Multilingual Flash Applications . Those will give you a good understanding of the topic. The examples are in AS2 but I don't really see your question as language based, but rather a general software architecture problem. Fonts are quite a big issue when dealing with other languages so check out WestBrents answer on this post Hope that helps.
