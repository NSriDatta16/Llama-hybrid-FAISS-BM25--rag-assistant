I would advise to use COM in this situation. (Attention: not COM+, not ActiveX, not OLE; COM, just COM.) Since Delphi 7 (or an earlier version, I'm not sure), this is easily done by adding a Type Library to the project, and an Automation object. Advantages are it's pretty widely supported, both within Delphi (the Type Library Editor has everything you need and updates your code, and COM internals and registering are catered for from the ComServ unit), and outside of Delphi (I use it in a number of project to interact with all sorts of applications: C++ projects, Word and Excel documents using VBA, oldskool ASP...). An only disadvantage I encountered may be threading issues, in normal applications, a plain CoInitialize(nil); at application startup will do, in more complex applications, you need to think about 'threading apartments' or use free threading and do your own locking. (Which in some cases you've been doing already.)
