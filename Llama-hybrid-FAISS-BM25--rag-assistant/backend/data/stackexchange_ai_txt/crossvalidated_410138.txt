Sampling Methods : Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Bishop

I am reading chapter 11 . Sampling Methods from the book : Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop : In the introduction , in short,he evaluates expectation of some function $f(z)$ with respect to a probability distribution $P(z)$ where $z$ is the random variable . He writes : \begin{align} E(f) = \int f(z)p(z)dz \end{align} Now he says that we suppose that such expectations are too complex to be evaluated exactly using analytical techniques . So we use sampling. And the idea behind sampling methods is to obtain a set of samples $z^{(l)}$ , (where $l=1,....,L$ ) drawn independently from the distribution $P(z)$ . This allows the expectation to be written as \begin{align} f^{\hat{}} = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{L}f(z^{(l)})}{L} \end{align} Now further in the official solution for excercise 11.1 , he calculates : \begin{align} E[f^{\hat{}}] = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\int f(z^{(l)}) p(z^{(l)})dz^{(l)}\tag 1 \end{align} Now i did not understand this integral . My argument , for simplicity , let us assume the underlying distribution $P(z)$ to be a one dimensional standard normal distribtion . 1.) When the author samples $z^{1}$ , i assume that he drew a fixed $n$ values which would look something like : $z^{1}= \{0.2,0.30.2323,... ,0.8\}$ ,total $n$ values . Now in that case how would the integeral in $(1)$ look like ? For example what would be the limits of integration ?
