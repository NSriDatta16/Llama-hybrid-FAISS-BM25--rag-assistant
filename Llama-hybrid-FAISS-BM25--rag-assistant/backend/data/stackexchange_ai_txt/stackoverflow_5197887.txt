For Cython A[1] will be a python object. If you want to be able to still use cdef, use automatic cast in your caller : cdef public caller(self): cdef Agents agent print "caller" agent = A[1] agent.called() You can check with the -a mode in cython to know if you are using Python or C for each lines code. (cython -a yourfile.pyx -> will generate a yourfile.html that you can browse & check).
