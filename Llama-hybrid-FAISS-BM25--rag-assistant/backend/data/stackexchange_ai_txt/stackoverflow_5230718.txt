This is the compiler/linker job to remove dead code from your binary. Compile your source code with gcc flags -fdata-sections and -ffunction-sections then link your binary with the flag â€“gc-sections. I think you can also produce warnings at compilation time for static unused variables. Finally you can use gcov or equivalent tool for code coverage
