WPF. IsolatedStoreage FileName Length

For save my configuration_data I use isolated stoeage domain scope like: IsolatedStorageFile isoFile = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForDomain(); But sometimes at saving data I get: System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.IO.PathTooLongException: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters. at System.IO.PathHelper.Append(Char value) at System.IO.Path.NormalizePath(String path, Boolean fullCheck, Int32 maxPathLength) Ok my fileName is too long. But I can't control it. Also I can't use application scope, cause I don't use ClickOnce. So what should I do? Thanks
