The most common algorithms book I have seen is Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's Introduction to Algorithms , which you may see written elsewhere as CLRS or "The MIT Algorithms Text". It's not quite as pervasive as the Dragon Book is for compiler design, but it's close. Strictly speaking, when talking about algorithms, the programming language you decide to use rarely makes much of a difference. Algorithms are about speeding up the machine's way of thinking of general problems, not a particular way of processing a particular input with a particular implementation.
