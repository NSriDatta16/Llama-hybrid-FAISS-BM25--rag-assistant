How do I make a WPF popup draggable using a thumb?

I've searched long and hard to find an example of this on the net. I've seen the alternative methods for this but I want to specifically use a thumb. In trying to hash out a solution I've been unable to get the functionality right/working as I'm fairly new to WPF. I'd be grateful if someone could give an example of how you may implement the above. Cheers
