This may not serve as an actual answer, but I'll go for it anyway. I ran into the same problem, using Mvc 2 and Ninject 2.0. I was working on a PhotoController that simply spat back images to the page. It would be hit thirty or so times per page request. I was using Ninject for dependencies with all of my controllers, and ran into problems with that specific controller. Sometimes, Ninject would throw the exact same ActivationException you are encountering. The only way to make the error go away would be to restart the app pool. After hours and hours of fiddling around trying to determine the cause, the only conclusion I came to was that Ninject must have a problem injecting dependencies in cases where a very large number of requests for the same instance occur . That was the only difference between the PhotoController and any other one in the project. I solved the problem by switching to using a generic handler, and shortly after that, pre-determined blob storage urls. Sorry I can't be of more help, but I posted a question about my experience on stack and never got a resolution to it.
