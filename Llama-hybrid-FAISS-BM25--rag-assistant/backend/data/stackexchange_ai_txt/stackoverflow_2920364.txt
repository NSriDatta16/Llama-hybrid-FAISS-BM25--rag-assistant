Checking for a null int value from a Java ResultSet

In Java I'm trying to test for a null value, from a ResultSet, where the column is being cast to a primitive int type. int iVal; ResultSet rs = magicallyAppearingStmt.executeQuery(query); if (rs.next()) { if (rs.getObject("ID_PARENT") != null && !rs.wasNull()) { iVal = rs.getInt("ID_PARENT"); } } From the code fragment above, is there a better way to do this, and I assume that the second wasNull() test is redundant? Educate us, and Thanks
