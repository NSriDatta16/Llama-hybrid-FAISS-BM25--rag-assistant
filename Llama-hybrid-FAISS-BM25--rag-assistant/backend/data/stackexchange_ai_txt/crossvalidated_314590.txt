ANOVA one way: Levene test is significant. Welch and Brown Forsythe Test are the solution?

I trying to run a one-way ANOVA to compare 3 groups (Northern, Center and Southern regions) but Levene test is significant. Kurtosis and Skewness are ok but the equal variances assumption is violated. So what do you think is the best way to proceed? Maybe using Welch and Brown - Forsythe test and Games Howell test as post hoc ? Thank you for your attention and your time
