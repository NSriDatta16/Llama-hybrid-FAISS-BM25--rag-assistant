The reason the CEmail class was compiling fine is because it was not marked as implementing the interface. When I marked it as such, I got the same error as the other class. The following is how it has to be... I am pretty stupid for not noticing that. We are under a lot of pressure here right now and I can't believe I stared at this code for like an hour before I posted a question, and it was something so simple... it always is I guess :) public interface IXmlSerializable { //if this interface is implemented, the object can be serialized to XML string toXML(); IXmlSerializable fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml); } public class AwwaTransmissionInfo : IXmlSerializable { public DateTime DateTime = DateTime.Now; public int ItemCount; public string toXML() { throw new Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } public IXmlSerializable fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { throw new Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } } public class CEmail : **IXmlSerializable** { public string Email = ""; public string toXML() { throw new System.Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } public IXmlSerializable fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { throw new System.Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } }
