Welcome to Data Science on Stack Exchange, This is a common question, predicting future prices or forecasting. The gap you see is due to the random nature of prices such as this, along with the underlying complexity of this topic. Unless there is a time pattern in the data, a LSTM model won't predict well. LSTM will especially perform poorly if the data is changing direction often, going up and down in value. A lot of discussion goes around which model you should use, but not sure any one of them are consistently the best. For some general ideas on different techniques, applied to the stock market in this case, here is a good reference. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/predicting-stock-price-machine-learningnd-deep-learning-techniques-python/ It mentions LSTM (popular if you believe in momentum), and also Arima, FBProphet, etc. However, there are usually many other variables that have a large influence on the future price that you won't get this way, such as sentiment, news articles or announcements, etc. You might look at using an ensemble, maybe LSTM + 1 or 2 other models, and combine these different inputs so they can be included in your prediction.
