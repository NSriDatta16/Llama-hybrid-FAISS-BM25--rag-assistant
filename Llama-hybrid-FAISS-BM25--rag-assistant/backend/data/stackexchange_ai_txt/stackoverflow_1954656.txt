Saving E-Mails into a Silverlight Application

We have an Silverlight applications for tracking Sales Leads. In this application files can be attached to the Sales Leads using the File Open dialog and a file upload module. This works great. In a perfect world, the client wants to be able to drag and drop e-mails onto the lead in the silverlight application. I know that this is a stretch. I am looking for ingenious ways of getting e-mails from Outlook attached to Leads in our database. Our best idea to date is to forward the e-mails to a monitored mailbox with the Lead # as part of the subject. A batch program would convert the e-mail into a PDF and save the PDF and file attachments in the lead specific folder. This feels a little kludgy because the Lead # is not currently exposed to the customer and requires non-techie users to follow instructions. Please let me know if you have any better ideas. Thanks, Mike
