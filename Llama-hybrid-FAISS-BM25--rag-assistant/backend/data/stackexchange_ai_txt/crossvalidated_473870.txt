Linear regression would not be a sensible approach for the data in that paper, since the relationship between X and Y is does not linear (conditional on knowing the clustering, there doesnt seem to be any relationship between X and Y at all, and any 'linearity' you find is going to be a spurious result of marginalising over the cluster allocations). You should break the observations into clusters first, and fit a separate model within each cluster. This really looks like a problem of omitted variables. There is perhaps some variable X2 (which you havent measured) which is separating the observations into clusters. If you fit a model which included this X2 and added in the interaction terms (essentially leading a multi-level model with random intercepts and perhaps random slopes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model ) then its coefficient would be highly significant. If you cant measure X2 directly then doing some kind of clustered regression where X2 is the cluster index of each observation would perhaps be sensible. This could be done either as a preprocessing step (i.e. you first cluster the data, take the cluster allocations as fixed, and then run a regression) or you could do some kind of full Bayesian analysis where you simultaneously learn the clusters and the regression model within each cluster and have full uncertainty quantification over everything.
