Magento - override "OnepageController.php"

I have a problem overriding the controller "OnepageController.php" located in "app \ code \ core \ Mage \ Checkout \ controllers", more exactly on the side of xml configuration file and the tree of my module, I am a bit lost in it ... A little help would be appreciated. Thanks a lot.
