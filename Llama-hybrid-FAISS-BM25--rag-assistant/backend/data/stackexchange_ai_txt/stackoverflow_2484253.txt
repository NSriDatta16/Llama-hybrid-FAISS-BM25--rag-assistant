If you mean the physical location to the IsolatedStorage within the file system, I believe the answer is no. You can, however, get a reference to the IsolatedStorageFile for your application using: IsolatedStorageFile f = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); ... and then you can iterate through all of the files within that container: f.GetFileNames(); If you can give a little more information about what it is you're actually trying to achieve then perhaps we could suggest a suitable workaround? Hope this helps.
