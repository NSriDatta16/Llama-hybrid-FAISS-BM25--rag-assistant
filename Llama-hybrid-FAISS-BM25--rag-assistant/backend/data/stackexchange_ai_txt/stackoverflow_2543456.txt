Files take up space in the form of clusters on the disk. A cluster is a number of sectors, and the size depends on how the disk was formatted. A typical size for clusters is 8 kilobytes. That would mean that the two smaller files would use two clusters (16 kilobytes) each and the larger file would use three clusters (24 kilobytes). A file will by average use half a cluster more than it's size. So with a cluster size of 8 kilobytes each file will by average have an overhead of 4 kilobytes.
