Keep NSWindow front

I open a NSWindow from my main NSWindow. DropHereWindowController *dropHereWindowController = [[DropHereWindowController alloc] initWithWindowNibName:@"DropHereWindow"]; [dropHereWindowController showWindow:nil]; I want this window to stay on top of my main window when dragging a file from the finder to that "DropHereWindow". However when opening the finder (not having the focus any longer) my "DropHereWindow" goes behind my main window. I tried orderFront, makeKey, makeKeyAndFront but nothing helped. What can I do about it?
