OK, after struggling with this I finally got it to work. I aint saying this is the best (or even correct!) way of doing it, but this is what ultimately worked for me locally on my Windows machine (running WAMP) and on a remote server running Linux. The paths listed are where they were for my environments. Obviously this could be different for your situation. BEFORE-FIRST (Windows only) With Windows, you need to setup an entry in your hosts file for the new "domain". WIN - C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts 127.0.0.1 webproject.local FIRST Need to edit httpd.conf and add a virtual host WIN - C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.11\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf LINUX - /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf DocumentRoot "C:\wamp\www\webproject" ServerName webproject.local SECOND Setup a host and context in server.xml. From what I read online, editing server.xml is discouraged but this was the only way I could figure it out. WIN - C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\conf\server.xml LINUX - etc/tomcat5/server.xml The thing I don't think is right, but worked for me was using "webapps" as the appBase even though my files are not in the "webapps" folder. Not sure why this is working... I fear that it is one of those situations where it works even though it shouldnt. I hope someone a lot smarter than me can offer some insight.
