You cannot take the address of a member of vector . That's because vector is a specialised version of std::vector, and the things stored in such a vector are not actually bools, but individual bits, which are not addressable. If you need to take the address, use a vector or deque instead. If you also need the storage to be contiguous (which it seems you do, if you want to use write() ), then use vector .
