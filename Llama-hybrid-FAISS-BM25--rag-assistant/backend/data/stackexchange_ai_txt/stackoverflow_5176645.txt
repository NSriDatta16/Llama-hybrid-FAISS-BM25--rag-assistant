How to find out when an installation is completed

I am creating an application that installs apps downloaded from a server. I would like to Install these application After the file is downloaded the code for the method I am using to install is here: public void Install(String name) { //prompts user to accept any installation of the apk with provided name Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(new File (Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/ContentManager/" + name)), "application/vnd.android.package-archive"); startActivity(intent); //this code should execute after the install finishes File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/ContentManager/"+name); file.delete(); } I would like to have the apk file deleted from the sd card after the install is completed. This code deletes it once the install is started, causing the installation to fail. I am fairly neew to android and would much appreciate some help. I am basically trying to wait for the installation to complete before continuing with the process.
