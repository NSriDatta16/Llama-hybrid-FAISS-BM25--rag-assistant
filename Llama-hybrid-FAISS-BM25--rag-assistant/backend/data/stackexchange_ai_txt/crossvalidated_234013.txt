Several types of priors for conducting variable selection have been developed in the context of linear regression models. One the most recent proposals are non-local priors, which are implemented in the R package mombf: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mombf/index.html In your case, $2^{20}$ models are not that many (1048576), and it may be feasible to explore all of them. If you want to conduct a faster, efficient selection, you may want to have a look at either of these two papers (which are also part of the mombf package): Variable Selection Via Gibbs Sampling . Edward I. George; Robert E. McCulloch. Journal of the American Statistical Association and J.G. Scott and J.O Berger. [Bayes and empirical Bayes multiplicity adjustment in the variable selection problem](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1278861454) . The Annals of Statistics.
