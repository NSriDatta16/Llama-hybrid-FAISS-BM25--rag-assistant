Logistic regression, deducing parameters from probability

I ran a logistic regression and know how to deduce the probability of success from select parameters: predict(glm , data , type = "response") However, how do we go the other way around? Let's say my data is composed of : survival (binary) (outcome) age (continuous) (parameter) sex (binary) (parameter) I would like to know, based on some probability $\alpha$ of survival, how old is the person, if boy or girl. Here is a picture of probability graph
