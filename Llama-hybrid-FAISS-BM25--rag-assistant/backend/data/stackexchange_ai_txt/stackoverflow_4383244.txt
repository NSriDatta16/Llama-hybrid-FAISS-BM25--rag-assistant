Handle KeyDown during a drag drop

I need to respond to keydown events (O, C, G keys etc., not modifier keys) while a Drag+Drop operation is in progress over my control (i.e. between DragEnter and DragLeave). However the KeyDown event is not called at this stage. I've tried selecting my control and specifically setting focus on DragEnter, but that doesn't work. EDIT: Hans' answer is basically correct, except I had to use GetAsynchKeyState to get the behaviour I wanted.
