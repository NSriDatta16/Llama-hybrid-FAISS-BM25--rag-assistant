Multiple Regression requires certain assumptions regarding independence in the error term which is free of pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses/local time trends and non-constancy of the error variance. Since you have time series data certain complications/opportunities may arise. I once wrote an article entitled Regression vs. Box-Jenkins to help explain this and it may help you understand the issues involved. http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/24-regression-vs-box-jenkins , Your daily data possibly influenced by your predictor may well include lags structures, temporal effects and possible level/trend effects. The methodology that you should be considering is called Transfer Functions . An example of this methodology to water levels is here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/news/166-051393-used-in-us-department-of-the-interior-technical-report-prediction-of-water-use-in-puerto-ricoqby-nazario-d-ramirez-beltran .
