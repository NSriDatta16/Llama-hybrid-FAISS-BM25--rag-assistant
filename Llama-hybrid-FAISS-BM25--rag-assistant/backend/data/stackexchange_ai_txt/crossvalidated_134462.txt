Returning unlikely results from a probability distribution

The Law of large numbers addresses the issue of the average result of a large number of random trials. Is there a similar law which addresses the probability of obtaining an unusual result for a large number of trials? For instance, consider a normal probability distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2. I am testing a computational method which will run only if the result is above 18 , that is four standard deviations off the mean and so the likelyhood of ever seeing the if condition met is very low. Therefore, to test the method I must run a very large number of trials. Just as one could expect the average value of the trials to approach 10 as more trials are performed, one could also expect that the probability of receiving the unusual result 18 to increase as more trials are performed. Is there a term for this phenomenon?
