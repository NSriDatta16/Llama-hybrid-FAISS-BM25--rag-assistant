If all patients have the same constant risk of discharge, then you have exponential distribution of length of stay and average time of stay = 1/incidence rate. Or, to put it differently, if discharges occur with a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$, then the average duration is $1/\lambda$. This may be a good starting point for your model. In reality 1) there are patients with different discharge probabilities. At any point of time, the patients with low discharge probability are overrepresented in the hospital. 2) The individual probability changes over time, in particular patients recover. These two effects probably make the exponential model above only a crude approximation. You can figure it out if you have the data (I would look at Weibull models) and do the corresponding calculations.
