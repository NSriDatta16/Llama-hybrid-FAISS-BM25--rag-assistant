ASP.NET MVC and IIS 5

What is the best way to get hosting of an ASP.NET MVC application to work on IIS 5 (6 or 7). When I tried to publish my ASP.NET MVC application, all I seemed to get is 404 errors. I've done a bit of googleing and have found a couple of solutions, but neither seem super elegant, and I worry if they will be unusable once I come to use a shared hosting environment for the application. Solution 1 Right-click your application virtual directory on inetmgr.exe. Properties->Virtual Directory Tab-> Configuration. Add a new mapping extension. The extension should be .*, which will be mapped to the Executable C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll, or the appropriate location on your computer (you can simply copy this from the mapping for .aspx files). On the mapping uncheck "check that file exists". 3 X OK and you're good to go. If you want, you can apply this setting to all your web sites. In step1, click on the "Default Web Site" node instead of your own virtual directory, and in step 2 go to the "Home Directory" tab. The rest is the same. It seems a tad hacky to route everything through ASP.NET. Solutions 2 Edit the MVC routing to contain .mvc in the URL and then follow the steps in solution 1 based around this extension.
