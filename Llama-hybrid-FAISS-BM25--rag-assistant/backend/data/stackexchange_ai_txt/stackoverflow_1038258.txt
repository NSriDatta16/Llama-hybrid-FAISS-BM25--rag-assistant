This is called the transitive reduction problem . Formally speaking, you are looking for a minimal (fewest edges) directed graph, the transitive closure of which is equal to the transitive closure of the input graph. (The diagram on the above Wikipedia link makes it clear.) Apparently there exists an efficient algorithm for solving this problem that takes the same time as for producing a transitive closure (i.e. the more common inverse problem of adding transitive links instead of removing them), however the link to the 1972 paper by Aho, Garey, and Ullman costs $25 to download, and some quick googling didn't turn up any nice descriptions. EDIT: Scott Cotton's graphlib contains a Java implementation ! This Java library looks to be very well organised.
