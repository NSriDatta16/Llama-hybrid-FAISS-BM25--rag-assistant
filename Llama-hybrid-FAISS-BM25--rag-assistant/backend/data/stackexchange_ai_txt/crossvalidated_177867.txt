It seems like you understand that you're able to have n levels, as opposed to n-1 , because unlike in linear regression you don't need to worry about perfect colinearity. (I'm coming at this from an R perspective, but I assume it's the same in Python.) That depends on a couple of things, such as 1) which package you're using and 2) how many factor levels you have. 1) If you are using R's randomForest package, then if you have n dummies, then the algorithm would not have this option at its disposal. Obviously if the particularly package you're using can't handle categorical features then you'd just need to create n dummy variables. 2) As I alluded to above, R's random forest implementation can only handle 32 factor levels - if you have more than that then you either need to split your factors into smaller subsets, or create a dummy variable for each level.
