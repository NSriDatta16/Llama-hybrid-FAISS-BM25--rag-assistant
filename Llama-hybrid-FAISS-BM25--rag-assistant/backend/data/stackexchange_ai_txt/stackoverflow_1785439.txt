cocoa + dmg file + trace back its path

I have a situation in which my .dmg file will on my removable storage device which contains my application. when i double click on it, it will get mounted on my local machine and inside the mounted volume will be my .app (aplication file). Now I want my application to auto launch once my dmg file is mounted on my local machine. Also now my app needs he info about where the actual dmg file is present like its path on the removable storage device. Is this possible and if so how do i find out the path of the dmg file from which the volume is mounted. Thanks
