There is a lot of debate as to what is best to use. You can store the data a lot of ways, and they all make someone happy - custom attributes will of course not validate if you use XHTML, and using classes to store one or two bits of data is clumsy at best and only gets worse with the amount of things you want to know. Personally, not only am I not a big fan of XHTML, I am also not much of a validation nazi, so I recommend going with the custom attributes. There is, however, an option that reconciles custom attributes with standards: data- attributes. As John Resig (the author of jQuery) writes about in his blog , this is a new attribute being introduced in HTML5 that allows you to specify custom data attributes with the data- prefix. So a perfectly valid element might look like this: Paolo Bergantino This has the upside that while you are still using custom attributes which may be bad if you are using XHTML, your code is going to age very well as this is the way that we will be storing data related to a particular item in the future.
