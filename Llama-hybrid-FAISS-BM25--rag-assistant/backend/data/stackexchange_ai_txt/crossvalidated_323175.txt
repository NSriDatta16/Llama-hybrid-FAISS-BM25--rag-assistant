In my opinion, this is weird because if you plot the time series together, you can see that they are very correlated in january. This is not weird. The mutual information in not mutual correlation, it is the mutual entropy. So for 100% correlated data with zero entropy the mutual information will also be zero. See my detailed answer with examples. I though that the mutual information was dropping because the entropy was dropping, so I divided the mutual information by the entropy to remove that effect. However, I still get the same result. This is indeed strange, but difficult to explain without seeing an example with your actual data.
