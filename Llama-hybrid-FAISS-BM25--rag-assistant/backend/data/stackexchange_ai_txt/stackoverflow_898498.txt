How can I reset the NSUserDefaults data in the iPhone simulator?

I've added NSUserDefaults data retrieval to my app, which is pretty nice. But for testing I would like to reset all the data I added to the defaults database, so that everything is in the state when the user launches the app the first time. I tried to call: [NSUserDefaults resetStandardUserDefaults]; but that doesn't do anything. The defaults are still saved and can be retrieved.
