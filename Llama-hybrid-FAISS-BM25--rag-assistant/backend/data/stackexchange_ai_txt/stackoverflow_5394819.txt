A few answers 1. Basically the same for a managed project except that the Reg entries point to the .MANIFEST file, which in turn identifies the dll of the addin assembly. Ohhh. this is a LONG story, there's lots of info on the web about it. Google "registering an addin for all users". Short version is that it's possible, but requires some really weird and difficult to explain registry shinanigans. If you've created an Outlook addin property, then by virtue of that project type, VS knows what to do on start. I've never found a good definitive source for vsto material. Google's been my best friend for that kind of info. Andrew Coates has a pretty decent list here though http://blogs.msdn.com/b/acoat/archive/2007/08/02/vsto-resources.aspx
