How to learn a language that has very little coverage?

I recently came across the Kogut language , and was interested by it. However, the only website to gain information from is the sourceforge page that hosts the project. I had no idea how to even attempt to look at the language in more depth. So what I'm asking is, has anyone here learnt a language that doesn't have the thousands of resources that Ruby, Python etc. have? What would be the best method to do so?
