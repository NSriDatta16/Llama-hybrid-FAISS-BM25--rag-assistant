It might be worth looking at one-class-SVM, which attempts to construct the smallest hypersphere that encloses as large a proportion of the data as possible, which has been used successfully in the machine learning community for novelty detection, so its use for outlier detection seems reasonable. I suspect there are non-linear versions (being a kernel method), which means that the sphere in the kernel-induced feature space corresponds to the exterior of the manifold containing the data in the attribute space, which doesn't necessarily have to be hyper-spherical. Caveat: I've seen this method described in conference and journal papers, but have not used it in anger myself, so your mileage may vary, but probably worth looking into.
