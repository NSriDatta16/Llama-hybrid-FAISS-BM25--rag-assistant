Most major games are written in C++. This does not mean that you have to use C++. For indy games you can also consider C# with XNA if you're more familiar with that (or want to play your eventual creations on your xbox 360 relatively easily). XNA also has the benefit of being free. GarageGames also makes a relatively well-respected series of games engines (which are not free, but are very affordable compared to most), including one which adds the standard capabilities to XNA so you don't have to write it all from scratch. MPelletier's advice is good, though. Game development is very complex, and even a simple game is a huge undertaking. Get a good grasp on the basics first, and I'd strongly suggest starting out with 2-D games.
