Bulk reads using Berkeley DB, C++ STL interface

I'm using the C++ STL API to Berkeley DB 4.8, and I'm able to use bulk retrieval for a db_map or db_multimap const iterator created using begin(), but not one created from find() (or lower_bound() for multimaps). I appreciate for single item random access uses of find() would be a waste to use bulk retrieval, but I want to access many records in btree order from my find() point forwards, so bulk retrieval would help me. The underlying C++ api appears to allow it, is it possible from the STl API?
