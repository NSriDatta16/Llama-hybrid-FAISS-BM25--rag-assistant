I do not know django, although have some experiences with python. I heard nice things about it, but I will mention rails related hosting/deployment options. capistrano - if you want to deploy manually on your own server/VPS, this is a way to go. It might take some time, you have to learn and understand capistrano. There are several resources for this (i.e. peepcode , railscasts , ..) heroku - are you familiar with git ? If you are, heroku is a super elegant way to deploy your rails application by git. If you have a mini application, like a personal blog or a presentation, than you can use it for free! google app engine - personally I did not use, even not try it so far. But some guys recommend it. You can run your rails application on JRuby. Although it is not strictly rails related, if talking about deployment, chef should be mentioned. Chef is written in ruby. It is tool for bootstrapping and managing servers on various providers. If you are beginning with rails, check out chef later. I would recommend you to start with Heroku if you choose rails.
