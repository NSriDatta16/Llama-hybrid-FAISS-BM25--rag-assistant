In principle what Tim says; however, there are two subtleties a) Given that your parameter estimates are distributions, what's your definition of "residual"? To get a "point" residual, you could take the model predictions at the MAP or the posterior mean, or else you evaluate the entire posterior (then, your residual is a distribution though). Alternatively, you can calculate quantile residuals from posterior predictive simulations, which creates a point-residual accounting for the posterior uncertainty. b) The second point is the influence of the priors - if priors dominate, you could force your model to have pretty much any residual distribution.
