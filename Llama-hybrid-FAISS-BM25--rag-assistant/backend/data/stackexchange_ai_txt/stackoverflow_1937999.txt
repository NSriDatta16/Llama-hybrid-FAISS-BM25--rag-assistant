To the best of my knowledge, there is not built-in way to get that. I'd recommend trying SimpleDOM , which is a PHP class extending SimpleXMLElement that offers convenience methods for most of the common problems. include 'SimpleDOM.php'; $qa = simpledom_load_string( ' Who are you? Who who, who who , me ' ); echo $qa->answer->innerXML(); Otherwise, I see two ways of doing that. The first would be to convert your SimpleXMLElement to a DOMNode then loop over its childNodes to build the XML. The other would be to call asXML() then use string functions to remove the root node. Attention though, asXML() may sometimes return markup that is actually outside of the node it was called from, such as XML prolog or Processing Instructions.
