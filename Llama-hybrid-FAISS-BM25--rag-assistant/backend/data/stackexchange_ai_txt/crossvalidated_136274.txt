Leave-One-Subject-Out cv method

I would like to use a Leave-One-Subject-Out cv on my datasets (I have dataset including 38, 15, 10 participants, respectively). I don't know the hyperparamenters C and gamma of my SVM so I have to estimate them with a cv grid search approach. Someone could explain me step by step how I can do all these thing? That is, how I have to divide the subjects to estimate the hyper parameters, to train the model and finally to test it? I need to do a SVM for each subject?
