array_map/array_walk keeps reporting invalid callback, not found, and/or undefined

I just wanted a more elegant automated solution to my form validation. On PHP.net I found a cool class script from the SQL injection page. Here it is the code (modified). It's suppose to go through my $_POST array and apply the validation function. class secure { function secureSuperGlobalPOST($v) { $_POST[$v] = htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($_POST[$v])); $_POST[$v] = str_ireplace("script", "blocked", $_POST[$v]); $_POST[$v] = mysql_escape_string($_POST[$v]); return $_POST[$v]; } function secureGlobals() { // This was originally array_walk; I'm just trying to figure out what's up... array_map('secureSuperGlobalPOST', $_POST); } } // This last line is attempt at using it. This was not provided with the code. secure::secureGlobals(); So then I get this error: _"Warning: array_map() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, function 'secureSuperGlobalPOST' not found or invalid function name in C:\wamp\www\mysite\register.php on line 19"_ I have been looking forever, but I cannot figure out why it wouldn't be valid, not found (it's in the same class), or why it would be invalid name (it's the same exact name!).
