I presume that the map contains the association between the word and the number of occurences. In this case, why do you say you have such a significant memory consumption? How many distinct words and forms could you have and what is the average memory consumption for one word? Considering 1.000.000 words, with 1K memory consumption per word (that includes the word text, the QMap specific storage), that would lead to (aprox) 1GB of memory, which... doesn't seem so much to me.
