muksie's answer already contains very useful advice. If don't want to write the HTML file yourself or want something a little fancier you could use a small script I wrote for the MDP library. This basically allows you to just do: import slideshow slideshow.show_image_slideshow(filenames, image_size=(80,60)) This will create an HTML slideshow and open it in your browser. You can grab just the needed files here (only templet.py and the two slideshow files are needed), which might be better for you than getting the full library.
