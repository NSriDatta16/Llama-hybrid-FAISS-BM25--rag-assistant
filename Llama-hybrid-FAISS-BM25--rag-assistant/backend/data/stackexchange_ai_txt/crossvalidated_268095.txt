Which book would you recommend to test predictive power of statistical models

The title says it all. I'm interested in getting a better understand how to test the predictive power of your statistical models. As an example: Assuming you want to model a certain relationship with regression and test how it behaves to predict future values how do you go about it in a sound statistical sense? How about for more complicated models, like in machine learning or time series analysis? Is there a book with the foundation of such question or at least covering certain parts of it.
