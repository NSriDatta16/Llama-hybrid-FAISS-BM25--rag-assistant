One of the usual idioms for reading unknown-size inputs is to read a chunk of known size inside a loop, check for the presence of more input (i.e. verify that you are not at the end of the line/file/region of interest), and extend the size of your buffer. While the getline primitives may be appropriate for you, this is a very general pattern for many tasks in languages where allocation of storage is left up to the programmer.
