The main effects went from "significant" to "not", but the evidence really didn't change all that much. For example, p=0.047 to p=0.063 for rok isn't, to me, a remarkable change. And a lack of evidence for a coefficient being non-zero isn't the same as saying it is 0. In considering the coefficient for obdobinehn when the interaction is included, you need to pay careful attention to the factor contrasts that are being used, as the meaning of the coefficient changes and depends on those contrasts. Note also that if a covariate is involved in an important interaction, then it does have an effect on the outcome, even if it shows no main effect. I agree with John's comment that it's useful, with factor covariates, to look at an ANOVA table.
