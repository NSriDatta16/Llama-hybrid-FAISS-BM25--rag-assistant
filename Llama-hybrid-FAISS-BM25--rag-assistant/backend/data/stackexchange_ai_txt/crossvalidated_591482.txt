Positivity, Causal Inference and Machine Learning methods

I ran into a problem where the predicted probabilities of being treatment/control from a machine learning model (the XGB model) matches the actual outcome almost exactly and have area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9999. On the other hand, the logistic regression achieved an AUC of 0.5. However, I cannot use the greedy matching algorithm to find any matches for the treatment if I use the XGB propensity scores. One of the earlier posts here mentioned this problem: How to use propensity scores that exhibit separation . So my question is: in order for the matching algorithm to work, do we have to give up the better machine learning prediction model for an inferior logistic regression? This seems a little counterintuitive.
