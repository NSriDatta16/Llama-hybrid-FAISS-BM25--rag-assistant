*nix configuration file storage convention?

Might be a candidate for SuperUser, but thought I'd try here first as the question came up for a programming project. Is there a *nix (targeting Solaris, Linux, and OS X) convention for where system-wide (updateable by all users) configuration information should be stored by an application?
