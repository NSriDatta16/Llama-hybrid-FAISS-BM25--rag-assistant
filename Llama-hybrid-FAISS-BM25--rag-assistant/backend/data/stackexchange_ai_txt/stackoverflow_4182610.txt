Ideal data structure with OpenMP

What is an ideal data structure in parallel programing, in my case OpenMP. #pragma omp parallel for for(int i = 0; i In this example it might be simple if we use a table of similar size. What is a more general data structure for shared-memory parallel programing in C++?
