Relationships between t distributions and normal distributions

In Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis : The t distribution is the marginal posterior distribution for the normal mean with unknown variance and conjugate prior distribution and can be interpreted as a mixture of normals with common mean and variances that follow an inverse-gamma distribution. What precisely (in terms of mathematical formulas) does it mean by "the t distribution is the marginal posterior distribution for the normal mean with unknown variance"? In the table on Wikipedia , I didn't find that the t distribution is a conjugate prior distribution for a normal distribution. So where does "conjugate prior distribution" come from?
