This is a different error than the more common problem of getting the cert wrong... Restore the phone (using the XCode Organizer to reload the latest OS), to be safe do not restore from backup when you sync with iTunes the first time (it'll still keep your number when you sync even if you don't use the backup). I've had to do this a very few times, the last one was when it was in the middle of deployment when I unhooked the phone from the cable (had to answer a call). Try the reboot (of the phone) first, hooking it up with XCode off. But if that does not solve things, restore is the way.
