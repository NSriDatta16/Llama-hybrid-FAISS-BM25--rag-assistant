How to flip bit fields in T-SQL?

I'm trying to flip a bit field in SQL Server using an update query, that is, I want to make all the 0's into 1's and vice versa. What's the most elegant solution? There doesn't seem to be a bitwise NOT operator in T-SQL (unless I'm missing something obvious) and I haven't been able to find any other way of performing the update.
