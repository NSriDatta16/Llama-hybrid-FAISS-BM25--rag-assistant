There is a third kind of storage and that is called static. Essentially, this is storage for data items within the runtime memory image of the excutable. It cannot be allocated or released, and it's lifetime is essentially that of the program. In C++, class static variables are stored in this area as are globals. In the old days, some processor architectures (particularly x86) used segmented addressing. In this case, static data would reside in the data segment. In order to access static data, you used an address relative to the segment base, which was in the DS or ES register. However, since at least the mid-1990s, OS architectures have gone to a flat memory model, where all segments coalign and cover the entire memory space. So data segments should not come up in any current interview question.
