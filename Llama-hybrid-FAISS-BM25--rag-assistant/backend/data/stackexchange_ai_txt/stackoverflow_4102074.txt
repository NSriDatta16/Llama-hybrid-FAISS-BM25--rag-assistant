My company did this using option "2", e.g. an agent (actually an MFC app) running on a machine with a card printer attached. The agent periodically checks an internet URL looking for new print jobs; print jobs are defined using scripts generated on the web server, the script includes details like mag stripe data to be encoded, user names/pictures and where to print them on the card stock, and so on. The agent posts back to the server after a successful print job. Posting back to the server is important because card printers tend to fail regularly. The big benefit to this approach is that multiple users can share a single printer so you don't need to buy a printer for each workstation where card registration occurs. Card printers can be fussy and require a lot maintenance, so it's easier to support a single printer. Another benefit is that you don't have to write plug-ins for all the browser platforms you want to support. Finally, it lets users with Linux/MacOS print cards using the system (as long as they are willing to setup a windows machine to drive the printer.)
