Recommended papers for deep learning based classification?

I'm working on a project where I have to build a classifier using Deep Neural Networks and I will be dealing with big data. I am familiar with neural networks, yet not an expert. I can obviously find a huge amount of literature online regarding deep learning but mostly will be convnets related. Are there any good research papers for DNN-based classifiers or should I just stack more layers? I want to get some insight about the architecture and training process. P.S: Using Deep Neural Networks is mandatory even if the accuracy is low, but it would be great if it worked out.
