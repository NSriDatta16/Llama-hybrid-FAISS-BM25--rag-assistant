python- execution time problem

I'm able to go through the first function....but the second func is not running....getaction def registerInitialState(self, state): """ This is the first time that the agent sees the layout of the game board. Here, we choose a path to the goal. In this phase, the agent should compute the path to the goal and store it in a local variable. All of the work is done in this method! state: a GameState object (pacman.py) """ if self.searchFunction == None: raise Exception, "No search function provided for SearchAgent" starttime = time.time() problem = self.searchType(state) # Makes a new search problem self.actions = self.searchFunction(problem) # Find a path totalCost = problem.getCostOfActions(self.actions) print('Path found with total cost of %d in %.1f seconds' % (totalCost, time.time() - starttime)) if '_expanded' in dir(problem): print('Search nodes expanded: %d' % problem._expanded) def getAction(self, state): """ Returns the next action in the path chosen earlier (in registerInitialState). Return Directions.STOP if there is no further action to take. state: a GameState object (pacman.py) """ if 'actionIndex' not in dir(self): self.actionIndex = 0 i = self.actionIndex self.actionIndex += 1 if i this is my function:when i execute, it shud give me the value of node but instead of it, it is giving me error. The value of i = 0 in the get action function. I dont know, why it is not incrementing. while stack.isEmpty()!= 0: node = stack.pop() print node Error: (5, 5) Path found with total cost of 999999 in 0.0 seconds Search nodes expanded: 1 None
