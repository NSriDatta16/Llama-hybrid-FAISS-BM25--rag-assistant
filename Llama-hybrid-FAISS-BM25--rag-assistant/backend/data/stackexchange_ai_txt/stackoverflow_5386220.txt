After a long tracing into the code and data, I found the obstacle which somehow bugging me out. There was a change in a master data which now has longger character (varchar). In my procedure it was put into a smaller size of varchar, let say 10 character. While new string its about 15. Here goes the error ...or string truncation.... . But anyway thanks of your attention to my problem and thanks for the clues you wrote, it save me somehow, give me the idea to trace it up. Thx a bunch,
