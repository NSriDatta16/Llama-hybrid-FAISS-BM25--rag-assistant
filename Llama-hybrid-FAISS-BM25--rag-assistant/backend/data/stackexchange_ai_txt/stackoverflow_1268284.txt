cannot load custom tooltips in silverlight

I have created a custoom tooltip for a lineseries chart. however my problem is that this custom tooltip is never loaded..(I still get the default tooltip i.e. X-value) Is there something I should be doing differently?? page.xaml page.xaml.cs (creating and binding) ... lineSeries = new LineSeries() { ItemsSource = storageInfo, DependentValueBinding = new Binding(dependentValueString), IndependentValueBinding = new Binding("CollectionDatek__BackingField"), }; } ... Thanks for your help... Ron..
