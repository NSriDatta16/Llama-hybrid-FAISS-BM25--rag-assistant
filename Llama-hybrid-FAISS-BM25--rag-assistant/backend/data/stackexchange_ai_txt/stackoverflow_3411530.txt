Loop doesn't terminate upon checking a condition

This loop does not terminate after I type x. I'm really new to Ruby, and so far, it is so much different than what I learned before - quite interesting, total = 0 i = 0 while ((number = gets) != "x") total += number.to_i i += 1 end puts "\nAverage: " + (total / i).to_s Any help is greatly appreciated.
