When plotting your data, you want to show as much detail as possible, including the individual patients. So create a before-after graph , where each patient is shown as two connected points. A paired t-test tests the null hypothesis that the difference between before and after measurements, on average, is zero. It is the same as a one-sample t-test on the set of differences , with a null hypothesis of zero difference. Your second graph plots *relative change", which seems to be the ratio (not the differences) of the two values. To answer your question: No, a paired t-test on the raw data is not the same as a one-sample test on the set of ratios. It is the same as a one-sample test on the set of differences. If you care about the ratios, one way to do analyze the data is to take the logarithm of all the values, and then run the paired t-test on the set of logarithms. The difference between log(values) is the same as the log(ratio). A final note. Before getting immersed in statistical analyses, look at the big picture. Your graph shows that a huge fraction of the patients have an increase and a huge fraction have a decrease. You may be able to show statistically that the excess of increases is unlikely to be by chance. But the big picture is many go up, many go down. Not sure what conclusions you'll be able to draw.
