Probability of a random outcome given a sample size

Say you gave an IQ test to a random sample of $n$ people, but instead of having the actual test results, you have only the normalized data for this sample (mean=0, $\sigma$=1). What is the probability that person $A$ is in the top 5% of the total population (1.64 standard deviations above mean), given that their normalized IQ score $S$ is $X$ standard deviations above the sample mean? I'm approaching that question from a Bayesian perspective (which is new to me), so I define it as: $$ P(A>1.64 | S=X)= \frac{P(S=X|A>1.64) \times 0.05}{P(S=X|A>1.64) \times 0.05 + P(S=X|A The probabilities I'm after are: $P(S=X|A>1.64)$ and $P(S=X|A I'm trying to use frequentist statistics to determine probability of a sampling error in the sample population. For example: For $X>1.64$, $P(S=X|A Is this the right approach? And if so, how would you determine the same probability for $X Here are my calculations for the probability of the mean and standard deviation being wrong: mean: $$ \mu = X - 1.64, x = 0, \sigma=1 \\ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \\ z = \frac{1.64 - X}{n^\frac{1}{2}} $$ standard deviation: $$ df = n - 1, \sigma = 1.64 - X, s = 1 \\ z = \frac{(n-1) \times s^2}{\sigma^2} \\ z = \frac{n - 1}{(1.64 - X)^2} $$
