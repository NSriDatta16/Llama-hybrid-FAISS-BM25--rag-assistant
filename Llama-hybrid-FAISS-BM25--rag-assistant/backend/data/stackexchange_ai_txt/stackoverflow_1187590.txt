Having the nullable text column in a separate table would be better in many ways 1) It will not be nullable if moved to a separate table 2) It is semantically more elegant 3) Joining back will not be inefficient as you will be joining on the PK of the parent table and that will use a hash join in all probability. 4) It will be extensible if you decide to have more such optional columns with each application in the future. You could look at a design similar to the following: Application(app#, date,...) Application_Attachments(app#, text_col1)
