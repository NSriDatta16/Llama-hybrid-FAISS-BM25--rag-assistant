Magento - Using alternative "reviews count" on category list page

I noticed that on the category list page, the number of reviews (pulled from frontend/base/default/template/review/helper/summary_short.phtml ) lists the full amount of reviews for an item, not the amount available to the store view youâ€™re on. So, for example (using the sample data) the Samsung MM-A900M Ace has 5 reviews - however, when you click that link and are taken to the reviews page, it actually just has 2 (as only 2 are available to the English view). But on the reviews page, the review count is correct and says 2 reviews (this time pulled from frontend/base/default/template/review/product/view/count.phtml ). Is there any way to use this review count on the category list?
