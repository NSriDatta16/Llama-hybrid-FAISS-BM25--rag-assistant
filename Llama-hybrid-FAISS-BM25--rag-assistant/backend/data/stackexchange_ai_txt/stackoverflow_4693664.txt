Silverlight: Drag multiple rows from a datagrid

I am working on an app where the user needs to be able to drag items from a datagrid onto a button (this then fires some data updates). After some messing around, I have this working quite well. I have used the DataGridDragDropTarget controls from the toolkit for this. I now need to allow the user drag multiple rows at once. While the datagrid allows me to select multiple rows, the DataGridDragDropTarget will only drag the first of the selections. It looks like the DataGridDragDropTarget is not built for multiple dragging. Would be grateful for any help on this one, this is the first time I have posted on SO - and hoping you guys can come through for me. Thanks all.
