I work on Pattern Recognition problems. Let me please to give you some advices if you plan to work effectively on SVM/ANN problems and if you realy don't have access to a computer cluster: 1) Don't use Matlab. Use Python and its large number of numerical libraries instead for Visualisation/Analysis of your computations. 2) Critical sections better to implement using C. You can integrate them then with your Python scripts very easy . 3) CUDA/GPU is not a solution if you mostly deal with non-polinomial time complexity problems which is typical in Machine Learning, so it brings no great speed-up; dot/matrix products are only a tiny part of SVM calculations - you still will have to deal with feature extractions and lists/objects processing, try instead to optimize your algorithms and devise effective algorithmic methods. If you need parallelism (e.g. for ANNs), use threads or processes. 4) Use GCC compiler to compile your C program - it will build the very fast executable code. To speed-up numerical computations you can try GCC optimization flags (e.g. Streaming SIMD Extensions) 5) Run your program on any modern CPU under Linux OS. For realy good performance, use Linux clusters.
