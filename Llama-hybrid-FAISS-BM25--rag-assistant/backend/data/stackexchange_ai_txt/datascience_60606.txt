Value function and Q-value

I am new to Reinforcement Learning, and I am having trouble understanding the difference between Value function and Q-value Here is my current understanding: Q-value is just a value for a particular action taken, and the Value function of a state sums over the Q-value of every action possible in that state. Would this description be accurate? Thanks!
