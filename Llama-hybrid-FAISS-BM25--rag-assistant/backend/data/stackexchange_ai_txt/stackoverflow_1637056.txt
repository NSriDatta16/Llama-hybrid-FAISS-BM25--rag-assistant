Encountering display errors while using UIViewAnimationTransitionFlip

I have 2 views, one login and another home. On clicking the signin button in my login view, on successful login, the user is redirected to the home view. Flip transition is implemented to acheive this. The problem is after the flip has occured, the home view layout is not displayed correctly. The view seems to drag itself above a little, leaving some white space at the bottom of the home view, i.e the home view contents do not fit correctly after the flip. Here is the method which is called on successful login: -(void)displayHome { if (loginController == nil) { [self loadhome]; } [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1]; [UIView setAnimationTransition:UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromRight forView:self.view cache:YES]; [homeController viewWillAppear:YES]; [loginController viewWillDisappear:YES]; [loginController.view removeFromSuperview]; [self.view addSubview:homeController.view]; [loginController viewDidDisappear:YES]; [homeController viewDidAppear:YES]; [UIView commitAnimations]; } -(void)loadhome { HomeController *hm = [[HomeController alloc]initWithNibName:@"Home" bundle:nil]; self.homeController = hm; [hm release]; } Any ideas on how to display the view contents correctly? Thanks
