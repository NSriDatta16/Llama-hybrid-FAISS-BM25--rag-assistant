Take a look at Quince for some UI (they call it UX) inspiration. Search for hierarchical. Examples include patterns such as Cascading Lists and TreeMap. From those, you can click the "related" button to see even more ideas. UPDATE: 2014-Sep-21, Sad news from Infragistics: "Quince Pro - We are officially retiring this product." More on their blog under "Product Status Change Notifications". I hope they retain it for a while as reference!
