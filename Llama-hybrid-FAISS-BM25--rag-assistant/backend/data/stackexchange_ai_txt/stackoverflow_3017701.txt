Rare Event Detection

Is there any good reference to Algorithms that people use for rare event detection ? Also, How is the time factor taken into account ? If i have a case where successive data points tell something (t_1 to t_n) , How can one factor this into normal Machine learning scenario ? Any pointer will be appreciated.
