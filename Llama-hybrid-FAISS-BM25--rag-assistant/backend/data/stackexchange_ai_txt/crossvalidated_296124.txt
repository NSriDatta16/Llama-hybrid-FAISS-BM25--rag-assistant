I don't know of any such technique to encode this prior, but also, I want to claim that it isn't necessary. In linear regression, a high amount of covariance between input features is sometimes indicative of multi-collinearity, which can cause numerical issues (especially when inverting matrices), but this problem doesn't carry over to neural networks, because they are trained in an entirely different way. Other than that, there really is no need to encode this information into the model -- it wouldn't help performance. If you really wanted to, I suppose you could apply PCA to the inputs before sending them through the network, which would severely reduce the amount of covariance between input features. However, in the literature, this rarely helps the performance of a model.
