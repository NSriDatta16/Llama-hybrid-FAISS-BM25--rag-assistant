The OP started with odds ratios and I assume a logit link best fits the data (log links are unlikely to fit as well in general because they require constraints to keep probabilities legal). Once you recognize that risk ratios are covariate-dependent (covariate-specific) it's easy. Just pick settings for all the covariates except for the one you are changing, let the one change, computed estimated risks directly from the logistic model, and take ratios. Getting uncertainties is the only hard part. For Bayesian models, posterior intervals for covariate-specific risk ratios may be computed exactly from the posterior draws of the underlying log-odds-scale parameters. In the frequentist domain you could use the bootstrap or the $\delta$ method. The OP started with the no-covariate case but it's best to learn more general methods IMHO. For one thing there is likely to be risk heterogeneity due to baseline variable distributions, and simple ratios were intended only for the homogeneous case.
