How can I make a custom class be displayed in MainWindow.xib?

I created a custom class that inherits from UIView and I want to display an instance on the screen. However, when I try to link the outlet from the App Delegate to the object I dragged onto the screen (which is that custom class I created) the link cannot be created. What am I missing?
