Is there a drag-and-drop form designer that could be easily customized for any widget framework?

As far as I know, right now there is no free (not even cheap) visual designer for making AS3 apps. It's not like it is not possible to create one - just like I can write the GUI definition code in FlashDevelop we could have this hypothetical tool generate it based on drag and drop actions, but at present nobody has built one yet. So suppose we wanted to build such a tool for AS3 widgets or for some others such buttons and text boxes widget framework. Is there a generic form builder tool that we could customize for this purpose? Or would basically the only (barely) customizable thing on the table be the forms designer component from .net framework? It could hypothetically be beaten into representing the AS3 etc framework widgets as user defined controls with us running a separate tool to automatically convert the C# form definition code into the target framework language, e.g. into runnable AS3 apps?
