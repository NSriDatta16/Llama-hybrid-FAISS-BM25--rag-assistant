Why do you want to make it ordinal? Ordinal independent variables are hard to deal with. (Ordinal logistic regression can be a good option when the dependent variable is ordinal). You apparently have an average (or other combination) of some Likert items. Since you were willing to take their average, you are treating them as continuous. You can then treat the average as continuous. And that's what I would do.
