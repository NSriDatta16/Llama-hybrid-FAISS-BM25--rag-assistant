Where do Kohonen and counterpropagation networks fall in the scheme of neural network architectures?

This site sums up various neural network architectures, which fall into broader categories listed below: feed-forward networks (don't form cycles) recurrent networks (have directed cycles) symmetrically connected networks Then, specific types of neural networks are listed: perceptron convolutional recurrent long/short term memory Hopfield Boltzmann machine deep belief autoencoder I have not found where Kohonen (now more commonly referred to as self-organizing maps) and counterpropagation networks (multi-layer Kohonen networks) fit into this scheme in this or other literature. They used to be more commonly used in the 1980s and 1990s but I am not sure where they fall in the categorization of neural nets.
