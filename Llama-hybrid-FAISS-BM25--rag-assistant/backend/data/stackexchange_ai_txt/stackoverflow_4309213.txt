The trick is to not actually disable the checkbox but intercept the click action of the "disabled" textbox so it functions as if it was disabled from that point you can style it and it will look how you want. What you will do is add this on your "disabled" checkboxes instead of disabled="disabled": onclick="return false;" EDIT: As someone noted below there is a drawback to using this method. The value of the checkbox will still be posted back to the server since it is technically enabled whereas if you used the supported method you would lose control over the look but wouldn't have to deal with this additional data. (Thanks Robert)
