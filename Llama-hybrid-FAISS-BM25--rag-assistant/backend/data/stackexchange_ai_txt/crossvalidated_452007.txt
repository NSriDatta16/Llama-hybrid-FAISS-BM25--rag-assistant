This comes down to hypothesis testing the intercept of a simple linear regression: $y=\alpha+\beta x$ . If you test $H_0: \alpha=0$ versus $H_a: \alpha \ne 0$ , you can say if the $\alpha$ is significantly different from 0. However, it matters if that is a positive or negative difference, so you would pay attention to whether or not the calculated $\alpha$ value is positive or negative. If the p-value is significant, and the calculated $\alpha>0$ , the manager is outperforming passive investment. If the p-value is significant, and the calculated $\alpha , the manager is underperforming passive investment. If all you want to know is if the manager is outperforming passive investment, you can do a one-sided test of $H_0: \alpha=0$ versus $H_a: \alpha >0$ . EDIT You don’t want to do the usual F-test in this case, as that will test the slope, not the intercept. That is, the “F-test” output of a typical software, say R, will not give you information about the intercept.
