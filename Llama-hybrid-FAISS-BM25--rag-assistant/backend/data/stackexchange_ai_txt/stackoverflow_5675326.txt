Should I check for a element on a page before calling the Jquery plugin or call it and allow it to fail if not there

I have recently been wondering what would be the most friendly/efficient way to use plugins that have been bundled together to leverage caching. Are plugins are tied to HTML modules that are used sporadically in the site and have been called by using this kind of pattern: if($('.moduleClass').length) { $('.moduleClass').modulePlugin(); } So we check for the module before we call the plugin. I have been wondering if this is the best solution or should I just be allowing jQuery to handle the fail if the browser doesn't find the element. $('.moduleClass').modulePlugin(); Any idea, thoughts and experiences would be greatly received. Thanks, Ad
