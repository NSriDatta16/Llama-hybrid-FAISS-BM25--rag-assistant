Estimates diverging using continuous probabilities in logistic regression

When using a binomial family, logit link for GLM (or GEE in my case), I notice that my model estimates diverge when my response variables (which are continuous probabilities with range 0 to 1) include 0 or 1 (or 0 Question: Why does this happen? When running a logistic regression model (with 0 I suspect the following: say I have observations 0 Secondary question: If I exclude observations that are 0 or 1 in order to fit my models, am I biasing my results? Here's an example: my response variable is graduation rate expressed as a percentage. For the logistic regression models, there are apparently schools that have 100% graduation rate (seen as a 1 in my dataset). Would it be a valid strategy to drop these schools from the model, and what are the implications in interpretation? Is this akin to dropping outliers willy-nilly?
