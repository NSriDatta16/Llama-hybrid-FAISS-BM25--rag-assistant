How to find the dominant/most common color in an image?

I'm looking for a way to find the most dominant color/tone in an image using python. Either the average shade or the most common out of RGB will do. I've looked at the Python Imaging library, and could not find anything relating to what I was looking for in their manual, and also briefly at VTK. I did however find a PHP script which does what I need, here (login required to download). The script seems to resize the image to 150*150, to bring out the dominant colors. However, after that, I am fairly lost. I did consider writing something that would resize the image to a small size then check every other pixel or so for it's image, though I imagine this would be very inefficient (though implementing this idea as a C python module might be an idea). However, after all of that, I am still stumped. Is there an easy, efficient way to find the dominant color in an image?
