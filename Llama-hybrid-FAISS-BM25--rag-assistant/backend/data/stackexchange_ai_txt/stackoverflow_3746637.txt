A Code Signing certificate is not for verifying that the code has not changed since the certificate was issued, it's to verify that the code has not changed since the code was "signed". Big difference. A specific certificate is not tied to a particular piece of work, nor to a version of that work. It is tied to an identity. The OTHER purpose of a code signing certificate is to verify the identity of the organization that signed it. It is to verify that the application actually came from a verified person/organization, so you know you can trust it. So when you sign some code you are letting the user know that it is YOU that is providing that code and that the code has not changed since you signed it. That means that there is no reason that you could not use the same certificate to sign multiple versions of multiple applications, because it is your organizations identity that you are verifying. Also, it is actually important that you use the same certificate for an update as you do for the previous version or you can break the application. Changing an applications certificate has a bit of a process to it. Certificates do expire after a time, so you will need to update the certificates once-in-a-while. Hope this helps.
