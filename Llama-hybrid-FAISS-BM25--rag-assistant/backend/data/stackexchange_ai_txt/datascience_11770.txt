Reverse classification model: Is it possible?

Assuming I am having the following data: +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | output| +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ | 0.1 | 0.7 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 1 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ | 0.4 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ | 0.3 | 0.7 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 1 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ . . And I am training the data with logistic regression or another classifier. Is there a way to say 'I want an example that outputs 1'? Or is there a way to 'formulate' the 'borders' of the labels?
