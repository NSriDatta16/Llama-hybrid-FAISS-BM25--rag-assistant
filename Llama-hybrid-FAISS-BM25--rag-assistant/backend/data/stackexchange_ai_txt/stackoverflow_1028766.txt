"rescue in const_missing" error with Ruby 1.9.1, Rails 2.3.2, and jrails 0.4

I recently started a project where the team decided we'd like to use jQuery rather than Prototype/Scriptaculous for our javascript needs. We set our project up, and began the switch. The plugin was installed via these instructions , and all went according to plan. Shortly after, when trying to run "./script/server", we get the following error: => Rails 2.3.2 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000 /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:105:in `rescue in const_missing': uninitialized constant ActionView::Helpers::JavaScriptElementProxy::ActionView (NameError) from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:94:in `const_missing' from /home/company/Development/project/vendor/plugins/jrails/lib/jrails.rb:229:in ` ' from /home/company/Development/project/vendor/plugins/jrails/lib/jrails.rb:226:in ` ' from /home/company/Development/project/vendor/plugins/jrails/lib/jrails.rb:2:in ` ' from /home/company/Development/project/vendor/plugins/jrails/lib/jrails.rb:1:in ` ' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `block in require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:521:in `new_constants_in' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `require' from /home/company/Development/project/vendor/plugins/jrails/init.rb:6:in `block in evaluate_init_rb' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin.rb:146:in `eval' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin.rb:146:in `block in evaluate_init_rb' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/core_ext/kernel/reporting.rb:11:in `silence_warnings' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin.rb:142:in `evaluate_init_rb' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin.rb:48:in `load' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin/loader.rb:38:in `block in load_plugins' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin/loader.rb:37:in `each' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/rails/plugin/loader.rb:37:in `load_plugins' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/initializer.rb:348:in `load_plugins' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/initializer.rb:163:in `process' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/initializer.rb:113:in `run' from /home/company/Development/project/config/environment.rb:9:in ` ' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `block in require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:521:in `new_constants_in' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-2.3.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:156:in `require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rails-2.3.2/lib/commands/server.rb:84:in ` ' from script/server:3:in `require' from script/server:3:in ` ' I've done exensive searching, and can't find the reason for this error, or any documentation regarding version compatibility issues.
