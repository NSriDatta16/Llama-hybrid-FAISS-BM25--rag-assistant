Better structure for Looking up booleans for an index?

This is a bit nitpicking and I might have overlooked something simple Sometimes I have some integers and have to be able to lookup whether they're true or false. I've always solved this by using an Dictionary , inserting a true and just using ContainsKey to see if something is true (it's false by default.) But it doesn't seem like an elegant solution to insert a bool that isn't even used :) What's structure would you recommend for this? Lookup performance being primary and insertions secondary (but important) Some nice (LINQ) syntax for having a bunch of indices and returning items that are not contained would be a bonus
