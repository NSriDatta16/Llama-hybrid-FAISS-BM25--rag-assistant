The VC question I'd prepare for is: "how are you going to hire personnel for that?" My personal experience that the hiring situation (both quantity and quality) for a language is often more important than the language features themselves. Also be careful to defend your position with solutions that require even more skill, like embedding interpreters, multilingual projects, changes of runtimes etc. This because, again, skilled personnel is the bottleneck. P.s. personally I reject all non native GUIs. So I hated Java for quite some time too. But I guess that doesn't apply when used for prototyping.
