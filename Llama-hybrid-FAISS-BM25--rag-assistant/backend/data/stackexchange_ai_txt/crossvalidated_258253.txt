Yes. PLS-DA is basically PLS regression where Y consists of categorical variables. Here is an example of Y matrix with 3 groups each consists of 2 samples (the first row is headers and is not involved in calculations). After applying PLS-DA you can obtain a BETA matrix (if you are using SIMPLS algorithm, for example) whose number of columns equals to the number of groups for 2+ groups. There are, however, few differences of PLS-DA from logistic regression and some other classification methods. The predicted Y values might get out of the 0 to 1 range. So you may find values such as 1.1 and -0.3 etc... Another property of PLS-DA is the sum of the predicted Y values in row is always equal to 1. Assigning predicted samples to a group can be done in several ways. The most common one is assignation of the sample to the group having the highest value. An alternative approach (Bayesian) is fitting a normal distribution to the predictions of the training set and finding the threshold that minimizes the classification error. The samples, then, can be assigned to the group whose threshold value is exceeded.
