Robert's answer is good, if the project is large though you'll be checking out a lot of content to get e single file. If you want to get an individual file from SCM, the Maven SCM API allows you to interact directly with an SCM repository to invoke arbitrary goals. In this related answer I provide an example of a custom Mojo that commits a single file, if you implement that mojo and change the command from add to checkout you'll avoid having to checkout the entire project.
