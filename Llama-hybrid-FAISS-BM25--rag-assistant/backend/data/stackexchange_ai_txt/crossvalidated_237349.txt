Why is $\pi$ used in logistic regression?

Why is $\pi$ used to denote probability in logistic regression? Rather than something that does not create confusion with the more common use of $\pi$ as the circumference of a circle or the specific number $3.14 ...$? Does using $\pi$ in logistic regression pertain some special meaning (like the more known $\pi=3.14...$) or is it just a symbol that has been chosen? It seems to be pretty widely used: http://www.google.com/search?q=logistic+regression+pi
