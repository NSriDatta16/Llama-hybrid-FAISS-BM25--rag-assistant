Spiked Covariance Model and PCA

Consider the spiked covariance model $Y_i\sim^{iid}N(\mu,\Sigma)$ , where $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n\in \mathbb{R}^p$ , $\Sigma=U\Lambda U^\top+\sigma^2 I_p$ be the eigendecomposition: $U\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times r}$ unknown matrix with orthonormal columns, $\Lambda$ is unknown matrix with nonincreasing diagonal entries, and $\sigma^2>0$ is unknown noise level. I'm curious about how do we estimate $U$ by using PCA? Is it true that $\hat{U}$ , the leading $r$ PC's, is the MLE of the matrix $U$ ? If so, how to show this? Thank you.
