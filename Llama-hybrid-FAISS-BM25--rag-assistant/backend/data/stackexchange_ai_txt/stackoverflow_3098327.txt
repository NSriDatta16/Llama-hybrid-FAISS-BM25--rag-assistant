If you pass a string to the select function , it tries to match it to the hash of the tab's anchor, you can see the code for that here . From the docs: Select a tab, as if it were clicked. The second argument is the zero-based index of the tab to be selected or the id selector of the panel the tab is associated with (the tab's href fragment identifier, e.g. hash, points to the panel's id). Instead you want the select by index, so it needs to not be a string. For that use parseInt() , like this: function pageLoad() { var loadTab = parseInt($("# ").val(), 10); $('#dvJqTabs').tabs( { selected: loadTab } ); }
