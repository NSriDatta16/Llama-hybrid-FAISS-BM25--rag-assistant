Standardizing data for neural network: High density at mean, large amount of outlier values

I have not been able to find much information on good practices for dealing with these two issues. The first is a high concentration around the mean, and the second is a large amount of values far away from the mean. First the input distribution shows a large number of values at zero. To normalize I simply computed the mean/std without the zeros included which I'm not sure is a good approach. I am running a convolutional neural net, so I don't think masking out the values is an option These are the values of the output distribution with the extreme concentration at and around zero (top values are clipped).
