How do I schedule one-time tasks from a Perl CGI application?

I am writing an application to allow users to schedule one-time long-running tasks from a web application (Linux/Apache/CGI::Application). To do this I use the Schedule::At module which is the Perl interface to the "at" command. Since the scheduled tasks are not repeating, I am not considering "cron". I have two issues with "at" though: Scheduling works fine when my CGI application runs under the suexec wrapper, but not when scheduled by the owner of the Apache process. How can I get scheduling to work in both environments (suexec and no-suexec)? It appears that the processes scheduled by "at" or Schedule::At have no failure reporting, and I sometimes find that scheduled tasks fail silently. Is there some way to log the fact that the scheduled task (not the scheduler itself) has failed to run? I am not fixed on "at" and am open to using other, more robust, scheduling methods if there are any. Thank you for your attention.
