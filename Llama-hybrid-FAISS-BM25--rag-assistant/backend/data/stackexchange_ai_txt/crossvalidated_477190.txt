The models use different ways to get the fixed-effect coefficient estimates, and it might help to think a bit differently about the interpretations of the coefficients in the two models. In general the estimates of fixed-effect coefficients won't agree in the two types of models. The simple linear regression model ignores all of the information about the clusters within the data and correlations of results within clusters. For estimating the intercept and slope, each data point is just equally weighted regardless of its associated cluster in a formula that has a closed form. Your mixed model estimates an intercept along with a Gaussian distribution of cluster-specific intercepts around it. So you might think of the intercept as a sort of average among clusters* rather than among the individual data points as in the simple linear regression. Your model specified a single slope with respect to condition for all clusters, but that now represents the condition-related change from the corresponding cluster-specific intercept. A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used to fit the model with these necessarily interdependent estimates, for which there is no closed-form solution. Your results show that the fixed-effect coefficients are similar but not identical, even in this simple model with 1 fixed and 1 random effect. *The distribution of cluster intercepts is forced to be Gaussian, so this "type of average" is not necessarily the same as the arithmetic average intercept among clusters.
