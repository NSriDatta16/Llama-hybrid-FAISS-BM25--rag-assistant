adding custom library with project

I have created one library with "Utility.h" file. I want to add that custom library to my another iPhone application. I have added the library to project "frameworks" and I have drag the library to "Library Search Path" it shows like "$(SRCROOT)/libUtility.a". I have imported the header file as #import "Utility.h". But I am getting below error message. Utility.h No such file or directory. Please any one help me to resolve this issues. What is my mistake.
