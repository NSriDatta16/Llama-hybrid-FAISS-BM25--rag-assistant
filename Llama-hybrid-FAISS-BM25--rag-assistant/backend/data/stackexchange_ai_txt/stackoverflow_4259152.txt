Problem in creating advanced profile in magento enterprise 1.9.0.0

Test conducted in Magento Enterprise version 1.9.0.0 First Problem When I try to create new profile under Advanced profile in admin and try to save it, I get following error: Fatal error: Call to undefined method Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget::getrowurl() in D:\wamp\www\ent\app\code\core\Mage\Adminhtml\Block\Widget\Grid.php on line 1583 As I started to drill down into the code and reach to app\code\core\Mage\Adminhtml\Block\Widget\Grid.php in line no. 1583, I have found following chunk of code (green color): class Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget { public function getRowUrl($item) { $res = parent::getRowUrl($item); return ($res ? $res : '#'); } } If you see $res = parent::getRowUrl($item); In the code, it instruct to run getRowUrl() function from its parent class i.e. Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget . Now when I search getRowUrl function in the widget class, it is not available there, even not in the parent class of Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget. I also tried to debug by commenting the code written getRowUrl() function, but it doesnâ€™t work. Second problem: When I run normal profile to import all product, I see following error Fatal error: Call to undefined method Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Abstract::getexceptions() in D:\wamp\www\ent\app\code\core\Mage\Adminhtml\Block\System\Convert\Profile\Run.php on line 166 All I tested this in fresh enterprise version 1.9.0.0 without installing any extensions.
