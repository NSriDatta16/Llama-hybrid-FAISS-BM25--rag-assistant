Please provide a minimal working example. Pooling of objects (such as simulation envelopes) is only justified when the individual objects (envelopes) were created under identical conditions. In your example you appear to be pooling several envelopes of the Foxall J function Jfox(X,Y) that were computed for different datasets. Each envelope was computed by taking a particular dataset (X,Y) , holding Y fixed, and generating random point patterns Xsim with the same average intensity as X . These are not identical conditions between the different envelopes, so it is not valid to pool them, and paradoxes can occur, such as you have found. Again, a minimal working example would help.
