There are two reasons I think: static has two different meanings: at class scope, it means shared by the whole class while at file/function scope it affects the visibility/storage... unnamed namespaces allow to declare new struct , class and typedef One note though, the commitee backpedaled on this: static is no longer marked as deprecated in n3225 .
