Make sure you have adequate code coverage in your unit tests and integration tests. Use appropriate UI validation, and test combinations that can break it. I have found that a well-architected application that reduces the number of possible permutations in the UI (ways the user can break it) helps a lot. Design patterns like MVC can be especially useful in this regard, since they make your UI veneer as thin as possible.
