The function printchar() below will print some characters as "special", and print the octal code for characters out of range (a la Emacs), but print normal characters otherwise. I also took the liberty of having '\n' print a real '\n' after it to make your output more readable. Also note that I use an int in the loop in main just to be able to iterate over the whole range of unsigned char . In your usage you would likely just have an unsigned char that you read from your dataset. #include static void printchar(unsigned char theChar) { switch (theChar) { case '\n': printf("\\n\n"); break; case '\r': printf("\\r"); break; case '\t': printf("\\t"); break; default: if ((theChar 0x7f)) { printf("\\%03o", (unsigned char)theChar); } else { printf("%c", theChar); } break; } } int main(int argc, char** argv) { int theChar; (void)argc; (void)argv; for (theChar = 0x00; theChar
