I know its answered, just sharing my experience. I had made a contact form through a CMS page. The form worked fine. But after submitting it, it would redirect to the magento contact form. To redirect it back to CMS page, i had to put $this->_redirect('contactus'); where contactus is the URL identifier. Also after redirect, the success / error message would not show up. For that i had to make changes here. Go to /app/design/frontend/default/yourstore/template/contacts/form.phtml getMessagesBlock()->getGroupedHtml() ?> with: getLayout()->getMessagesBlock()->setMessages(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getMessages(true)); ?> I got the solution from here
