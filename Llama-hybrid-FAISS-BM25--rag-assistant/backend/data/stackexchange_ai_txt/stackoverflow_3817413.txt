http request from Google App Engine

I'm trying to make http requests from my Google App Engine webapp, and discovered I have to use URLConnection since it's the only whitelisted class. The corresponding Clojure library is clojure.contrib.http.agent, and my code is as follows: (defroutes example (GET "/" [] (http/string (http/http-agent "http://www.example.com"))) (route/not-found "Page not found")) This works fine in my development environment- the browser displays the text for example.com. But when I test it out with Google's development app server: phrygian:example wei$ dev_appserver.sh war 2010-09-28 14:53:36.120 java[43845:903] [Java CocoaComponent compatibility mode]: Enabled ... INFO: The server is running at http://localhost:8080/ It just hangs when I load the page. No error, or anything. Any idea what might be going on?
