HttpBrowserCapabilities Custom Browser file parsing

If I have a custom .browser file, and I want to evaluate what will happen if it is given a particular User Agent, is there any way to do that through the .NET API? I was attempting to use HttpBrowserCapabilites, but I'm not sure how to load a custom .browser file into that class.
