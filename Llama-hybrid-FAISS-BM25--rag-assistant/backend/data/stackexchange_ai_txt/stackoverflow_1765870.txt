MySQL AVG query help

I have this query which works perfectly: SELECT cp.* FROM CustPrimaryQ cp JOIN Customer c ON cp.CxID = c.CustomerID JOIN SacCode sc ON sc.SacCode = c.SacCode WHERE sc.ResellerCorporateID = 392 However I am trying to modify it to calculate an average. Each row of the CustPrimaryQ table has a field called QScore and it's this field I want to find out the total average of. In other words if there are 10 rows in CustPrimaryQ I want the Average QScore for the 10 rows. Any help would be much appreciated.
