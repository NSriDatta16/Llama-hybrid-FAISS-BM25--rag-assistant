Add another RNN. Your first RNN outputs a set of features for each sentence, based on words or characters. (I used a CNN myself.) Your second (bi-directional) RNN takes those features and outputs features based on the features of the current and other sentences. Your fully-connected classifier then assigns a classification to each line. You’ll need to make sure the classifier is getting input at each time step (i.e. for each sentence) and not just the usual default of results for the last sentence (i.e. for all of your sentences at once). I guess you could also use seq2seq techniques that involve transformers and attention, but your task does have a natural input and output cadence, so in that way isn’t like translating English to French. You have the same number of input sentences as output classifications, and they will be made in the same order.
