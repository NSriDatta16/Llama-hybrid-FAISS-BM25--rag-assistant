Agree the answers above, the difference of two independent t-distributed random variables are not t distributed. But I want to add some ways of calculating this. The easiest way of calculating this is using a Monte Carlo method. In R, for example, you random sample 100,000 numbers from the first t distribution, then you random sample another 100,000 numbers from the second t distribution. You let the first set of 100,000 numbers minus the second set of 100,000 numbers. The obtained 100,000 new numbers are the random samples from the distribution of the difference between the two distribution. You can calculate the mean and variance by simply using mean() and var() . This is called Behrens–Fisher distribution. You can refer to the Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behrens%E2%80%93Fisher_distribution . The CI given by this distribution is called "fiducial interval", this is not a CI . Numerical integration might work. This is continued as the bullet point 2. You might refer to the Section 2.5.2 in Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis by Box, George E. P., Tiao, George C. It has the detailed steps of integration, and how this is approximated to be a Behrens–Fisher distribution.
