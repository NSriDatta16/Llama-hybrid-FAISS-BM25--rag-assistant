How to programmatically confirm a user in Magento?

I am writing a script that automatically imports users into magento. Here is a code snippet: $customer = Mage::getModel("customer/customer"); $customer->website_id = $websiteId; $customer->setStore($store); $customer->loadByEmail($riga[10]); echo "Importo ".$data[0]."\n"; echo " email :".$data[10]."\n"; $customer->setTaxvat($data[7]); $customer->lastname = $lastname; $customer->email = $data[10]; $customer->password_hash = md5($data[0]); $customer->save(); The problem is that the users are created as "not confirmed", while I would like them to be "confirmed". I tried with: $customer->setConfirmation('1'); before the save, but it didn't work. Does anybody know how to confirm the user? Thanks!
