A solution not involving url rewriting would be the following: Assign myapp.mycompany.com and mysubapp.mycompany.com different IP addresses in DNS, but they should map to the same host (Robert explains below how, or use 2 NICs). Create 2 Web Sites (not Virtual Directories) in IIS. Map the first one to an IP address of myapp.mycompany.com and point to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\myapp Map the second one to an IP address of mysubapp.mycompany.com and point to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\myapp\mysubapp ??? Profit :)
