Sensibly vague priors for a normal

In the middle of page 64 of the third edition of Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman writes... We saw in Chapter 2 that a sensibly vague prior for $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, assuming prior indipendance of scale and location, is uniform on $(\mu, \sigma^2)$, or eqivalently $$ p(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto (\sigma^2)^{-1} $$ I don't think I saw where this was referenced. Gelman writes that a prior or a normal with known mean but unknown variance is an Inverse Chisquared distribution. This distribution has two hyperparameters, $\alpha, \beta$, which if were both set to 0 would yeild $(\sigma^2)^{-1}$. Is that the logic behind the prior for a normal with two unknown params?
