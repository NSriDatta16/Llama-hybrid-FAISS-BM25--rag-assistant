That's certainly valid. You just have to keep in mind the tradeoff. You are forsaking some information to embed your $N$ dimensional data into a lower dimensional space. Multidimensional Scaling can be seen as a dimensionality reduction algorithm like any other, with the advantage being it tries to keep the hierarchical structure of the data (and it can of course fail on that, no free lunch). Keep in mind you're not restricted to 2-dimensions with MDS. You can actually test for a feasible and reasonable number of dimensions.
