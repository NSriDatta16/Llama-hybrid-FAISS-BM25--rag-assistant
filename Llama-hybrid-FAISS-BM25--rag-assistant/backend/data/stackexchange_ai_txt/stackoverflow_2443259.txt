Your method of interprocess communication should depend on how important it is that each message get processed. For instance, if process A tells process B to, say, send an email to your IT staff saying that a server is down, it's pretty important. If however you're streaming audio, individual messages (packets) aren't critical to the performance of the app, and can be dropped. If the former, you should consider using persistent storage such as a database to store messages, and let each process poll the database to retrieve its own messages. In this way, if a process is terminated or loses communication with the other processes temporarily, it will be able to retrieve whatever messages it has missed when it starts up again.
