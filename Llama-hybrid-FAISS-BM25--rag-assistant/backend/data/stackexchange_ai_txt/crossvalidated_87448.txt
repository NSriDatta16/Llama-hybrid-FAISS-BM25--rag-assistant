Summary statistic for 'average' conditional probabilities

I have the following scenario: Let $X_i$ denote some event. Now I have the following calculated probabilities. $P(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_9 | X_{10})$ $P(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_{8} \cap X_{10} | X_{9})$ $\vdots$ $P(X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_{9} \cap X_{10} | X_{1})$ In words, the above expressions represent the (joint) probability of the 'remaining' events given that a particular event has occurred. To calculate these probabilities, I know the underlying probability distribution that describes the entire system, i.e., $p(x_1, x_2, \cdots. x_{10})$, so for example, calculating the probability $P(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_9 | X_{10})$ just simply requires me to find $\frac{P(X_1 \cap \cdots \cap X_{10})}{P(X_{10})}$ where both the denominator and numerator can be calculated by integrating over certain regions of the probability density function $p(x_1, x_2, \cdots. x_{10})$. My question is, I wish to find one summary value that describes the 'average' probability of this system, e.g. say $P(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_9 | X_{10})= 0.4$, $P(X_1 \cap X_2 \cap \cdots \cap X_{8} \cap X_{10} | X_{9})= 0.3$ etc, how can I "combine" these values $0.4$, $0.3$, etc into one value that describes the "average" probability of this system? My initial method is just to take the arithmetic average of each value, but that is mathematically incorrect since conditional probabilities aren't summable (except when they are conditioned on the same event). So are there any other measures/techniques I can use to somehow "combine" these single probabilities into "one" value? I.e., some kind of summary statistic that describes the average probability?
