WiX drops fragments with only Error elements if not reference by custom actions

I'm using WiX (3.0.3815.0) on a fairly large project. I want to do some code generation that will generate Error elements out of some kind of source (purpose: Both C-compiled CAs and MSI need to see the error strings and know about the IDs). I generate something like this: (Lots more...) During build, I use it like I use my other .wxs files: call candle.exe and get gen.wixobj, and then pass it to light.exe together with my other wixobjs. Problem: WiX doesn't include the Error lines in the resulting MSI error table (validated with Orca). Ugly workaround:Add a custom action with Error="28002" - then the entire file gets included in the MSI. Anybody familiar with this? Any less-ugly solution?
