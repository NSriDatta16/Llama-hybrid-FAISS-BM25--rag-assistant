As for session storage, I can recommend memcached. There is a PHP function that enables you to set your own session handler. Do not save sessions into a real database. It would add unncessary overhead. I cannot tell you much about the database design as your post is lacking substantial information. Therefore I would just say, create two tables, "User" and "Project". "user" is made up of the columns ID, Name and E-Mail. Project consists of the columns ID, User ID (foreign key if supported by DBMS), Name etc.
