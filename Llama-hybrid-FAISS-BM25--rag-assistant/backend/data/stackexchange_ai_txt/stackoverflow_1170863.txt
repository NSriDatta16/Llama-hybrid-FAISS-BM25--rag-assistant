Visual Studio DSL Tools and Server Explorer

Is it possible to enable users to drag and drop a Table from the Visual Studio Server Explorer onto my own DSL Diagram? I can drop custom Domain Classes I have created but want to make use of the build in funcationality. I am working in Visual Studio 2010.
