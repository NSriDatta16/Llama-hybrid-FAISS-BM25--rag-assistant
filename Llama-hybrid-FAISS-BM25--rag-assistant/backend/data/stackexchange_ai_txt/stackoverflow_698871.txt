I suggest using the stretch method they recommend for button images. [UIImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:15 topCapHeight:13] You can see a working example by downloading Twitterfon 's source(it's on the FAQ page). You can see how they code a reusable control for it as well as example images for creating your own bubble. Edit - Source is no longer available(NDA, possibly) I put the image up here . You should be able to figure out the rest :)
