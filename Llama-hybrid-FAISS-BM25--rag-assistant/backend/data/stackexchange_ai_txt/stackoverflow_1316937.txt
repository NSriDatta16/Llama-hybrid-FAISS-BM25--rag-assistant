Take a look at the Apache Java Caching System (JCS) JCS is a distributed caching system written in java. It is intended to speed up applications by providing a means to manage cached data of various dynamic natures. Like any caching system, JCS is most useful for high read, low put applications. Latency times drop sharply and bottlenecks move away from the database in an effectively cached system. Learn how to start using JCS. The JCS goes beyond simply caching objects in memory. It provides numerous additional features: * Memory management * Disk overflow (and defragmentation) * Thread pool controls * Element grouping * Minimal dependencies * Quick nested categorical removal * Data expiration (idle time and max life) * Extensible framework * Fully configurable runtime parameters * Region data separation and configuration * Fine grained element configuration options * Remote synchronization * Remote store recovery * Non-blocking "zombie" (balking facade) pattern * Lateral distribution of elements via HTTP, TCP, or UDP * UDP Discovery of other caches * Element event handling * Remote server chaining (or clustering) and failover * Custom event logging hooks * Custom event queue injection * Custom object serializer injection * Key pattern matching retrieval * Network efficient multi-key retrieval
