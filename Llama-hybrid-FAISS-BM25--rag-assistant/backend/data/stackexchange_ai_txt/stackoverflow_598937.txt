Aside from numerous technical differences between how they're implemented, they serve roughly the same purpose: the organization of data. The big difference is that in Python (and other object oriented languages such as C++, Java, or C#), a class can also have functions associated with it that operate only on the instance of the class, whereas in C, a function that wishes to operate on a struct must accept the structure as a parameter in some way, usually by pointer. I won't delve into the technical differences between the two, as they are fairly significant, but I suggest you look into the concept of Object Oriented Programming .
