HDF5 pros supported by pandas out of the box therefore, supported by jupyter-notebook out of the box good support by other software includes good amount of metadata single file can store multiple data frames each dataframe includes good amount of metadata (I think) thus: it's great for making sense of data, it's self-describing it's great for experimentation HDF5 cons with naive tools: file must fit in RAM with a bit more care: the dataframe you access must fit in RAM, and the file must be in local storage each dataframe has a schema, it's homogenous some cloud systems don't support it out of the box ( aws) thus: not for humongous data not for network storage (e.g. s3) not for cases where schema changes over time
