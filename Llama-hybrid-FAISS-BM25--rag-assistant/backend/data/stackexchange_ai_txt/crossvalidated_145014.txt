Find the mle of $\theta$

This is from Robert Hogg's Introduction to Mathematical Statistics 6th Edition Exercise 6.1.13. The question is: Let $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n} $ be a random sample from a distribution on $\mathbb{R}$ with one of two pdfs: $$f(x;\theta)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{\exp\{-x^2/2\}}{\sqrt{2\pi }}&\text{ if }\theta=1\\\dfrac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)}&\text{ if }\theta=2\end{cases} $$ Find the mle of $\theta$. My simple solution is $\hat{\theta}=ArgmaxL(\theta;X)=ArgmaxL(1,2;X)$. The max value for $\theta=1$ is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$, when x=0 for the standard normal distribution The max value for $\theta=2$ is $\frac{1}{\pi}$, when x=0 for the cauchy distribution. Therefore, mle of $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{\pi}$ I am not sure whether my solution is correct or not. Please check my solution. Thank you very much Sorry, the mle should be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ since it is bigger than $\frac{1}{\pi}$ by my simple solution. After poder this problem for two days, I think the mle is "0" since by difination of MLE $\hat{\theta}=ArgmaxL(\theta;X)$ which means that $L(\theta;X)$ achieve its maximum value at $\hat\theta$. Since the likelyhood fucntion can achive its maximum value at 0, therefore, by the defination, the mle is 0. Further, the mle can be a statistic $\overline{X}$ which is just a function of data, then why we can not also treat constant 0 as a fucntion of data, which is 0*data, i.e 0*X.
