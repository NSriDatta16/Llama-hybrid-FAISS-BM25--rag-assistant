Backticks should be used if and only if you need to capture the output of a command. Otherwise, system() should be used. And, of course, if there's a Perl function or CPAN module that does the job, this should be used instead of either. In either case, two things are strongly encouraged: First, sanitize all inputs: Use Taint mode (-T) if the code is exposed to possible untrusted input. Even if it's not, make sure to handle (or prevent) funky characters like space or the three kinds of quote. Second, check the return code to make sure the command succeeded. Here is an example of how to do so: my $cmd = "./do_something.sh foo bar"; my $output = `$cmd`; if ($?) { die "Error running [$cmd]"; }
