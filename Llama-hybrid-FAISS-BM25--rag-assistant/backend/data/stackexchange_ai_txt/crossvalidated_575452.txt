I think the content of the course will still be relevant for several reasons. The first one is that the courses available will always slightly lag the state of the art research as it takes a bit of time for a new tool to be widely used and known. The second is that even if progresses are being made fast in some domains, this course seems to cover the general foundation on which you can build a deeper knowledge yourself by maybe going a bit more specialized. I refer here to the variety of problems machine learning now covers, from images to sounds to languages. Third reason is that companies evolve A LOT slower than academia on tech related questions. Yes there will be some teams that are state of the art, but overall, companies care most about robustness and loss aversion than fancy and shiny new models, therefore you can be sure some companies will still be in need to whatever is taught in that course. As pointed out @Firebug however, machine learning is just a very small sub-domain of IT, and this course material seems to be centered on it. It is yours now to decide if that's what you want to do.
