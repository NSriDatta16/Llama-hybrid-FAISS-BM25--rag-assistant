Moving average process - stationarity

If we consider a moving average process of order 1, is that stationary? Because, although, the mean will remain the same for Yt and Yt+k, the variance and co-variance will change if you calculate for Yt+k, so in that case, why is it stated as stationary? Can anyone explain: how do you know if a moving average process is weakly stationary, strictly stationary or non stationary?
