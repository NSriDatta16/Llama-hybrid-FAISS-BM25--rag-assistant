Problem with accessing in DOM with jQuery

I changed the tree of my JSON-P output, and i cannot access to my object DOM anymore : Here's my output : jsonp1271634374310( {"Inter-Medias": {"name":"Inter-Medias","idGSP":"14","average":"80","services":"8.86"} }); And here's my jQuery script : success: function(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest){ widget = data.name; widget += data.average ; .... I know one level is missing, but if I try to do : data.Inter-Medias.name or data.name.name it's still not working. Any idea please ? Thank you.
