This MSDN article How to: Configure an HTTP Handler Extension in IIS explains what you'll have to do. See the paragraph for the Integrated mode. The file-name extension for .zeip must be registered in both the httpHandlers element and the handlers element. You'll have to click Add Managed Handler in the Actions pane. Using IIS Manager in IIS 7.0 to add a custom handler extension is equivalent to registering the handler extension in the Web.config file.
