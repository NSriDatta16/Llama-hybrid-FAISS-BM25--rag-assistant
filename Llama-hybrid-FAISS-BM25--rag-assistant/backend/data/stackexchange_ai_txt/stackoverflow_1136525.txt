As a work-around, you could extract the object from the collection and then reinsert it after you are done processing. Depending on your requirements and concurrency model, this could just make the program ugly, though. This is a quick hack, and not suitable for anything that requires quality. Instead, you could implement the collection with an update method that specifically triggers the ContentChanged (not sure about the name) event. It's not pretty, but it is at least quite easy to deal with. Ideally, as kragen2uk says, it would be best to make the objects observable and keep your client code clean and simple. see also this question .
