Simple HTML Dom PHP help required

I am doing some screen scraping work at the moment using PHP and Simple HTML Dom. I am struggling a little with finding some consistency within the targets markup. The divs are all named strangely. See example... Small houses Dolls Houses H117: Daisy Cottage Pretty painted cottage with daisy motif, opening windows, shutters and door, decorated interior, includes 'Starter furniture set'. Dolls sold separately, 3 years+ W440mm D350mm H425mm H111: Lilys Cottage Pretty painted cottage with daisy motif, opening windows, shutters and door, decorated interior, includes 'Starter furniture set'. Dolls sold separately, 3 years+ W440mm D350mm H425mm le toy van, wodden toys, designed in uk, pirate, fantasy, everyday, historical, fairytale, dolls, manufactured in indonesia, traditional wooden toys, fabric clothing, designed in the uk manufactured in indonesia, copyright le toy van ltd, manufacturer distributor, designer, dolls houses, castles, garages, cars, budkins, traditional wooden toys, fairies, farms There are two products within this page, they seem to be using div's like tables??? What elements can I target to obtain "image" "title" "description". I'm using this at the moment... foreach($all_pages->find('img') as $src){ if (strpos($src->src,"http://letoyvan.com") === false) { $src->src = "http://letoyvan.com/$src->src"; } $product['image'][] = $src->src; } foreach($all_pages->find('p[class*=imAlign_left]') as $description){ $product['description'][] = $description->innertext; } foreach($all_pages->find('span[class*=fc3]') as $title){ $product['title'][] = $title->innertext; }
