Once your application has been approved it does indeed take up to a few hours before it has propagated and shows up. The same applies when you pull your application from the App Store or changing your application description or screenshots. Basicly everything you do in iTunes Connect regarding your app, takes some time to propagate through the servers. I don't think I ever had to wait longer than 6 hours though, more like 3 hours on average.
