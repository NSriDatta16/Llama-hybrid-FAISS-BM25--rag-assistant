I would say Yes. As Jacob neatly put, the Universal Approximation algo. can be leveraged for proving the fact. In fact, as neural networks are highly flexible, owing to their portable structure definitions and a huge set of activation functions one can choose from, I don't see why a Bayesian network cannot be mimicked by a neural network. But, from my experience of both research and coding deep belief networks, I'd advise you not to try this at home. Cause, you would often end up with painfully complex networks. :D But, I am skeptical about the vice-versa process. (owing to my limited knowledge of Bayesian networks)
