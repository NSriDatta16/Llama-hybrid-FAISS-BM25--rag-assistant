Not knowing much about the black box you will probably have to try a number of approaches. My first suggestion is to define a smallish number $n$ , say $n=5$ and a distance measure, say euclidean distance. Then for each new vector of 9881 input variables find the $n$ nearest neighbors within the 325 known data sets. Take their $x$ and $y$ values and compute the predicted $\hat x_i$ as the mean of the $x_{1..5}$ and the predicted $\hat y_i$ as the mean of the $y_{1..5}$ . Alternatively you can compute a weighed mean of the $x$ and $y$ values with the weights determind by the distances in a way, that a point further away from the input has less influence on the result. My second suggestion is to use two random forests: One to predict the $\hat x$ -values from the 9881 input values and one to predict the $\hat y$ values. The influence of each of the 9881 input values cannot be specified from 325 inputs but each tree within the forest will only use part of the values. Random forest with only one output, either x or y, are implemented in many software solutions and easier to find than those with value pairs as outcomes.
