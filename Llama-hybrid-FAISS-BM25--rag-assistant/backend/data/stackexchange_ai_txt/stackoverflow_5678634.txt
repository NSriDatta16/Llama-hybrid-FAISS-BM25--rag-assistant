Yes. you need something like this (for OS X) export JAVA_OPTS="-agentlib:jprofilerti=port=8849 \ -Xbootclasspath/a:/Applications/jprofiler5/bin/agent.jar" export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/jprofiler5/bin/macos Usually when you configure a new session through the wizard in JProfiler, it will tell you those exact parameters that you need to put in. For me this wizard is StartCenter -> New Session , then select "New remote integration". This will then ask local/remote , startup mode, jvm type, profiling port and on page 6 says "Perform required modifications" and it lists those. Alternatively you can select "Integration wizard" from the menu bar.
