How to analyze this biplot of PCA?

I have dones a PCA analysis about measurement of a fish morphometric between female and male. After the PCA result came out with biplot graph, I was a little bit confused to interpret this data. It seems all the vector didn't representing the data because the data dispersed in the opposite axes. Could you help me to analyze this? Note: blue=male pink=female POL=post orbital length mow=mouth opening width cpl=caudal peduncle length podl=post dorsal length.
