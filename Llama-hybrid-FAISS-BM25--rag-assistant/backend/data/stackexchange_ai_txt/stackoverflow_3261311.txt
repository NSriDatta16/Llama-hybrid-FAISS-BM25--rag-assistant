I end up using eXontrol's exg2antt http://www.exontrol.com/exg2antt.jsp It's a COM component instead of native VCL, the layout aspect seems quite flexible, I especially like the combination of a tree grid and gantt chart. The default look is quite dated, but a skin can easily be apply to it. I did have problem with the TLB file generated causing bad variant type errors, but the developers emailed me back a working solution within 24hrs.
