Is POJO Servlet ever considered?

POJO is the norm in Spring but also pervasive in the Java EE world. One non-POJO stronghold is Servlet. I'm wondering if any open source ever appeals to change. POJO examples: class MyHttpServlet { @Inject void doGet (@HttpServletRequest Request request, @HttpServletResponse Response response) {..} } class MyOtherServlet { @Inject void doOther (@OtherServletRequest Request request, @OtherServletResponse Response response) {..} } class MyOneWayServlet { @Inject void doOneWay (@OneWayServletRequest Request request) {..} } ..... Maybe it's all about how to make POJO/SoC/loose-coupling pragmatically. Spring's taking on EJB2.x is straight replacing it that later yields to EJB3.x, but on Servlet adding a MVC layer above (like other web frameworks doing theirs). Orginally i was asking if someone envisioned the radical way on Servlet. The answers seem to me clearly none.
