Getting a subset of an R data frame using values in the order vector

I have a vector of correlation scores myCorVector which contains a range of values from 1 to -1. The vector myCorVector has a score for each row of a data frame myDataFrame . I can order the data frame rows by specifying myDataFrame[order(myCorVector),] . What I would like to do is order the data frame, but retrieve a subset of rows from myDataFrame where myCorVector values are less than 0. If I apply subset() on myCorVector , then the indices returned by order() no longer associate with valid row indices in myDataFrame . Is there a quick and/or elegant way to do this that doesn't require a for loop over myCorVector ?
