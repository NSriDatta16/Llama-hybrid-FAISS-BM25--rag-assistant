SQLce DAL, Linq-to-Sql or EntityFramework

I'm learning databases, using SqlCe, and need business object to database mapping. Currently I try to decide if to use Linq to Sql, or EntityFramework. (I understand a bit L2S, but haven't familiarized with EF yet) The program will only be developed and used by myself, so I have good control of the priorities: I don't need to consider potential change of database type or data storage type, as I'm quite certain SQLce will stay sufficient. I DO expect continued development and changes to the data scheme while the program is in active use; change business object properties (Hence database columns), and possibly overall table scheme. So old data must be transported to new scheme. I also want to keep a decent degree of layer separation DAL/BLL, although this may not be necessary, it is good for me to learn these principles. My question is: With these priorities, would I have any benefit by choosing either Linq2Sql vs. EntityFramwork? (and please explain why) Btw, the project involves very simple table scheme and relations with only ~4 tables total. Thanks!
