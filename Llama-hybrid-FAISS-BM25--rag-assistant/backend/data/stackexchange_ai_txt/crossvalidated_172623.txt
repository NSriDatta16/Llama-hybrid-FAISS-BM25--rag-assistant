The final properties of the score may depend on the normalization procedure. Therefore, it may be better to keep using fixed length unix command sequences. However, something that offers "basic consistency" is geometric average. Most likely : $\hat{P}(S)=(q_{S_1}\prod_{t=2}^{|S|}p_{S_{t-1}S_t})^{1/S}$ Therefore, typing two times the same sequence leads to the following : $\hat{P}(S+S)=(q_{S_1} p_{S_{t}S_{1}}\prod_{t=2}^{|S|}p_{S_{t-1}S_t} \prod_{t=2}^{|S|}p_{S_{t-1}S_t})^{1/2S}$ If the sequence is long enough (i.e. $S$ large), you obtain that: $\hat{P}(S+S)\approx\hat{P}(S)$
