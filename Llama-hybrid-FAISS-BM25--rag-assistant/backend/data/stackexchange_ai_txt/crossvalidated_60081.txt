Basic time series model question

If I fit a time series with a AR model, I can tell if this fit is valid by checking the residual correlation (valid if not correlated). But if I fit it with a MA model, how do I tell if this fit is valid or not? In R, when I specify to fit the time series with, say MA(1), it will automatically use white noise for epsilon, right? $y_t = \epsilon_t + \text{coefficient} \cdot \epsilon_{t-1}$ Thanks
