I answered two verisimilar question: Contradictory results of ADF and KPSS unit root tests What is the difference between a stationary test and a unit root test? (I summarized the most relevant part of this answer below) How unit-root test and stationarity-test complement each other If you have a time series data set how it usually appears in econometric time series I propose you should apply both a Unit root test: (Augmented) Dickey Fuller or Phillips-Perron depending on the structure of the underlying data and a KPSS test. Case 1 Unit root test: you can’t reject H0; KPSS test: reject H0. Both imply that series has unit root. Case 2 Unit root test: Reject H0. KPSS test: don`t reject H0. Both imply that series is stationary. Case 3 If we can’t reject both test: data give not enough observations. Case 4 Reject unit root, reject stationarity: both hypothesis are component hypothesis – heteroskedasticity in series may make a big difference; if there is structural break it will affect inference. Power problem: if there is small random walk component (small variance σ 2 u ), we can’t reject unit root and can’t reject stationarity. Economics: if the series is highly persistence we can’t reject H0 (unit root) – highly persistent may be even without unit root but it also means we shouldn’t treat/take data in levels. General rule about statistical testing You cannot proof a null hypothesis you can only affirm it. However if you reject a null hypothesis you can be very sure that the null hypothesis is really not true. Thus alternative hypothesis is always a stronger hypothesis than the null hypothesis.
