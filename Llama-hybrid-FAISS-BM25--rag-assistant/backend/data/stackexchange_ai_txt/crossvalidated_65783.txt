Since you have a sample with known labels, you want supervised learning algorithms here (perhaps that's what you're talking about, but "clustering" usually refers to unsupervised learning). Supervised learning involves learning a classification rule from training data that can be generalized to test data of the same format. Some examples are multinomial logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forest classifiers. Without knowing more specifics about your data I can't make a specific recommendation. The next part of your question involves pooling results across various classifiers: this would fall under the domain of ensemble classifiers. Aggregated results from multiple classification rules often outperform the individual classification schemes comprising them. There are many different methods for aggregation across multiple classification schemes. Your question is very broad, so hopefully this is enough to get you started.
