hide hyperlink text of anchor tag in browser status bar but it should navigate

I have a referral project. In that there is an agent between the affiliate (my site) and the target site . So all hyperlinks displayed in my site will be redirected to the agents site and then it is redirected to the target site. The hyperlink itself is the link to the agents site. So i am displaying all products. I have given links to them. When users hover a hyeprlink you can see the href text displayed in the status bar which will be the agents site. The requirement is the hyperlinks of an agent site should not be displayed in the status bar. My solutions and assumptions So i can use span onclick = window.location = hrefOfAgentLink. I have seen in other sites that they redirect to another scripting page and then the redirection takes place. for example http://sitename.com/click/id=32 . The id refers to the hyperlink in database. hope they fetch the link and they do a location header to redirect to the agent page. Why so? because the user should not see where the link goes. I want to know whether there is(are) any other option(s) so that the hyperlink will not be visible in the status bar and in the address bar when it is redirecting. Anyway when redirecting the agents url is not visible because it immediately redirects to the target site. I would like to have the stackoverflow users suggestions. Thank you.
