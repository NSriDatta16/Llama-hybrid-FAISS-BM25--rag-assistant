Compare time series of measured properties to control, no forecasting

There are many time serious questions but I can't seem to find one that explains my case. I have a set of timeseries that are the output of many simulations where the value of the same parameter is changed in each simulation. I would like to compare each time series with the time series from the control simulation. The frequency and duration of all time series is the same. The value at time t depends on the value at time t-1 (in most cases), so I guess you would call these auto-correlated time series. These are values of number of plants or kg of biomass produced, or average height. I would like to know if there is a statistical significance between each time series and the control to determine the magnitude of the effect that this parameter has on the simulation output. I was thinking of comparing the mean and standard deviation using a t-test, but I am not sure if these timeseries are auto-correlated. Here two example with difference distances between means from control
