Issue Calling Applet Functions from Java Script

Every time I call a function of my applet from my Java Script, it throws an undefined exception. And my googling hasn't helped me at all. here is a link to the site I am am hosting it on right now: Host Site Here is my html for the embedding the Applet: And here is my java script code: function test(){ document.writeln(" "+"Test"+" "); try{ var s=document.ClientApp.getGreeting(); document.writeln(" First: "+s+" "); }catch(err){ document.writeln(" Error Caught 1: "+err.description+" "); } try{ var s=document.getElementById('ClientApp').getGreeting(); document.writeln(" Second: "+s+" "); }catch(err){ document.writeln(" Error Caught 2: "+err.description+" "); } document.close(); } I know it loads the applet because I can see the gui, and if it helps here is my init function public void init() { try { SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() { public void run() { JLabel lbl = new JLabel(getGreeting()); add(lbl); } }); } catch (Exception e) { System.err.println("createGUI didn't complete successfully"); } } here is a link to my full code as well Code I got a feeling that the error is incredibly obvious, but I just can not see it. Any help would be great! P.S. The Applet class files are now in a signed jar file. Also This will be placed in the webapps folder of a tomcat server, but I am currently accessing it as a local file.
