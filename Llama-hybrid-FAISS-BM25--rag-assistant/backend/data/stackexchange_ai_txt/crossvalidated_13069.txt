Book for broad and conceptual overview of statistical methods

I am very interested about the potential of statistical analysis for simulation/forecasting/function estimation, etc. However, I don't know much about it and my mathematical knowledge is still quite limited -- I am a junior undergraduate student in software engineering. I am looking for a book that would get me started on certain things which I keep reading about: linear regression and other kinds of regression, bayesian methods, monte carlo methods, machine learning, etc. I also want to get started with R so if there was a book that combined both, that would be awesome. Preferably, I would like the book to explain things conceptually and not in too much technical details -- I would like statistics to be very intuitive to me, because I understand there are very many risky pitfalls in statistics. I am off course willing to read more books to improve my understanding of topics which I deem valuable.
