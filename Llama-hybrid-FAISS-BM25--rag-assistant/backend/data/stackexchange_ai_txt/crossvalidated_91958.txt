How deal with exponential distribution of data during principal component analysis

I am trying to do PCA on a series of variables (all are positive, real numbers) using correlation and varimax rotation. All the computation is done in R. Although I got high loadings for all variables of interest, the frequency distribution of the obtained PC2 shows an exponential distribution, meaning that the extremes of one side of this axis contains a very small number of observations. I have tried several transformations: logarithmic, square root, centering and scaling, and rank, and none of them solves the problem. What do you think I should do? Leave it like that? For further contextualization, I want to use the obtained PCs for their use in a multiple regression analysis.
