Is there a better way to handle form tab order in PHP than this?

Is there a better way to handle form tab order in PHP than this? I have a page with multiple repeated forms. Due to the layout I want the tab order to be non-sequential, so I have to specify it in the html (so that I can specify it out of order). My forms are constructed using PHP's block quote mechanism, which as far as I can make out doesn't allow arithmetic on PHP variables inside the block I've implemented it, but my implementation seems awkward. I can't help thinking there's a more elegant way to do this. First I initialize some php variables at the top of the page. $tab1=1; $tab2=2; $tab3=3; $tab4=5; $tab5=4; Then later on, inside a php loop I do this... $tab1+=5; $tab2+=5; $tab3+=5; $tab4+=5; $tab5+=5; Then add the variables to the block quote... $picshtml .= Add Comment Comment Name Email Website BLOCK;
