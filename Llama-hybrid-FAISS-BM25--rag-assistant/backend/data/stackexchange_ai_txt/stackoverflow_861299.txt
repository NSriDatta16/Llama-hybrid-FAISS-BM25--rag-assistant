What are Microsoft Development Environment Setup Best Practices

I've just joined a small team of developers and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the way each developer sets up their development environment or how they use version control (currently Source Safe). I made the "mistake" of asking a question about their standard practices. To keep a long story short, this earned me the task of coming up with a plan to standardize everything we reasonably can since there currently is NO standard and this is causing unnecessary delays and headaches. So I'm hoping some of you can give me some advice or point me to some good resources in this regard. A little background. Our team is about 10 developers all working on .NET projects ranging from DotNetNuke Portals and Modules, to Webservices, to WPF projects. Most developers work autonomously (hence the difference in everyone's setup), but we all have to have access (currently through Source Safe) to all projects for support, bug hunts and enhancements. I'm looking for suggestions as simple as should we standardize locations for third party dlls on each of our boxes or use a network location for those so all references are consistent - to what's the best way to organize our projects folder structure - to coming up with a plan to reorganize everything step by step (ie. leave it where it is until you need to work on it and then migrate it into the new system). Any help would be greatly appreciated.
