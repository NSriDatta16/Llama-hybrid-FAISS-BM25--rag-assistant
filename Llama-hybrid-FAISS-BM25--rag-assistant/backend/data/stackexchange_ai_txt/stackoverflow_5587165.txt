You don't need any alternatives. Just do not write PHP code into a file with your code. Look, you are using PHP awfully wrong way. Instead of writing another PHP page for the every new user you have to use only one PHP page to serve them all. This page would operate some data storage , a database or a text file, and display it to the user. That's the way every PHP application works: single PHP code, multiple data.
