Asymmetry effect vs leverage effect

Regarding GARCH models, many authors use the terms asymmetric effects and leverage effects interchangeably and they left me with a doubt on whether these two terms are synonymous. I get that, for example, in asymmetric GARCH models, good news and bad news have different effects on the variance; however, I'm guessing this means that asymmetric effects are present. If so, then what is the distinction with leverage effects?
