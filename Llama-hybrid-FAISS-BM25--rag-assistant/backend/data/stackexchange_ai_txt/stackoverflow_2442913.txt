As others have said, what these tools give you is an link between your data and how you want to display it - be that a listing, chart, cross tab (grid of summarized values) etc, with options for your own parameters, calculations and queries. If you are embedding your reports in your application, I'd say your selection of a reporting platform gets down to what technology are you comfortable with. For Microsoft, look at Crystal. For Java, look at JasperReports and iReport. JasperReports does have sub reports. Sherman Jaspersoft (company behind JasperReports)
