Likert scale and yes/no calculation of one score

My survey is based on observations and interviews. The observation questions are yes/no type questions and interview questions are 4 points. $1=$ never, $2=$ sometimes, $3=$ usually, and $4=$ always. Yes $=1$, No $=0$. If I add up all these with highest possible score and divide it by the total score received, I can then retrieve a total score for the survey. For example, let's say I have 5 responses for the Likert and 5 for the yes/no. $5\times4$ $=20$ (with 4 being the highest possible score you can get on the Likert scale) and $5\times1$ $=5$ $(1$ being the highest possible score for yes/no question). I then add up both to find the highest possible score $=25$. If I get a combined score of $20$, do I divide it by the possible score, $20\div25=80$%? Can I build my questionnaire and calculations like this? My main objective is to get one percentage / score for the entire questionnaire. I thought of accomplishing this in 2 ways: Get the sum of earned score from both scales divided by total possible scores for both scales. Get a percentage by using the above calculation for individual scales, which will give me two sets of percentages, and then take an average for those percentages. I am not sure which way I should go with, or if this even makes sense doing it this way.
