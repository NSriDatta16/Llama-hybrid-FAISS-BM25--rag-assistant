If you want to copy and paste the chart manually to a CMS (e.g. Joomla/Wordpress site), than you could do it from the 'gvis' object's html list. Just like @kohske suggested: # demo data from manual M Then copy and paste the content of temp.html to your Joomla site. You should pay attention to paste the code as HTML content, not in the WYSIWYG editor (e.g. Tiny MCE)! If you want to show it on a separate page, do not forget to include header and footer also: # demo data from manual M And at last: you can easily upload this document to e.g. an ftp server and reach it via any browser.
