Scrum PM is a decent, current Scrum plugin for Redmine. It's fairly basic, and the UI leaves something to be desired, but it works. It has a Backlog where you can create stories, and a Dashboard where you can drag and drop tasks for stories through status to done. Redmine Issues are Tasks, and Versions are Sprints. There is no strong correlation between tasks and stories, and there are a few (non-blocking) bugs, but it's the best scrum plugin for Redmine I've seen.
