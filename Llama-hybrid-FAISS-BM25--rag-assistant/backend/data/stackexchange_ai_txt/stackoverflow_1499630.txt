asp:menu in safari and chrome

I have seen some posts of the asp:menu and the browsers Chrome and Safari here, but nevertheless, I think the problem that I have is different than other problems. I am using the following code in order to display the menu: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("AppleWebKit") > 0) { Request.Browser.Adapters.Clear(); } ... } However, the problem is still there if I start the browsers for the very first time, the menu is displayed vertically instead of horizontally. After a page refresh, the menu works fine... How is that possible? Or is the problem that simple,and I need to place the code in somewhere earlier (eg Page_PreInt). Thanks in advance, Patto
