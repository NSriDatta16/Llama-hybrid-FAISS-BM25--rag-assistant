If a property of an Entity is an Identity (auto-incrementing value) in the database is specified in the StorageModel of your Entity Model. Perhaps this setting is not correct for your particular field. You can check this by opening the edmx file of your model and looking into the StorageModels section. It should look like this: ... ... ... StoreGeneratedPattern must be set to Identity . If there is None or the attribute is missing (which defaults to None ) you get indeed the error you described since EntityFramework doesn't know in this case that ID is an identity and will issue a value for the column in the generated SQL-INSERT statement. (Make sure you are really checking the edmx:StorageModels section in the edmx file. The edmx:ConceptualModels section has an attribute annotation:StoreGeneratedPattern in the property as well but its setting doesn't matter for your specific problem. (I think that's only important when a database gets created from a model, but I'm not sure.))
