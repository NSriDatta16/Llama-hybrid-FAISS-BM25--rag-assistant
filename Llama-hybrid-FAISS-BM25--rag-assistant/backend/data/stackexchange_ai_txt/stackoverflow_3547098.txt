I cant say what the best way would be but using Windows Workflow Foundation for such long running processes is definitely one way to go about it. You can do tracking of the process to see what stage it is at, even persist it if you have steps where it is awaiting user input etc. WF provides a lot of features out of the box (especially if your storage medium is SQL Server) and may be a good option to consider. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WF/WF4Extensions.aspx might help give you some more insight into the same.
