Using variance of y variable as weights for weighted linear regression when both x and y variables contain negative values?

I am currently dealing with a weighted linear regression problem in the context of an instrument calibration in analytical chemistry. Let's assume I have a response variable y and a predictor variable x. Both contain several negative values. Both contain several negative values. Now I perform a linear regression and notice that the assumption of homoscedasticity is not met(residuals increase with increasing fitted values). Normally, in such a case, I would try to solve the problem by applying different pragmatic weights such as 1/x^0.5, 1/x, 1/x^2, 1/y^0.5, 1/y and 1/y^2 so deal with heteroscedasticity. I consider these factors pragmatic because in analytical chemistry there are usually not sufficient replicates for each level (usually at most 2) to apply variance-based (S^2) weighting factors (e.g. 1/S(y)^2), which usually solve the heteroscedasticity problem best. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use negative weights for weighted linear regression and hence all x and y based weighting factors are not applicable. Now let's assume that I have enough replication to make reliable variance estimates for every level. Would it then be allowed to use these variances for weighting? Thanks a lot in advance. XEZ
