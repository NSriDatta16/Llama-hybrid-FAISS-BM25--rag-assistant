The ARIMA model with a dummy variable for an intervention is a special case of a linear model with ARIMA errors. You can do the same here but with a richer linear model including factors for the beverage type and geographical zones. In R, the model can be estimated using arima() with the regression variables included via the xreg argument. Unfortunately, you will have to code the factors using dummy variables, but otherwise it is relatively straightforward.
