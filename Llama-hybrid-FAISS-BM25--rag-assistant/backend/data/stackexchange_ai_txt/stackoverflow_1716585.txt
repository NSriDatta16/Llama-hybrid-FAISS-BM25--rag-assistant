Depending on your webserver, but session variables do not typically have a size restriction. Apache+PHP you could handle extremely large sizes, instead you should care about http://ca.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit . In addition, PHP.ini carries session.size variable that you could adjust. I am not sure how it did not work for you; you used $_SESSION, right? Finally, to make a better persisting yet fast (faster than Database) volatile storage I would recommend using Danga's memcached. It is very stable, widely used and has wrappers for every possible language flavor.
