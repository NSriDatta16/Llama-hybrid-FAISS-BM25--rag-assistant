NetBeans 6.8/6.7 UML Class Diagrams

i have tried to generate Class Diagrams in NetBeans 6.7 and 6.8 but all i get is: i figured out installing UML for 6.8 here: NetBeans 6.8 UML i have followed the instructions here: UML Class diagrams i so far i failed to generate anything meaningful. i have followed the tips: Open your project, then create a new UML project (choose "Reverse Engineered Java-Platform model"). After that all your classes will be available in the UML project under "Model". You can now create a new class diagram and drag your classes from "Model" onto the diagram. but nothing meaningful happens when i drag my classes to the Class Diagrams. it always represents the classes as "datatype" on the diagram and class info is not displayed. any helpful tips regarding how can i fix this? or another way of generating Java class diagrams? thank you for your time. EDIT: NetBeans 6.5.1 is working perfectly. thanks!
