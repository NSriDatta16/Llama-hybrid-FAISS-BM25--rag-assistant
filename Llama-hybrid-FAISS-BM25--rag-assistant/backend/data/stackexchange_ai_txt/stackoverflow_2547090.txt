Removing unwanted newline characters when adding in CKEditor

When loading content with a set of paragraphs in CKEditor, it replaces my tags with &#x9; That means the editor converts this: paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 into what ends up like this: paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 How do I fix it so that CKEditor doesn't add the extra newline characters when it sees the paragraph tags?
