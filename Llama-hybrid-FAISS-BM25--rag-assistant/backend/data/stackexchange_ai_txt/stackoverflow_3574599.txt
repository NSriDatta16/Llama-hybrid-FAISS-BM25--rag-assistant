HDPI and MDPI Problem

All these days i used to test my application on my HTC Legend (2.1 OS) only, and i had all my images resources in drawable-hdpi folder.. and everything worked fine and today i wanted to test my Application on Android 1.5, so i recreated all the images with lower resolution and kept it under drawable-mdpi folder, so now i have High resolution images in drawable-hdpi folder and lower resolution images in drawable-mdpi folder.. Everything looked great on both the HTC Legend and Emulator(with Android 1.5) Later i found out that the images in drawable-mdpi are shown in my HTC Legend too and not the images in drawable-hdpi in my manifest file i have also included Can anyone help me with this, I want to know as to why the images in drawable-hdpi are not used?
