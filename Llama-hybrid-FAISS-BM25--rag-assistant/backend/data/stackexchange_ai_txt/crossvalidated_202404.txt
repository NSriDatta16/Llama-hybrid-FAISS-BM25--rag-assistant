What is the point of lag plots and autocorrelation plots?

Most people seem to argue that lag plots and autocorrelation plots are useful for determining whether some univariate time series data is random or not. I feel like I could accomplish this task by just plotting the time series normally. I don't see the point of a lag plot or a autocorrelation plot, plotting the raw time series seems to give a good enough intuition of the behaviour of the function. Can someone enlighten me on the true usage of lag and autocorrelation plots?
