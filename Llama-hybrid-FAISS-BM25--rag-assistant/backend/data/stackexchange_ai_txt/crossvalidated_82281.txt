Because contour plots--especially 3D contour plots--are usually difficult to interpret and plots of $I$ against $u$ are familiar to physicists, consider a small multiple of such plots where $A$ and $B$ range through selected values. Experimentation is in order. You might, for instance, overlay multiple graphs for fixed $A$: In each of these plots $B$ varies through the sequence $(-6, -1, 0, 1, 2)$ with color denoting the value of $B$; a legend would be helpful. (The first value of $B$ is drawn in blue; the next values are drawn in red, gold, green, and so on.) You could also overlay multiple graphs for fixed $B$: In each of these plots $A$ varies through the sequence $(-2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)$. Again, a legend would help. Because these tableaux convey the same information in different ways, if space is available you might publish both versions. Notice how, to assist visual comparison across the cells of each tableau, identical scales and ranges on the axes were used. Sometimes values vary so much this is not feasible, in which case you need to draw the reader's attention to the changes in the scales. Another thing worth considering is how, if at all, to standardize the plots. It might be more meaningful physically, for instance, to scale them all so that the minimum $I(1/2)$ is equal to a constant value. For other purposes you might standardize them to make their slopes at a distinguished value, such as $I^\prime(1) = 1/\left(\sqrt{e} \sqrt{A-e B+e}\right)$, equal to a constant.
