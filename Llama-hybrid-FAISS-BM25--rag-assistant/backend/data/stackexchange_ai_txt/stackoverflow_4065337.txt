i would also like to be able to read values in the depth buffer, but research is indicating it can't be done. as vincent suggests, if you have simple shapes like spheres, ray-casting is probably better. for more complex shapes tho, i'm thinking of rendering the object to a (potentially smaller) offscreen buffer, manually assigning one of the color components of each vertex to be the depth of that vertex, and then reading the color values. this is somewhat inelegant and annoying tho, and requires you to be able to convert object-space to screen space (i'm using my own quaternions to drive the matrices, so that takes care of that). there may be a way with shaders to write the depth information into the color or stencil buffer (does GL ES even have a stencil buffer?) if anybody has a cleaner approach i'd love to hear it.
