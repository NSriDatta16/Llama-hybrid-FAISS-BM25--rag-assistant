Did two courses in NN and some other AI-courses - its fun to poke round with that stuff and I actually managed to implement the stuff in some of the things I've done like face-recognition, and it's useful in some other areas to if you wanna plot your lab data etc. I have never used the NN:s in my web development career though I am sure it could be used for something however what it all really boils down to is to find a client or employee willing pay for it when you can just take the straight path. So I would rather read book about it if I wasn't that hardcore about it. Fundamental Neural Networks doesn't take to much knowledge in math, and was what I used in my first course.
