Though you might want to avoid simple hash functions (for example, any half-baked idea that you could think up quickly) because they might not mix up the sentence data enough to avoid collisions in the first place, one of the standard cryptographic hash functions would probably be quite suitable, for example MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. You can use MD5 for this, even though collisions have been found and the algorithm is considered unsafe for security intensive purposes. This isn't a security critical application, and the collisions that have been found arose through carefully constructed data and probably won't arise randomly in your own NLP sentence data. (See, for example Johannes Schindelin 's explanation of why it's probably unnecessary to change git to use SHA-256 hashes, so that you can appreciate the reasoning behind this.)
