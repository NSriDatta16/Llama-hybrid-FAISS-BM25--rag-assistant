It is expected that the decision_function and predict methods of the OneVsOneClassifier class in scikit-learn may give different results in cases of ties. This is because the decision_function method returns the distances of the samples to the decision boundary for each class, while the predict method returns the class labels themselves. The decision_function method uses the distances to the decision boundary to break ties, while the predict method uses the order of the classes as determined by the classes_ attribute of the classifier. This attribute is determined when the classifier is fit, and it is the order in which the class labels are encountered during training. Therefore, the order of the classes in the classes_ attribute determines the class that is chosen in cases of ties by the `predict method. It is not possible to modify the implementation of the LIBSVM library, which is used by scikit-learn, to use the confidences in the decision function to break ties. However, you can use the decision_function method to make predictions, which will break ties using the confidences. Alternatively, you can use a different classifier that does not have this issue, such as a classifier that uses probability estimates to make predictions, such as the SVC class with the probability parameter set to True . In this case, the classifier will return the probabilities for each class, and you can use these probabilities to break ties and make predictions. I hope this helps clarify the difference between the decision_function and predict methods and how they handle cases of ties. Let me know if you have any further questions.
