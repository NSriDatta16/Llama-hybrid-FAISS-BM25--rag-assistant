Creating ODT and PDF files as end result

I've been working on an app to create various document formats for a while now, and I've had limited success. Ideally, I'd like to dynamically create a fairly simple ODT/PDF/DOC file. I've been focusing my efforts on ODT, because it is editable, and open enough that there are several tools which will convert it to any of the other formats I need. The problem is that the ODT XML files are NOT simple, and there aren't any good-quality API's I could find (especially in python). So far, I've had the most success creating a template ODT file, and then manipulating the DOM in python as needed. This is ok generally, but is quickly becoming inadequate and requires too much tweaking every single time I need to alter one of the templates. The requirements are: 1) Produce a simple document that will have lists, paragraphs, and the ability to draw simple graphics on the page (boxes, circles, etc...) 2) The ability to specify page size, and the different formats should generally print the exact same output when sent to a printer My questions: 1) Are there any other ways I can produce ODT/PDF/DOC files? 2) Would LaTeX be acceptable? I've never really used it, does anyone have experience converting LaTeX files into other formats? 3) Would it be possible to use HTML? There are a lot of converters online. Technically you can specify dimensions in mm/cm, etc..., but I am worried that the printed output will differ between browsers/converters.... Any other ideas?
