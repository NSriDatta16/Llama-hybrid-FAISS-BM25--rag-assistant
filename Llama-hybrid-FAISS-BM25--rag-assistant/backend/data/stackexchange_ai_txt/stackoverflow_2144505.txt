I am a TA, but in a different subject. I think Hello World is too boring, many students may already have some experience (the hacker type), and those are fun students. Maybe you could create some quick examples in Python, that will grab the attention, maybe something like simple graphics (fractals), simple networking (maybe send SMS to phone?). I think those can be done in a few minutes if you supply instructions.
