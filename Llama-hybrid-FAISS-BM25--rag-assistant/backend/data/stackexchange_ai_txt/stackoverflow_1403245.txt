Sun Java Tutorials for earlier versions of Java?

I'd like to read the Sun Java Swing tutorials for Java version 5. It's easy to find Sun's tutorials for SDK 6. My searches of Sun's site and using Google didn't turn up any links (yet) to the older tutorial. Even the tutorial link on the SDK 5 page pointed to the current tutorials. Are the older tutorials still available? If so, where? Thanks in advance for any assistance. P.S. For the curious among you, the handling of drag and drop changes between SDK 5 and SDK 6. I'd like to read the tutorial that pertains to the JVM I'm actually using.
