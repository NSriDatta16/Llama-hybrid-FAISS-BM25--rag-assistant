collate 500 excel sheets into database

i have 500 excel sheets which are used for data collection from various organisations i need to collate all the data into a variety of summary excel sheets at the moment this is all done manually, cut and paste and then create big forumlas to calculate across several sheets to tally it up i am looking to automate this somehow, I would like to run a set of tests on the excel files to make sure the data is correct, and them import it all into a database, and then spit summary sheets back out in excel format. is there something out there that does this sort of thing already, based on a set of rules ?
