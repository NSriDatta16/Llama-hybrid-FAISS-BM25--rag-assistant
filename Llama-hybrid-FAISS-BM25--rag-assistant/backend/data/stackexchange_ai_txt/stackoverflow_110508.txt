One thing to ask yourself is: do you really want to implement this type of behavior with checkboxes? Checkboxes already have a well-understood behavior from a user point of view, and having a seemingly random box become unchecked when a new one is checked will likely be very confusing or maybe even frustrating for the average user. Maybe consider something like a listbox with add/remove buttons, where the design of the list gives the user a visual cue that there is a max of (say) four items. As a reference, I'm thinking something along the lines of the toolbar customizing dialog in IE . Perhaps not the answer you were looking for, but something to consider.
