What operating system features I would advocate for Chrome OS? Here my wish list as a Plan 9/Inferno fan: Resources (ip stack, graphics, etc) as file systems. Network transparent file system (ie., 9P ). Private per-process namespaces. Factotum-like auth system (ie., no root user). Pure UTF-8 everywhere. Extremely lightweight processes. Automatic snapshot and de-duplicating storage (ala venti+fossil). And I guess many others, but this would be enough to make me quite happy. This is not a 'OS feature' per see, but I would love to have a GUI with mouse-chording.
