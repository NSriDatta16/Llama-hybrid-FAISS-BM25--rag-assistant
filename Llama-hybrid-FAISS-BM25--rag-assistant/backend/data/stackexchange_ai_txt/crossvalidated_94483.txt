Are Restricted Boltzmann Machines better than Stacked Auto encoders and why?

So I'm learning about deep learning. I first learned about stacked auto-encoders and now I'm learning about Restricted Boltzmann Machines. However non in the papers/tutorials I read I found them motivating why would one want to use RBM instead of auto-encoders. So what are the advantages of RBM over stacked auto-encoders? And when should one use RBM or auto-encoders?
