In Bayesian Linear Mixed models, there is no distinction between random effects and fixed effects. This is a terminology inherited from the classical framework (which is often useful to understand in order to communicate the results). This is explained in Chapter 15 (page 383, footnote) of Gelman et al. book Bayesian data analysis .
