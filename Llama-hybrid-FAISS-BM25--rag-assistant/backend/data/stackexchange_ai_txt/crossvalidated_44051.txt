Well, RBM is an energy based model, and as such it has undirected edges, and thus you could say "symmetric weights". The probability distribution over visible and hidden units, defined by the RBM is based on the Energy function: $$E = -\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} \, v_i \, h_j -\sum_i \alpha_i \, v_i - \sum_i \beta_i \, h_i$$ As you can see, even if you wanted to somehow introduce asymmetric weights, they would average out. In short, usage of asymmetric weights simply makes no sense in case of RBM, since it is an energy-based model defined by an undirected graph. Now, you wanted to know "What is the intuition behind this design decision". I guess you could ask this question here, "Why make RBM's energy based models defined by an undirected graph? Why not use a directed graph?". And it would be a damn deep question. The short answer is: you can. A model similar to RBM with directed egdes is called sigmoid belief net. They are directed graphs, and not energy based. They are different in how they are trained, and in where the problems with training arises. Since it's not directly connected to your original question, and I just thought you might be interested, I'll drop you great learning material for both RBM and sigmoid belief nets: https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/index The class is taught by Geoffrey Hinton himself. I highly recommend it if you are interested in neural networks in general. Also, it might be a good idea to download the videos now, since class closes in few weeks, and then they won't be available anymore. The lectures most relevant to your question, that will also really make your understanding of RBM much deeper are 11, 12, 13, 14.
