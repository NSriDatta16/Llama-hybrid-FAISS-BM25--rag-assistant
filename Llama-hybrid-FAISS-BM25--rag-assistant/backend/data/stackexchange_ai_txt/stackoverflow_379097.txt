You're doing what I do. My first tool for making a query comprehensible is good visual organization, which people in the question you reference are mostly doing, and testing in manageable chunks using LIMIT clauses. If non-correlated subqueries are involved, they can be run separately, of course. If there's a magic bullet, though, I don't know about it.
