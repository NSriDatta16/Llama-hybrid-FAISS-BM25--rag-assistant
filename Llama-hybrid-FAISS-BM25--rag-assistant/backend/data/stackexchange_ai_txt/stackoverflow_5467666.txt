In same way as Webbrowser control, is the "sourcecodeeditor" control of VSTO available to use as a project component? [. . .] Exists the class "MSVSTOSourceCodeEditor"? This is the question. Thanks Unfortunately, no. Microsoft doesn't allow you to subclass its source code editor, nor do they provide a version for use in your own projects. As I mentioned before, they don't really want to encourage you to rewrite Visual Studio. They'd prefer that you bought it instead! Have you considered creating a plug-in or extension for Visual Studio instead? It's a little bit different way of going about it, but it just might work for you. Your developers might find it more convenient since they won't have to switch back and forth between two programs. If you're really set on rolling your own custom solution, probably the best thing to do is check the source code for some of the open-source, Visual Studio-style IDEs, and see how they've written the code editor: MonoDevelop SharpDevelop KDevelop
