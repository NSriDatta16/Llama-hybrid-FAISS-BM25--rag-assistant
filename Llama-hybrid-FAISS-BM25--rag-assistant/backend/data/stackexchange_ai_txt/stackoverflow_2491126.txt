Silverlight Vs. WPF Vs. Winforms What is good for specifically my purpose?

I am about to start a new Windows applications and the contenders for the platform are: Windows Forms WPF Silverlight Now my experience with WPF at least in my last application was not very encouraging (the app failed to run on the deployment machines and I had to re-do it in Winforms). So my confidence is shaken here. My app is for mass-distribution (the last version had some 100,000+ installations). So I want to make absolutely sure that my users will be able to use it and enjoy it without any problems. I would love to create a nice interface, going the next step like a Flex or Silverlight, iPhone app, with animations and effects. So I would really like to go with WPF or Silverlight if I can. My needs are Good support for visuals and animation effects. Support for database connectivity. Support for printing (Is there an equivalent of PrintDocument in Silverlight) Must not suffer from deployment troubles. Silverlight is universal, but does it have printing support and good controls toolset? WPF has printing support and a nice toolset, but can I depend on it? Winforms is dated already and is not so impressive, but should I go with it anyway? Your advice would be appreciated
