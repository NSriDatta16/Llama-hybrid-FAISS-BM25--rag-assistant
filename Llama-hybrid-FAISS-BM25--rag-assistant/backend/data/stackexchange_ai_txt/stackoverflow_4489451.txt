extend jquery draggable/droppable to support on iPad and iPhone

I've been using JQuery draggable/droppables in my application from last 1 year. Now, the application needs to be supported over iPad and iPhones. Known, above JQuery won't support drag/drop over iPads... I'm looking for a some JQuery plugin or so which I can connect to my existing JQuery codes for drag/drop over iPad. After googling, I found some alternate ways like, JQTouch, jquerymobile etc.. But, it looks I would then need to do massive changes (or, write a complete drag/drop things from scratch) in my application :( My application is very heavy and hence looking for some quick/easy way to connect my existing JQuery solution into iPad touch events etc.... Please help Thanks in advance
