Time series test data dilema

Iâ€™m trying to build a model to predict the amount of sales of a product for the next few days This question is about whether or not I should use the tail of the serie as the test set and train models using the rest of the data or I should create a test set picking dates at random as usual Reading about classical time series models (ARIMA), they recommend the first approach (using the last days as test) but I feel weird doing this when applying a machine learning model What is the correct approach? Any advantage or disadvantage using one or the other?
