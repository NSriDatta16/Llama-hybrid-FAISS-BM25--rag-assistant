I like the Head Firs t series by O'Reilly Publishing. They have a few web related ones, I'm already pretty familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, so I just got their web design book listed below, but it referenced the XHTML book a lot. So, if you wanted to check out those books you might want to read them in this order: Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML Head First Web Design Then if you're interested in client-side or server-side scripting, maybe these would be good (I haven't read them, but I like the format of the books...not as boring as tech books): Head First Javascript (client-side script) Head First PHP & MySQL (server-side script and database) Head First Rails (server-side scripting language framework for Ruby language) Anyway, there are also books for Java (which can be run on a web host) and deeper software development related topics as well. Also, after getting acquainted with javascript a little (maybe from w3schools as @rmk suggested) I'd encourage you to learn the jQuery javascript framework , which makes writing javascript code much easier, and much more cross-browser friendly.
