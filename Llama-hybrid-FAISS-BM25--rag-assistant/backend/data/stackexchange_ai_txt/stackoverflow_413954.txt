Drop caps in pdfLaTeX

I want to find a way to produce drop caps (large initial letters several lines high) in pdfLaTeX. I know that there is a dropping package which works well when used with latex + dvips . However, when used with pdflatex the result looks ugly. My source file is: \documentclass[12pt]{article} % for pdflatex file.tex # dropping is ugly % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} % \usepackage[pdftex]{dropping} % for latex file.tex ; dvips -T 12cm,8cm file.dvi # dropping is OK \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} \usepackage{dropping} \usepackage[papersize={12cm,8cm}, left=0.5cm,right=0.5cm, top=0.5cm,bottom=0.5cm]{geometry} \begin{document} \dropping[-3pt]{3}{W}ith a drop cap, the initial sits within the margins and runs several lines deep into the paragraph, pushing some normal-sized text off these lines. This keeps the left and top margins of the paragraph flush. In~modern browsers, this can be done with a combination of HTML and CSS by~using the float: left; setting. \end{document} When I compile it as latex drop.tex && dvips -T 12cm,8cm drop.dvi the result is OK: When I uncomment [pdftex] lines and compile it as pdflatex drop.tex the results is: Can anyone suggest a better way to produce drop caps with pdflatex ?
