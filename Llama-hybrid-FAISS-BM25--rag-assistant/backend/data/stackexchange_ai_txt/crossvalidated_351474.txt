Does it make sense to run DBSCAN on the output from t-SNE?

Performed time series clustering where I used DTW to generate a distance matrix. The distance matrix was then given as an input to t-SNE where the two-dimensional results from t-SNE were used for clustering with DBSCAN. Does it make sense?
