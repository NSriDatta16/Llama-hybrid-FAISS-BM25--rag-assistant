Is it possible to take the mean of a time series when it is not stationary?

Many guides, when determining the mean of a time series $X_{t}$ , assumes that $X_{t}$ must be stationary before calculating $\hat{\mu}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T} x_{i}$ . But consider the following example: I want to get the mean number of daily COVID cases over the last year. Assume $X_{t}$ is a process chronicling daily covid cases for a year and that $X_{t} \sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$ . (This distribution is probably incorrect in the real world, but stay with me for this example). If modeled this way, $\mu$ may vary from month to month depending on regulations and world events. Using differencing, $X_t$ cannot be converted to a stationary process, so I cannot follow the methods outlined in textbooks like here . But at the end of the day, I just want the mean number of covid cases in a year. Is it really so bad to just get the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and report that? I feel like I may be getting conceptually confused here, so could use some guidance on where I may be misunderstanding the problem.
