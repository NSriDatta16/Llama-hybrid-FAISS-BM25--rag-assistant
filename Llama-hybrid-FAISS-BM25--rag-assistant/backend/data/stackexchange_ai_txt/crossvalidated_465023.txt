Variable importance based on predictive R-squared

I found the paper Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning . Accesible, for example, via https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/download/ML.pdf . The authors state on page 2247 We discover influential covariates by ranking them according to a notion of variable importance, which we denote as $VI_j$ for the $j$ th input variable. We consider two different notions of importance. The first is the reduction in panel predictive $R^2$ from setting all values of predictor $j$ to zero, while holding the remaining model estimates fixed (used, e.g., in the context of dimension reduction by Kelly, Pruitt, and Su 2019). The second, .... This seems like a nice way to do variable importance selection. It seemed to me that it solves the problem of highly correlated variables (maybe I am wrong?). I did not see this method before, and I find it hard to find a good source online. Does anyone know how to do this in R?
