The standard deviation is a summary metric which can be calculated for any set of numbers, but that doesn't mean that captures something "useful" about that set of numbers in all cases. What you're seeing here is that you have a set of numbers with little variation for the most part, plus a few outlier samples which are the main contributors to the standard deviation. Summary metrics that are highly dependent on a small set of samples tend to not be very useful, since they say more about that small set of samples than they do about the population as a whole, rather defeating the purpose of the summary. On its face, this doesn't seem like a terribly useful way of categorizing YoY changes, since 90% of the values get categorized the same. The use of "1 SD from the mean" is convenient for normally distributed populations as it's a fixed threshold that provides "reasonably sized" groups on either side of the threshold. But for an arbitrary distribution, 1 SD may or may not have any particular useful meaning at all. Some distributions are entirely contained within 1 SD of the mean, in which case trying to threshold values 1 SD from the mean is pointless. You see a similar effect in other outlier-dependent summary statistics like the mean. For example, the mean net worth in the US is nearly $1M, but this is dragged way up a small number of billionaires, so many would view it as a misleading summary statistic. The median net worth is barely \$100k, which most would view as a better summary of the population. Whenever using summary statistics, it's worthwhile to make sure that it's summarizing a useful aspect of the population as a whole.
