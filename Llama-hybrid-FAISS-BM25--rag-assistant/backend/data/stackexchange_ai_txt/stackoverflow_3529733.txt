Have you considered SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) ? This MS tool is very powerful and allows you to build up complex actions such as getting data from different sources, sorting, merging and generally messing with it, and outputting it to various places. And you can code anything that's not supported out of the box in .Net. Of course this isn't your own app so you're limited in how people interact with it (basically by running predefined scripts), testing is going to be more difficult, and you're dragging & dropping instead of writing code (which generally sucks!). So not much use if your users have to dynamically create new tasks, but if it does suit the bill it might well be the quickest way. Other than that, it sounds like you might be looking at writing some kind of Domain Specific Language (DSL) for your users to input into your app, but that's going to be a lot of work.
