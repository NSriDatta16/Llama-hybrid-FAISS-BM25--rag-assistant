How to display available branches in Android source tree?

Following directions on Android's main website to pull down sources, I'm looking at this command to initialize repo for the cupcake branch: repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git -b cupcake How can I view all available branches besides cupcake, i.e eclair, donut, etc...?
