Interpreting logistic regression interactions predicted probability versus logit

I have a logistic regression, and I am interested in the interaction between two categorical variables: one (let's call it A) is a continuous variable categorized in 20 quantiles, the other (B) is a categorical variable that can take 3 values. I use ventiles because the effect of A on C is highly non-linear and it is a simple way to account for it. I ran the model and used predict.glm to predict the outcome/dependent variable for several values of the covariates/independant variables. I used both type = "link" and type = "response" . reg Results suggest that the difference in predicted probability between groups of B is getting large as A increases. But this is mainly due to the transformation from logit to predicted probability since the model shows no interaction effects between A and B (see graphs below). Then, my question is: how do I interpret those results? Can I say that, in light of the second plot, as A increases, the effect of A on C is higher for group 1 than for group 3? or, in other words, that the relationship between A and C is different among levels of C (on the pred. prob. scale)?
