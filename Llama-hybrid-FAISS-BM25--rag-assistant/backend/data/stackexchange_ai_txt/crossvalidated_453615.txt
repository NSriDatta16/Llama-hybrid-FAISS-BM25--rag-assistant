How to deal with unbalanced time series data for machine learning?

My understanding when it comes to unbalanced datasets is that we can randomly sample from the dominant class. What are some ways to deal with unbalanced data when we have time series data and the goal is to either build a boosting tree or neural network? Thanks!
