Can I use non-linear PCA (CATPCA?) on my multivariate dataset that contains nominal AND ordinal data?

In my multivariate dataset I have over 100 objects/cases that have been coded on 20 different variables. Several variables are ordinal and several variables are nominal. Is it possible to use non-linear principal components analysis as a dimension reduction technique on this dataset? I am not certain how to approach optimal scaling with the two types of variables simultaneously.
