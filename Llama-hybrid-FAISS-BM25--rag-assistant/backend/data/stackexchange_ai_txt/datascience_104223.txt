Most explicitly: did the models increase the top line or help out the bottom line? By what degree? That's really what stakeholders are concerned about in my opinion. More implicitly: did the work you did allow for the model making process to be streamlined? If so, to what degree? Does the pre-work make a huge difference (obviously yes but you might have to spell it out). The point of having a data science team is to leverage massive quantities of data to make decisions. How many decisions were made based on your work either wholly or partially?
