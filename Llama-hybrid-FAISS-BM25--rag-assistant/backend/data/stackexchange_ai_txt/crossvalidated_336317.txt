Given that this is sale in an online webshop, your numbers in each cell in such a randomized* experiment are hopefully large (otherwise it may not be worthwhile to fine-tune minor details of the online shop), then I would not even bother with an exact test. E.g. a logistic regression (whether frequentist with likelihood ratio test + profile likelihood CI or Bayesian analysis with credible intervals) should be just fine and in fact allows you much more ability to adjust for additional information on customers (or the time of day they visit on etc.). In fact, statistical significance may be a bit irrelevant. I.e. even things with a tiny impact will likely achieve statistical significance (and if they do not, the confidence/credible impact for the impact will likely exclude the possibility of a meaningful impact). When you have lots of possible things to potentially implement, then some of those with a tiny impact may not be a priority. Thus, it will likely be important to get an estimate of the effect of a change to the online shop, which again logistic regression could be a pretty good choice for. *: Doing anything other than a randomized experiment, where you randomly pick visitors and show them one version of the webpage or the other is just making your life complicated for no reason. E.g. doing one thing in one month and then something else in the next month is just not a good idea (Suprise! Christmas presents sold better in December than in January!).
