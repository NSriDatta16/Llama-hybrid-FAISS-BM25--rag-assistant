Three options that I can see immediately (Tuple is used to represent the coordinates in your matrix): You could use a BitArray for each point in the matrix, the bit is set if the coordinate has an O, cost would be O(row length x column length) for storage. Retrieval is O(1) if you know the coordinates you want to check otherwise, O(n) if you just want to find all O's You could use a List > to only store the coordinates for each O in the matrix, cost would be O(m) for storage, m being the number of O's. Retrieval is also O(m) Alternatively to option 2 you could use a Dictionary , bool> , which allows O(1) retrieval time if you know the coordinates you want to check.
