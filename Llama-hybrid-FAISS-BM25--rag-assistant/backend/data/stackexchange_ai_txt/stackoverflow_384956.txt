As Hernan already said, add a custom build step that makes a copy of the intermediate file that contains the build results (warnings). Not sure how to do naming for this, but you could create a bat file that gets called as a custom build step. Why you would want to save warnings is beyond me. Treat them as errors, or ignore them or pragma/disable them.
