Independent t-test: non-significant different!

I ran ind. t-test and find that no significant different for the two means. So, does this meant discouraging? Mean for A is higher than B, so i did planned to conclude that A is actually favoring compared to B. However, in my current state with no significant different btw the two means, what can i conclude from the different mean score since that were not statistically different? please helps!
