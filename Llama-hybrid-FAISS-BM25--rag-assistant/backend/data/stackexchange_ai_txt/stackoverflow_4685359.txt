Don't do it. Use the class nesting sparingly just for simple internal use classes. The fact that you are trying to split them out into different files tells you something - ie that you have gone a bit overboard with the nested classes. Using them publicly out side of your code is ugly ugly. If you need to keep things internal use the internal modifier. Name spaces and project folders can help you keep everything organized.
