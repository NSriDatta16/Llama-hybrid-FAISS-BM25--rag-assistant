How much is moderate violation to normality for one sample t-test?

I want to test if my data have a mean equal to zero (Ho: mu=0). The sample size in not large (n=21). My variable is numerical with average -0.10 and sample_sd 0.05. I don't know the population variance. The only test I know to do this, is t-test. I checked for normality using Shapiro Wilks and it gets rejected (therefore no evidence of normality). I understand that t is relatively robust to moderate violations of the normality assumption; what is not clear to me is, how much is moderate? I do need to run other test like this for other samples. May someone be so kind to provide me with examples of how much can I deviate in skewness and kurtosis for sample sizes between 12 and 25? What else can I do to test against zero if I can't use t-test? Thank you in advance
