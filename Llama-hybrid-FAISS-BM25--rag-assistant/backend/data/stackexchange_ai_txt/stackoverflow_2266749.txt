Your problem is discussed on the Java Forum: // Write a custom toolkit public class MyToolkit extends sun.awt.windows.WToolkit { public void beep() { } } // Set this property System.setProperty("awt.toolkit", "MyPackage.MyToolkit"); NOTE: The use of this workaround is discouraged. You should still try to find the root of the problem. Edit: Removed a link, since the thread on Java Forum is now offline.
