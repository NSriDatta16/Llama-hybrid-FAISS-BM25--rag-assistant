I have been happily using Derby's Eclipse plug-in for data storage and retrieval. There is a good step-by-step tutorial that assumes very little prior knowledge. Follow these installation instructions , and you should be up and running fairly soon. Once you get it installed in Eclipse, there is additional useful information. Launch Eclipse and bring up the Help for the Derby plug-ins. Help >> Help Contents>> Derby Plug-in User Guide.
