ASp.net MVC with Report Viewer?

How can i set up rdlc (report file,with Reprort viewer) on ASP.net MVC 2.0? I have created rdlc file.. And when i drag report viewer in the mvc page it shuffles and it doest not fit like what weve done in winform application / webform . Even you create new My First MVC application Report viewer also distorted.I place the report viewer in a table and not still fit. I tried to create a webform that excluded in my mvc masterpage and the report viewer fits well. Whats should i do? Thanks in regards..
