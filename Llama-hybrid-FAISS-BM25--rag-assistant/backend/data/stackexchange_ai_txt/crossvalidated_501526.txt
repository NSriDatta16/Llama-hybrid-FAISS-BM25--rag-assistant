One easy answer it to use Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. Simulate values of the parameters that are consistent with the data, then plug them into your function. Repeat thousands of times, getting thousands of values of your function. Count how many are more (less) than zero, and divide by the number of simulations. These probabilities give a sensible answer to your question.
