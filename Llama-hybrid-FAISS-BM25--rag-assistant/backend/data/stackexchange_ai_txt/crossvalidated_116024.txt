One class goes missing. I am new to R and unable to understand what is happening here. So this isn't an issue with R, one class should "go missing" in any software package you use. The multinomial logit is estimated by regressing a log odds ratio against a set of linear predictors, and one of the classes is chosen as a pivot for the other variables. For example, in the regular logit case, you have two classes, let's label them class 0 and class 1 . Let $Y_i$ be the class of observation $i$, and let $X_i$ be vector of predictors for observation $i$. Then a logistic regression estimates $$\log\frac{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1)}{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=0)} = \beta_0 X_i .$$ Here 0 is the pivot class. Note that there are two classes, but we only get one set of coefficients, namely $\beta_0$. Now let's suppose we want to estimate a multinomial logit with three classes, and label the classes 0 , 1 , and 2 . Let's again choose 0 to be the pivot class. Then the multinomial logistic regression estimates the two equations $$\log\frac{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1)}{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=0)} = \beta_1 X_i$$ and $$\log\frac{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=2)}{\mathbb{P}(Y_i=0)} = \beta_2 X_i .$$ Here, we have three classes, but two sets of coefficients, namely $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. Keep in mind that $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are vectors, so if you have five predictors, then $\beta_1=(\beta_{1,1},\beta_{1,2},\beta_{1,3},\beta_{1,4},\beta_{1,5})^\prime$ and likewise for the other coefficient vectors.
