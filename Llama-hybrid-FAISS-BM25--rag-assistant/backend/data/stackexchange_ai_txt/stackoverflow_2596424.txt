External event to Fullcalendar

I need to create a dynamic page with a plugin called Fullcalendar. I want to drag an event (div) to the calendar from a sidebar. Any idea how to do this with Fullcalendar or with an other plugin? Any example? I found this link http://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/tree/fcdraggable , but it doesn't work fine for me and it has some bugs.
