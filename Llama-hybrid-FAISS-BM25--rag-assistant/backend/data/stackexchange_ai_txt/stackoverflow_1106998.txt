Regular expressions are for data that is REGULAR, that follows a pattern. So if your data is completely random, no, there's no elegant way to do this with regex. On the other hand, if you know what values you want, you can probably write a few simple regexes, and then just test them all on each string. Ex. regex1= address # grabber, regex2 = street type grabber, regex3 = name grabber. Attempt a match on string1 with regex1, regex2, and finally regex3. Move on to the next string.
