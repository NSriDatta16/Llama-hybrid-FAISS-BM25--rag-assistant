How much disk space should I reserve for my Subversion repository?

What are the best practices with respect to planning disk space for a Subversion repository that will host average development projects (i.e., with text files mostly and the odd binray here and there)? If, for instance, my project takes up, say, 100Mb as my working copy, how much space should I reserve for the repository to be comfortable?
