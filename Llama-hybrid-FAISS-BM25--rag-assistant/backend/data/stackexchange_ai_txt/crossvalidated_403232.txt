Why does differentiating the normalization term of a Binomial Distribution yield the expected value?

In Bishop's book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, problem 2.4 aims to derive the expected value of the binomial distribution $m \sim Bin(N, \mu) = {N \choose m} \mu^m (1 - \mu)^{N-m}$ by differentiating the normalizing constant $\sum_{m=0}^N {N \choose m} \mu^m (1-\mu)^{N-m}$ with respect to the parameter $\mu$ . I can algebraically solve the problem, but why does differentiating this normalizing constant yield $\mathbb{E}[m]$ ? Edit: To clarify, I'm asking WHY this result emerges, not how. I can do the algebra myself.
