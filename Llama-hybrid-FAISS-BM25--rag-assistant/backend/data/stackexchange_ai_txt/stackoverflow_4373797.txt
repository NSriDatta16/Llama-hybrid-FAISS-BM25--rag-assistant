MPMoviePlayerController : Trouble stopping video and switching back to iPhone app

I am making an iPhone app, where in there is a requirement for embedding video into the app. I am using MPMoviePlayerController class instance to play the video inside my iPhone app. Now how to stop the video and come back to the application when the video finishes ? Right now even after the video finishes the moviePlayer ( i.e. instance of MPMoviePlayerController ) remains open. Please Help and Suggest.
