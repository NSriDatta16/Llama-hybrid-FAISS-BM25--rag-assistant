You can usually tweak the optimizer with #pragma statements. I don't know the exact syntax for your compiler, but you should be able to find it in the docs which come with your compiler/ide. Something like this #pragma optimize( "", off ) //now the function which should not be optimized #pragma optimize( "", on )
