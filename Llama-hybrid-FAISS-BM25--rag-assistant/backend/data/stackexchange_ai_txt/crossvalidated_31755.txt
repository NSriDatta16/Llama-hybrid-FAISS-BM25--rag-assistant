What to do when the means of two samples are significantly different but the difference seems too small to matter

I have two samples ( $n \approx 70$ in both cases). The means differ by about twice the pooled std. dev. The resulting $T$ value is approximately 10. Whilst it's great to know that I have conclusively shown that the means are not the same, this seems to me to be driven by the large n. Looking at histograms of the data I certainly do not feel that such as small p-value is really representative of the data and, to be honest, don't really feel comfortable quoting it. I'm probably asking the wrong question. What I'm thinking is: ok, the means are different but does that really matter as the distributions share a significant overlap? Is this where Bayesian testing is useful? If so, where is a good place to start, a bit of googling hasn't yielded anything useful but I may not by asking the right question. If this is the wrong thing does anyone have any suggestions? Or is this simply a point for discussion as opposed to quantitative analysis?
