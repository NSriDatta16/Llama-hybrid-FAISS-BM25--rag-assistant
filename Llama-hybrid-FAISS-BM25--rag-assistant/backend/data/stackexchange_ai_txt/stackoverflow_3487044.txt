TouchesBegan on specific object

I've been searching on google for that , but didn't found any answer. I want to use TouchesBegan but on a specific object, like a textview, a label, ... I've tried to replace "any object" by the pointer of my object but it doesn't work. Is there on other way to detect the touch on a object with a method , in witch I can tell after : do something ? , like in the touchesbegan method but for a specific object ? Thank you in advance for your answers / or sample code would be great ;o) Have a nice day ! Robin
