Trivially speaking, an image is also an ordered sequence of random variables, if you imagine unrolling the image along one axis. The idea of 'time' is really just there to give an intuitive understanding to the order; that could just as easily be replaced by 'location' and then you have an image. In the context of your questions: (1) Each feature vector for $f_{object}$ is an ordered set of random variables of size $d$ (2) Both are acceptable ways of considering this. If your $N$ different images are ordered in time, as in a video, then you might prefer to work with it as a $N$ member time series, where each member is of dimension $d$, but in terms of the object itself it has no preference.
