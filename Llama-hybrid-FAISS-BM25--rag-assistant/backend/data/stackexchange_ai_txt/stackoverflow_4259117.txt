The whole point of EF is to save me from having to write mind-numbingly tedious data access code that will be error prone. Right, and the way it does this is by writing the boilerplate code for you, using a T4 transform. I know someone is probably thinking I could write a T4 template to generate all this code for me, but that just brings me back to the point that it is tedious boilerplate code that adds no real value. ... which is why leveraging T4 seems like an obvious way to solve this problem. The code you're describing is no more tedious than the code that the Entity Framework is already generating for you. You can actually change your entity contexts so that the .edmx.cs files are generated by your own custom T4 template in the first place, rather than by Visual Studio's built-in transform. I've not had to use stored procedures in Entity Framework yet, so there may be a better way to do what you're describing, but I wouldn't be too quick to discount the T4 approach if it can solve your problems adequately.
