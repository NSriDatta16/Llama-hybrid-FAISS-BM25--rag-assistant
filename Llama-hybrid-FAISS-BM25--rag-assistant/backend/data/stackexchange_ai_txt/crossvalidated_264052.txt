You need to make an experiment where the same student papers is given to two different TAs. Then you can compare results, maybe with kappa or Krippendorffs alpha (which are coefficients of agreement). Also make plots, a good plot will be of differences in grade (between the two TAs) against the average. Such a plot is often called Tukey mean-difference plot or a Bland-Altman plot. See Agreement between methods with multiple observations per individual for some examples, or search this site.
