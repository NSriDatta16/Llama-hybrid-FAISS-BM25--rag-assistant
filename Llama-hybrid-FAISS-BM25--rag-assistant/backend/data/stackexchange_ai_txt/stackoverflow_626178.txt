I'd recommend a basic course in propositional logic for every aspiring programmer. At first, the notation and Greek letters may seem off-putting to the math-averse, but it is really one of the most powerful (and oft-neglected) tools in your skillset, and rather simple, at the core. The basic operators , de Morgan's and other basic laws , truth tables , and existence of e.g. disjunctive and conjunctive normal forms were an eye-opener to me. Before I learned about them, conditional expressions felt like dangerous beasts. Ever since, I know that I can whip them into submission whenever necessary by breaking out the heavy artillery!
