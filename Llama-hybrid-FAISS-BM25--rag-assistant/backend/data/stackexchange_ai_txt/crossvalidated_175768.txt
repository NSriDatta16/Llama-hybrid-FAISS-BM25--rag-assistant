The results of averaging the predicted probabilistic response will give you the proportion of cases (or instances when the stock moved up) in your dataset which is 18.7%. Only if exactly half of such cases involve a stock moving up would you expect the average response to be 0.5. Logistic regression is often used to analyze risk factors for a rare outcome in case-control studies. These studies use outcome dependent sampling to match controls to cases, usually in a 1-1 fashion. Given how common these types of models, I presume you must have conflated some properties of study design.
