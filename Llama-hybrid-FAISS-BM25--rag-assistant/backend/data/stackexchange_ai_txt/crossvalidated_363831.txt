It seems that this is the case for a classic paired t-test. A paired t-test is used to compare two population means where you have two samples in which observations in one sample can be paired with observations in the other sample. In your case, you can pair the observations for the same recording and in each case you can calculate: Di = Xi - Yi Xi = Average of the accuracy of the old workers for audio file i Yi = Average of the accuracy of the new workers for audio file i Di = Difference of average accuracy of old workers vs new workers. Having your variables Di calculated for your 40 observations, you can calculate the Standard Deviation and average and perform a simple t-test and calculate your confidence interval. If Your confidence interval includes 0, it means there is no statistical difference between the old and new workers accuracy.
