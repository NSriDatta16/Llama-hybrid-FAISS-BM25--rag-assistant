Without any deep knowledge of the mySQL engine, I'd say this sounds like a memory saving strategy. I assume the reason is behind this paragraph from the docs : Each BLOB or TEXT value is represented internally by a separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all other data types, for which storage is allocated once per column when the table is opened. It seems like pre-filling these column types would lead to memory usage and performance penalties.
