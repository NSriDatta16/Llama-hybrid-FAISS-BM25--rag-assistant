I know OR operator but the question was rather how to organize the structure so it can look ahead and behind. I'm going to explain what I have done so far var strPattern:String = '(?!to )(? First line is the same line in my question, it searches structures like to bail out for cases where you type out. Second line is for matching structures like to cross out/off. But we need something else to match to cross out/off if the word is off. So, the third line add that extra condition.
