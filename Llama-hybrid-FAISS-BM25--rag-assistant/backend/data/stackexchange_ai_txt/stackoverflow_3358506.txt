There is nothing in the posted code that would trigger a crash. Depending on how titleLogoImage is defined, it might be affects by the autorelease. However, beyond the problems outlined by mvds , you have no pressing needs for a localized autorelease pool. It will do nothing here but cause you trouble. Autorelease pools are dangerous and not for beginners. They will kill any autoreleased objects in them. You generally only create your own pool when you are rapidly creating a large number of memory intensive objects. That does not appear to be the case here. Despite the attention given them, custom pools are seldom used. After over a decade Apple API work, I can probably count on my fingers the number of times I have used my own custom pool.
