When you dummy encode for logistic regression, how do you determine the feature importance for the reference group?

Say you have an IV that can be k different categorical values, and you are trying to do logistic regression. To avoid multicollinearity, you dummy encode the IV into k-1 variables, with one of the categories being the reference group. represented by zeros in all k-1 columns. For all other categories, the corresponding beta value will be representative of the feature importance, but how do you determine the feature importance for the reference group? Also, how would you do this if Lasso regularization is used, and several betas were dropped?
