How can I approach this Neural Network problem?

Suppose, I have the following data-set: ... ... ... ... AABBB 7.027 5.338 5.335 8.122 5.537 6.408 ABBBA 5.338 5.335 5.659 5.537 5.241 7.043 BBBAA 5.335 5.659 6.954 5.241 8.470 8.474 BBAAA 5.659 6.954 5.954 8.470 9.266 9.334 BAACA 6.954 5.954 6.117 9.266 9.243 12.200 AABAA 5.954 6.117 6.180 9.243 8.688 11.842 ACAAA 6.117 6.180 5.393 8.688 5.073 7.722 ABAAC 6.180 5.393 6.795 5.073 8.719 7.854 BAACC 5.393 6.795 5.796 8.719 9.196 9.705 ... ... ... ... Apparently, the feature values represent a string pattern comprising of only three letters A , B , and C . I have to design a neural network that would be able to detect these patterns and spit out a binary representation of these strings where the letters should be encoded in 3-bit binary (one-hot encoding). How should I approach this problem to solve it?
