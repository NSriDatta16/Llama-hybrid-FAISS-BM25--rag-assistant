Maybe this has been answered already (a few answers above are "correct" ways of doing this), but I thought I'd just add my solution as well. Our iFrame is loaded within a div, hence I needed something else then window.height. And seeing our project already relies heavily on jQuery, I find this to be the most elegant solution: $("iframe").height($("#middle").height()); Where of course "#middle" is the id of the div. The only extra thing you'll need to do is recall this size change whenever the user resizes the window. $(window).resize(function() { $("iframe").height($("#middle").height()); });
