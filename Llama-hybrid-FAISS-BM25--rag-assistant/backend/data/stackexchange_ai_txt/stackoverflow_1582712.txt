For point 3, probably the majority of developers these days would say the single-return rule is simply flat wrong, and on average leads to worse code. Others see that it a written-down rule, with historical credentials, some code that breaks it is hard to read, and so not following it is simply wrong. You seem to agree with the first camp, but lack the confidence to tell the tool to turn off that rule. The thing to remember is it is an easy rule to code in any checking tool, and some people do want it. So it is pretty much always implemented by them. Whereas few (if any) enforce the more subjective 'guard; body; return calculation;' pattern that generally produces the easiest-to-read and simplest code. So if you are looking at producing good code , rather than simply avoiding the worst code , that is one rule you probably do want to turn off.
