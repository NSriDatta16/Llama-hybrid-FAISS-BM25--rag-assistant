Better to use Collab indeed. Kaggle also provides notebooks with 38h GPU and also 30 hours of TPU per week you might want to have a look at that as well (plus Kaggle allows you to use your GCP credentials so you can link private google cloud storage buckets to your Kaggle notebook). On Kaggle you will also find plenty of public notebooks that can be of great help
