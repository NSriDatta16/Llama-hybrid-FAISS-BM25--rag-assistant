VBScript "Type Mismatch" issue with "[in, out] BSTR * " parameter

I'm working with third-party COM object that has some of its methods passing values back as BSTR pointer. Since VBscript supports only Variant type attempts to use in a way like Object.Method(sMyString) reasonably end with "Type mismatch" error. I suspect this error is generated by the COM object itself rather then VBscript interpreter since the object gets string instead of pointer. I tried to workaround it defining array of strings but it's still the same error. So I was wondering if someone had similar problem and what workarounds were utilized. Just to emphasize. I DO NOT have control over COM object. It's in Vendor's application. I have to use it "as is". Thank you, Albert Gareev
