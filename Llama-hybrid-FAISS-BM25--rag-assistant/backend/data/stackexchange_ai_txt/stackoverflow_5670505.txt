Drag-and-drop to custom task pane in Excel VSTO

Arr, I am stuck! I'm writing an Excel add-in that opens up a custom task pane (it's a data analysis tool type of thing). In the interest of productivity I want to enable the user to drag an object, such as a file or email attachment, onto a part of that task pane for processing, rather than have to go through one or more file dialogs. The problem is that Excel seems to completely override the drag/drop properties of the custom task pane and the controls it contains, so that when I drop a file onto the task pane, Excel simply tries to open it as a spreadsheet (and succeeds if it's a supported file type), and my DragDrop event never fires. Is there any way to make Excel stop doing this so the drop event gets sent to the task pane?
