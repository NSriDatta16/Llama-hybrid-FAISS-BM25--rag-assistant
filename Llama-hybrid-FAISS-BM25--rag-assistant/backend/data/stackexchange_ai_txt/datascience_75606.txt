Is it ok to trust regression predictions when none of the coefficients are statistically significant?

Background to the problem: I am estimating individual treatment effects using double machine learning model . I do not know true treatment effects for my problem. Double ML: Given Y (outcome), T (treatment) and X ( features) Y = aT + bX + error coefficient a is of interest (measures treatment effect) . Double ML procedure: Fit Y ~ X => Compute residuals (Y* = Y – Y’) – Residuals are treatment effects to be estimated Fit T ~ X => Compute residuals (T* = T- T’) – This model captures variation in T explained by X Fitting a model (Y* ~ T* ) on residuals will give the average treatment effects I am fitting a linear regression model (Y* ~ T* ) and none of the coefficients are statistically significant. Instead of relying on point estimates, I am computing prediction confidence intervals and p-value to check if the predicted value is statistically significant or not. Is this approach good?
