Field value objects are stored as strings in the Sharepoint database. For simple values (e.g. "Hello world") this is simple enough. But for complex field values - such as an ID/value pair, how to store the entire value as a single string is obviously more complex as well. Each field value class in Sharepoint is responsible for its own storage implementation. ToString() is responsible for writing a string representation of the value; while the field value's constructor takes a string and is responsible for parsing that and setting all the properties on itself appropriately. For example, the SPFieldUrlValue (which represents an description ) has Url and Description properties. Creating a new SPFieldUrlValue(string fieldValue) object will parse the value and set the properties accordingly. In order to get a true/correct (and often strongly-typed!) representation of the field value, you must know what type the field is, and what that field's value class is.
