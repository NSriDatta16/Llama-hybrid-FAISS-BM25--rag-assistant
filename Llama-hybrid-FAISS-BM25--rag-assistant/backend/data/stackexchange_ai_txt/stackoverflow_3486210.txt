Why can I do 'if (a = 7) ...' but not 'if (var a = 7) ...'?

Why does if (prev = this.Prev()) { ... } work but if (var prev = this.Prev()) { ... } does not? this.Prev() is a method for a Point object which returns a reference to a previous Point if it exists, and false if it does not. I don't want to declare the variable to be global, and I don't want something verbose like: var prev = this.Prev(); if (prev) { ... } EDIT: What's the most elegant way to do something like what I am trying?
