Take a look at Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data in Political Analysis 9 (2001): 137-63 by Gary King and Langche Zeng. There really isn't a problem using logistic regression modelling in the case you described. The issues is that your estimates will have small-sample bias. You can use exact logistic regression if your sample isn't too big or you can use the method described in the paper above which is based off of a penalized-likelihood approach.
