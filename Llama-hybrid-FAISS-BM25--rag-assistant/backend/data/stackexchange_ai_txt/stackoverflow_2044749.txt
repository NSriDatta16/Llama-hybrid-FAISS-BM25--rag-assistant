organizing technical and user-facing error messages in php

I'm having a little trouble organizing my error messages for two interacting classes. One object has states that are 'error-ish', where something went wrong, or happened unexpectedly, but the situation is still salvageable. I don't want to use exceptions, 1. because they only have a single string for the message, and 2. because I want to access the object after the error. At the very least, I want to use some of its get() methods to construct a useful error message after the exception! Ultimately I have two messages I want to communicate: one to myself as the coder, that something went wrong. This string would have the technical details of the file, line, function/method, arguments, and results. Obviously, I don't want to show this to the user, so there is another string of an error message that I want to show the user ("That email address was not found" kind of thing ). So the thought occurs to me to build an error message array, which could use the error code from exceptions, or a status code, as keys for various messages. ( Though if I do this, where do I store the array of messages? ) Another option might be to make an error status object. Is there anything like "error patterns", similar to design patterns?
