Trend & Seasonality Determination in Time Series without looking at Graph

Most of the articles I have read describe determining Trends and Seasonal (TS) effects through rolling your eyes on Graphs. Graph is a nice visual representation, but I am looking a way in either Python , R or through any other way and discover TS. In short I want to feed my time series data to some program in backend and through output values I determine Trend is Yes/No or Seasonal effects exists in my time series Yes/No. Will really appreciate your ideas. Thanks
