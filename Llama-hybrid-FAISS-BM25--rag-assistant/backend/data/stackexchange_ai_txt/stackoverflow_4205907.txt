Is it possible to define a local struct, within a method, in C#?

One of the common programming best practices is "define variables as close to where they are used as possible". I use structs frequently to create code thats almost self documenting in places. However, C# forces me to define the struct outside the method. This breaks the aforementioned best practice - its basically creating an unwanted global variable type for the entire class. Is it possible to define a local struct inside a method, just like a local variable, and if not, could you give me a window into the reasons the C# designers decided to prevent this? Use Case I'm converting part of a spreadsheet into C# code. I'd like to use local structs within the method to store temporary information in an organized manner, without having to resort to hundreds of separate variables that are global in scope. Update 2016-August: C# 7.0 may have this feature! As of 2016-Aug, apparently, this will be a feature in C# 7.0. So the C# compiler team agreed - wow! Update 2020-July: Now supported by C# and C++ C++ has always fully supported this. And it's fantastic. C# 7.0 now has value tuples for a lightweight data structure with named fields.
