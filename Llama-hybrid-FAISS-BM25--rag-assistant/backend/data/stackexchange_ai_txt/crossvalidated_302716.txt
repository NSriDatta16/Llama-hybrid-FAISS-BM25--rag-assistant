Is a "cycle" always ending where it started?

I am involved in an engineering project. We concern ourselves with a manufacturing process in which mechanical parts are processed. Every time a part is processed we get a set of time series data. A time series is something specific in data science: A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Let's say a part is produced in 5 seconds and we get temperature and torque with a rate of 1000 per second. So every Millisecond we write down the time (called timestamp) and the value and we do this for temperature and torque. Thus we get for each part two "lists" of time-value-pairs. Our system is not so exact so we cannot match up the time stamps exactly for both temperature and torque, but that does not matter. Each of these lists is called a "time series" and for each time series we get about 5000 data entries (time-value-pairs). So for each processed part we have this data object which consists out of two time series. I am looking for a word for this data object. Thus I am looking for a word for "multiple time series that belong together". Sure, there is a mayor series of processed parts, where the parts are the elements of this series, but I am not concerned with that series. So in total we have a series of "word" that consists out of multiple time series. On wiktionary I found "cycle", which apparently is "An interval of space or time in which one set of events or phenomena is completed." The description sounds very promising, but I got the feeling that cycle needs to be something where the end kind of is the end. Am I wrong and should use the word "cycle" or is there a better word? I don't think there is a specialised term for what I am looking for, so I just want to know: Is a "cycle" always ending where it started?
