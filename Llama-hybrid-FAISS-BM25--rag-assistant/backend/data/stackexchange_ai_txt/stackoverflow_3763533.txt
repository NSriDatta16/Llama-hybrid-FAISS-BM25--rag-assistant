General tips for semantically cleaning up HTML, CSS & JS?

As I've gotten deeper into using jQuery with various sites I've worked on, I've found that I can get lost on whether a class attribute value is appended to an element in the DOM in order to attach an actual CSS style, or to bind an event to it. As such, I've started leaning towards using the rel attribute on anchor tags to denote if something is going to be bound to an event, keeping the class attribute specifically for stylization. (I've not delved into this deep enough to determine if there are any drawbacks or fundamental flaws with this approach, however, and am open to comments & criticisms on it.) It got me to thinking that others must have similar things they do to help keep their code organized, and I'm interested in learning about some new ideas that might be floating around out there.
