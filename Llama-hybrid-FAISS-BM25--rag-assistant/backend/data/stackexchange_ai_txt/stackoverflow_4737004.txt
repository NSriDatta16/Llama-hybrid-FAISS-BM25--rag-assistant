I am somewhat reluctant to answer this question because it is basically just a longer version of what Artefacto and I already told you, but anyway. You can either add the raw XML subtree and add it through a fragment DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML — Append raw XML data Or use DOMDocument::importNode — Import node into current document Note that you can deep import entire trees by passing TRUE as the second argument. Examples: $a = Hello World I am from the src document HTML; $b = Importing Fragments HTML; Using fragments: $dest = new DOMDocument; $dest->loadHTML($b); $fragment = $dest->createDocumentFragment(); $fragment->appendXML($a); $dest->getElementsByTagName('h1')->item(0)->appendChild($fragment); echo $dest->saveHTML(); Using imports: $dest = new DOMDocument; $dest->loadHTML($b); $src = new DOMDocument; $src->loadHTML($a); $dest->getElementsByTagName('h1')->item(0)->appendChild( $dest->importNode( $src->getElementsByTagName('div')->item(0), TRUE ) ); echo $dest->saveHTML(); The output for both of these would be something like Importing Fragments Hello World I am from the src document If you are concerned about which one performs better, I suggest to benchmark these under real world conditions, e.g. in your application. Then judge for yourself which suits your needs.
