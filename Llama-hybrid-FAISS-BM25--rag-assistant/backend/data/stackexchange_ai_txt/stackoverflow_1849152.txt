You can call CacheGlobalData multiple times. For each clipboard format, the clipboard stores the last value set by CacheGlobalData. For example, IE stores data in CF_UNICODETEXT, CF_TEXT and CF_HTML formats when you drag a paragraph of text. Generally an application should provide data in as many formats as possible so more applications can recognize the data. To avoid data lose in round trips, clipboard formats that contain the most information should be placed on the clipboard first, followed by less descriptive formats. For example, CF_HTML first, CF_UNICODETEXT second and CF_TEXT last. You probably need to register your own format for the numeric value and modify your drop target application that can understand your own format. None of the standard formats take a numeric value. Clipboard data must be stored in global memory. If you don't like that, you can pass NULL and handle WM_RENDERFORMAT or WM_RENDERALLFORMATS messages to provide data when needed, but for a DWORD it is not worth the effort.
