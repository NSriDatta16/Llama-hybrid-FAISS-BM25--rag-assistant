Doing linear dimensionality reduction just means that you project your data to a linear subspace, so you replace your data with a new one. I.e. if your first dataset works best with a reduction to 60 dimensions, this might indicate that your dataset is actually only of dimension roughly 60, but it could also mean that the projection to the 60-dimensional subspace removes most of the "detrimental" noise while keeping a sufficient signal level. In general, you can have more variance in the lower-dimensional datasets than in higher-dimensional ones, and, of course, also the other way around.
