Why should I use a human readable file format in preference to a binary one? Depends on the content and context, i.e. where is the data coming from and going. If the data is typically directly written by a human, storing it in an format that can be manipulated through a text editor is a good idea. For example, program source code will normally be stored as human readable with good reason. However, if we are archiving it, or sharing it using a version control system, our storage strategy will change.
