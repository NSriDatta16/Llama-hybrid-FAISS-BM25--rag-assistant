I had the same problem, and although I'm not an expert on WP7 or SL/WPF development I think the problem has to do with the default TextBox Template's Focused state not reverting the BorderBrush back to it's original setting (the same problem seems to exist with the Background property as well.) I managed to resolve this by using my own template in XAML... I don't have Blend installed so I don't know how to pull out the original template, but based on this page I think the original template is as follows: Collapsed Visible Collapsed Visible I didn't need the Focused state to look different than the Unfocused state, so I changed the FocusStates VisualStateGroup to look as follows: Yeah, I know, not the most elegant solution but it worked for me and hopefully this at least helps point you in the right direction!
