This is dependent on the development platform. For example, Borland C++ has a #pragma which could be used for exactly this. (From Borland C++ 5.0, c. 1995) #pragma startup function-name [priority] #pragma exit function-name [priority] These two pragmas allow the program to specify function(s) that should be called either upon program startup (before the main function is called), or program exit (just before the program terminates through _exit). The specified function-name must be a previously declared function as: void function-name(void); The optional priority should be in the range 64 to 255, with highest priority at 0; default is 100. Functions with higher priorities are called first at startup and last at exit. Priorities from 0 to 63 are used by the C libraries, and should not be used by the user. Perhaps your C compiler has a similar facility?
