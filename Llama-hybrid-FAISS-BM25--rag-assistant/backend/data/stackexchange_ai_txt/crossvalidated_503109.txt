Dynamic bayesian model conditional independence

I have just started learning probabilistic graphical models, so my knowledge of this subject is relatively weak. Hope I don't make any mistakes in my question. Given the Dynamic Bayesian model shown below, suppose that $O^{(1)}$ , $O^{(2)}$ , $X^{(1)}$ , $X^{(2)}$ are not observed, then $O^{(2)}$ is not independent of $O^{(1)}$ . I.e $P(O^{(2)}|O^{(1)},X^{(2)}) \neq P(O^{(2)}|X^{(2)})$ because there is an active trail from $O^{(2)}$ to $O^{(1)}$ Suppose that only $O^{(1)}$ is observed, then is $O^{(2)}$ independent of $O^{(1)}$ ?
