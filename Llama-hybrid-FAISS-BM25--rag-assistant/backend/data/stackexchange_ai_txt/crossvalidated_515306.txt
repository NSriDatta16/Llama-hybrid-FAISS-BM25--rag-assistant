Converting posteriors to likelihoods by removing prior

I have a set of MCMC chains (i.e., unnormalized posteriors) for a parameter I modeled for a sample of objects. I have a model that requires that I condition on the likelihoods of this parameter. My question is, what is the right way to convert from posteriors to likelihoods given that I have a functional form of my prior? I'm working in python using scipy to define my prior distributions. What I've tried so far, prior = scipy.stats.truncnorm.pdf(mcmc_chain, a, b, loc=loc, scale=scale) likelihood = mcmc_chain/prior But the domain of the prior is different than the mcmc chains, which I think doesn't make sense to then try to divide the mcmc chains by the prior. I thought about reweighting the mcmc chain by the prior distribution but 'prior' doesn't sum to 1 so I don't think that will work as weights and I'm also just not sure if that's the correct approach.
