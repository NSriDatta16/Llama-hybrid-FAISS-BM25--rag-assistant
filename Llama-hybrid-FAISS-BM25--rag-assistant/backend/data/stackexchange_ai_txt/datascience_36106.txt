input shape of dataset in CNN

My dataset is a simple table of 20 columns and 100,000 rows.It is not a image data as commonly used in CNN. What input shape should I provide in this case? Right now I did- input_shape = (21,109713,1) model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(1, 1), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape)) which gives the error- ValueError: rng_mrg cpu-implementation does not support more than (2**31 -1) samples
