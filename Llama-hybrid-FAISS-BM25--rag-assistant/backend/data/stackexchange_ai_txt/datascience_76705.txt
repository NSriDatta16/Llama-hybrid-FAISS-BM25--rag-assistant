Small addition, as this was still not mentioned, and I was also searching for it. There is an explanation here . for the drop parameter: drop{‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or a array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None Specifies a methodology to use to drop one of the categories per feature. This is useful in situations where perfectly collinear features cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data into a neural network or an unregularized regression. However, dropping one category breaks the symmetry of the original representation and can therefore induce a bias in downstream models, for instance for penalized linear classification or regression models.
