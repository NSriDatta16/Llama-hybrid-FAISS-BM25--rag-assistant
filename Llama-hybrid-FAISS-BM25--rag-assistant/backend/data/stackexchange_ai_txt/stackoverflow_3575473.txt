what's means of value type and referance type in .net

hi i am little bit confused in valu type or referance type... for instance int is a value type string is referance type but int also referances some value like int int i=4 int j=i here j is also referanced 4 as like i so why not we call it as a referance type......in case of string s="hello" string s1=s here s is referancing s.....will any one explain in storage point of view ......is there any restriction over valu type or referance type.
