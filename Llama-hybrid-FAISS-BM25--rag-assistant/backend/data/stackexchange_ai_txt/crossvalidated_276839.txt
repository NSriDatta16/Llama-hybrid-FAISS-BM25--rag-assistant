Best measure for multiple time series modelling prediction methods?

Newbie question, sorry. I have a highly seasonal monthly time series, predictable with no exogenous/independent variables and no obvious trend. I want to show that a suitable state space model (using dlm ) is a better predictor than both Holt Winters and a SARIMA model and that some more modern methods (single layer neural network nnetar from the R package forecast and XGBoost ) are better still. 1) I have split my data 80/20 train/test, what single measure should I use to establish a comparative measure of predictive power across all these methods? A data science competition I saw recently used sum of log squares: $$\sum (log(predict)-log(test))^2$$ Is this appropriate across all methods here? I've not seen the log correction before, what's the purpose of this? 2) I have seen some literature suggesting a 60/20/20 split of data to allow for cross validation. Why wouldn't I just fit the model to 80% of my data and use part 1) to select the best method?
