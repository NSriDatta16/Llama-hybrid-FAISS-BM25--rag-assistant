If you want a small percentage of points ordered by some criterion, you'll be better served using a Priority queue data structure; create a size-limited queue(with the size set to however many elements you want), and then just scan through the list inserting every element. After the scan, you can pull out your results in sorted order. This has the benefit of being O(n log p) instead of O(n log n) where p is the number of points you want, and the extra storage cost is also dependent on your output size instead of the whole list.
