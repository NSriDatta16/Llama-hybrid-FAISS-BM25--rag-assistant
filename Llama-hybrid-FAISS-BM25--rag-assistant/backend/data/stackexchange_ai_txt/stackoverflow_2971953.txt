A SharePoint list is the wrong storage choice here. A quick quote from the Working with Large Lists in Office SharePoint Server 2007 (bottom of the first paragraph under "Test results and findings"): The maximum number of items supported in a list with recursive folders is 5 million items. Perhaps this list is more logically several lists dumped into one?
