Using a rolling window in time series regression

I am learning about regression. I have done some cross sectional regressions which are fine. I recently did a simple time series regression. So I have a y & x vectors each containing 1000 observations. I did a simple ols regression in excel which I thought was fine. However my online tutor e-mailed me after I sent the results asking what rolling window I was using? I don't seem to follow. I have e-mailed back but received an out of office reply and I'm keen to understand what he meant. Is it simply rather than using all 1000 observations that I should use the first 50 observations (so 1:49) for a regression then do another regression using obs (2:50)? My understanding was that as long as the data in my vectors is ordered correctly (in my case my date) then the regression should be done in the same way as a cross sectional regression - am I wrong?
