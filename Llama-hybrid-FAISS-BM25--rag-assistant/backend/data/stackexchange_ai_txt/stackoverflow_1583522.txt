The Hilbert system is not normally used in automated theorem proving. It is much easier to write a computer program to do proofs using natural deduction. From the material of a CS course : Some FAQ’s about the Hilbert system: Q: How does one know which axiom schemata to use, and which substitutions to make? Since there are infinitely many possibilities, it is not possible to try them all, even in princple. A: There is no algorithm; at least no simple one. Rather, one has to be clever. In pure mathematics, this is not viewed as a problem, since one is most concerned about the existence of a proof. However, in computer science applications, one is interested in automating the deduction process, so this is a fatal flaw. The Hilbert system is not normally used in automated theorem proving. Q: So, why do people care about the Hilbert system? A: With modus ponens as its single deductive rule, it provides a palatable model of how humans devise mathematical proofs. As we shall see, methods which are more amenable to computer implementation produce proofs which are less “human like.”
