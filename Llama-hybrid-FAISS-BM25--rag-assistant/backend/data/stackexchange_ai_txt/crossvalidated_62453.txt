In this case you should use spatial pattern analysis to identify relations between human activity and distribution of rocks. Rocks have to be represented as a point shp-file. Adding another level of abstract to distribution of rocks (making them polygons instead of points) is highly questionable approach that doesn't seem to provide any help for analysis. You will need a spatstat package (with the great tutorial ) for R and maybe QGIS . [Are you hunting for ghosts?] Use Monte-Carlo test to be sure that your rocks are not randomly distributed across the study area (regardless of human activity). To perform it see the corresponding section of tutorial or this post . In this case o-win object (it is the boundaries of the study area, see tutorial) will be the whole area that you study. Use Monte-Carlo test to determine whether rocks are randomly distributed across human activity sites (in this case o-win object will be polygon shp-file of human activity). Get the empirical graph of the dependency of intensity of rocks distribution on the distance to the human activity sites. If humans determine rocks location then intensity of spatial distribution of rocks will depend on the distance to the areas of human activities. Use rhohat function for it. If distribution of rocks indeed depends on human activity sites then the graph in your case should look similar to this: Here o-win object again will be the whole study area. Use a distfun function for a polygons of human activity as a covariate in rhohat . Here is some example code for the third step from one of my projects: library(maptools) library(rgdal) library(spatstat) spatstat.options(gpclib=TRUE) gpclibPermit() # load point shp-file for analysis S That's pretty much it. Now some important details. If you dont't have a point shp-files for rocks (in this case you should skip first two steps cause it will be pointless) you can recreate it using your polygon layer. Use QGIS for this. Go Vector -> Research Tools -> Random points. Here choose your polygon layer of rocks as an input layer and set up one of the option for the Individual Polygons (density or the number of points per polygon). If you have issues with human activity polygons as a covariate for the rhohat function ( spatstat sometimes not working well with the polygons). You can replace that polygons with the point layer just as it was suggested in the previous paragraph, but using Regular points instead of Random points. P.S. You may take some other approach (get inspiration from the tutorial for spatatat ) but it is essential to use point pattern analysis in this case, not some polygons of locations of rocks.
