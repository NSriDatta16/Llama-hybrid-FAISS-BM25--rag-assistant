First off, using xsl output to form your PHP array is fairly inelegant and inefficient. I would highly suggest going with something like the domdocument class available in PHP ( http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domdocument.php ). If you must stick with your current method, try using regular expressions to remove any unnecessary whitespace. $string = preg_replace('/\s+/', '', $string); or $string = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $string); to preserve single white space.
