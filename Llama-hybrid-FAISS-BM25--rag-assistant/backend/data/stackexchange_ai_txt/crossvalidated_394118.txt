Why do neural networks need so many training examples to perform?

A human child at age 2 needs around 5 instances of a car to be able to identify it with reasonable accuracy regardless of color, make, etc. When my son was 2, he was able to identify trams and trains, even though he had seen just a few. Since he was usually confusing one with each other, apparently his neural network was not trained enough, but still. What is it that artificial neural networks are missing that prevent them from being able to learn way quicker? Is transfer learning an answer?
