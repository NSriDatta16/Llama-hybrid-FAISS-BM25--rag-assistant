Rails 3 CRUD shallow nested model

I'm trying to use this example but it doesn't work. I guess it's because I use a shallow nested model ! I get this error : Template is missing Missing template pprojects/create with {:formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:builder, :erb, :haml, :rjs, :rhtml, :rxml], :locale=>[:en, :en]} It looks like my app is trying to do HTML and no JS because my server console says the following: Processing by ProjectController#create as HTML Maybe I have a problem here : true) do |f| %> or because in my controller my load method isn't compatible with create and update : def load @projects = Project.all @project = Project.new end def create @project = @organization.projects.new(params[:project]) if @project.save flash[:notice] = "Successfully created project." @projects = Project.all end end def update @project = Project.find(params[:id]) if @project.update_attributes(params[:project]) flash[:notice] = "Successfully updated project." @projects = Project.all end Do you have a clue? Thanks in advance
