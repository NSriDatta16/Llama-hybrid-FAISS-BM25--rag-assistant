Interpreting a nullity correlation matrix

I learning data science using Dataquest. In one of the missions, I encountered a nullity correlation plot like this: I am already familiar with the concept of correlation. But I have never heard of "nullity correlation". My question is what is nullity correlation and how can I interpret this plot?
