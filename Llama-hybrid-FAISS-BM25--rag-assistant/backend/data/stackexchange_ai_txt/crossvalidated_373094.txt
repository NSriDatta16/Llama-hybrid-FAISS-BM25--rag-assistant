my error bars cross zero, is this ok?

I have plotted the total consumption (g) of a solution by my experimental organisms. However, when I plotted the error bars (s.e.m) a few crossed zero (see image). (1) is this correct/plausible? (2) How should I interpret this? thanks in advance. [![Standard-error bar plot][1]][1]
