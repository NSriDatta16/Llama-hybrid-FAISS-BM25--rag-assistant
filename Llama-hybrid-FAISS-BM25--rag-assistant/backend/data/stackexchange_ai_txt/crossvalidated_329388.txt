Predictive distribution derivation from Bishop "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning "

I have a question regarding one part in section 4.5.2. Specifically conclusions about equation (4.148): $$p(a)=\int \delta(a-\mathbf{w}^T\phi)q(\mathbf{w})\mathrm{d}\mathbf{w}.$$ I think context is not that important, the only relevant thing is that $a$ is projection of $w$ on $\phi$. So the puzzling part is this We can evaluate $p(a)$ by noting that the delta function imposes a linear constraint on $w$ and so forms a marginal distribution from the joint distribution $q(w)$ by integrating out all directions orthogonal to $\phi$. I really do not see how linear constraint on $w$ imposes that all orthogonal directions to $\phi$ will be integrated out. Can someone elaborate?
