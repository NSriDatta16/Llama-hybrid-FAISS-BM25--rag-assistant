HTML elements cannot be nested. Nesting them results in unexpected behavior which could vary between different browsers. Quote from the specification : Every form must be enclosed within a FORM element. There can be several forms in a single document, but the FORM element can't be nested. So you might need to remove the outer form or find another way of organizing your markup.
