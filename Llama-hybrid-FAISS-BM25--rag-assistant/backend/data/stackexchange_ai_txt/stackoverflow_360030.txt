Set Variable from an Array directly into a List of Variables in Java

I have a Java method which returns an array of doubles. I would then like to store these values in individual variables in the calling function. Is there an elegant way of doing this in Java. I could write it as this: double[] returnValues = calculateSomeDoubles(); double firstVar = returnValues[0]; double secondVar = returnValues[1]; I was just wondering if there was some way of compressing this down to a single line? Something like: (firstVar, secondVar) = calculateSomeDoubles(); This type of thing is quite easy when scripting, but the stronger typing of Java means it probably isn't possible.
