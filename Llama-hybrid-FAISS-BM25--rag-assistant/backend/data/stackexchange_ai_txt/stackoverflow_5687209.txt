.swf Adobe flex not loading on website

Pardon the technological terminology blunders. A long time ago I built and compiled a flex app into a .swf. I decided to start testing how to load this onto a website. However upon visiting my website, I am greeted with... nothing. If I inpect the page source, however, and click on the src link, it works. It works meaning... well the forms and everything show up as expected. I've a feeling I am missing something basic, or that embedding different technologies may become complicated. This is all done on a .php page, served by fatcow, if that helps. Thanks for the help.
