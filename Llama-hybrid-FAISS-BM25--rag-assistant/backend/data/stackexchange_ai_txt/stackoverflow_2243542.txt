How to efficiently get the k bigger elements of a list?

WhatÂ´s the most efficient, elegant and pythonic way of solving this problem? Given a list (or set or whatever) of n elements, we want to get the k biggest ones. ( You can assume k without loss of generality, I guess) For example, if the list were: l = [9,1,6,4,2,8,3,7,5] n = 9, and let's say k = 3. What's the most efficient algorithm for retrieving the 3 biggest ones? In this case we should get [9,8,7] , in no particular order. Thanks! Manuel
