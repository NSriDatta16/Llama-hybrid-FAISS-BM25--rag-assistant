Running Mantis on MS SQL Server

As a part of the technology standardization in the organization I work at, we're moving from MySQL and Linux to MS SQL Server and Windows. One of the PHP-based applications that we use is Mantis, a bug tracking system available at http://www.mantisbt.org Has anyone had any luck getting Mantis to work completely with MS SQL Server? I've got Mantis 1.1.8 working for the most part but file attachments do not work, while Mantis 1.2.1 does not install on MS SQL Server.
