Google sends a different 'User-agent' header than a normal browser, so you can easily use that as the determining factor and route bot requests to a different page. However, you should bear in mind that they're probably a lot more advanced than you in the arms race to spoof their crawlers. Specifically you should probably read this page before attempting shenanigans. EDIT: actually this page is more apropos.
