I think the reason it's frowned upon is because the "toolbox" can grow and you will be loading a ton of resources every time you want to call a single function. It's also more elegant to have the methods that apply to the objects in the actual class - just makes more sense. That being said, I personally don't think it's a problem, but would avoid it simply for the reasons above.
