How do we get that $\hat\beta_1\,\sigma_x = \widehat{\beta_1\sigma_x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\xi_i}{n} y_i$?

I am trying to understand this answer by @whuber to this question of how to get the standard errors of the regression estimators. @whuber says the following: Variance of the slope estimate The Ordinary Least Squares estimate of the slope in these new units is simply the average product of the $\xi_i$ and $y_i,$ $$\hat\beta_1\,\sigma_x = \widehat{\beta_1\sigma_x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\xi_i}{n} y_i.\tag{2}$$ I can see that we can write the standardised value as $$\dfrac{x_i - \overline{x}}{\sigma_x} = \zeta_i.$$ So the slope in the new units, $\beta_1 \zeta_i$ , is the old slope, $\beta_1$ , scaled by the standard deviation of all the $x$ , $\sigma_x$ . With that said, I still don't see where this idea that $\hat{\beta_1 \sigma_x} = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \zeta_i y_i$ is coming from. @whuber then says that $\hat{\beta_1 \sigma_x} = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \zeta_i y_i$ comes from the normal equation of least squares. Following the link in @whuber's answer here to this question , I fully write out a small example of $(X^T X)\beta = X^T Y$ , where $n = 2$ and $p = 2$ (see here ), to get $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \beta_0 + (x_{11} + x_{21})\beta_1 + (x_{12} + x_{22}) \beta_2 \\ (x_{11} + x_{21})\beta_0 + (x_{11}^2 + x_{21}^2)\beta_1 + (x_{11}x_{12} + x_{21}x_{22})\beta_2 \\ (x_{12} + x_{22})\beta_0 + (x_{11}x_{12} + x_{21}x_{22})\beta_1 + (x_{12}^2 + x_{22}^2)\beta_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{11} + \beta_2 x_{12}) + (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{21} + \beta_2 x_{22}) \\ x_{11} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{11} + \beta_2 x_{12}) + x_{21}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{21} + \beta_2 x_{22}) \\ x_{12}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{11} + \beta_2 x_{12}) + x_{22}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{21} + \beta_2 x_{22}) \end{bmatrix}$$ This seems to be correct. But, even so, I don't see how this clarifies $\hat{\beta_1 \sigma_x} = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \zeta_i y_i$ . So how do we get that $\hat\beta_1\,\sigma_x = \widehat{\beta_1\sigma_x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\xi_i}{n} y_i$ ?
