AS3 function running before variables are defined!

I am trying to add an init() function to a MovieClip, but when I run the function from scene1 the variables that were set in the MovieClip are not defined yet... The MovieClip was dragged to the stage from the library. scene1: mc.init(null); MovieClip: var _default = 5; function init(num) { if(num == null) { trace(_default); } else { trace(num); } } This is tracing "undefined" instead of "5"; Is there a way of fixing this problem?
