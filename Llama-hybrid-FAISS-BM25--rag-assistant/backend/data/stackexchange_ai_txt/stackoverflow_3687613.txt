Popup needs to refer back to textbox within a content control

I have a link that is located inside a content control. This link calls a javascript function that opens a popup window containing a calendar and passes it the transformed id from the server of a textbox control using clientid. I need to be able to click on a date and have the popup close and insert the date into the textbox of the id I passed into the function which again, is located inside the content control. This is the link in the content control: ');" href="javascript:void(0);"> This is the javascript inside the masterpage: function calendarPicker(strField) { var strField = window.open('DatePicker.aspx?field=' + strField, 'calendarPopup', 'width=250,height=190,resizable=yes'); } The calendar is a calendar control inside its own page and this is the codebehind: Private Sub Calendar1_DayRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DayRenderEventArgs) Handles Calendar1.DayRender Dim link As New System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlGenericControl Dim strLink As String e.Cell.Controls.Clear() link.TagName = "a" link.InnerText = e.Day.DayNumberText strLink = "JavaScript:window.opener.document." & Request.QueryString("Field") & ".value = '" & e.Day.Date & "'; window.close();" link.Attributes.Add("href", strLink) If (e.Day.IsSelected) Then link.Attributes.Add("style", Calendar1.SelectedDayStyle.ToString()) End If e.Cell.Controls.Add(link) End Sub I should also mention the error I'm getting is: window.opener.document.form1 is undefined
