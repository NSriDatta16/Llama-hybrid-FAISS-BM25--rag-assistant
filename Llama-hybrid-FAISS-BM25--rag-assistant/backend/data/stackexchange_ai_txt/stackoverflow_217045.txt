Neural networks sound cool until you read the fine print : In modern software implementations of artificial neural networks the approach inspired by biology has more or less been abandoned for a more practical approach based on statistics and signal processing. This is something that has mystified me for years. Here you have an amazingly complex and powerful control system (real-world biological neural networks), and an academic discipline that appears to be about modeling these systems in software but that has in reality abandoned that activity. If you're doing web development, your time is probably better spent in the HCI course.
