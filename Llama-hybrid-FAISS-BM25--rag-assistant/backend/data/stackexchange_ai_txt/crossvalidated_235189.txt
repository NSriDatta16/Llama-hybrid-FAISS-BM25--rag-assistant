Random forest regression not predicting higher than training data

I've noticed that when building random forest regression models, at least in R , the predicted value never exceeds the maximum value of the target variable seen in the training data. As an example, see the code below. I'm building a regression model to predict mpg based on the mtcars data. I build OLS and random forest models, and use them to predict mpg for a hypothetical car that should have very good fuel economy. The OLS predicts a high mpg , as expected, but random forest does not. I've noticed this in more complex models too. Why is this? > library(datasets) > library(randomForest) > > data(mtcars) > max(mtcars$mpg) [1] 33.9 > > set.seed(2) > fit1 fit2 > #Hypothetical car that should have very high mpg > hypCar > predict(fit1, hypCar) #OLS predicts higher mpg than max(mtcars$mpg) 1 37.2441 > predict(fit2, hypCar) #RF does not predict higher mpg than max(mtcars$mpg) 1 30.78899
