Difference between estimation and learning

What is the difference between parameter estimation which includes system identification and learning in machine learning perspective? Let say the model is y= Ax. x is the input and y is the output. In estimation, I have seen parameters to be estimated, maybe in this case it is A and the samples are also estimated (unsure) What is learning then?
