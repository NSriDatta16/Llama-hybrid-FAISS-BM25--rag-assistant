Two solutions. First, you do it with the help of libxml / DOMDocument / SimpleXML: you have to import your $sx object to DOM , create a DOMDocumentFragment and use DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML() : $doc = dom_import_simplexml($sx)->ownerDocument; $fragment = $doc->createDocumentFragment(); $fragment->appendXML($book->genXML()); $doc->documentElement->appendChild($fragment); // your original $sx is now already modified. See the Online Demo . You can also extend from SimpleXMLElement and add a method that is providing this. Using this specialized object then would allow you to create the following easily: $sx = new MySimpleXMLElement($xml); $sx->addXML($book->genXML()); Another solution is to use an XML library that already has this feature built-in like SimpleDOM . You grab SimpleDOM and you use insertXML(), which works like the addXMLChild() method you were describing. include 'SimpleDOM.php'; $books = simpledom_load_string( ' ABCD ' ); $books->insertXML( ' EFGH ' );
