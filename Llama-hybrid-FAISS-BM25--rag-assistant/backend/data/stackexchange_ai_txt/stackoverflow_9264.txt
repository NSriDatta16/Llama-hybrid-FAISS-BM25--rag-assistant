@Ice^^Heat: What do you mean by that the data tier should not be aware of the business logic tier? How would you fill an business object with data? The UI asks the ServiceClass in the business tier for a service, namely getting a list of objects filtered by an object with the needed parameter data. Then the ServiceClass creates an instance of one of the repository classes in the data tier, and calls the GetList(ParameterType filters). Then the data tier accesses the database, pulls up the data, and maps it to the common format defined in the "domain" assembly. The BL has no more work to do with this data, so it outputs it to the UI. Then the UI wants to edit Item X. It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage. The UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier. The UI is responsible for mapping the users data input to and from the objects, and the data tier is responsible for mapping the data in the db to and from the objects. The Business tier stays purely business. :)
