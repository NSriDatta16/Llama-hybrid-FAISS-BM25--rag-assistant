I know of two points that might be relevant to your question: First , there is the data processing inequality , which, for a Markov chain $X\to Y\to Z$ states: $$ I(X, Y) \ge I(X, Z). $$ This gives you an upper bound of what you can hope for when trying to predict $Z$ from $X$ . Note, that this is independent of how you go about the prediction, i.e. it doesn't matter whether you try to do it directly or in two steps as how you have described it. Second , there is a paper by Cox showing that in linear regression, it is usually better to perform the two regressions for $X\to Y$ and $Y\to Z$ and then to multiply the two regression coefficients, than to compute the regression coefficient of $X\to Z$ . Here, "better" means, that the asymptotic variance of the estimated regression coefficient is smaller.
