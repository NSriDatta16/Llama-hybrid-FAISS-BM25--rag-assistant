I'm having a bit of trouble following the details of your question (I think maybe some of the "drop function" got lost in your post somehow). But if the question is: how do I remove a movie clip from its parent, without knowing an exact path to the parent? then the answer is simply: foodDrag.parent.removeChild(foodDrag); assuming that foodDrag is your movie clip that you want to remove. If I'm missing the point, please reply and help me understand what you're asking.
