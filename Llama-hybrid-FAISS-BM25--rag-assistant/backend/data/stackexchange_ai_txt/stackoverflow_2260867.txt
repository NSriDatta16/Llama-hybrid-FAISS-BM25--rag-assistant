MySQL/SQL - When are the results of a sub-query avaliable?

Suppose I have this query SELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM table_a WHERE id > 10 ) AS a_results LEFT JOIN (SELECT * from table_b WHERE id IN (SElECT id FROM a_results) ON (a_results.id = b_results.id) I would get the error "a_results is not a table". Anywhere I could use the re-use the results of the subquery? Edit: It has been noted that this query doesn't make sense...it doesn't, yes. This is just to illustrate the question which I am asking; the 'real' query actually looks something like this: SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM ( SELECT wp_pod_tbl_hotel . * FROM wp_pod_tbl_hotel, wp_pod_rel, wp_pod WHERE wp_pod_rel.field_id =12 AND wp_pod_rel.tbl_row_id =1 AND wp_pod.tbl_row_id = wp_pod_tbl_hotel.id AND wp_pod_rel.pod_id = wp_pod.id ) as found_hotel LEFT JOIN ( SELECT COUNT(*) as review_count, avg( ( location_rating + staff_performance_rating + condition_rating + room_comfort_rating + food_rating + value_rating ) /6 ) AS average_score, hotelid FROM ( SELECT r. * , wp_pod_rel.tbl_row_id AS hotelid FROM wp_pod_tbl_review r, wp_pod_rel, wp_pod WHERE wp_pod_rel.field_id =11 AND wp_pod_rel.pod_id = wp_pod.id AND r.id = wp_pod.tbl_row_id AND wp_pod_rel.tbl_row_id IN ( SELECT wp_pod_tbl_hotel .id FROM wp_pod_tbl_hotel, wp_pod_rel, wp_pod WHERE wp_pod_rel.field_id =12 AND wp_pod_rel.tbl_row_id =1 AND wp_pod.tbl_row_id = wp_pod_tbl_hotel.id AND wp_pod_rel.pod_id = wp_pod.id ) ) AS hotel_reviews GROUP BY hotel_reviews.hotelid ORDER BY average_score DESC AS sorted_hotel ON (id = sorted_hotel.hotelid) As you can see, the sub-query which makes up the found_query table is repeated elsewhere downward as another sub-query, so I was hoping to re-use the results
