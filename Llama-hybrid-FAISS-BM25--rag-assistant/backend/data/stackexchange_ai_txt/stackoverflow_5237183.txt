The postfix-mta tag can be used for programming questions related to the Postfix mail transfer agent. Non-programming questions relating to setting up a mail server are off-topic for Stack Overflow. Such questions are often on-topic on Server Fault . Postfix is a popular mail transfer agent (MTA), created as an alternative to Sendmail by Wietse Venema . Postfix is intended to be similar enough to Sendmail to be comfortable for those already familiar with Sendmail. However, Postfix is specifically intended to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, and will deviate from Sendmail convention when necessary to achieve those goals. Postfix is free and open source, and offers a source distribution that is capable of running on a wide range of Unix-like systems, including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, AIX, HP-UX, and Mac OS X. Some system vendors also provide pre-built binaries for ready-to-run use.
