Just to be clear as I think @Jon's answer doesn't make it perfectly clear. The values for getAttribute and setAttribute on HttpServletRequest are not present on what is actually sent over the wire, they are server side only. // only visible in this request and on the server request.getAttribute("myAttribute"); // value of the User-Agent header sent by the client request.getHeader("User-Agent"); // value of param1 either from the query string or form post body request.getParameter("param1");
