What is the sample size and variance for the mean that is a simple, unweighted average of two independent groups' means?

We have two groups: N1 = 10 and N2 = 100 Their means on some measurement are: Mean1 = 4 and Mean2 = 5 Their variances are Var1 = 3 and Var2 = 2.5. Let's further assume we have no access to the individual level data. Some guy wants to combine the two groups' means into one. However, instead of taking a weighted mean of two groups, as would have done anyone reasonable, he calculates a simple unweighted mean: UnweighedMean = (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5 (Please don't tell me it's very wrong. I know it is.) So, if we stick to this incorrect method, what would you say is the sample size for that total mean of 4.5? Is it 20? And what is the variance of that mean? Thank you for your thoughts!
