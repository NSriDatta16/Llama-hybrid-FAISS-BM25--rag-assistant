Zend Framework: how to get message instead of Internal Server Error?

For example, we have IndexController. Application.ini - all log errors are true: phpSettings.display_startup_errors = 1 phpSettings.display_errors = 1 resources.frontController.params.displayExceptions = 1 I tried to set up ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL); At last in indexAction I'm writing: Zend_Auth::hasIdentity(); After this one I have got Internal Server Error. This is clear, because we cannot run hasIdentity() as static. I can get a var_dump in this function but when I run $this->getStorage() init I have got Internal Server Error. So I would like to get some error message with description. No like Internal Server Error. If I doing smth like this in a simple php application (not Zend Framework) - I have got a full error description without Internal Server Error. So how to get description instead of Internal Server Error there?
