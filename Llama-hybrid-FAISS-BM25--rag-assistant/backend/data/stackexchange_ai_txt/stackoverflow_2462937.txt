In the first case, I believe the sequence of the requests/responses is the following, please correct me if I'm wrong. We'll call A brugman/budgetplanner/aanmelden.php and B /brugman/budgetplanner/. You're on some page, X and in FF you do the following: Request: POST A Response: Redirect B (that's the 302) Request: GET B Response: Result of B However, in IE, it seems like the following: Request: POST A Response: Redirect B (that's the 302) Request: GET B Response: Redirect Y (We see another 302) What is happening is that something in the second case is causing B to also return a redirection header. The problem is not in the client but the server. The additional information that everyone else is asking for: What is the request/response BODY of the 4 fiddler headers you posted (Go to inspecters, Raw View on both top and bottom panes to get this). This would more clearly show the values of X and Y in my above sequences. What is in the server PHP code, the problem is almost certainly at B (/brugman/budgetplanner/) Comparing the bodies of the the second request as per IE and FF should give you an indication of how the server sees them differently (to the server, a client is just an agent that prepares a request). Based on the difference in requests, the server sends back a different response.
