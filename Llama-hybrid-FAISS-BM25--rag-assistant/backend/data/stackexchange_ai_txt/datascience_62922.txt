Understandable and explainable machine learning model

I want to find formula for best financial portfolio. Inputs: Historical fundamental data for last 15 years. For 3000 companies for every quatal we have things like market cap , cash flow , liabilities , assets , revenue etc, every one of these inputs is a time series with data points for every quartal (i.e. 4 times in a year). Goal : I want to find a formula that given the 3000 companies would allow me to rank (sort) it from best to worst. And then I can pick let's say top 10 of those as the best portfolio. Example, how human can solve this task : study those historical financial data for couple of years, and came up with something. Like this very simple formula rank = revenue[last]/total-assets[last] + revenue[last]/market-cap[last] (looking for highly profitable and not too much overpriced companies). Machine Learning way to solve it : feed those data points to Neural Net, run it and hope it will learn something after a while. The problem is that we can't analyse the the neural network result because it's a black box. And I want to see the final formula in more or less compact form and be able to understand what it does . What other technics other than Neural Nets can be used? The model has to be sophisticated enough to be able to work with the time series as inputs.
