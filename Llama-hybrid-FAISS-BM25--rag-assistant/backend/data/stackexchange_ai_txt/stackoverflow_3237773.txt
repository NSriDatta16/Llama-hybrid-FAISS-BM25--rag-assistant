Frameworks/templates for web developer

I'm C/C++, Java developer and now in order to put some variety into my work, I decided to start playing with web development - i'm using django. However, I'm hopeless with graphics and advanced css. I would like to build and ship some apps with elegant and simple design. Are there any frameworks/templates which let me build something great looking without photoshop skills? I'm looking for something useful like: http://960.gs .
