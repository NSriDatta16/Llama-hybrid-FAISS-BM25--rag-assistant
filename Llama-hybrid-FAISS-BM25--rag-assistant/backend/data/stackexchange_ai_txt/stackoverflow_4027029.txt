In Internet Explorer use the filter property. In webkit and Firefox there is currently no way to desatuarte an image solely with CSS. so you will need to use either canvas or SVG for a client side solution. But I think using SVG is more elegant. check out my blog post for the SVG solution that works for both Firefox and webkit: http://webdev.brillout.com/2010/10/desaturate-image-without-javascript.html And strictly speaking since SVG is HTML the solution is pure html+css :-)
