(My)SQL Basics and much more

I've been using MySQL for quite some time now. Most of that time I used it with PHP, for Joomla development. Up until now, I didn't pay very much attention to optimization, since I was usually asked to finish stuff ASAP. Now, while I know that ASAP factor is a reality, I would like to improve my knowledge of relational DBs, together with good introspection to query and db optimization. I'm planning to start working with some rather large dbs, for which my usual approach will not be possible. Any recommendations for some good books from the area? Thx in advance.
