Avoid Leaderboard Hacking on Game Center

Has anyone found a way to avoid leaderbaord hacking on Game Center or at least make it more complicated? You can see a video of HackCenter, a Cydia app that lets you submit any score you want here: Hack Center Even though that application is not supposed to be available on the Cydia Store we've all seen scores that are obviously fake on several games on the AppStore. Unlike the score submitted on that video, the fake scores are usually ridiculously high and they discourage other players, since they can never reach the top of the leaderboard. I haven't been able to find out how the hack is accomplished (I presume they intersect the http call and just replace the score parameter with whatever they want?). Any insight is appreciated.
