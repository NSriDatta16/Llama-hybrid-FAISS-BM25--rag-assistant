Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data

I am trying to solve an anomaly detection problem that consists of three variables captured over a span of five years. It is an unsupervised problem, and I believe density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN aren't a good fit for this problem as it doesn't consider seasonality, time series nature of the variables. Can someone suggest appropriate methods or any implementation that is similar to this problem?
