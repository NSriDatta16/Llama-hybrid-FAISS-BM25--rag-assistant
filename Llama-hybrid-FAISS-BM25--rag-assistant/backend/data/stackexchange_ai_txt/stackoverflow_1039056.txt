Providing customizable forms to non-technical users

I'm curious how others have offered customizable forms to their website's users (who are primarily non-technical). It is possible that there is a library out there that achieves this, but I have not seen one. Some of the concerns are: Options for each form element What kind of options to provide to the user, keeping in mind that all of these need to be persisted. Layout Customization Is it enough to just have a top to bottom sequential layout. Is it really necessary to offer different layouts? (For instance, a two column layout) Database storage Any efficient/relatively quick methods for storing the data entered in the form in a database. The issue here being that you don't know how many columns will be needed. And also, is it okay to store everything as a VARCHAR (losing some of the 'queryability' of dates/integer). Validation Should validation be built in (dependant on field type), or customizable? There are a lot of possibilities, and I'm looking to see what others have used/offered and what they found to be effective. And any potential gotchas or whether it is not really worth it to offer this.
