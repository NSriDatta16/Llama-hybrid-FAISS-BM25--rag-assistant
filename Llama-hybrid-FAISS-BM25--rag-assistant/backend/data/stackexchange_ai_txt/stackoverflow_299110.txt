What metrics should we use to judge code quality?

I'm currently working on a large project, where many developers worked over time and the code was terrible. After many refactorings we now arrived a point, where the code is ok. Now I'm thinking what "ok" means - probably for everyone something different. Do you think it's possible to specify "ok"? What is important? NDepend metrics? Test Coverage? Comments? Coding style? Documentation? I know there are already many topics about coding style or commenting (for example here ). This question is just about what facts are important.
