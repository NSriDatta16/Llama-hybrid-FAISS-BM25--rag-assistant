Talk to distributed components securely

I am designing authentication and security for a distributed application. The requirements are :- 1) The are are two distributed components A and B A and B will be always installed in Windows environments. A and B can be installed in two different Windows domains which don't trust each other. 2) A and B use WCF for communication. A and B should be able to authenticate each other and exchange data securely. What are the ways in which this can be done ? The possible solutions are :- a) Implement a CA, issue certificates to A and B. both of these certificates are signed by rootCA. But this solution involves us to implement a CA which is too costly b) Implement a key generation service on A. This would look like :- CreateSymmetricKey(string userName, string password); A and B would have a self signed certificate. The data exchanged between A and B would be secured using the self signed certificate. The authentication is done using userName and password. This would generate a symmetric key. Both A and B would store this key using local secure storage. This symmetric key would be used for encryption and authentication for communication between A and B. Can you suggest of other ways in which this could work ? Thanks, Vivek
