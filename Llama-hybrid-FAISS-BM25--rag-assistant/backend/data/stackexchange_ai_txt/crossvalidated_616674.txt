How to test for size (Typ one error probability) on Breusch-Pagan Test in R?

The data i created contains heteroscedasticity. I already calculated the power so my idea was to basically do the same but switch the hypothesis so that H0: Heteroscedasticity and H1: Homoscedasticity and then count how many times the new H0 is rejected. But this is not possible in the bptest() feature i use in the lm-package. Can anyone help me? im completely new to R so i am struggling... is there any other way to calculate power of a test or switch the hypothesis?
