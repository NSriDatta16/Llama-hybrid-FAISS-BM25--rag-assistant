Algorithms or techniques for pattern recognition

I am looking for algorithms or techniques that could be used for pattern recognition/extraction in data. Preferably I would like to know if there are any algorithm implementations in Python that I could study from. I am not really looking for novelty research but hands-on examples and implementations. More specifically I would ideally like to develop an algorithm that could identify patterns (commonly repeated observations within a dataset) or trends in an unsupervised way, mostly in numeric data, not time series necessarily. I am not sure if my understanding of pattern recognition is correct but an example of algorithms that could be used for my case I have found so far is Latent Dirichlet Allocation for text data and autoencoder neural networks for outlier detection.
