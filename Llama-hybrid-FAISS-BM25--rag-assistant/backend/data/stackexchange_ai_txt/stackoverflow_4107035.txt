On Linux, in the Bash shell, you can check the stack size with ulimit -s . Variables with automatic storage duration will have their space allocated on the stack. As others have said, there are better ways of approaching this: Use a std::vector to hold your data inside your BigClass . Allocate the memory for bf1 inside BigClass 's constructor and then free it in the destructor. If you must have a large double[] member, allocate an instance of BigClass with some kind of smart pointer ; if you don't need shared access something as simple as std::auto_ptr will let you safely construct/destroy your object: std::auto_ptr (new BigClass) myBigClass; myBigClass->bf1; // your array
