It turned out that Hibernate did not update the list of the related models. After removing the Car using AppFuse's carManager, the deleted car still showed in the getCars()-list of the associated Garage [when receiving the Garages using garageManager.getAll()]. So the problem was not related to richfaces itself! Currently I'm using a workaround (deleting the items manually when receiving the data from the related model oO) but maybe I'll open a new question to solve this problem.
