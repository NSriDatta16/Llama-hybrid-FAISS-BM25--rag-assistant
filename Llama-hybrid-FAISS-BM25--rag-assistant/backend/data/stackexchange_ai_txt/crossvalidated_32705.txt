How can you convert Bayesian Information Criterion parameters to a probabilistic interpretation?

I'm working with a general bayesian information criteria to determine if this data exhibits a bimodal, trimodal, quadmodal etc. My existing BIC exhibits clear trimodality, but I'd like a hypothesis test of sorts. How can I determine the probability that this model is true?
