I have tried using Random Forest for multiple imputation in MICE to handle missing data in survival analysis. I used bootstrapping to account for sampling variability in the imputation models. I found that Random Forest MICE performed better than parametric MICE when there were interactions between predictor variables that were not included in the imputation model. The CALIBERrfimpute package provides a function for Random Forest imputation in MICE: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CALIBERrfimpute/index.html This is an article describing tests of the method on simulated data and a real epidemiological dataset: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwt312
