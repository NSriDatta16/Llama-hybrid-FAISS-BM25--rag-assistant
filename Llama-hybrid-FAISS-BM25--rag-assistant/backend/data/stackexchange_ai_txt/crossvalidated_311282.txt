There is a paper PCA on a DataFrame that seems trying to solve this problem. The technique used here is called collectively Generalized Low Rank Models (PCA and Sparse PCA are examples of this family of methods). If you are familiar with Python/R you can try to use GLRMs from H2O library. They can handle both categorical and continuous data in single row.
