Two independent Poisson process question

If I have two independent Poisson processes, X and Y, with X having a lambda 2 and Y having a lambda 3. Given that the starting value for Y is 3 and X is zero, then how do I calculate the probability of X being larger than Y at any given point, even if only for one instant in time. I realize that I can just simulate my way out of it, but that does not really seem like an elegant solution. Any help/directions would be much appreciated. Besides the solution below, is it possible to use the CDF and pmf of a Poisson distribution instead of only its PMF, see below. $1-\prod_{t=1}^{\infty}\bigg[\prod_{k=0}^{\infty} \bigg [1-\bigg(1-e^{-\lambda_1*t}\cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k+D+1}\bigg[\frac{(\lambda_1*t)^{i}}{i!}\bigg]\bigg)\cdot \frac{(\lambda_2*t)^{k}*e^{-\lambda_2*t}}{k!}\bigg]\bigg] $ My idea was that we find the probability that Poisson distribution X with Lambda 2 receives k+3+1 more occurrences conditioned on the fact that Poisson distribution Y gets equal to k occurrences. This is done for all k and then subsequently we do it for all points in time. Is this also a correct way of doing it?
