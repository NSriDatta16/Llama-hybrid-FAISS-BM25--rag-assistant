Bayesian Inference for More Than Linear Regression

I learned about MCMC and variational inference for Bayesian inference, and I would like to try it out in some regression problem. However, all existing related models I know falls within either of the two cases below: Classification problem, such as topic models, but I am only looking for regression problem. Linear regression problem, which I do not see too much benefit compared with classical frequentist estimation of parameters such as confidence interval. Hence my problem is: Is there any famous/established model in machine learning field that is a non-linear regression problem? EDIT: I am asking this question because I learnt about the Bayesian method and I feel there is nothing much more it gives compared with the more efficient MLE, except for an (not so good) estimation of confidence interval. Therefore, I am looking for some tasks that Bayesian inference can provide more unique values or performs better than MLE methods. The classical model that came to my mind is parameter estimation for LDA or HDP used for topic models, and perhaps other generative models. However, all those I know is in the domain of classification or clustering. Is there any such established model in the field of regression?
