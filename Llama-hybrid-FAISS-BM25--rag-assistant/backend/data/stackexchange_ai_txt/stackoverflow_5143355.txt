Remove tax if over x value in magento

Hello :) Can anyone help me how to remove shipping value, if the total order is over 100 euro for example. So if the order i under 100 euro, there need to be a extra shipping tax, but if the order is over 100 euro, there don't need to be a shipping tax. Hope someone can help :-)
