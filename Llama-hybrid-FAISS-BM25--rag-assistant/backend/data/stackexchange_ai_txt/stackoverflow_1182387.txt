Replacing a html tag with another tag using JS DOM

I am fairly new to javascript and DOM and I am having a problem with manipulating DOM using javascript for the following html code. Testing Lion Tiger Giraffe Dinosaur Cat Dog Llama Rat Rhino Reindeer buffalo Yak Deer moose Rabbit Duck Peacock Crow Raven Swan Sorry if the above html code is bad.I am writing a greasemonkey script for the same which is produced by a site which i have simplified here. So i have no control over it whatsoever. I want the [marquee] tag to be replaced with the [div] tag so that it becomes static and i don't have to wait forever for the 100th link in the marquee to come up. ;-). So I wrote the following script. (I am new to js programming and yes i know that my script sucks :-) ) function setMeFixed(){ var fixedElement=document.createElement('div'); var marqueeElement=document.getElementsByTagName('marquee')[0]; //var clonedMarqNodes=marqueeElement.cloneNode(true); for(i=0;i Many problems occured. The resulting output did not show few links on it. Peacock, Crow, Swan, Raven are not seen in the output and all the tags are messed up after it becomes static with spaces printed above and no breaks between the links. As a beginner javascript programmer i am stuck here and any assistance in the right direction would be much appreciated. Any way to elegantly solve this problem? Thanks. paul bullard. PS: I am using Fx 3.0.11.
