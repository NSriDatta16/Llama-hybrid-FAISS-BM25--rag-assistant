displaying errors in jsf fragment with tag

I was just wondering if I could display errors on a separate jsp fragment. I have a requirement where I have to display hyperlink errors (i.e clicking any error would focus to respective input field) For example, if I have a form and there are 20 fields, then I am suppose to use 20 times tag. I know I can use single tag for all errors, but I have a requirement to focus individual field and I am not sure How we implement this using . However onclick event from tag solves my issue but using 20 tags leave a big space under heading and page does not look nice. So I was thinking if I could put all the errors tag on separate jsf fragment and later do jsp include on the main page. I tried, but error messages are not being displayed. Does any body have any idea, how do I accomplish this?
