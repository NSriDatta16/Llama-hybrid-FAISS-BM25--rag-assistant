Drag n drop from filesystem into a web application

I am investigating on a web framework/techno that allows to drag n drop files from the filesystem into a web application. The purpose is of course to upload those files into an application server. In Flex it seems to be not possible (although it works with AIR). I have found a way with Google Gears, but this force the user to install Gears as a browser plugin. With an Java applet, it seems to be possible but it requires the user to accept a security rule exception... (it is strange for me since reading a file specified by the user via DnD is not "less secure" than if the user had specified the file via standard classical Upload dialog box...). Is there any non intrusive way to allow this feature, without installing any plugin and without accepting a security warning message box?
