There are a lot of things you could do to the Oracle instance for the scenario you mention like using the correct locking strategy/isolation level, disabling all kinds of undo-logs, etc. You should consult a good Oracle Tuning book for that (I like the one by Mark Gurry, but I'm not sure how up to date that is). There is one other thing that might be important: If you constantly add and delete data from your db (I mean "totally empty the db"), make sure you're setting up the storage parameter for each table correctly. If you have the space, consider assigning an initial extent equal to the max size for your test cases. (Either in the db creation script, or define once and then just trancate the tables with the reuse storage option.) Then when you run the test cases, the db doesn't have to allocate additional storage space.
