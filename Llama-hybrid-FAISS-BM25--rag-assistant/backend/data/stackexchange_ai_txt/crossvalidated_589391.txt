Assuming that you have excluded simple variation in MCMC results, I would assume that your problem is that the posterior after each sequential step cannot be adequately approximated by independent normal distributions for each parameter. Generally (of course with some exceptions), the posterior samples for different parameters will be correlated a-posteriori, even if the prior distributions were specified as independent. I.e. you need to describe the posterior by some joint distribution (perhaps a multivariate normal can capture the situation, but perhaps not). If you reduce things to a super simple example, your approach should work though. E.g. it should work for the case where you only unknown parameter is the mean of a normal distribution (with known SD) as you can see here . In that simple case, you can do this both analytically using conjugate updating (see first row of this table), or numerically using conjugate updating (the RBesT R package is a nice tool for letting the computer do this for you), or in the way you described. However, once you assume the standard deviation is unknown, you already end up with a normal distribution being wrong even as the marginal posterior distribution for the mean (too short-tailed; additionally, of course you need a joint posterior for both parameters).
