Different websites on different domains, one .NET MVC application?

Is it possible to have one .NET MVC application, and have it accessible from different domains, in such a way that the content will be domain-dependant? For example, both www(dot)site1(dot)com and www(dot)site2(dot)com will point to my server's IP, and to the same website in IIS. In that website my .NET MVC application will reside. Now, I want the ability to know which site (domain name) triggered the ControllerAction, and act accordingly (for example, display different content for the homepage in the Index action, or allow/prevent access to specific content assigned to a specific site). I would appreciate any help on this. I can accept an extra parameter passed to all controller actions (probably using Routing), but if there's a more elegant solution that would be ideal.
