auto generating the doctor unit id using php, codeigniter!

i'm developing a site using codeigniter, in my app i have this scenario each patient is assigned to a doctor unit and there are 6 doctor units operating in the hospital some times one or two doctor units may be not operating some doctor units are not operating is certain days, i.e one can operate on monday,wednesday and friday... like wise so i have to auto generate the doctor unit number according to the arrival at the registration, how can i do this? how to track the previous unit assigned and assign the next one? query the operating units at the beginning keeping it in a array and auto generating, would that be appropriate? or using JavaScript to do it in the client side,would that be appropriate? if suddenly doctor unit stops working, i will need to be dynamic enough to work on that condition also, how to achieve that kind of things using any approach? regards, Rangana
