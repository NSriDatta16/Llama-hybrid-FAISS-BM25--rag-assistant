This usually occurs when your page URL protocol is HTTPS, but you have resources embedded in the page i.e. CSS, JavaScript, images etc, that have hardcoded protocols of HTTP. This is quite easy to embed the correct protocol server-side in ASP.NET via Request.Url.Scheme . When embedding third party JavaScript includes, you can use javascript to embed the correct protocol, for example: var protocol = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https" : "http"); document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + protocol + "third-party.com/script.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E")); If you are having trouble tracking down the insecure resources, I would recommend using Fiddler2 , a debugging proxy, which will highlight the issues.
