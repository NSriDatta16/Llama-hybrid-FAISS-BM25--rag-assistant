You can fit ARIMA model, but first you need to stabilize the variance by applying suitable transformation. You can also use Box-Cox transformation. This has been done in the book Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R , page 99, and then they use Box-Cox transformation. Check this link Box-Jenkins modelling Another reference is page 169, Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, Brockwell and Davis, “Once the data have been transformed (e.g., by some combination of Box–Cox and differencing transformations or by removal of trend and seasonal components) to the point where the transformed series X_t can potentially be fitted by a zero-mean ARMA model, we are faced with the problem of selecting appropriate values for the orders p and q.” Therefore, you need to stabilize the variance prior to fit the ARIMA model.
