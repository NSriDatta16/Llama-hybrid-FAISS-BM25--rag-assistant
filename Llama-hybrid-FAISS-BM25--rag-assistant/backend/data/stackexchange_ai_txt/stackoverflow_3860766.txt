Creating a Custom Silverlight Designer in WPF

I need to create a designer for Silverlight in WPF and I’m thinking of a few options Use a WebBrowser control, display the content there and communicate Silverlight using the JavaScript Bridge. Not sure if this will be enough for the scenarios I need to support (see below). This is what KaXaml is doing. SilverlightSpy uses a a more sophisticated WebBrowser control, but I'm not sure how they communicate with Silverlight. Communicate using Sockets between the Host and Silverlight. Host the Silverlight runtime (not in a browser), but directly using AgCore.dll . Similar to what sllauncher does for OOB. I imagine this is what Blend/VS are doing. Do whatever Blend or VS are doing which. I obviously don’t want to go as far as VS and Blend, but I need to support drag and drop of some controls as well as grouping, changing the layout, moving controls in the design surface and obviously updating the Xaml as a result of this actions. Any ideas, recommendations or pointers on the best way to create a Silverlight Designer in WPF?
