Logistic regression AIC likelihood function and other outputs interpretation

I have created a logistic regression model using statsmodels in python. My model has 5 input variables that characterise properties of hillslopes (e.g. mean slope angle, curvature etc) and these are related to a measure of stability. The number of model inputs stays the same each time. BUT I change the slope size (its a parameter in another program used to make hillslopes on a DEM). So the slopes increase in size 100, 400, 700 etc. The table below lists the slope sizes and model outputs I need including: AIC, AUC (ROC), Mc Fadden psuedo R and the p-value of the chi-sqaure test between the log-likelihood of the model (L) and that of the null-model. I am trying to evaluate which slope size is optimal in terms of the model outputs. I understand the interpretation of AUC, R and p-value (i know i shouldnt really use R), but AIC is causing some confusion. I get that in general terms, lower AIC values indicate the less complex models and increased goodness of fit. As the number of variables (k) used stays the same, AIC must be reducing with slope size due to increasing log-likelood. So how would I choose between, say a low AIC value and a significant p-value Size AIC AUC R p-value 100 107.04 0.86 0.37 0.000 400 88.38 0.86 0.32 0.008 700 79.04 0.84 0.31 0.040 1000 70.29 0.83 0.35 0.023 1300 65.29 0.84 0.36 0.016 1600 61.40 0.84 0.33 0.080
