Linear regression best polynomial (or better approach to use)?

Any ideas on other polynomials I could successfully use for applying regression? My goal is a solution that has fit error strictly based on the noise. Is this possible since it is a bell-like curve? The tails can be long, short or non-existent. Am I looking for the impossible? Please note it has been a while since I have plunged this far into linear regression. Anyway, my data points do not fit the $ax+bx^2+c$ polynomial well enough. I would like a replacement for this polynomial to apply regression (or different approach). In the following example, each point misses the fit curve by $20\%$ of the $Y$ range on average (of the data points). I looked at splines, but I do not know how to apply the regression since they look piece-wise. Example $Y$ values (evenly spaced in $X$). It looks kind of like a bell curve. I would be applying 5 to 50 data points to determine the polynomial coefficients. Ultimately, I am interested in the best $X$ location for the peak based on the data points.
