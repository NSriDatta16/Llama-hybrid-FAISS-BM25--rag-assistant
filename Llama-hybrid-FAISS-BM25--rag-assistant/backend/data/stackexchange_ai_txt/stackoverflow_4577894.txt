Tomcat 5.5 and Tomcat 6.0 have some significant differences. My suggestion is to move the WAR files to the new Tomcat instead of trying to gut the old one. One particular difference that comes to mind is that the JAR files are all organized differently. Since Tomcat 6.0 obviously comes with all of the Tomcat 6.0 JAR files, it stands to reason that you won't have any conflicts if you just use a fresh Tomcat 6.0 install and then move your WAR file applications to the new Tomcat 6. You will probably still have conflicts, but you'll at least have one variable knocked out, you'll know you're working with a fresh, solid, Tomcat installation instead of one that might be broken or might not be broken. Good call setting the logging level to ALL, just make sure you get all of the logging.properties files as sometimes there may be more than one. http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/logging.html Good luck!
