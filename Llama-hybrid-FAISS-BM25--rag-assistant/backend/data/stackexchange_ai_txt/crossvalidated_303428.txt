Due to the complexity of a patent document and the specifications of a patent such as abstract, description, and claims are quite different and they tends to be used in different classification purposes. For instance, a description tends to be large several pages, and claims to be several paragraphs. In patent representation, it would be wise to split a patent document into three smaller documents respectively and these documents will be used to train the doc2vec model. In this case, feature representation of a patent can be used as a concatenation (or with a certain weighting) of the feature representation of each specification (abstract/desc/claims)
