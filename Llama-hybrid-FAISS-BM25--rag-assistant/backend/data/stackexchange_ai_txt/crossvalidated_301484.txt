Biased Data in Machine Learning

I am working on a Machine Learning project with data that is already (heavily) biased by data selection. Let's assume you have a set of hard coded rules. How do you build a machine learning model to replace it, when all the data it can use is data that was already filtered by those rules? To make things clear, I guess the best example would be Credit Risk Assessment : The task is to filter all clients that are likely to fail to make a payment. Now, the only (labeled) data you have are from clients that have been accepted by the set of rules, because only after accepting you will see if someone pays or not (obviously). You don't know how good the set of rules is and how much they will affect the payed- to not-payed distribution. Additionally, you have unlabeled data from the clients that have been declined, again because of the set of rules. So you don't know what would have happened with those clients if they had been accepted. E.g one of the rules could be: "If age of client The classifier has no way to learn how to handle clients that have been filtered by these rules. How is the classifier supposed to learn pattern here? Ignoring this problem, would lead to the model being exposed to data it has never encountered before. Basically, I want to estimate the value of f(x) when x is outside [a, b] here.
