You're looking for encryption . What language are you using? You probably have a built-in encryption algorithm you can use. The idea with hashing is that you can only go one-way. [plain text]--->(HASH ALGORITHM)--->[hash] Whereas the idea with encryption is that you can use a key together with some plaintext to create a ciphertext . Then you can use the key on the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext at any time: [plain text] + [key] --->(ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM)-->[ciphertext] [ciphertext] + [key] --->(DECRYPTION ALGORITHM)-->[plain text] The decryption algorithm for a given encryption algorithm is usually very similar to the encryption algorithm, and it allows for the retrieval of a plaintext message given a ciphertext and the correct key (ie password).
