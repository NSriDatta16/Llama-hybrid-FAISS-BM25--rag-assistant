There are different ways to think about this problem. Does it make sense to rephrase your question as: Does the discrete clustering structure explain mean differences in continuous variable z? If so, the corresponding null hypothesis is: There are no mean differences across clusters in z, or, if you refer to the cluster averages of z as $\mu_{z,1}$ , $\mu_{z,2}$ , $\ldots$ , you then assume $H_0$ : $\mu_{z,1}=\mu_{z,2}=\mu_{z,3}=\ldots$ . To test your hypothesis, you may resort to a simple type of ANOVA analysis performing the corresponding omnibus test. If you reject $H_0$ , you may run post-hoc t-tests to find the cluster pairs that significantly differ from each other.
