We ran into this problem on a project and handled it by iterating through each available reader and checking to see if a card is inserted in that reader. You will encounter this naming problem with several brands of usb readers. My company has a product that lets you integrate smart cards with websites; one of our demos lists the smart card readers currently available and it might help you with testing different reader scenarios: https://cardboss.cometway.com/content.agent?page_name=GetReaders+Demo
