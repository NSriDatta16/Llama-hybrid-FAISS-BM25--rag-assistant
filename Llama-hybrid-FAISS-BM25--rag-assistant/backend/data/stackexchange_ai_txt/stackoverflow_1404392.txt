Using Java to change xml to html

I am using java code to create a html document. I have an xsl stylesheet and some xml that I want to create the html from. I am using the TransformerFactory method to do this. My problem is that when it creates the html file, when you open it you see a blank page but the code is there. The issue is that when the html is created it uses a javascript file (which is used in the xsl code) and it doesn't add the tag at the end of it but it is used in the xsl. So in the xsl it is as follows: but when the html creates it, it does: and it doesn't include the tag. Instead it uses the / at the end to close it. For some reason the html doesn't like this and when I insert the tag in manually it works fine, but I want it to include the tag itself so it will open properly. Any idea's on how to do this. Your help is much appreciated.
