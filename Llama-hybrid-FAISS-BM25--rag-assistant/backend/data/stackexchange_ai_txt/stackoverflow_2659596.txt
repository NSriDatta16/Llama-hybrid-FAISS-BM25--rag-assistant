How to organize product catalog site in Drupal 6?

please advice me how to organize product catalog site with such structure (this is pages which should be in site map): - Home page - About Us -- Team -- Contacts - Products -- Category --- Product ---- Overview ---- Photo gallery ---- Variants -- Category --- Subcategory --- Product ---- Overview ---- Photo gallery ---- Variants I know that i can use Page nodes for general pages like About page. And i can prepare Product node with CCK with needed fields. Then i can use taxonomy vocabulary for product categories/subcategories. Is this a right way to do such functionality? Or better to use just child/parent nodes? And how i can show subpages menu on product page? How i can organize menus? I need one menu with primary links, second menu below it, for secondary links (except Products catalog) and sidebar menu for Products catalog. Please advice. May be this is easy questions, but i just learning Drupal (but i have experience with other CMS). Thanks a lot.
