@David - believe it or not this is what we actually have just now, and yet it's still causing us problems! We're making some changes though, which are forced upon us due to moving to TeamCity and multiple build agents - so we can't have references to directories outwith the current project, as I've mentioned in my previous answer. Look at the Externals section of this link to see what I mean - http://www.dummzeuch.de/delphi/subversion/english.html
