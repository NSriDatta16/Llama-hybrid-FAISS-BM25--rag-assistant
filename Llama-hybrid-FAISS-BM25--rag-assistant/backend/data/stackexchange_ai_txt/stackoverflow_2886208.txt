To filter out the empty elements of the array, check out array_filter . To sort the elements, check out sort (or refer to this list of sorting functions to see what meets your needs) $newarray = array_filter($myarray); sort($newarray); This will take the array you pass it (ie. $myarray ) and it will strip out any empty values, then it will store the results to $newarray . After that, sort will organize the remaining values from least to greatest.
