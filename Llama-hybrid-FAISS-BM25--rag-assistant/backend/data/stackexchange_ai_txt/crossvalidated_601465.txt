What is the role, if any, of the Central Limit Theorem in Bayesian Inference?

As someone who started by studying classical statistics where the Central Limit theorem is key to making inferences, and only later now am studying Bayesian statistics, I was late to realize that the Central Limit Theorem has a much smaller role to play in Bayesian statistics. Does the Central Limit Theorem play any role at all in Bayesian inference/statistics? Later Addition : From Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et.al. 3rd edition - on the central limit in the Bayesian context. "This result is often used to justify approximating the posterior distribution with a normal distribution" (page 35). I went through a graduate course in Bayesian Statistics without encountering an example in which the posterior was approximated with a normal distribution. Under what circumstances is it useful to approximate the posterior with a normal distribution?
