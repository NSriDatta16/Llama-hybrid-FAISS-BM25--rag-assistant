Not sure I understood your question completely, but this might be what you are looking for: SELECT avg(difference) FROM ( SELECT timestamp_col - lag(timestamp_col) over (order by timestamp_col) as difference FROM your_table ) t The inner query calculates the distance between each row and the preceding row. The result is an interval for each row in the table. The outer query simply does an average over all differences.
