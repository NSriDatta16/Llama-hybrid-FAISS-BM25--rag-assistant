The short answer is: on a LAN, you will probably notice very few of the tradeoffs (good and bad) of UDP, because on a LAN few things can go wrong. You could lose packets. LAN congestion or local system limitations are the most likely cause. When you leave the LAN, and depend on routers, then the majority of UDP problems will appear (fragmentation, duplicate packets, delayed packets, discarding of packets beyond a certain size, lack of error messages being returned). In other words, MOST of what makes UDP complicated is "leaving the LAN".
