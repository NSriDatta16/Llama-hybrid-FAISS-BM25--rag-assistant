The OR and 95% CI for logistic regression were very high!

I have done binary logistic regression for a dichotomous outcome and used 5 predictors (3 continuous and 2 dichotomous); one of the dichotomous predictor gave a big number of OR and 95% CI (108.28, CI= 6.64- 1764.6, $p By the way, the continuous independent variables were linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable. I tested this Box-Tidwell procedure by adding the interaction terms between the existing continuous independent variables and their natural log transformations to the logistic regression, and they were nonsignificant.
