Your answer will depend on your need, mostly. Points to keep in mind are: include is faster than require. if a file is "included" but is not found, it does not result in a fatal error. The script will continue running. if a file is "requried" but is not found, the script execution stops instantly. However, a side note: if your application is including file4 in file3, file3 in file2 and file2 in file1, then I'd say you should reconsider your file organisation. I'm sure you can come up with a better way of organising your code into files. ADDITION: The speed difference between include and require is pretty marginal. However, require_once() is significantly heavier than require(). Likewise for include_once() and include(). cheers, jrh
