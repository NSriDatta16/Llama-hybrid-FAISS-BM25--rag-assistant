What is being raised is just a basic misunderstanding of statistics coming from the ML "classification" not probability viewpoint. a predicted probability is just a prediction, if you want confidence intervals you need to do something like bootstrapping/bayesian methods. eg if I win 6/10 games or 600/1000 my predicted estimate of winning the next game is still 60%, but the confidence interval around the 60% is much narrower after 1000 games.
