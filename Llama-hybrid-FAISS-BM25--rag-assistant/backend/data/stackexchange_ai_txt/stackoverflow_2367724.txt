asp.net MVC database driven navigation menu

can anybody point me in the right direction as to how I would go about implementing a hierarchical navigation menu which is driven by database? I don't want to re-invent the wheel here, so I was wondering if there is something that's already been done. I'm aware of the Menu control in asp.net, but from what I figure it won't work with MVC. Is there something that's already provided as part of the framework that I can leverage for this purpose? If not, then maybe a few links to point me in the right direction? thanks.
