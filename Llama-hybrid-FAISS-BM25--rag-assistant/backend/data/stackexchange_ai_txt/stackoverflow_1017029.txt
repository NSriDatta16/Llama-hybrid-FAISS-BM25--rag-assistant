MySQL query: show a league table of users ordered by their average rating for the current month

I have a mysql table called RATING with this structure: ID, USERNAME, RATING, RATER, MONTH I want to be able to show a league table of users ordered by their average rating for the current month. For example: 1, Bob, 10, Rita, JUL 2, Bob, 8, Sue, JUL 3, Rita, 9, Bob, JUL 4, Sue, 4, Rita, JUL 5, Rita, 10, Sue, JUL I want a SQL query which would produce these results: Rita: 9.5 Bob: 9 Sue: 4 Any ideas please?
