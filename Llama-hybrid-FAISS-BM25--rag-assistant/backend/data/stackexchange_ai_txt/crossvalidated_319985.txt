How to interpret lmer summary statistics

Just to give you a bit of a background understanding I'm doing a study on how the construction of a motorway affects badger extraterritorial excursions. I have calculated the average excursion distance (continuous response) by each badger for each month meaning I have multiple entries involving the same badgers which is why I need to use an lmer (to account for the individual effects I believe are present). I have four data sets, one from before construction of the motorway, one from during construction, one for after construction and one which includes all the data from before, during and after construction. I am also interested to see what effect sex and age cohort (juvenile, young adult and older adult) have. I have set up a lmer model since i have a continuous response variable. lmerbefore1 I cant really make sense of these results and not sure if they're telling me anything so any explanation would be appreciated. I also did an anova but I'm not sure what the F values are telling me if this makes sense to do at all. anova(lmerbefore1) Analysis of Variance Table Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value sex 1 0.21460 0.21460 1.4687 age_cohort 2 0.31836 0.15918 1.0894 sex:age_cohort 2 0.82447 0.41224 2.8213 i have done the same thing with all three before, during and after data sets and also did a more complex model for the full data set which takes into account the interaction with roadworks lmertotal1
