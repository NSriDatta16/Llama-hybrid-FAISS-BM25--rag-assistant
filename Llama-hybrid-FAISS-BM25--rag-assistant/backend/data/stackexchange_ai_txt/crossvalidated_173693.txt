How does adding a new value to a set of data affect the standard deviation?

For a given set of $n$ numbers with standard deviation $s$, it is my understanding that adding numbers that are far less than $s$ from the average will always reduce the variance. 1) Does this rule always apply? No edge cases? 2) Is there a formal proof?
