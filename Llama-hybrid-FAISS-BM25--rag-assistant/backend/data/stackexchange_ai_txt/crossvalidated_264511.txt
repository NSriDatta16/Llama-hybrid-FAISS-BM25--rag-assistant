Whereas PCA reduces dimensionality, the method you named cluster centriods in your link performs subsampling. PCA removes features, cluster centriods remove datapoints. PCA is thus used in case you have a lot of features, cluster centroids for subsampling is used in case you have a lot of samples (another advantages could be to reduce imbalance as a large cluster and a small cluster both results in a single cluster centriod).
