Your plots clearly show yearly seasonality. A seasonal frequency of 60 for daily data will not capture that, and ARIMA has major issues with "long" seasonality. Daily data typically exhibits multiple-seasonalities . The tag wiki contains pointers to literature for such effects. Previous threads in this tag may be helpful. For your ML tools, I would recommend you include dummy predictors for day of week, and harmonic transforms for day of year . You discuss weather. Note that in production, you will not know tomorrow's weather, only the weather forecast. So even if the weather carries information beyond seasonality, if you use the actual weather in the forecast period, you will be overestimating the quality of your forecasts. ML methods like LSTM work better if you have "many" related time series. They usually do not yield a major benefit over "classical" methods if you have a single or few time series. In-sample fit via $R^2$ is notoriously unreliable as a guide to out-of-sample forecast accuracy. The gold standard in forecast evaluation is using a holdout sample. There is a limit to forecastability. You typically reach it earlier than you think, and earlier than you would like. We have a canonical thread on resources for forecasting, which may be useful for you: Resources/books for project on forecasting models
