In my master thesis I did use (multi class) SVM not on features of a neighborhood but on features of a complete image. Still, many of the features I used and that are somewhat explained and referenced in my paper may help you (NB. Not peer-reviewed). Classification of Cell Images Using MPEG-7-influenced Descriptors and Support Vector Machines in Cell Morphology Perhaps someone else can recommend a good book in image analysis and or computer vision that describes commonly used features?
