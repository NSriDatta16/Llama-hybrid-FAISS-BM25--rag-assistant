There are way too many implementations of Markdown for the same reason there are way too many implementations of the Scheme programming language: It looks like a quick, fun project. Markdown looks really good, but there's just one, little, tiny improvement I want to make... The problem of converting readable ASCII to typeset documents or HTML has been around a long time. The first instance I know if is notech , by Richard J. Lipton and Robert Sedgewick, in a 1990 technical report called "Typesetting Without Formatting". If anybody has a copy of that report, I would love to have one... My favorite reimplementation of Markdown is pandoc , which interconverts a whole boatload of formats.
