If by interaction you mean 'touches' then you can easily do that by putting a UIView (if do not have a global one on top of the others) on each UIViewController in your NavigationController that has the duty of registering a touch, saving the current date to an higher level controller (even the AppDelegate might work). Then this controller can compare the date to the previous one ( you have to store it) and if the time difference overcomes your threshold you can fire your action by messaging the proper object. Here is a guide from Apple on how to catch the touches (you will need to overrid the touchesBegan:WithEvent: method to get the first touch)
