I got the answer..... First I was converting doc on paragraph basis. But instead of that if we process doc file sentence by sentence basis, it is possible to determine whether that sentence contains bullet or any kind of shape or if that sentence is part of table. So once we get this information, then we can convert that sentence appropriately. If someone needs source code, I can share it.
