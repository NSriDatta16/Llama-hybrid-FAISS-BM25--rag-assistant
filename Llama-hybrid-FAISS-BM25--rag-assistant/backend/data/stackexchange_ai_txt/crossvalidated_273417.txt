Heteroskedasticity is a different type of problem in Bayesian thinking than in Frequentist thinking. The Frequentist is just concerned with the sampling distribution of some statistic, in this case, the distribution of the sample mean. The t-test is the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ when $\sigma^2$ is fixed but unknown. There are an infinite number of problems that can be solved with a t-test, while the same issue would be solved by many different Bayesian models. If a person using Bayesian methods knew that there was homoskedasticity or was willing to behave as if there were, then the likelihood function would just be the normal distribution. On the other hand, if there was a suspicion of heteroskedasticity then the person using a Bayesian method, they have to model the form of the heteroskedasticity. The person using Frequentist methods only cares that it exists, but does not care how it comes about. The person using Bayesian methods has to model why it exists and how it exists. As there is not a unique solution as to the cause it could vary with the mean, it could vary with time, it could vary with a specific variable. The person using a Bayesian method would construct two models, one that is homoskedastic and one that is not and run them jointly. Let's imagine that the real concern is whether $\mu\ge{5}$ is true. Then two things are true. The first is that while the researcher wants an accurate model, the researcher also does not care at all what the variance is or if it changes. It is a nuisance parameter and nothing more. The second is that the researcher may behave differently if there is a clear answer to the question than if there is no clear answer. For the first one, Bayesian methods use marginalization to remove the impact of having multiple models and having parameters you do not care about. To have an example of this, let's assume that the follow parameters are being estimated: $\mu$ for the center of location, regardless of model $\sigma^2$ for the variance of the homoskedastic model $\gamma^2$ as one component of the variance of the heteroskedastic model $\lambda$ as the factor triggering heteroskedasticity, which may be a function itself $\mathcal{M}_1$ to designate the homoskedastic model as a parameter $\mathcal{M}_2$ to designate the heteroskedastic model as a parameter. It is important to note that Bayesian methods treat separate models as parameters themselves with probabilities to be estimated. The posterior density function before marginalization would be $$\Pr(\mu;\sigma^2;\gamma^2;\lambda;\mathcal{M}_1;\mathcal{M}_2|X),$$ where $X$ is the data. This would be a five dimension density function. since $\Pr(\mathcal{M}_1)+Pr(\mathcal{M}_2)=1$. When you marginalize you would remove anything you are not concerned with. After marginalization, you would end up with: $$\Pr(\mu\ge{5}|X)=\int_5^\infty\sum_{i=1}^2\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty\Pr(\mu;\sigma^2;\gamma^2;\lambda;\mathcal{M}_i|X)\mathrm{d}\sigma\mathrm{d}\gamma\mathrm{d}\lambda\mathrm{d}\mu.$$ You need to state assumptions about the true value of $\mu,\sigma,\gamma,$ and the relative probabilities that $\mathcal{M}_1$ is true relative to $\mathcal{M}_2$. You also need to state the form of the likelihood function so that it is clear how the heteroskedasticity is generated in the first place. Any statistical package using Bayesian methods could model this. You may have to do some manual coding. The second part mentioned above is that you may be interested in not only the hypothesis but secondarily with whether heteroskedasticity is present or not. In that case, you would marginalize out the center of location and the variance terms. Imagine that the probability that the data was homoskedastic was 99.99%, then you may just drop the results of the other model and treat it as non-existent. In that case, you would marginalize out the variance. On the other hand, imagine that there was a 54% chance the variance was fixed and a 46% chance that it varied in some manner. In that case, you definitely would want to do the procedure above to properly weight the risks that you have the wrong model.
