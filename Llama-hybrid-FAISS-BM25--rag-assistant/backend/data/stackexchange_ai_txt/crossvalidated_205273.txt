Prior choice for ABC is not different than for standard Bayesian analysis - if your parameters act strongly nonlinear on the likelihood, uniform may not be a sensible choice. See, e.g. Kass, R. E. & Wasserman, L. (1996) The selection of prior distributions by formal rules. J. Am. Stat. Assoc., American Statistical Association, 91, 1343-1370. A sensitivity analysis may be useful. Impossible to say if you don't say what data you have - in any case, you typically want to have several summary statistics. You could have a look at the summary statistics tested in Wood, S. N. (2010) Statistical inference for noisy nonlinear ecological dynamic systems. Nature, 466, 1102-1104, this is a fairly similar setup. You need a stochastic model - standard LV is not stochastic, you will need to introduce some stochasticity in the equations.
