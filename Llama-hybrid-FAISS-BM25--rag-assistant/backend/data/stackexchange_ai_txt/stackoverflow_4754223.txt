sql server 2000 dts package fails when scheduled

I have a SQL Server 2000 dts package which copies data from a DBF file to SQL Table I have created a System DSN and provided UNC Names for both Connection and Database file itself. It runs smoothly when ran manually but fails when scheduled as a job? I googled and found that it has to do with the permissions of SQL Server Agent etc Can anyone guide me to the right source/post a solution? "The error says xyz.dbf doesn't exist" in the job history This is related but separate question If i am pulling data from one SQL server to another using dts package provided a condition only,For example ,copy the data between the servers if SourceServer table has a value "OK" i.e if SourceServer.SourceDB.Dbo.CheckStatusTable.Statuscolumn="OK" then copy the value else do not copy If I have something like above condition how do i embed this into a dts package? Thanks
