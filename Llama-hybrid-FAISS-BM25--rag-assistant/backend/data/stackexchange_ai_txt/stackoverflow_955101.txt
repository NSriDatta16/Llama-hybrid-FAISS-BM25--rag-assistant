SQL Column merge and aggregate functions

I have a simple table with two columns (well two columns of interest, plus just an ID)... I have an ajax search which is just looking for keywords... which are then sent to my real search... the ajax search doesn't care what they are, but they need to be distinct... How can I merge the two columns together: City, Country Krakow, Poland Warsaw, Poland Austin, USA New York, USA Prague, Czech Republic So that I would get Keyword, Sideinfo Krakow, Poland Warsaw, Poland Austin, USA Prague, Czech Republic USA, Country (only once) Poland, Country Czech Republic, Country I tried doing a UNION but I'm not sure how i'd do a WHERE LIKE 'keyword%' Hope that makes sense...
