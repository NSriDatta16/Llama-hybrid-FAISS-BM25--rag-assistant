After browsing the reported issues in spacy git page , it turns out that there is an issue mainly with certain version of packages specifically numpy. See this closed thread . As suggested, I did: conda update --all And everything works as expected with the following packages (even in ipython): Python 3.6.5 Anaconda, Inc. Spacy: 2.0.12 Numpy: 1.15.2 Ipython: 6.5.0 Mac OSx 10.13.5 Happy NLP!
