If you are using the USysWare File Browser add-in for Visual Studio, you can very quickly find files of particular names in your solution. Imagine looking for an enum that is not in its own file but instead buried in some file in a gigantic solution. For small solutions, it doesn't matter, but for large ones, it becomes all the more important to keep classes and enums in their own files. You can quickly find them, edit them, and more. I highly, highly recommend putting your enum in its own file. And as was stated... How wasteful is a file that ends up only being a couple of kb anyways?
