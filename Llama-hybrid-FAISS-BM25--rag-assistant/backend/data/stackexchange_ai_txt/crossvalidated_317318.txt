No, posterior distribution is not a statistic if you define it strictly and agree that there is a distinction between statistic and estimator. First of all, it is an estimator of the posterior distribution (see What is the difference between an estimator and a statistic? ). Second, as already noticed in the comment by @whuber , a statistic is a function of the data, while posterior distribution is a function of the data and the priors, so it depends not only on the data. Posterior distribution is an estimate of the distribution of the parameter of the assumed model; statistic would be a function of the sample that characterizes it. The problem is not with the fact that it is a distribution (e.g. one could argue that kernel density estimator, as well as histogram, are statistics), but with your interest in the model, rather then the sample. On another hand, the definition of statistic is very broad and many handbooks give only brief definitions ( "function of the sample" , or "numerical characteristic of a sample" ), or like Leehman and Casella in Theory of Point Estimation say that "estimators are statistics" (p. 16). So when sticking to the definition that statistic is any function of the sample, the answer would be "yes". Do Bayesians use the term "statistic" in the same way that frequentists do, or does Bayesian inference not depend as heavily on the concept of a statistic? In general, Bayesians use all of the statistical terms the same way as other statisticians. They only differ in how they interpret the probability , while sticking to the same definitions (Kolomogorov axioms etc.). If they didn't, they wouldn't be able to communicate with the rest of statistical community and would not be considered as a part of statistics.
