The Illinois Center for Information Technology and Web Accessibility makes a great Firefox plug-in called the Functional Web Accessibility Evaluator (FAE). It analyzes your HTML and finds potential accessibility problems. Coverage includes navigational elements (titles, headings, links, tables, etc.), text equivalents, scripting and even color contrast analysis. They also have a beta version with ARIA support , and are hoping to soon start development on a Firebug extension. Overall a very cool plug-in to add to your toolbox!
