storage allocation at opening brace of scope in c++?

while reading from BRUCE ECKEL'S THINKING IN C++..i came across the following text In c++,a variable can be define at any point in a scope,so it might be seem that storage for variable may not be define until its point of definition .It's actually more likely that the compiler will follow in c of allocating all the storage for a scope at the opening brace of scope. Doubt:I guess its only for storage allocating at stack but my doubt is how compiler get to know that how many objects(or not even a one) is defined inside the main(or other fn) before reaching to its definition in order to allocate storage at the opening brace of scope.
