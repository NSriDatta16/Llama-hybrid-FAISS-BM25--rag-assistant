Elastic net chooses lags beyond ACF cutoff

I've been using Elastic net for time series forecasting. Iâ€™m using first difference of the series. Normally I use the ACF to determine the number of lags to use. I was curious, if I would produce more lags than according to ACF, would Elastic net use them or not. Below is the ACF. The ACF cutoff was around 13-15 lags. I decided to produce 40 lags. Then I used Elastic net and the algorithm used all the variables, also lags 15 to 40. I used 10-fold CV to tune. Below is a plot of the coefficients from Elastic net regression. As you can see, it uses all the 40 lags. What could be the reason for Elastic net using lags that should not affect the outcome according to ACF?
