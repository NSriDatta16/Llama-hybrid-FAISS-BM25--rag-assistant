Interpreting model averaging results in R

I am trying to understand and know what to report from my analysis of some data using model averaging in R. I am using the following script to analyse the effect of method of measurement over a given variable: Here is the dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/s/u9un273gzw9o30u/VMT4.csv?dl=0 Model to be fitted: LM.1 dredge full model require(MuMIn) d=dredge(LM.1) print(d) coefficients(d) Obtain summary information of all models to get parameter estimates summary(model.avg(d)) I know that either all models can be averaged (full model averaging) or just a subset of them (conditional averaging). Now, I would like to know: when is better to use full or conditional averaging to make inferences. What should I report of all this for a scientific article? What means exactly the Z value and associated p for a model averaging situation? To make it easier to visualize my questions. Here is the result table, > summary(model.avg(d))# now, there are effects Call: model.avg(object = d) Component model call: gls(model = VMT ~ , data = VMT4, method = ML, na.action = na.fail) Component models: df logLik AICc delta weight 1 4 -247.10 502.52 0.00 0.34 12 5 -246.17 502.83 0.31 0.29 13 5 -246.52 503.52 1.01 0.20 123 6 -245.60 503.88 1.36 0.17 (Null) 2 -258.62 521.33 18.81 0.00 3 3 -258.38 522.95 20.43 0.00 2 3 -258.60 523.39 20.88 0.00 23 4 -258.36 525.05 22.53 0.00 Term codes: method sex turn 1 2 3 Model-averaged coefficients: (full average) Estimate Std.
