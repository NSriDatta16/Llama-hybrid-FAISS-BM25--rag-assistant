Linear mixed effects model with time series

I have been reading through the different posts here on linear mixed effects models, but am still very unsure whether I have understood the task correctly, therefor I am reaching out for help by the community, any point in the right direction will be greatly appreciated! The task I was given is described as follows: The mean difference between treatment and placebo in terms of symptoms core values at Day1, Day2, Day3, Day4 will be estimated with a repeated linear mixed effect model (LMM) with an unstructured covariance matrix. Treatment and time will be used as fixed effects, and baseline symptoms severity as a covariate. I read that as Dependent variable: Severity at given time Fixed effect: Treatment + Timepoint Covariate: Baseline measure Example data: mydata And then fitting the model as follows: severity.model = lmer(Severity_at_given_time ~ Treatment + Timepoint + (1|Baseline_measure), data=my.data) summary(severity.model) (In my full data that gives an R2 of 0.02) Now I have to say I dont understand the part about "repeated LMM", why is that? From talking to the experimentalists they want to know whether there is a significant difference between treatment and placebo over time, which should already be captured by a single LMM? Many thanks for feedback!
