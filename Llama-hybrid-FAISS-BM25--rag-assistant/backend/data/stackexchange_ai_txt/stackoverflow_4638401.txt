Five updates per second per connection isn't much depending on the number of connections. You didn't say how many connections you have, expect to have. In Java, what I would do in your situation (and I imagine would be just as easy in any technology) is to use batches of data. The performance issues with messaging and databases is often concerning the rate of messages/transactions you perform. I would have a tasks/thread which takes all the messages pending and roll these into a batch, one MQ message, one transaction to the database. The elegance of this solution is that the slower your MQ messaging, the larger the batches and more efficiently it deals with each connection message. The remaining question is a only, can the messaging/database handle the bandwidth of data.
