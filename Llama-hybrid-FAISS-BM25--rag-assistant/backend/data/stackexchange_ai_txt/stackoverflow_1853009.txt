Replace all whitespace with a line break/paragraph mark to make a word list

I am trying to vocab list for a Greek text we are translating in class. I want to replace every space or tab character with a paragraph mark so that every word appears on its own line. Can anyone give me the sed command, and explain what it is that I'm doing? Iâ€™m still trying to figure sed out.
