In order to compare the ground truth (i.e. correct/actual) target values with estimated (i.e. predicted) target values by the random forest , scikit-learn doesn't use the MSE but $R^2$ (unlike e.g. MATLAB or ( Breiman 1996b )), as you can see in the code of forest.py : self.oob_score_ = 0.0 for k in xrange(self.n_outputs_): self.oob_score_ += r2_score(y[:, k], predictions[:, k]) self.oob_score_ /= self.n_outputs_ r2_score() computes the coefficient of determination aka. R2 , whose best possible score is 1.0, and lower values are worse. FYI: What is the out of bag error in Random Forests? What is the difference between “coefficient of determination” and “mean squared error”? Breiman, Leo. Out-of-bag estimation .
