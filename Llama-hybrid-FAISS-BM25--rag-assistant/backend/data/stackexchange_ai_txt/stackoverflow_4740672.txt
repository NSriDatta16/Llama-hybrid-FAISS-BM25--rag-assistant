I am no expert and am continuing to refine my process. I recently blogged about it which should get you off to a great start: http://ntcoding.blogspot.com/2011/01/total-bdd-in-aspnet-mvc_16.html Hope you like it. BDD helps you stay organised and make sure you are developing the right product. Spend a lot of time learning gherkin too. You can use IronRuby in .NET which means RSpec and lots of stuff the rails boys use. Ciao for now :PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
