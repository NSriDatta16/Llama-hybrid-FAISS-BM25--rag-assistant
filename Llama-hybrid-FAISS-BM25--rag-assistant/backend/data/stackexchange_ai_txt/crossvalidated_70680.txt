Some good ecology books based in Bayesian statistics are: Kery, M. 2010. Introduction to WinBUGS for Ecologists: Bayesian approach to regression, ANOVA, mixed models and related analyses . Academic Press. Kery, M., and M. Schaub. 2011. Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS: A hierarchical perspective . Academic Press. Royle, J.A. and R.M. Dorazio. 2008. Hierarchical Modeling and Inference in Ecology: The Analysis of Data from Populations, Metapopulations, and Communities . Academic Press I also find Zuur et al. (2009) very useful. Zuur, A., E. N. Ieno, N. Walker, A. A. Saveliey, and G. M. Smith. Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R . Springer.
