Infragistics XamWebChart Series Fill Color Binding

I have a ControlTemplate that contains a XamWebChart . For each pie slice created in my series, I would like its fill color bound to the same source the Value and Label are coming from. The current xaml for my pie chart looks like: The objects that are Bound to this ControlTemplate are: public sealed class GeographyDataItem{ public IEnumerable Details { get { return _details; } } } With children: public sealed class GeographyDataDetailItem { private readonly IColorProvider _colorProvider; public IColorProvider ColorProvider { get { return _colorProvider; } } public string Identifier { get; private set; } public double Amount { get; private set; } public GeographyDataDetailItem(string identifier, double amount, IColorProvider colorProvider) { _colorProvider = colorProvider; Identifier = identifier; Amount = amount; } } Where IColorProvider is: public interface IColorProvider { Color ForegroundColor { get; } Color BackgroundColor { get; } } The ControlTemplate binding is set to bind to GeographyDataItem elements. The only issue I am having is binding the ForegroundColor property of GeographyDataDetailItem . IColorProvider to the Fill property of the Pie Data Series. I am not sure how to go about this.
