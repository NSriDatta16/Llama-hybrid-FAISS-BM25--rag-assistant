Modelling an elevator using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

There are a set of questions that seem to be commonly-used in interviews and classes when it comes to object-oriented design and analysis. This is one of them; unfortunately, my OOP professor in college never actually gave an answer to it, and so I've been wondering. The problem is as follows: design a basic set of objects/methods to be used to simulate an elevator bank. What are the objects and their attributes/methods? For the sake of argument, let us assume that our building has twenty floors; the bottom floor is the lobby, and the second floor connects to the parking garage (therefore, people will enter/exit the building on either the bottom floor or the second floor). There is one elevator bank that services all the floors; there are three elevator shafts in the elevator bank, and one elevator per shaft. What would be the correct way to model this in an object-oriented model?
