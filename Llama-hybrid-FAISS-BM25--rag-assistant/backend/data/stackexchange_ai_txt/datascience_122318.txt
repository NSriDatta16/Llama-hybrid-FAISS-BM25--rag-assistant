Please give me suggestions to identify scammers from communication data

I have some communication behavior data of carrier subscribers, containing information on calls made, duration and base stations. What do I need to do with this kind of data or what kind of machine learning algorithm can I use to identify the characteristics of fraudsters. I have a little bit of machine learning foundation, but I don't know how to deal with this kind of data of temporal sequential relationship, but I feel that this sequential relationship is a key factor. For example calling different people successively and moving in different base stations successively. Your ideas and help are very much needed, thanks. Since my English is not very good, the text is translated using Google Translate, so sorry if anything is not clear.
