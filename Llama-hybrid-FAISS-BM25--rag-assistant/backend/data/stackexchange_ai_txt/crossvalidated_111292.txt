The word correlate is sometimes used informally as you use it, but in statistics it has a more formal definition. If you measured height and weight in a bunch of kids of different ages, you'd find that on average the taller kids are also heavier. You could say then that height and weight are correlated. If you measured height in men and women, you'd find that on average the men are taller. But a statistician wouldn't usually say that height correlates with gender. The concept is correct, but the term correlate is rarely used like that.
