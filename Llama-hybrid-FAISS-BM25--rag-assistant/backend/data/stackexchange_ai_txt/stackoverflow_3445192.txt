.NET should I store references or values?

I need to store in my object which values have already been handlerd, I am doubting what would cost more performance, should I create an array that stores: The instance references (they are not structs, only ref classes) The hashcode of the items The name of the name of the properties (string) that have been handled Update my aim is that the collection of the data on the handled references should cost the less of memory the possible since I am going to have a tone of the parent instance type. I care less about the retrieval time (i.e. collection.Contains(reference)). So my question is then what of the above array what cost less memory.
