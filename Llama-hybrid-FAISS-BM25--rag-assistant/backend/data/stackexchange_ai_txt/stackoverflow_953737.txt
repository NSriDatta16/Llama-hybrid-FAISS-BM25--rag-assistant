Interesting problem. What you're looking at is word classification. While you can learn and use traditional information retrieval methods like LSA and categorization based on such - I'm not sure if that is your intent (if it is, then do so by all means! :) Since you say you can use external data, I would suggest using wordnet and its link between words. For instance, using wordnet, # S: (n) **fishing**, sportfishing (the act of someone who fishes as a diversion) * direct hypernym / inherited hypernym / sister term o S: (n) **outdoor sport, field sport** (a sport that is played outdoors) + direct hypernym / inherited hypernym / sister term # S: (n) **sport**, athletics (an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition) What we see here is a list of relationships between words. The term fishing relates to outdoor sport , which relates to sport . Now, if you get the drift - it is possible to use this relationship to compute a probability of classifying "fishing" to "sport" - say, based on the linear distance of the word-chain, or number of occurrences, et al. (should be trivial to find resources on how to construct similarity measures using wordnet. when the prof says "not to use google", I assume he means programatically and not as a means to get information to read up on!) As for C# with wordnet - how about http://opensource.ebswift.com/WordNet.Net/
