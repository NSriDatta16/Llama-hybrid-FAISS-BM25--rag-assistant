Well, what you can do is, create your own helper with a collection (through a model), and then filter the collection based on product count. Only a rough draft, but I've posted some code in another magento related question: Magento products by categories . You can see how and when it adds the products count, I'd filter again when this is done. I don't think this is extremely "great" in terms of performance, so instead of using their model classes, you could write your own, extending it and adding default filters, or shortcutting directly to the database. As long as you stay in your skin/template, there are no larger issues with updating.
