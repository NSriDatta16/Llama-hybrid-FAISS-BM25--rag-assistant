About the wishlist.xml problem, i had the same problem, disable it in system>configuration>advanced and/or use the whislist.xml from base/layout like Fooligan said. I'm still searching for a solution for the "Invalid config field backend model: adminhtml/system_config_backend_image_favicon" So, if someone fixed this....? ;)
