Assuming you are submitting files with an HTML form like this: You can get the file type with this in a Python CGI script: form = cgi.FieldStorage() filetype = form['userfile'].type Take into account that the submitted file type is determined by the client web browser. It is not detected by Python CGI library or the HTTP server. You may use Python mimetypes module to guess MIME types from file extensions (e.g.: mimetypes.guess_type(form['userfile'].name) ). You could also use the UNIX file command for the highest reliability although this is usually too costly.
