deep learning for stock prediction

I am learning deep learning . Right now I am using MNIST data set, which contains tens of thousands of scanned images of handwritten digits, together with their correct classifications. My question how to use time series data like stock market data (how to incorporate stock data with neural networks ) My second question how to know which neural networks is suitable for predicting ?
