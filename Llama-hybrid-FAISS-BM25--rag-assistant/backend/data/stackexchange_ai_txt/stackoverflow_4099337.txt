JavaScript native Date objects only know two timezones, UTC and the user's locale timezone (and even then, the amount of information you can extract about the locale timezone is limited). You could work in UTC and subtract 4 hours to get EDT, but do you really always want EDT and not EST? If you want to do timezone conversions between arbitrary regions in PHP you'll need to drag in a large library with its own timezone information, such as TimezoneJS . It may be better to keep the JavaScript stuff all in UTC, and let the PHP side worry about formatting it for a particular locale/timezone, using eg the timezone stuff from Date/Time .
