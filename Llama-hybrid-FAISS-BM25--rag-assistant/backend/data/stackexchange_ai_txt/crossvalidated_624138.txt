Not my area of expertise (limnology, amphibians, or statistical models), but I seem to recall a friend having a similar problem (except with kidney transplant survival data) and he basically fed his data into a few different machine learning frameworks and then pried the lid off the top of the black box and was able to pick out predictors and levels of significance. Depending on the ML framework, e.g. a Bayesian classifier, might have similar results. I will leave it to others to comment on the post-hoc extraction of measures of association and prediction from ML libraries. I think there is another, probably totally off-topic for a stats forum, perspective that I am surprised the reviewer didn't mention. Others commented on the problems w/ having a data set of non-independent (see below) measurements w/ only 9 sites Ã— 4 years, where there are likely significant unmeasured differences, e.g. temperature in the weeks leading up to the sample time, rainfall--and timing is key here, changes in predator species (which may be highly localized), spread of pathogens, or even a change in what brand of pesticide the local farmer is using, etc. would all have potential to confound the crap out of the data. So I think the first thing would be to back up a bit and just look at the data and see if there is a story to tell. You didn't mention what the data actually showed. I don't think you can use year as a separate variable either, as I don't recall frogs living all that long...so while it is a separate sample w/ a different set of variables, it is only a rough proxy of comparable conditions between your sites, assuming they are in the same general area and elevation. If they are ponds up in the mountains at different elevations, then they very well could have markedly different temperature and precipitation profiles. Most ponds in areas w/ sedimentary rock underlying a decent layer of soil are roughly a spherical cap (or a spherical segment if the sediment has truncated the water column to a frustum) has a volume $\mathrm V = \frac{1}{6}\pi h (3a^2 + h^2)$ . a=area, h=depth Since both pH and conductivity (which you didn't mention the range) depend on the volume of water in the pond (as well as runoff) these variables are inherently linked--not just by chance, but intrinsically so. Finally, you didn't mention the year-to-year, pond-to-pond variability. Obviously, your stochastic noise level is pretty high to begin with. One thing you didn't mention, but what you can actually get your hands on is the actual weather data which you might want to try and figure into your analysis as the temperature, rainfall, and to a lesser extent, wind and cloud cover, will impact the water balance which frogs are rather particular about. If you know the location of the ponds, you can probably pull up enough GIS data to get an idea of land use--but it won't tell you how much organochlorine and other hormonal disruptive pesticides were used year to year (although it should be less in each, we hope). I know that isn't the answer to the "what statistical model do I use" question, but might help you answer the "how do I make sense of this data" question.
