A little bit of indirection in the partial class should do the trick... Public Property AssetId() As Int32 Implements IAsset.AssetId Get Return Id1 End Get Set(ByVal value As Int32) Id1 = value End Set End Property The property that implements the interface calls the actual property generated by the dbml. The class will essentially have two id properties, which is not very elegant but when accessed through the interface you won't know the difference.
