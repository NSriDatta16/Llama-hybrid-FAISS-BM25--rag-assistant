How should I interpret these strange density and mixing plots when fitting a generalised pareto distribution using MCMC with JAGS?

I'm trying to fit a generalised pareto distribution to a simulated dataset using JAGS and runjags. When doing so, I get very strange density and mixing plots for the mu parameter. The sigma and xi parameters are estimated as expected. How should I interpret these plots, and proceed to fix my model? The plot and a reproducible model are below. # Simulate gpd require(evir) N Note that increasing the chain length doesn't solve the problem. After increasing the sample from 4,000 to 400,000, the density for mu isn't anything like a unimodal distribution centred around 5:
