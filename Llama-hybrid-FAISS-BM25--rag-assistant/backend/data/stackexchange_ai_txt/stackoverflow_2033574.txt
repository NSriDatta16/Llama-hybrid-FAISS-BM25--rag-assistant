By what type of "table" I assume you mean storage engine. Anything that supports mutations (i.e. not "archive" or "black hole") Any numeric field will do (tinyint, int, float, etc). That said, there's no special PHP code, just the SQL for incrementing the desired field: UPDATE table SET field = field + 1 WHERE [...] If you want a transaction, then pack the above query into a transaction. As for MySQL version, I agree with @hsz - use the most current version possible.
