How to analyze a contingency table with time series?

I have a contingency table with frequency of food items (rows) measured across 10 years (columns). I wonder what kind of analysis I should use to model the variation in food frequencies with time (preferably in R). It is data of nesting gull-billed tern diet. It records the number of times a given prey is brought to a fixed colony. Food categories are bird, fish, frog, reptile, crustacean, insect, other invertebrate. Data is aggregated by year. Hypotheses: Do diet change over the years? If so, does it in a predictable pattern? (for instance monotonic increase of one item over others).
