What is the best way to reuse code in PHP?

Code: if ( $_GET['tab'] == 'newest' ) { // Go through each question foreach( array_reverse( $end_array, true ) as $tags_and_Qid['question_id'] => $titles_and_Qid['title'] ) { // Grab the title for the first array $title = $titles [ $tags_and_Qid['question_id'] ] ['title']; // Grab the tags for the question from the second array $tags = $end_array [ $tags_and_Qid['question_id'] ] ['tag']; // Grab the username for the question from the second array $username = $usernames [ $tags_and_Qid['question_id'] ] ['username']; --- cut ---- } } I need to use this code often. The only difference is the array_reverse (..., true) in the first example. I have tried to solve the problem by making a function organize_question to solve this problem. I was unsuccessful: function organize_questions ( $tab ) { if ( $_GET['tab'] == 'newest' ) { echo ( "array_reverse ( $end_array , true )" ); // Problem here! } if ( $_GET['tab'] == 'oldest' ) { echo ( "$end_array" ); // this does not work } else { echo ( "array_reverse ( $end_array , true )" ); // Problem here! } } I then changed the relevant line in my code to this: foreach( organize_question( $tab ) as $tags_and_Qid['question_id'] => $titles_and_Qid['title'] ) The problem is in transferring variables from one function to another. I tried to put all necessary variables in the parameters of the function, but everything gets broken, since there are many dependencies on this function. I am new to PHP so there must be easier way to do this than what I am trying.
