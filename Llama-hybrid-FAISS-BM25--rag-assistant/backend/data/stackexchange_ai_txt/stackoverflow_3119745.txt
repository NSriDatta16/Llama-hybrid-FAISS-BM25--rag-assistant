Drag and Drop items from a WPF application onto Desktop

I have a WPF application containing set of UserControls. Requirement is that a user should be able to drag any of these UC's from application and drop it anywhere on screen(outside the main application window). From what I have learnt about D&D functionality in WPF , a drag source and drop target is must. But in the above case the drag and drop is across process and there is no predefined drop target. Any idea , suggestion , approach etc are welcomed. And I hope I have explained the scenario quiet clearly. Thanks
