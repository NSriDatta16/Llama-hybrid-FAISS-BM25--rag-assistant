You posted three series each with 3831 daily values. To demonstrate an approach I took the most recent 1274 values (4 years) for series 1 and obtained using AUTOBOX , a time series anlysis package that I helped develop.. A quick visual analysis suggest a possible level shift which was automatically detected using search heuristics. THe ACF OF the original series looked like this . THe auromatic process detected the need for weekly determistic structure . two level shifts and an ARIMA model (1,0,0) .. and . The residials from this model are plotted here with this ACF . Note that the approximate (very) confidence limits are based upon 1/sqrt(1287) yielding unreasonably tight limits . Nothig to worry about ! THe Actual,Fit and Forecast graph is here with the forecasts here The residu al histogram is presented here and the Actual/Cleansed data plot here . In this manner one can deal holistically with the data , yielding an equation that creats a random process leading to forecasts with reasonble limits. With the following residial acf table I wouldn't be concerned . hope this helps ...
