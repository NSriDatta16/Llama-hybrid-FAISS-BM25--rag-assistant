HTML-based Adobe Air Application for Playbook - Cannot read property of "SQLConnection" of undefined

I'm having some real problems getting a HTML-based Adobe Air application to run correctly. I've been developing it in Aptana, and executing it through there is working a treat - no errors whatsoever. The problem occurs when I try to run the same file through Chrome, Firefox (or most importantly) the BlackBerry Playbook simulator. When I try to run my app in any of these environments, it looks as though the jquery isn't running. If I use Chrome to inspect element and view the .js file, it is coming up with two errors - "Uncaught TypeError - Cannot read property 'SQLConnection' of undefined" and "Uncaught TypeError - Cannot read property 'File' of undefined. Any idea what normally causes these errors? The HTML file is: Application Sandbox sample Tripbook logo Travel Tracking Made Simple Log-on as First_Name Last_Name of Company_Name Register a new user Switch Users Switch Job and the javascript file (welcome.js) starts: // Bootstrap $(document).ready(function(){ SetupDB(); displayMenu(); SuggestUser(); }); var log_in_first; var log_in_last; var log_in_company; var db = new air.SQLConnection(); function SetupDB(){ var dbFile = air.File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("tripbook_base.db"); if (!dbFile.exists) { // var dbTemplate = air.File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath("tripbook_base.db"); dbTemplate.copyTo(dbFile, true); } // try { db.open(dbFile); } catch (error) { air.trace("DB error:", error.message); air.trace("Details:", error.details); } }
