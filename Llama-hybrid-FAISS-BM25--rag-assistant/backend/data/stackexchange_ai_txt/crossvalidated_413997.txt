Do non-invertible MA models imply that the effect of past observations increases with the distance?

Update (2019-06-25): changing title from "Do non-invertible MA models make sense?" to distinguish it from Question 333802 . While reviewing MA( $q$ ) models, I came across these slides (Alonso and Garcia-Martos, 2012). The authors state that, while all MA processes are stationary, if they are not invertible you have " the paradoxical situation in which the effect of past observations increases with the distance. " This can be seen in by the decomposition of the MA(1) process: $$ y_t = \epsilon_t - \theta \epsilon_{t-1} $$ into $$ y_t = \epsilon_t -\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \theta ^i y_{t-i} - \theta^t \epsilon_0,$$ where clearly $|\theta|>1$ translates into history having more and more influence over the present. Two things about this bother me: It's not hard to imagine a situation where there's a one-time period lag in the effects of something This Cross Validated Post has an answer which claims: " Invertibility is not really a big deal because almost any Gaussian, non-invertible MA(q) model can be changed to an invertible MA(q) model representing the same process " Is it true that the effect of past observations increases with the distance? If so, does that make the models unfit for describing real world phenomena? Update (2019-11-09) Found this in the text Time Series Analysis and Its Applications (Shumway and Stoffer, page 85) which also supports the case that it doesn't really matter if an MA model in non-invertible, but we may want to chose the non-invertible version of the model for convenience.
