In firefox, how can I change an existing CSS rule

In firefox, I have the following fragment in my .css file tree (negative){ font-size: 120%; color: green;} Using javascript, how do I change the rule , to set the color to red? NOTE: I do not want to change the element. I want to change the rule. Please do not answer with something like ... element.style.color = 'red';
