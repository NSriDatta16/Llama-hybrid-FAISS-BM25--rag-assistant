Using LINQ to query flat text files with fixed-length records?

I've got a file filled with records like this: NCNSCF1124557200811UPPY19871230 The codes are all fixed-length, and some of them link to other flat files (sort of like a relational database). What's the best way of querying this data using LINQ? This is what I came up with intuitively, but I was wondering if there's a more elegant way: var records = File.ReadAllLines("data.txt"); var table = from record in records select new { FirstCode = record.Substring(0, 2), OtherCode = record.Substring(18, 4) };
