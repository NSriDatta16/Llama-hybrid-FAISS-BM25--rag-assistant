Radiomic features

I have a specific problem that I am trying to solve on the topic of radiomic features. Briefly, radiomic features are quantitative features extracted from medical images, such as CT and MRI. let's say, my dataset has CT images scanned with 2 image acquisition parameters (tube current, tube voltage), the value ranges from 0 - 200 in both mAs and kVp. mAs and kVp are settings you need to set to take CT images using CT scanners. I would want a ML model that corrects or shifts the data to an arbitrary level (it could be shifted to any parameter values, maybe median kVp and mAs?, so like 100 kVp and 100 mAs)..so I would want the ML model to transform all the feature values so that they are about the same, despite the values of kVp and mAs parameter.... From many studies, it is shown that using different settings in those two parameter can influence the radiomic feature values that are extracted from our CT images. So basically, those two parameters influence the feature values that I obtain. I am trying to find a way to correct the feature value using these two imaging parameters, i.e. mAs value of 20 and kVp value of 100... and mAs value of 50 and kVp value of 200 would return same value of radiomic feature from the image that I extracted. (the 2 pairs of values that I wrote here is arbitrary, in reality, it could be anything with increment of 10, let's say) so basically, I need to train a machine learning algorithm that corrects the two parameters. So in the end, whichever parameter values I take from 0 - 200 in both mAs and kVp, the feature value I extract from CT images will result in the same value. I would like to hear ideas from the community on what algorithm I can use to tackle such problems.
