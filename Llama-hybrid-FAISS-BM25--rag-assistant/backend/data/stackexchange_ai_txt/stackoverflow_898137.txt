Here's a starting point that works in WebKit. (I used Safari 4.) I haven't had to do any real math in ages, so you'll have to figure out the correct angle of rotation based on the distance of the drag. Also, the rotation box is offset slightly when you start rotating. They may be rotating around a different center point.
