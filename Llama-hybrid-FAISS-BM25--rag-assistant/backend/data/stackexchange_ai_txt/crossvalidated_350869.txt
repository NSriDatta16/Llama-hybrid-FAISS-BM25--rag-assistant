Maximization of Output based on Input

What I want to do is find the values for $X = $ { $x_j$ } that will produce the maximum $y$. I'm currently trying to maximize my output $y$, based on my inputs $X$. Say there are inputs, $X = $ { $x_1 , x_2 , x_3 \cdots , x_j $ }. Each example has all the features in $X$, and a $y$ value - ie one example is $ ( X_i, y_i) $ What I want to do is find the values for $X = $ { $x_j$ } that will produce the maximum $y$. One (shitty) idea is create a neural network with $j$ input nodes in the first layer and have one single output node. Train the NN, which would let me predict the output $y$ based on $X$ which isn't helpful for my example. So I would then generate a bunch of randomized values for $X$ and find the value that outputs the largest $y$ which is obviously super inefficient. Another (shitty) idea is to train the NN like above, but this time use some sort of Reinforcement learning to optimize the inputs. I don't know much about RL, but it seems to be unnecessary and not helpful in this situation because the training examples are varied which means the $y$ value wouldn't be optimized? (I don't know much about this specifically.) Is there a specific model or algorithm that would let me find the maximum $y$ based on my $X$ values? This question is pretty similar to this but here they don't actually give a specific model to follow. NEW EDIT : As requested by @whuber a more clear explanation of the context. I am conducting an experiment that has many parameters I am able to vary. I can then develop a large(ish) dataset with each of the parameters/features somehow affecting my final output $y$. The inputs are my features/parameters $X =$ {$x_j$} and each example of $(X_i, y_i)$ contains a variation on the features called $X_i$ where $i$ is the number of training examples and $j$ is the number of features comprised in $X$. - I have no idea what the relationship between $X$ and $y$ so I don't know what $f$ maps from $X \mapsto y$ I want to know what I changes I can do to my parameters ($X =$ {$x_j$} ) in my experiment in order to maximize my output ($y$).
