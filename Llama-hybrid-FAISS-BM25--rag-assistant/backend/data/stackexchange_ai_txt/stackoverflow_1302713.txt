My suspicion is that something is off in the structure of your request (e.g., a missing header), since the XML content sounds like it's valid (or at least like USPS's servers read it correctly). Our implementation of the USPS API uses a raw TCP/IP connection with fsockopen , which has the advantage that I can confirm precisely what we're sending in the structure of the request: POST /ShippingAPI.dll HTTP/1.0 The only headers we're including on the request are these: User-Agent: (foo)\r\n Host: (bar)\r\n Content-Type: text/xml\r\n Content-Length: strlen($xml)\r\n\r\n Does that match what you're sending through cURL?
