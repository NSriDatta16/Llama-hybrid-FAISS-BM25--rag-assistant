JMF can be deployed via JNLP. (1) It would be achieved by calling the install procedure from within an installer-desc JNLP. The installer is invoked a single time, when the app. is first launched. As to what to do within that installer JNLP, there are two options. One way is to call the normal installer (e.g. for Windows - that would be the .exe), but that has the disadvantage that the user would be prompted to reboot. I checked that by not rebooting and found it to be unnecessary, but the message is irritating. JWS can partition the download so that Windows gets the .exe, while Mac and *nix get whatever installer is appropriate to them. The other way is to simply add the appropriate JMF Jars into the resources section of your main JNLP file, but you might need to write some code to invoke the JMFRegistry, which I think is done automatically in the installer. 1) Note: I have tested neither method. Edit: Forgot to mention that I have a little demo. of the ExtensionInstallerService that is invoked via. the installer-desc mentioned above.
