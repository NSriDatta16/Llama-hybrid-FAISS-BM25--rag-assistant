Are Lyapovov exponents related to statistical precision?

In my understanding, Lyapunov exponents measure the average rate of separation of near-identical chaotic trajectories, while statistical precision, in the context of a predictive model, is a measure of a spread of projections, taking into account the uncertainty of the input data. This blog post states that: The precision of a model is the variance of its predictions, without reference to observations. This is in the context of numerical climate models. These models don't have any explicit variance estimates: a single simulation simply outputs a single value for a given variable at each timestep/grid point. You could calculate an approximation of a Lyapunov exponent by taking rate of change in the variance of an ensemble of simulations with similar initial conditions. But is this actually a measure of model precision?
