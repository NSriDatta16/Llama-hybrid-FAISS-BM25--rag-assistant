Why is Visual Studio 2010 crashing in the HTML designer?

Fairly consistently when I'm using the HTML designer for editing ASP.NET files that contain essentially text and paragraphs, usually after a prolonged "Requesting data..." in the status bar, Visual Studio 2010 will just crash completely. No error message is shown, only the usual Visual Studio has encountered a problem dialog. I have two extensions installed - PowerCommands and Productivity Power Tools. No other plugins. I'm fairly sure (though not 100%) that it crashed before these were installed too. Here's an example event log: Faulting application name: devenv.exe, version: 10.0.30319.1, time stamp: 0x4ba1fab3 Faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000 Exception code: 0xc0000005 Fault offset: 0x72006500 Faulting process id: 0x5c8 Faulting application start time: 0x01cbbce486b11b94 Faulting application path: c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe Faulting module path: unknown Report Id: 0999f614-28d8-11e0-81d1-6cf04975111f EDIT I may have found the problem. Someone had installed the spelling checker extension from the extension manager in Visual Studio. I've uninstalled it and since have had no crashes.
