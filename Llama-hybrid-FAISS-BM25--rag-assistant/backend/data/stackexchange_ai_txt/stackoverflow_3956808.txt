Is there any visual tool for design and generate code of PHP classes?

I know that general, language agnostic design can be done with any of UML tools but is there anything made just for PHP (or with PHP as one of optional choices)? For now I use NClass, it's nice and easy to use but it is designed for C# so I have to use syntax of this language (types for method's arguments, etc.). I googled the web but I didn't noticed anything made with PHP syntax in mind so I ask here. It would also be great not to find out that some plugin for Visual Studio or Eclipse is the answer :) Not that I'm against these products but something lighter and separated from huge IDE would be nice to have in my toolkit. EDIT : I just downloaded ArgoUML because it suppose to have PHP support, so I check it out but let that fact not discourage you, I'm still waiting for your tips :) EDIT2 : Little feature I also seek in tool in question is assistance for code issues like adding interface methods to a class implementing that interface, for example. ArgoUML does not have such feature or I just didn't not found it yet.
