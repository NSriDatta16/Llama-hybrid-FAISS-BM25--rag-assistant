I have also used the above diagnostic and here's what happens: int number = layeredPane.getLayer(chessPiece); int number3 = layeredPane.getComponentCountInLayer(JLayeredPane.DRAG_LAYER); While dragging, the first one always returns the number 400 which is the notation for the drag layer. BUT the other one returns a 1 at first but then it all become zeros as we drag... This means that at least for an instance of time, the chesspiece actually GOT into the drag layer and then fell off. But that's what happens if you ask the pane... Does this help at all? Also, would you mind giving me a link of the jlayeredpane source code? I'm looking for JLayeredPane.java but had no luck till now... Thanx in advance...
