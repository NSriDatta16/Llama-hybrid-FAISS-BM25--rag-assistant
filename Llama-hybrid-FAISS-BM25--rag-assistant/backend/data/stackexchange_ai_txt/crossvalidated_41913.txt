Choosing right algorithm for binary classification

I'm having a problem to predict hits from original features. I tried using LDA on original matrix but the thing is that probability of getting a hit vs non-hit is 95% vs 5%. That said after running LDA I get true positive rate of 5% and true negative rate of 96%. Now, my understanding of LDA makes me think that when it separates hits from non-hits into two groups the later gets more attention, however what I really want is to minimize the false discovery rate, even better to control it. The question is what algorithm is best suited for this? I have two binary coexclusive groups (Hit/Not-hit).
