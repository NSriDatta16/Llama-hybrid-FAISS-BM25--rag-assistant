How to check t-SNE performance?

We use t-SNE to visualize multidimensional vectors into 2D or 3D space, and if my understanding of this algorithm is correct, we can compare it to PCA as it also provides dimensionality reduction. My question is how can I check if my t-SNE with certain parameters is doing a good job (as explained variability metrics for PCA)?
