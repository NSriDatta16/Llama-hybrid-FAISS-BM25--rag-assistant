Bayesian Network: tools for simulation to create a sample set from reference Bayesian Networks?

There are some commonly used reference Bayesian networks, which can be found in the Bayesian Network Repository , and I want to simulate a data set from such a reference graph. Are there any tools that can help me do this? The tools need to be able to load the files of one of the formats in the Bayesian Network Repository (such as .bif and .dsc) and do the simulation to generate a number of samples.
