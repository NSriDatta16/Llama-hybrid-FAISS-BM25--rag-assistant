I Checked both the string.Compare and string.CompareOrdinal using stop watch --Compare Ordinal case 1 Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch(); sw.Start(); int x = string.CompareOrdinal("Jaswant Agarwal", "Jaswant Agarwal"); sw.Stop(); lblTimeGap.Text = sw.Elapsed.ToString(); -- Only compare case 2 Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch(); sw.Start(); int x = string.Compare("Jaswant Agarwal", "Jaswant Agarwal"); sw.Stop(); lblTimeGap.Text = sw.Elapsed.ToString(); In case 1 Average elapsed timing was 00:00:00.0000030 In case 2 Average elapsed timing was 00:00:00.0000086 I tried with different Equal and not equal combinations of string and found that every time CompareOrdinal is faster than only compare.. That is my own observation..you can also try just put two buttons on a form and copy paste this code in regrading event..
