You seem to be confused more about the definition of quantiles and/or boxplots than about seaborn (which is mainly a wrapper for matplotlib ). A quantile divides a range of observations (or a probability distribution) into intervals with equal probabilities. Common quantiles include quartiles (four intervals) or percentiles (100 intervals), though you can theoretically define any quantile $p$ within $(0, 1)$ . $y$ is the population quantile $k$ of the variable $Y$ if: $$\text{Pr}(Y However, we almost never observe populations, only samples. The sample quantile $p$ is defined as a weighted average of consecutive order statistics between two observations $j$ and $j+1$ from your sample $x$ : $$ Q(p)=(1-\gamma)x_j+\gamma x_{j+1} $$ There are nine different common definitions of sample quantiles ( Wikipedia has a summary too, and this blog post makes some comparisons) that will determine the values of $j$ and $\gamma$ in the above formula. seaborn calls numpy.percentile to draw its boxplots which defaults to Hyndman & Fan type 7 quantiles, using the following definitions: $$j = \lfloor np+(1-p)\rfloor$$ $$\gamma = np+(1-p)-j$$ This all seems more complicated than it needs to be right now, but with these formulae we can exactly reproduce the calculations. You have $x=\{1,2,3,4\}$ so $n=4$ and are looking for quantiles $p=0.25, 0.50, 0.75$ (quartiles). For $p=0.25$ you end up with $j=1$ and $\gamma=0.75$ , so the quantile itself becomes: $$Q(0.25)=(1-0.75)x_1+0.75x_2=0.25\times 1+0.75\times 2=1.75$$ The additional quantiles are: $$Q(0.50)=(1-0.50)x_2+0.50x_3=0.50\times 2+0.50\times 3=2.5$$ $$Q(0.75)=(1-0.25)x_3+0.25x_4=0.75\times 3+0.25\times 4=3.25$$ These are also exactly the values where the boxplot boxes ended up being plotted. It should be noted that you drew up a pretty contrived example, drawing quartiles from $n=4$ , but the formula should let you (re)calculate any quantiles of any sample. If you're feeling adventurous you can even adapt the definitions of $j$ and $\gamma$ to other quantile types which is the method argument of numpy.percentile , though I'm quite sure this is not exposed in seaborn / matplotlib . The quantile definitions that result in $Q(0.25)=1.5$ as you seem to expect for this particular sample are H&F types 2 and 5. The definition of the boxplot itself is really very standard and follows Tukey's original presentation, I'll just copy the matplotlib documentation here: The box extends from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3) of the data, with a line at the median. The whiskers extend from the box to the farthest data point lying within 1.5x the inter-quartile range (IQR) from the box. Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.
