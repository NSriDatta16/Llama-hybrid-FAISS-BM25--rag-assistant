Ah... the rationale for not having a straightforward method in Java to do that is file storage abstraction: some filesystems may not have the number of files in a directory readily available... that count may not even have any meaning at all (see for example distributed, P2P filesystems, fs that store file lists as a linked list, or database-backed filesystems...). So yes, new File( ).list().length is probably your best bet.
