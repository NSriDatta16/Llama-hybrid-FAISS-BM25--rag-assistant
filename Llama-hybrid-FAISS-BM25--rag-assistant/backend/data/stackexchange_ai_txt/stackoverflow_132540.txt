Architecture alone might turn people into astronauts / zombies. So they should definitely have some coding to do even if that's basic prototyping. In fact the success of their prototypes must be definite review factor. They should give out by-monthly presentations / frequent blogs that track their work, so that others in the organization can learns. There should be academic goals like being familiar with certain platforms / tools / books and design philosophies. They should be given time to pursue new tools / projects / responsibilities in existing projects if they feel like it. They would have the responsibility to do at-least 3-4 code reviews of critical modules and come up with code style guidelines. They would have the responsibility to review low level designs at -least of key modules. They should be given spare time as individuals or team to build something they feel might be useful. They should have the option to forego architecture and return to regular work if they feel like it with no penalties involved. They should have the information about whats happening across all projects running in the organization. At least one project should be followed closely so that they can inform their own peers about stuff happening elsewhere. This can possibly be the project in which they perform code reviews and such. They should have a highly technical person as their manager. Architects should be switched between projects once they are very familiar with one of them, and allowed to follow on whatever prototype they where following while working with the original project. Have at least one real goal (Like consolidate all commonalities across projects into a single library) every 1 year Invest time and training to ensure that architects do not get ego bound and conduct fairly professionally. Conflict resolution and other soft skills training along with budget for technical meetings and trainings would be definitely required too.
