Ok, sorry. My stupid mistake. The svm used scaled dataset for training, but I was using un-scaled dataset for test data. ./svm-predict parameters.data.scale parameters.data.model svmpredict_output.log Like above, everything works well. (extension like *.scale, *.data should be the same if you're using easy.py)
