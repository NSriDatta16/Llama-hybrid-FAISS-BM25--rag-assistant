An algorithm to create HTML table from this row data?

I have come unstuck on a relatively (almost) trivial problem. I have a row of data that I want to display in tabular form (HTML). For some reason (possibly long day [again] behind the computer), I am not coming up with any elegant solutions (algorithms) to do this. I have presented some sample data, and how such data would be displayed in the table. I would be grateful for some ideas on algos to implement this. The output table has rows labelled with the various scores and the indices are displayed at the bottom. I would like to be able to have a variable determine the number of columns to print, before a new table is printed underneath - to prevent ridiculously long tables. so I want to write a function with the following signature (ignoring data types): function create_table_html_from_rows(datarows, max_cols_per_table) Here is the sample data and mock output table presentation Row data: index, Score, amount 1, level 1, 12.24 3, level 4, 14.61 9, level 10, 42.35 15, level 2, -8.12 Scores ====== Level 1 12.24 Level 2 -8.12 Level 3 Level 4 14.61 ..... Level 10 42.35 ---------------------------------------- | 1 | 3 | 9 | 15 Pseudocode should be sufficient, however, if you snippet is in a programming language, it is perharps worth pointing out that I will be implementing my algorithm in Python, however any snippets in any of the following languages would be fine: Python, C, C++, PHP, C#
