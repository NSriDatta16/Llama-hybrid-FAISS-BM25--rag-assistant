Can Logistic Regression be used as the base learner in bagging?

I am working on a multiclass classification problem which uses sentiments extracted from review texts as feature space and tries to predict the numerical ratings. I am interested in using bagging approach to make predictions. My question is about the appropriateness of using Logistic Regression as the base learner in bagging. The reason why I am interested in Logistic Regression is because I came to know that TF-IDF and Logistic Regression is a powerful combo.
