There is dependency Walker, if you don't know this tool. http://dependencywalker.com/ Drag and drop your DLL or exe on the main window. It will show all dependencies. And if you want to link to a 3rd party DLL, all you need is a .lib made for that DLL. If you don't have that .lib, you can always make one using lib.exe or polib.exe from pelles c tools. polib is easier to use because you don't need to write a .def file. http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/ I hope it helps for your question. Edit: Do you have the source code for the .lib you are using?
