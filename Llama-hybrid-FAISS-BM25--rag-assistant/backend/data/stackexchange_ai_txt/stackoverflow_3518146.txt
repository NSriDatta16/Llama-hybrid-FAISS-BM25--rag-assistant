WPF Button isPressed and isEnabled problem

Update: using Expression Blend 3 I'm trying to style the IsPressed & IsEnabled(false) property triggers for a class of buttons in a WPF application. Here's a UserControl with a Button using the style... And here's the style fragment... The Default and Mouse over changes work fine, but isEnabled false and isPressed true still show the Button default colors. What am I doing wrong?
