Data definition has no type or storage class with float array definition

I'll probably find the answer soon enough by blind experimentation or a better Google search, but.. This might benefit others. This is NOT inside a class definition, but is in a .m objective-c file. I've got a declaration of a float array that is giving me the following two warnings in Xcode. The errors show up on the DECLARATION line, not the assignment line. Data declaration has no type or storage class. Type defaults to 'int' in declaration Then an assignment fails - but if the variable is defaulting to int, that would happen. Here's the code. The first declaration (static const float array with initializer) doesn't give an error, nor does the second (simple float). The third and forth (float arrays) do. static const float offset3d[4] = { 0.0, 0.0, -2.0, 0.0 }; float boxv; float boxv0[3]; float boxv1[3]; boxv0[0] = -0.5; // this gives the error of trying to assign float to (default) int
