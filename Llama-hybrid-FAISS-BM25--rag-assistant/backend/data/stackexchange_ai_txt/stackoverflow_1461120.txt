You should start by creating your own module in app/code/local. Create for example the directories Moak/Vip. It will be the root of your module. In order for Magento to know it exists, create a file named Moak_Vip.xml in etc/modules, with the following content : true local Moak VIP module Then, in your module directory, you need the following structure and files : etc/config.xml Model/Observer.php The config.xml defines your module and declares your event listener for a given event ( checkout_onepage_controller_success_action is sent when onepage checkout process is complete, sales_order_payment_pay is sent when the payment has been confirmed). You don't need any DB setup since you will not save any new entity. So your config file should look something like the following : 0.1.0 Moak_Vip_Model singleton moak/observer checkVipCustomer Now, your Observer method checkVipCustomer should receive an event object from which you can retrieve all information about the order, the customer... and perform the modifications you like. Have a look at Magento model classes in app/code/core/Mage/.../Model/... to see how to navigate through those objects. Example : getInvoice()->getOrder(); // Mage_Sales_Model_Order /* - Check order amount - Get customer object - Set Group id - $customer->save(); */ return $this; } } Note I've not tested any of the code I wrote here, so handle with care ! Hope it helped, Magento has a hard learning curve... Good luck !
