1) For Logistic regression, Pregibon (1981) developed two types of Cook's distances that were literally implemented in PROC LOGISTIC in SAS under the names of C and CBAR, correspondingly. 2) For other generalized linear models, PROC GENMOD produces DOBS that is equal to C divided by the number of regression coefficients, $p$. Roughly speaking, C is influential if it's much higher than the mean of $\chi^2(p)$ (which is $p$), and DOBS is influential if it's much greater than 2.
