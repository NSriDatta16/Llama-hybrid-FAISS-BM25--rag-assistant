Cross validation is only used to evaluate performance. This is true in general, it is not a procedure that optimizes, fits or chooses parameters. It can be confusing, because people will perform cross-validation for different sets of hyper parameters, and then use the hyper parameters that perform best, which is measured using cross-validation. So here, cross-validation will give you a measure of how this algorithm performs (although cross-validation on time series is tricky), and it may inform you decision on hyper parameters, such as whether to include holidays, custom seasonalities and so on.
