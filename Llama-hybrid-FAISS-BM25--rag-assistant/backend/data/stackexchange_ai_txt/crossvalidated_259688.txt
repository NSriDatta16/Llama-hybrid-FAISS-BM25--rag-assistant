Generalized linear model is defined in terms of linear predictor $$ \eta = X\beta $$ Next thing is probability distribution that describes conditional distribution of $Y$ and a link function $g$ that "provides the relationship between the linear predictor and the mean of the distribution function", since we are not predicting the values of $Y$ but rather conditional mean of $Y$ given predictors $X$, i.e. $$ E(Y|X) = g^{-1}(\eta) $$ In case of Gaussian family GLM (linear regression) identity function is used as a link function, so $E(Y|X) = \eta$, while in case of logistic regression logit function is used. (Inverse of) logit function transforms values of $\eta$ in $(-\infty, \infty)$ to $(0, 1)$, since logistic regression predicts probabilities of success , i.e. mean of Bernoulli distribution. Other functions are used for transforming linear predictors to means of different distributions, for example log function for Poisson regression , or inverse link for gamma regression. So link function does not link values of $Y$ (e.g. binary, in case of logistic regression) and linear predictor, but mean of the distribution of $Y$ with $\eta$ (actually, to translate the probabilities to $0$'s and $1$'s you would additionally need a decition rule ). So the take-away message is that we are not predicting the values of $Y$ but instead describing it in terms of probabilistic model and estimating parameters of conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$. For learning more about link functions and GLM's you can check Difference between 'link function' and 'canonical link function' for GLM , Purpose of the link function in generalized linear model and Difference between logit and probit models threads, the very good Wikipedia article on GLM's and the Generalized linear models book by McCullagh and Nelder.
