How to extract name of objects from technical description (NLP)

I have a list of technical descriptions of mechanical parts such as Relay Compressor A4u8skk Relay-Start-Compressor sdfvsh2 Relay-Start-Compressor-Copelan 05-569-21 Compressor-J4KS0AK-5gss-fj2 and i would like that my model output for the each sample of that list above will be "Compressor" , i have 700+ unique samples like the one above, not only Compressor but large list of items . What is the best approach / models that i should look for that kind of task? is topic modeling related ?
