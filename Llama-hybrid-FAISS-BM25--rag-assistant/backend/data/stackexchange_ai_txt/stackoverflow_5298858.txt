List all of one file type on Android device?

For example, I want to retrieve a list of all .mp3 files on the internal AND external storage. I would also like the path ( String ) of each .mp3 file for reference (store them in a List ?) How could I do this? Is this a relatively expensive operation? If so, should it be put on a thread and while that is running, present the user with a "Loading" ProgressDialog ?
