Input text box scrolling

I currently am having a problem with HTML , as in the Google Chrome browser, if I use the below CSS, when I type text into the box, I am able to highlight the text and drag it up and down, as if it is scrolling a little 2px, due to the text larger than the input box. Can anyone help me solve my problem, and prevent the dragging to scroll up and down the 2px? Many thanks! input { border: 0px; font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace; font-size: 13px; color: inherit; margin: -1px; background: none; }
