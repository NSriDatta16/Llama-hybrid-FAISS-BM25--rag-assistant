I see that there has already been an accepted answer here, but I'd encourage everyone to take a look at the latest release of Spring Toolsuite (SpringSource's distro of Eclipse). It comes with a profiling utility out of the box, Spring Insight, that provides these exact statistics at runtime in a nice format. Just deploy your app to its internal tomcat, hit a few pages, then go to the /insight servlet and see the time taken in each method called all the way down to the SQL statements that were executed and how long they took. Here's a link to a nice writeup about Spring Insight that should get you what you want in just a few minutes. http://www.dotkam.com/2009/10/28/spring-insight-in-action-5-minutes-from-scratch/
