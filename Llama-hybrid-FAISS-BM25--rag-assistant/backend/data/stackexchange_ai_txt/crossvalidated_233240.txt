Not sure if this is really an answer ... I am guessing (but do not know) that one cannot sample from an only finitely additive distribution. An example would be the uniform distribution on the rational numbers, which only can exist as a finitely additive distribution. To see this, let $(q_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ be an enumeration of the rationals. Since the distribution is uniform, $P(X=q_i)=0$ for any individual $i$, so $\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(X=q_i)=0$ but $P(X\in \mathbb{Q})=1$. If this answer looks strange and even irrelevant, look at more practical examples which are sometimes used in Bayesian inference: A uniform prior distribution on a real parameter, such as the mean of a normal distribution, say $\mu$. That can be modeled by a "density" (not a real probability density) which is identically one: $\pi(\mu) = 1$. Such a prior can be used in Bayesian analysis (and is sometimes used, see the classic book by Box & Tiao), but we cannot sample from it. And, the probability distribution defined that way is only finitely additive, which you can see by an argument similar to the rational number example above.
