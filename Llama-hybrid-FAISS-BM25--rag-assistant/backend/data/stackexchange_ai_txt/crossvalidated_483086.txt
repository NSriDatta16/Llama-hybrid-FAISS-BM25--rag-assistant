How to calculate conditional probability

I have data on average time a real estate property is in the market/time to lease at different price points. I'd like to calculate the conditional probability for a new property to get leased, given the price. Additionally, I'd like to include information about the market such as level of supply which affects the avg. time the property is on the market. How would I frame this as a bayesian probability estimation problem?
