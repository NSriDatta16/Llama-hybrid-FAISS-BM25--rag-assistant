Conditional distribution of | is logistic distribution. Is this right? Or is it a categorical distribution? No, $y$ is a binary variable so cannot have a logistic distribution. The conditional distribution of $y\mid x$ is binomial. PDF at a single point is zero. So how can we get probabilities in logistic regression if it is a continuous distribution? $y$ is categorical, so does not have a pdf, it has a pmf (probability mass function.) By the way, the PDF at a single point does not need to be zero, see Can a probability distribution value exceeding 1 be OK? for intuition. As a side question, what is it we get when we evaluate a PDF at a single point? For example, in scipy.stats, norm().pdf(3) returns a value, what is it? See the answer above. For the question in the title about relationship logistic distribution and logistic regression see How is Logistic Regression related to Logistic Distribution?
