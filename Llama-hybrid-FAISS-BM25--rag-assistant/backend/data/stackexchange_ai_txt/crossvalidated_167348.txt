You assert " ARIMA can give an over fit for such series. Moreover, ARIMA will not really take into consideration the seasonality, it's advised to remove trends and seasonality from the system and bring the TS into stationary to use ARIMA." On the contrary, the final ARIMA model can take into account seasonality BUT it is purely autoregressive seasonality whereas deterministic seasonality might be more applicable. You are confusing identification steps and final model identification which by the way is not unusual in time series newbies. Note that stepdown and stepup strategies yield models that are minimally sufficient whereas naive one-step identification procedures using a list-based process are flawed in this regard ( and more ! ) Good analysis should consider both approaches incorporating either or both as is suggested by the actual data while being sensitive/robust to the detection of unusual/untoward values. If you post an example time series I will use my favorite tool to do just that. Note that deterministic factors like day-of-the-week often change over time and that may not be identifiable with only five weeks of data. AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: I used AUTOBOX a commercial piece of software that I have helped to develop. I was given 48 values for each of 6 time series , each of which was to be separately analyzed just using the history of the series in question . The OP wishes to predict out 1 period from each of 28 origins starting at origin 20 and ending at origin 47. He wished a hands-free totally automatic procedure to examine/study data up to and including the origin to be solely used to develop a model and make a 1 period out prediction. Please download from http://www.autobox.com/stack/ALL6.ZIP . It contains 6 separate csv files ( one for each time series) presenting the forecast, the actual and the mape . Additionally for series 6 as an example, I have included a file called 6htm.zip detailing the modelling process that was conducted for each of the 28 origins as supporting "proof" of the hands-free solution and the resulting audit trail .
