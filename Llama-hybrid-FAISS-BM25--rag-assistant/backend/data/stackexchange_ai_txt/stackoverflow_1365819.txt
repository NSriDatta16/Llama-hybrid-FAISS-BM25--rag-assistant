We've experimented with test coverage tools for Rockwell Control Logix controllers. Most procedural language test coverage tools do branch coverage or some such; because Relay Ladder Logic typically doesn't branch, this doesn't work very well. What we have prototyped is MC/DC (modified/condition/decision coverage) for RLL code for Rockwell controllers.. This tells, for each condition in rung, whether that condition has been tested as TRUE, tested as FALSE, and more importantly, if the condition controlled the output of the decision in the rung (well at least the action controlled by the decision) in both true and false directions under some test. This work is done using a general purpose program analysis and transformation tool called DMS used to instrument the RLL code with additional logic to collect the necessary data. You still have to code unit tests. The easiest way to do that is to get another PLC to act as a replacement for the mechanical hardware you intend to control, and simply write another RLL program to exercise the first one.
