If it makes a better prediction, then of course it makes sense to include the interaction in the model. In assessing the treatment effect, one has to recognize that by including the interaction with gender, you are saying that the treatment effect depends on gender. So what I suggest doing is estimating the means and comparisons separately at each gender. Something like this, if using R: library(emmeans) EMM The marginal means are computed at the average age. Since you have age squared in the model, it is a little tricky because if age^2 is a separate variable, it will also by default use the average of (age^2), which makes no sense because that's not the same as (average age)^2. Your best bet is to fit the model with those variables computed, e.g., poly(age, degree = 2) . Stata help? Can a Stata expert please show us how to do this in Stata?
