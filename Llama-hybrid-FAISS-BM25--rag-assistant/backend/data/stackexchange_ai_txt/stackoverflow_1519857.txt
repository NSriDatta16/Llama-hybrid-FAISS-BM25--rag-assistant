No, but maybe you can change the script to consume less memory. Update . I have tried to reproduce the problem on Linux, corresponding to the script listed in the other question . In Bash: while read fileName; do echo echo ----------------------------------------------- echo For file $fileName : while read matchItem; do echo Searching for $matchItem echo sed -i "s/$matchItem/XXXXXXXXX $matchItem XXXXXXXXXXXXXX/" $fileName done I have used fragments of a protein sequence database (large text file, FASTA format, up to 74 MB) and short peptide sequences for the test (such that there was at least 10 replaces per file). While it is running no process is using any significant memory (as I would expect). CPU load is on the order of 50% while it is running. Thus I can not reproduce the problem.
