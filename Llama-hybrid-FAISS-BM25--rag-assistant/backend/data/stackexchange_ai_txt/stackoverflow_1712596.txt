A few years back, I've been beating my head against the wall trying to convert HTML into PDF for days. What I wanted to do was really simple - make an invoice for customers into a PDF file. An image (logo) up on top, a few paragraphs, and a table with a list of charges. The hole shaped like my head on the wall is still there. All of the free libraries that convert things to PDF - they all suck. I found one that sucks the least, it's DomPDF. At least that one ended up doing the job, after a week of suffering and debugging. It's not fast by any means, though (if you want to generate a complex PDF, you might want to do it off-thread).
