Your filter is a specialization of the Finite Impulse Response filter. You're using the moving average method to select the coefficients, using N = 1. It already is a low-pass filter. Calculating the coefficient and order for the filter to tune it to a specific frequency response involves tricky math. Best thing to do is to use a software package to calculate the coefficients if moving average doesn't fit your bill. Matlab is the usual choice, GNU Octave is an open source option.
