How do I go about rectifying violated assumptions when more than one is violated at the same time?

I am currently trying to run a model analyzing the duration of the egg stage of each sex of two species of insect across five different temperatures. All independent variables are categorical. My model looks like this: model1 In building this model I have tried to evaluate the assumptions of: Normality of residuals Homoscedasticity No serial autocorrelation no unduly influential observations (leverage above a particular threshold). It would seem that all of these assumptions appear to have been violated (see below my diagnostic plots, Autocorrelation function plot, leverage plot). As a result I was wondering what would be the best assumption to tackle first or whether or not there is a generally accepted hierarchy as to which assumptions, if violated, should be rectified first. Here are my diagnostic plots via plot(model1): Here is my autocorrelation function plot: Here is my plot of leverage for each data point with the threshold determining whether or not a datapoint is influential being set as 2p/n where p = no of independent variables and n = sample size. Edit 1 - Here is the pACF plot for my model
