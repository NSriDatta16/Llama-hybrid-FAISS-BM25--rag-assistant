No, those two sorts of chi-square tests do different things. The first sort (disease by population) tests whether disease is associated with population. That sounds like what you wanted to find out. The second test would test whether the proportion of disease in a particular population is 50%. That is clearly NOT what you want to find out. Given that you have 3 groups, you might try a 3x2 chi-square. You might also try (if you have learned how) a logistic regression with the DV being disease and the IV being group.
