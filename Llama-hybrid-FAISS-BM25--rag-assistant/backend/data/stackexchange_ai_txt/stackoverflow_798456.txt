Most of those programs do a "secure delete" by overwriting the file bits with random noise. The biggest problem has more to do with the actual implementation of hard drives and file systems than anything else. Fragmentation, caching, where the data actually is that you're trying to overwrite: that's the big problem . And it's a very low-level problem -- driver level, really. You're not going to be able to do it with Python, C#, or Java. Once that problem is solved, there's the one of physical media. Because of the nature of magnetic media, it's very frequently possible to read the previous bits that were once on the hard drive -- even if you overwrote them with a different bit. "Secure delete" programs solve this problem by overwriting several times -- preferably a random but suitably large number of times.
