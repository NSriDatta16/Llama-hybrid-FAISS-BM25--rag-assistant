How to use apache logs to check complete file downloads

I have a file hosting site that's using this script MFHS . I want to develop a point system of my own in which points will be rewarded only if the visitor downloaded the whole file. How can I track it and where are the logs relating to it saved in apache? I am using Ubuntu server. Or else is there any easier way? The average file sizes on my server is 300mb max file size is 3gb.
