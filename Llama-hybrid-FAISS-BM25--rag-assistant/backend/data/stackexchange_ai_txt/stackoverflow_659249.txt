treelike structure plugin for vim

Does anyone know of some plugin for vim which would enable treelike note keeping organization like in many today's notekeeping applications. For example, something alike which would according to the tree on the left create another file in a directory structure to enable keeping several files together, under one tree, but still have them all at view.
