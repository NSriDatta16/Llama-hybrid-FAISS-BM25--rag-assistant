R Programing beginner

Hi I am new to Data analytics.I am planning to learn R by doing some real time projects. How should I stream line (set goals) my time in learning R and also I have not learnt statistics till data. I am planning to learn both side by side. I am mid level data warehouse engineer who has experience in DBMS Data-Integration. I am planning to learn R so that I can bring out useful analysis from the Integrated data. If I be specific, I am beginning in R, so what are the basic statistical concepts I should know and implement it in R. If I want to be an expert or above average person in R how should I plan strategically to become one. Say if I can spend 2 hrs a day for 1 year what level I should reach. FYI am working for a SaaS company. What are the way s in which I can utilize R knowledge in a SaaS environment
