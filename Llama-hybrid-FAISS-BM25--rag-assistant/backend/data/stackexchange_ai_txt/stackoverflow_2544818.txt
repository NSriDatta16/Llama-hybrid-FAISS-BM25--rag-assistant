Firstly choose your doctype and then validate your html against the W3C validator for formatting errors Other things to consider off the top of the head are Proper indentation Resisting the temptation to add too much markup i.e. keep the markup simple Structure your html semantically so that if you switched off style sheets the document would still make sense and be in the right order Avoid deprecated tags e.g. Choosing generic class names e.g. mainHeader instead of largeRedHeader Use classes for repeating elements and ids for elements that appear once Use classes and ids on parent elements only and style child elements using css e.g. #intro > p instead of #intro .paragraph
