Windows Folder/Desktop Widget

Is it possible to create an application that allows you to interact with the files/folder in any folder (including desktop) graphically? IE: The program would allow you to create a graphical object that allows you to drag and drop folders/files on to it. The object would remain in the folder/desktop and basically be another folder with different capabilities. I was thinking of a desktop widget, but wasn't sure where to look exactly. Also, if this was possible, could it be done with C# in Visual Studio?
