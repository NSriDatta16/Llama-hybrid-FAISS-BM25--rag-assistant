Unskewing the Data with the PCA's Help

I'm making some RFM Analyses (Customer Segmentation) and, in order to feed the RFM data to K-Means, I need to unskew the data, as K-Means works best when dealing with symmetrical distributions. One of the best practices I've found so far is to use log transforms in order to unskew the data. However, after a bit of experimenting (and, hopefully, correct intuition), I've also found that PCA is working really well at unskewing the data, without the need of performing a log transform. Is this supposed to work or am I in danger of making incorrect assumptions? On a ( cough ) safer bet, I was planning on using PCA after a log transform and the scaling of the data, since it would help to orthogonalize it and, I suppose, improve K-Means's performance. Is this better or worse than simply applying PCA without the log transform?
