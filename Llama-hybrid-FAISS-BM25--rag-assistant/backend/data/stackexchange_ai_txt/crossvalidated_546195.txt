Prior after variable transformation

I am sampling the variables ( $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ ) with a Markov chain where I put the priors to be flat, e.g. $\pi(\alpha) = U(\alpha)$ and similarly for $\beta, \gamma$ . Now I am actually interested in $\theta = \frac{\gamma}{f(\beta)}$ . Computing the transformation of the posterior probability gives: $P(\theta) = P(\gamma) | \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \gamma} | = P(\gamma)f(\beta) $ What I am not sure is how to deal with the prior, if I want a uniform prior in $\theta$ and not $\gamma$ . From Bayes theorem I have: $P(\gamma) = \mathcal{L}(\gamma) \pi(\gamma) Z(\gamma)^{-1} $ How to recover $P(\theta) = \mathcal{L}(\theta) \pi(\theta) Z(\theta)^{-1} $ where $\pi(\theta) = U(\theta)$ ?
