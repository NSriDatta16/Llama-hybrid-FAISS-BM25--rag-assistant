Mixed effects models in the frequentist domain always involve approximations as your post makes clear you are well aware of. Bayesian mixed effects models are trivial to implement and make no approximations. So it is a good idea to run a Bayesian model to get a posterior median or mean random effects variance and uncertainty interval for the variance. Compare this with the approximate frequentist method. You can fit Bayesian random effects models quite easily with the R brms and rstanarm packages. I recently fitted an ordinal model with the ordinal package that had two observations per cluster and about 100 clusters, and the approximations completely broke down to yield meaningless standard errors for all the variables in the model. A Bayesian model worked fine, and so did a GEE approach. High random effects variances can also result from misspecified models. As discussed here the compound symmetric correlation structure assumed by random intercept models is not reasonable in some settings. Also random effects can misbehave if you have strongly varying error variance or non-normality.
