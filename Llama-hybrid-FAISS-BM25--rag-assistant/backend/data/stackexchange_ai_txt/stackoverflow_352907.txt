Basically, I agree with the above advices, using regexes for parsing HTML is asking for having code breaking some day on strange legal HTML constructs (not to mention malformed HTML that browsers accept...). Finding and using a good HTML parser can be rewarding in many ways... Now, I am pragmatic (and I can't resist a little regex challenge...) and sometime I use REs against machine generated HTML (often an export feature), because I know the structure I see is unlikely to change, unlike hand-generated pages where the author can make typos... It is mostly for quick hacks I can adapt if output ever change. In your case, the HTML is quite regular, linear and predictable, so the RE is quite simple. I give Java code because I don't know C# but adaptation should be trivial. Pattern p = Pattern.compile("( )"); Matcher m = p.matcher(html); while (m.find()) { System.out.println(m.group(1)); } HTH.
