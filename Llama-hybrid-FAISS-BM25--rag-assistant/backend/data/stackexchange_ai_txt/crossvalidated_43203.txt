R's forecast package bats() and tbats() functions can fit BATS and TBATS models to the data. The functions return lists with a class attribute either "bats" or "tbats". One of the elements on this list is a time series of state vectors, $x(t)$, for each time, $t$. See http://robjhyndman.com/papers/complex-seasonality/ for the formula's and Hyndman et al (2008) for a better description of ETS models. BATS and TBATS are an extension of ETS. For example: fit In this case, each row of x will be on fourier-like harmonic. There are also plot.tbats() and plot.bats() functions to automatically decompose and view the components.
