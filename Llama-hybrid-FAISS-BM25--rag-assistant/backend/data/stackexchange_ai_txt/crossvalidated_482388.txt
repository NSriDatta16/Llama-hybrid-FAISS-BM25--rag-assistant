In your first command (AME), you are asking margins to calculate the derivative of the expectation with respect to age for each person and then take the average. That derivative is function of (1) age and (2) the coefficients on age and age^2, namely _b[age] + 2*_b[c.age#c.age]*age. It is a linear function of age. So it does not matter if you ask Stata to average _b[age] + 2*_b[c.age#c.age]*age in your sample, or if you tell Stata to plug in the average age into that formula and then take the in-sample average (the MEM in the second margins ). The second average is redundant here, but it makes some sense in more complicated settings where you want to set some variables to the mean and leave others alone, or if your derivative is more complicated/nonlinear.
