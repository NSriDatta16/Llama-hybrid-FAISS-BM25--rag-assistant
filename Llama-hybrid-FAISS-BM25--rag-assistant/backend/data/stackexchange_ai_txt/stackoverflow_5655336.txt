In Ruby, why does "omega-3 (dHA)".gsub(/\b([a-z])/, '\0'.upcase) not work?

I want to capitalize the first character of each word and leave the rest intact (so it is different from Rails's titleize , which downcase the rest). The first line is a test, and third line works, but I wonder why the second line doesn't work? ruby-1.9.2-p180 :026 > "omega-3 (dHA)".gsub(/\b([a-z])/, '#\0#') => "#o#mega-3 (#d#HA)" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :027 > "omega-3 (dHA)".gsub(/\b([a-z])/, '\0'.upcase) => "omega-3 (dHA)" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :028 > "omega-3 (dHA)".gsub(/\b([a-z])/) {|s| s.upcase} => "Omega-3 (DHA)"
