As answered by Fayland Lam , the correct syntax is: local *LWP::UserAgent::get_basic_credentials = sub { return ( $username, $password ); }; But this is patching (dynamically scoped) the whole class and not just the instance. You can probably get away with this in your case. If you really want to affect just the instance, use the subclassing you described. This can be done 'on the fly' like this: { package My::LWP::UserAgent; our @ISA = qw/LWP::UserAgent/; sub get_basic_credentials { return ( $username, $password ); }; # ... and rebless $agent into current package $agent = bless $agent; }
