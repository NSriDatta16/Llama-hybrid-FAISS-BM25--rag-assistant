Well - for all the reasons your discovering, you actually don't have flexibility when leveraging "boilerplate" code like this. Use Extend and Override to properly modify existing classes: package com.yourSite.src { public class Foo { public function Foo { } public function foo():void { trace("foo"); } } } package com.yourSite.src { public class Bar extends Foo { public function Bar { } override public function foo():void { trace("bar"); } } } So, write a class that Extends Accordion, and override anything that you want to work differently. Any other functionality you may need can be added as required. OOP 101 :D Check out the link above for a more cohesive discussion. Cheers!
