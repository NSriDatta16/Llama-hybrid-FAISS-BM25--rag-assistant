The ELO ratings apply to chess. If player 1 has the rating R1 and player 2 has the rating R2 then the probability of player 1 beating player 2 is as you suggest above. They also apply to soccer, despite soccer matches frequently ending in a draw. You can use archives of past soccer results in which the respective elos before the match are included to work out a formula for P(home win), P(draw), P(away win). In soccer the team playing at home is usually awarded a bonus. I have a ready reckonner somewhere in java. But in chess also draw is a possibility, so that too can be worked out. However what you are really interested in is multiplayer events. Such as discus throwing. A discus throwing event between 3 athletes can be arranged without loss of generality by making it into a series of 2 person contests. So if the three guys are A,B and C, we can for example ask C to wait and then face the winner of the contest between A and B. So with this rule you can work out the probabilities of A,B an C for the three way event. Then as there are 3 possibilities of doing that you take the averages. What happens when there are N contestants though ? It's N! orderings and N! can get big. Is there some simplification ?
