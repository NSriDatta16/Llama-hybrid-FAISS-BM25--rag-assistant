I know this isn't ListView specific, but I have sample code for implementing row drag and drop out of / into a DataGridView . Some of it is obviously control specific, other code is actually pretty generic (such as deciding when its a drag): http://adamhouldsworth.blogspot.com/2010/01/datagridview-multiple-row-drag-drop.html Completely forgot the fact that ListView already allows drag-dropping! I can also add some theory - when the drop occurs on your control, you will need to hit test on those coordinates (likely a method called HitTest ) on the ListView to see what row was hit, this is the basis for where to insert the row being dragged. Unrelated - is that var class perhaps the new var keyword in C#?
