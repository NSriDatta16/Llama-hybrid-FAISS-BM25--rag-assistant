How to handle constraints/undesirable outcomes in Reinforcement Learning

What are the methods of handling constrains in RL? As I understand there are two types of environments: constrained (doesn't allow some actions and states) and unconstrained (allows any action and state). 1. Is adding penalty to reward the only way to handle undesirable outcomes if the environment is unconstrained? 2. How to handle situation when environment is constrained and agent takes unfeasible action (i.e. tries to insert more items into knapsack than it can actually hold)? Terminate episode early? Add penalty to reward? Anything else?
