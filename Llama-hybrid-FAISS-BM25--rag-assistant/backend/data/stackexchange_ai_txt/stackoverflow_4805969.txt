As far as I know there is no special algorithm needed for embedding images into a QR code. Just take a standard QR code and embed your small image into it using standard image manipulation methods. It may still work if the embedded image was small enough because of the redundancy in the pixel structure - therefore after manipulation you should test the modified QR code.
