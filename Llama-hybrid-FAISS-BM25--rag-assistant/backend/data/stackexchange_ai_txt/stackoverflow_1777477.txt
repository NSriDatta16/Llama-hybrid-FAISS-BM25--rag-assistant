I think that your idea is just ok. That will make simple and elegant solution For finding point in center you can use "avarege" len=length(points(:,1)); p(1)=sum(points(:,1))/len; p(2)=sum(points(:,2))/len; angle=atan2(points(:,2)-p(2),points(:,1)-p(1)); [angle_sorted,perm]=sort(angle); p_sorted=points p_sotred(:,1)=points(perm,1); p_sotred(:,2)=points(perm,2); Did not check, but it should be ok. Complexity is n*log(n) becuase of sort.
