you can use the OUTPUT clause, which has access to INSERTED and DELETED (DELETED only on on update/delete): DECLARE @NewRows table (YourIdentityColumn .... ,any other columns here ) INSERT INTO Organization (OrganizationName) OUTPUT INSERTED.YourIdentityColumn, any other columns here INTO @NewRows VALUES (@OrganizationName) of course this is best when inserting multiple rows at a time: INSERT INTO Organization (OrganizationName) OUTPUT INSERTED.YourIdentityColumn, any other columns here INTO @NewRows SELECT col1, col2, col3... FROM ... you could also just return a result set (it will insert the row and return a result set to the procedure caller), from your INSERT: INSERT INTO Organization (OrganizationName) OUTPUT INSERTED.YourIdentityColumn, any other columns here VALUES (@OrganizationName)
