What is the best way to organize the datasets for my task?

I am working on a task â€” geolocation estimation of Twitter users by using tweets only. I collected tweets (and users) from more than 6000 people in Twitter. Each user is associated with a city. In the dataset, number of samples (or users) for each city depends on the city size. (i.e. If the city A is more populous than the city B, the city A has more users in the dataset.) This seems fair, but it creates an unbalanced dataset. Right now, I am planing to collect another dataset; a dataset that is more balanced (i.e. there will be the almost the same amount of users for each city although there will still be more users in big cities). Doing this makes sense or should I continue with the unbalanced dataset? What approach would it be good for that task?
