Adding Group Average Line to Bar Chart

I am trying to create a PivotChart in the form of a bar chart and I would like to add a group average line on the chart. I have this (sample) table in my PowerPivot Data Model: Group averages are A: 20, B: 50 and C: 80. My bar chart looks like this. How would I do this? Do I need to add a measure? If so, how? I am not that great with DAX functions yet.
