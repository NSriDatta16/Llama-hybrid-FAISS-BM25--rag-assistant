Stumped - bubbling an routedevent up to top window in WPF - how to capture anywhere!

The literature is awful in this regard - all I want to do is bubble an event up from a control that I have defined but created on the fly (hopefully this will not cause issues) from a broker controller class. The control is a PopUp. public static readonly RoutedEvent weClosed = EventManager.RegisterRoutedEvent("TIMBOO", RoutingStrategy.Bubble, typeof(RoutedEventHandler), typeof(FixedTaskbarNotifier)); // Provide CLR accessors for the event public event RoutedEventHandler TIMBOO { add { AddHandler(weClosed, value); } remove { RemoveHandler(weClosed, value); } } // This method raises the Tap event void RaiseTapEvent() { RoutedEventArgs newEventArgs = new RoutedEventArgs(weClosed); RaiseEvent(newEventArgs);} protected override void OnClosed(EventArgs e) { //TO DO - rearrange current open windows - fire event? Log.Instance.Info("Clean up Window"); RaiseTapEvent(); This is called on close but nothing fires .. } I am hoping to catch the event somewhere - even in my parent window or higher up the visual tree. This has a reference to a controller that holds the list of notification controls -once I know which one was closed, I can reoganise / repaint any others still active via the controller, but how to catch? Thanks!
