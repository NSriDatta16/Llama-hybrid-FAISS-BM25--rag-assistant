Logistic regression loss function

What is the "standard" function one minimizes to estimate the parameters for logicistic regression? What is implemented in R? I thought it was the squared error but a machine learning course I am following suggests a loss function of the type: $ -\log h_\theta (x)$ for $y =1$ $ -\log (1- h_\theta (x))$ for $y = 0$ $h_\theta(x) = (1+ e^{-\theta^Tx})^{-1} $ This would make the cost function convex. Is this this estimator same as MLE? What about for other non-linear regressions such as probit model?
