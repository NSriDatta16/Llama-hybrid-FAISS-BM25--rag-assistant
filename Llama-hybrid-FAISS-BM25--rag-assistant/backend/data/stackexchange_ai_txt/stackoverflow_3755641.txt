Your pdf files don't have to be in a user viewable directory. They can be outside your web root. That way, noone can actually browse to www.yoursite.ext/uploads/2395wrfhgt.pdf to download it himself or share the link with others. In order to download the pdf you'll have a dedicated script that will do all the access checks on the user that's requesting it, and if all ok it will set the appropriate headers, read the file from the filesystem, and print it out to the user. So, lets say your site is at /var/www/site/htdocs/ and you upload every pdf into /var/www/site/uploads/ . You don't even need to hash the filenames but instead can keep them nicely named for easy organization. Then, all the links to download a file will be made to point to www.yoursite.ext/download.php?id={fileid} Your download.php will do all the access checks (properly logged in, has permissions to download the file etc), and then do the following: $pathToPdf = '/var/www/site/uploads/some.pdf' ; header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($pathToPdf)); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=' . 'some.pdf'); readfile($pathToPdf) ; And that's pretty much it. Once you get this working you can look into improving a few things: use mod_rewrite or similar to have the actual pdf filename in the link, which helps some browsers realize they should download it: www.yoursite.ext/download/{fileid}.pdf consider using the web server instead of php to serve files, eg X-Sendfile header
