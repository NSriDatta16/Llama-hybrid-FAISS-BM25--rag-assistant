Well first of all i would suggest you use PHP with a DOM Parser Class , this will make it a lot easier to get the tag contents you need. // Get HTML from URL or file $html = file_get_html('http://www.google.com/'); // Find all paragraphs $paragraphs = $html->find('p') //echo the first paragraph echo $paragraphs[0]; The problem is a lot of sites have poorly structure html, some are built on tables, the key get around this is that you decide what tags will you consider the website description. I would try to get the meta description tag, if this one does not exist, look for the first paragraph.
