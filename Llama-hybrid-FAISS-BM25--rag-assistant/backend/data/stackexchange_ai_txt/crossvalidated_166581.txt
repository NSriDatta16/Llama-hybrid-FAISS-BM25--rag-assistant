Your example doesn't quite work for me. I need to add: r = factor(r, levels=1:3, ordered=T) From there, I don't get all the problems you report. For example, I don't get the messages: [1] "Killing the following coefs." [1] "z" "y:z" I do get the warning messages, though. The first warning message, 1: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred , is due to perfect separation in your example. I don't know if you also have separation in your real dataset, but you might. There are a number of threads on CV that deal with this issue; you can find them by searching under the hauck-donner-effect tag. The second warning message, 2: In polr(r ~ x * y * z, data = a) : design appears to be rank-deficient, so dropping some coefs , is due to perfect multicollinearity. I gather you are familiar with multicollinearity already, but you can read some of the threads listed under the multicollinearity tag, if you'd like. Regarding your problems with calling summary(model) , I notice that the documentation for ?polr states: Hess logical for whether the Hessian (the observed information matrix) should be returned. Use this if you intend to call summary or vcov on the fit. I don't have the problems you report when I run: model I don't get the error message: Error in svd(X) : infinite or missing values in 'x' , so I don't know what that is about. Yes, MASS is a stable package. There are, however, a number of ways to run an ordinal logistic regression in R. They are discussed here . If you don't like MASS , you can always try some of the others.
