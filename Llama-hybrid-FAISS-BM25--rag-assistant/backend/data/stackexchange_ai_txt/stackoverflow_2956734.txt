You cannot add a subview to UIImageView in interface builder for reasons only known to Apple! You are right in saying that you can addSubview programmatically, but then, the overhead of setting autoresizing masks and placements of subviews should all be handled in code, which is cumbersome. So there is an easy workaround. Instead of dragging an instance of UIImageView in the nib, just drag a UIView and change its class to UIImageView from UIView (cmd+4 option of inspector). The only difference you find in the nib for default imageView instance and your new UIImageView subclass instance is: you cannot set image to your new imageView from nib (cmd+1 option). So, in the -viewDidLoad method of its appropriate viewController, set image to this outlet of UIImageView. By doing so, you are free to add subviews to your "now UIImageView" instances in interface builder, which is much easy.
