How to represent a set of sets as a vector

I'm pretty new to machine learning. I know I can represent a set of discrete values as a vector of 0/1 values. For instance, in the set of features {a, b, c, d, e}, the subset containing {a, c} can be represented as [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] and the subset containing {c, d, e} can be represented as [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] , meaning I have as many dimensions as elements, which is workable when you have a finite (and small) number of elements. But now, for a clustering task, I want to represent sets of sets, like, for instance, representing the set {{a, c}, {c, d, e}} . How can I do that? Here, the basic 0/1 approach won't work, as I'll have 2^n possible combinations. What is the workaround, if any? Edit : here is the transcription as a less abstract, more business problem. I want to find clusters of people according to the trips they made. A trip consists in a set of cities visited, and a set of transportation used. For instance, people might have visited cities in the set {Rabat, Alger, Marrakech, Tunis, Hammamet} with transportation such as {car, plane, train} . A trip could be {Rabat, Marrakech, plane} or {Alger, Marrakech, Tunis, car, train} . Note the order in which cities were visited, or the order in which vehicles were used, is not considered. An example of the items I want to find clusters of could be a person having made those two trips, represented as p1 = {{Rabat, Marrakech, plane}, {Alger, Marrakech, Tunis, car, train}} .
