In general, NO. Consider the simpler case of two different (independent) beta variables -- say a beta(1,2) and a beta(2,1). In that particular case a 50-50 mixture is standard uniform, which has 0.95 quantile equal to 0.95. The weighted average of the two quantiles of the components is smaller than that (it's about 0.8755): > qbeta(.95,1,2) [1] 0.7763932 > qbeta(.95,2,1) [1] 0.9746794 (This was the first example I tried, but knowing that quantiles are not linear in general, I expected almost any random example should fail unless it was a special case.) [whuber's example in comments is an especially simple and compelling one -- but I wanted to show that it was still clearly the case for beta random variables - which overlap completely, since they're all on the unit interval]
