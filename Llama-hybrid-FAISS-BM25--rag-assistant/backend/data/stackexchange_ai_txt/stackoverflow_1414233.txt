According to the C standard, 6.7.8 (note 10): If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is indeterminate. So it depends on the compiler. With MSVC, debug builds will initialize automatic variables with 0xcc, whereas non-debug builds will not initialize those variables at all.
