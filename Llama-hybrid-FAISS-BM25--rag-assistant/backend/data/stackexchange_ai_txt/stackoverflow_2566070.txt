What I'm talking about is: Is it possible that under certain circumstances the CPU "buggs" and suddenly responses 1+1=2? Yes In which parts of the computer can that happen (HDD, RAM, Mainboard)? All of them What could be the causes? Bad quality? Overheating? The most common cause is overclocking. Less common causes include faulty hardware. If everything is okay with the CPU (not a single fault in production, good temperature), can that still happen sometimes? It can be a ram problem like I said above, or really anything. What would be the results of, let's say one to three wrong computations? I don't understand this question.. You mean what would happen to the program? It would probably segfault but impossible to say. You mean what would 1+1 result into? Impossible to say. You mean what would happen if 1 in 3 computations were to fail on average? The computer wouldn't even boot.
