It is true that reducing an ordinal or even continuous variable to dichotomous level loses a lot of information, but this is a concern for the dependent variable (i.e. dichotomizing a continuous dependent variable) in logistic regression. For continuous predictors (independent variables), logistic regression assumes that predictors are linearly related to the log odds of the outcome (an assumption known as “linearity of the logit”). If this assumption is violated, logistic regression underestimates the strength of the association and rejects the association too easily, that is being not significant (not rejecting the null hypothesis) where it should be significant. The Box–Tidwell test can be performed to assess linearity in the log(odds) as required by logistic regression. If linearity is not observed, categorical scales for the continuous predictor can be examined on the basis of quartiles and logit graphs. Fractional polynomials and spline functions can also be used to model continuous predictors. For a good discussion of methods to examine the scale of a continuous covariate in the logodds, I suggest reading chapter 4 of Applied Logistic Regression, 3rd Edition, by Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant.
