I don't think there's anything simple'n'easy you can do here. My approach would probably be to limit the number of rows returned by each SELECT statement (by partioning the data returned by some criteria, e.g. by date or location or something), and then put those smaller XML streams into files one by one. Doable, but not very elegant or sophisticated..
