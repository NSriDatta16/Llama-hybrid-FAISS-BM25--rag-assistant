First of all: stop and breathe. I agree with "there is no too much data" but I also agree that a lot of data can drive us mad. I think the your first resources should be a pen and a paper. For many people this may sound ridiculous but in my experience it really works. Start for putting in writing some of the questions you would like to be answered, example: 1 - Users that return to the website 2 - Users that subscribe to a newsletter 3 - Users that visit the news section 4 - .... This exercise will help you to create a structure in the data. If you don't have a data model then you can create one. They are very useful. Go step by step, if latter on you decide that you need more variables (that I'm sure you will) than you just create them. You don't have to have everything at first. For starting you can also browse around, there is nothing wrong with that. Maybe that makes you feel more conformable with the data and then you start having more ideas. As material, try a Data Mining book. Check these ones "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques - Jiawei Han" and "HANDBOOK OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING APPLICATIONS - ROBERT NISBET, JOHN ELDER, GARY MINER". They are quite complete and maybe is a starting point.
