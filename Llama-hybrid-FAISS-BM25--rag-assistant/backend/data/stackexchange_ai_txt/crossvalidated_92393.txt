Linear Kernel in Baysian Linear Regression

I came up with http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/duvenaud/cookbook/index.html and it is actually very useful. At some point it says If you use just a linear kernel in a GP, you're simply doing Bayesian linear regression, and good news! You can do this in time $O(N)$ instead of $O(N^3)$ Why is that?
