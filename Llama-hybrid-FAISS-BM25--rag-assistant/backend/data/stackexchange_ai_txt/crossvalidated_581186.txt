how to calculate an agreement value in a vote between multiple people?

I am not at all good with statistics which also doesn't help me looking for a proper answer. I am trying to calculate an agreement value in a vote between multiple people. And people can vote in numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, etc). What would be a nice way to have like a percentage of agreement in each voting round? lets say i have something like this votesRound1 = { one: 4, two: 2, three: 1, five: 0} votesRound2 = { one: 7, two: 0, three: 0, five: 0} then I would like to know based on that, how can I calculate the agreement scale. So for votesRound2 I would expect the agreement to be 100%. But for the votesA I have no idea how to calculate, although I would expect something larger, since more than half the group voted on the same answer. I am just not at all familiar with a lot of stats concepts, so I don't know where to search for that answer. Why I am asking: So I saw in an app someone calculating an agreement rate after a round of votes between options. I am looking to do something similar. People will choose among a few options, and for each round I would like to have a number expressing how much they are agreeing in that vote. We are picking numbers, and I will show them an average of those numbers. People the more people vote for the same number, the higher I expect this "agreement" rating to be. So if everyone votes for the same thing, the agreement would be 100. If nobody votes for the same thing, I would think it would be 0. But then maybe the ones that chose similar options (lets say 1 and 2 are similar, but 8 and 1 are not), so I would expect that agreement to be higher if more people choose similar numbers (1s and 2s) than if people picked 1s and 8s. I posted this question here because I thought 'statistics' would have some similar concept that I am not familiar with.
