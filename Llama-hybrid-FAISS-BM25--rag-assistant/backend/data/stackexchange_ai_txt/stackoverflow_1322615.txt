Is this a valid XML file?

I need to send some XML element to some other services and I want to ensure my XML file is of elegant format so that other people could use their XML parser to parse the XML file. For such kinds of XML file, is it elegant format, breaking any rules of XML? Not sure whether &#x4 is valid XML character sequences in .Net/C#? I am confused about whether strings starts with $#x are all valid? If not all of them are valid, any ways to filter them out? I am using VSTS 2008 + C# + .Net 3.5. &#x4;
