Can't Find Framework .h File

I downloaded Andy Potion's "PFLetsMove" framework here and added the Xcode Project to my application's project. I then dragged the framework from that to the Link Binary with Libraries and Copy Files build phases. Now, if I compile the application with a call to PFMoveToApplicationsFolderIfNecessary() it works fine, so the framework is definitely there. But if I put the line #import "PFLetsMove/PFMoveApplication.h" in the app delegate, I get the following error: 'PFLetsMove/PFMoveApplication.h' file not found . I've checked the compiled PFLetsMove.framework in the build folder, and PFMoveApplication.h is there. I did the exact same thing with the AquaticPrime framework (import the header) and it works fine. Where am I going wrong here, or is there potentially an issue with how the framework is built?
