jQuery closest function

Alright I know that the .closest() have been discussed before, but I have been searching, and I still can't get it working. The situation is this. I have a table with some checkboxes and labels. Now when a checkbox is checked I want a div to appear, and disappear when unchecked. Keep in mind that this is dynamic PHP code. I have got it working this far, but the current issue is that all the message divs appear instead of just the appropriate one. $('[name^="check"]').click(function() { $(".message").toggle(this.checked); }); Now the checkboxes have names such as check1, check2 and check3. A matter of how many that is generated. I have tried to play around with different this(), parent() and closest() functions in my attempt to select just one of the divs, but I can't get it working. Thank you for your attention. Edit: The HTML that is rendered look somewhat like this (simplified) Label for check1 FOO Label for check2 FOO
