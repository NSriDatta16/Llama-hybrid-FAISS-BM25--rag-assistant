I've similar problem my solution was naive - create new variables representing each minute of the day if given activite took place then mark that minute by 1 : yawning -> yawning ... ... 2:21-2:22 2:21 1 3:42-3:45 2:22 1 9:20-925 2:23 0 14:45-14:32 . . 3:42 1 . 3:43 1 . . 45:40-45-43 . so we have now new time series, which we could analyse by more standard methods, this worked really good, I've tested in on simulated data on below logit model, where x is 0-1 variable, z - "driving" variable : p(x(t+1)=1|p(x)=1)=exp(x+B1*z)/denominator the same for y, the closer was B2 to B1 the better dependence between x and y measured by Hamming distance. Methodological problem : what to do if total time of activity_11 during the day is 10 times higher then that of activity_2 ? Sometimes it doesn't matter, sometimes some weighted distance is needed - in the case when we want to build distance matrix.
