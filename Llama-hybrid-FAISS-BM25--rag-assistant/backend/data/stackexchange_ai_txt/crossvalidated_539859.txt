Since $J_t$ has support on the non-negative integers, you have a Gaussian mixture model , with marginalised sampling density: $$p_{R_t}(r | \lambda,m) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{1}{j!} \Big( \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{1+m}} \Big)^j \exp \bigg( - \frac{r^2}{2(1+m)^j} - \lambda \bigg).$$ This distribution is non-trivial, but we know it is symmetric around zero (and therefore has zero mean and zero skewness). Using the law of iterated variance its variance is: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{V}(R_t | \lambda, m) &= \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{V}( R_t |J_t)] + \mathbb{V}[\mathbb{E}( R_t |J_t)] \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{E}[(1+m)^{J_t}] + \mathbb{V}[0] \\[6pt] &= G_{J_t}(1+m) \\[6pt] &= \exp(\lambda m). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ (In this working $G_{J_t}$ denotes the probability generating function of $J_t$ .) It is also simple to establish the marginal kurtosis. As a preliminary step we have: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{E}(R_t^4 | \lambda, m) &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^j e^{-\lambda}}{j!} \cdot \mathbb{E}(R_t^4 | J_t) \\[6pt] &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^j e^{-\lambda}}{j!} \cdot \frac{3}{(1+m)^{2j}} \\[6pt] &= 3 e^{-\lambda} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{1}{j!} \cdot \Big( \frac{\lambda}{(1+m)^2} \Big)^j \\[6pt] &= 3 \exp({-\lambda}) \exp({\lambda/(1+m)^2}) \\[6pt] &= 3 \exp \Bigg( - \lambda \cdot \frac{2m + m^2}{(1+m)^2} \Bigg). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ We therefore have the marginal kurtosis $$\begin{align} \mathbb{Kurt}(R_t | \lambda, m) &= \frac{\mathbb{E}(R_t^4 | \lambda, m)}{\mathbb{V}(R_t^4 | \lambda, m)^2}. \\[6pt] &= 3 \exp \Bigg( - \lambda \cdot \frac{2m + m^2}{(1+m)^2} \Bigg) \exp(-2 \lambda m) \\[6pt] &= 3 \exp \Bigg( - \lambda \cdot \frac{4m + 5m^2 + 2 m^3}{(1+m)^2} \Bigg). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Given that the this Gaussian mixture is symmetric with a known variance and kurtosis, you could approximate it well by a generalised error distribution with appropriate choice of parameters using the method of moments using the above marginal variance and kurtosis. This would give you a substantially simplified approximation to your problem. In any case, your MCMC simulations of the posterior will depend on the prior distribution you use for $\lambda$ and $m$ , which you have not specified here.
