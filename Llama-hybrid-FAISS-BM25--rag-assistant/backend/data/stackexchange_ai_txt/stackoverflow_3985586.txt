You can try using two nested scroll views; one is limited to scrolling horizontally with paging enabled, and one (or one for each page if you're displaying several images?) limited to scrolling vertically with paging disabled. By default this will work like you said, paging/snapping horizontally but free scroll vertically. However, it will only let you scroll in one direction at a time (either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally). If you want to use nested scroll views like this but you'd like to allow scrolling/dragging in both directions simultaneously, take a look at my solution for this: Nested UIScrollViews scrolling simultaneously
