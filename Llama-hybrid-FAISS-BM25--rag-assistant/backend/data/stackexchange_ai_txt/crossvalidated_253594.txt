This is an important measure for decision trees in a random forest and is a component of the generalization error of the random forest. Please read Breiman's original paper (page 6) where he defines correlation as $\bar{\rho}=\mathbf{E}_{\Theta, \Theta^\prime}[\rho(h(\cdot,\Theta), h(\cdot,\Theta^\prime)]$. So that $\bar{\rho}$ is the correlation between two different members of the forest averaged over the $\Theta, \Theta^\prime$ distribution. A second paper a bit more readable, describes correlation between trees to be the correlation between their raw margin function . The margin function is the extent to which average number of votes for class exceeds the average number of votes for the next-best class. See Slides . Finally, another way of evaluating the correlation would be consider correlation between the prediction errors between decision tree pairs, though this would not be the same term in the generalization error PE$^\ast$ in Breiman's paper.
