Do Autoencoders preserve distances?

Based on my understanding, autoencoders are used to find a compact representation of input features that carries the essential underlying information. Is there any relationship between the L2 distances in the original input space and reduced (compact) space? If not, can I train the network such that the compact representation preserves distance after the transformation?
