I've just come across this exact problem. In my Drag/Drop components , although I support Delphi 5 through Delphi 2010, I only distribute the dof files. I do this to avoid having to keep the dof and dproj files in sync. Now all of a sudden the search path setting from the dof files are not being exported to the dproj files. The solution I've found is to strip the dof file of everything I don't need: [FileVersion] Version=7.0 [Directories] OutputDir=. UnitOutputDir=. SearchPath=..\..\Source With this change the dof file is imported correctly. I haven't had time (nor reason or motivation) to investigate precisely which entry in the dof file that is preventing the SearchPath from being exported.
