Not sure about heat eqautions, but the way that I solve this problem is via TIN modelling . Check out Herbert Edelsbrunners book on the topic, Geometry and Topology for Mesh Generation . I would have it down as a must read. Also well worthwhile is Joeseph O'Rourkes Computational Geometry in C which while more general does include worked examples and makes a useful cookbook. In terms of open source, check the following Code Guru link and have a look at Paul Bourkes work.
