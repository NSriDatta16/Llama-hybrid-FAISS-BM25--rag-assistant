Different seasonality patterns

I'm currently trying out several ARIMA models for time series data with seasonality. The data consists of daily demand for two years. The data has strong weekly seasonality since Fridays and Saturdays have much higher values than remaining days. The data presents also other types of seasonality since summer and Christmas have always higher values. So, my data shows two types of seasonality. Is it possible to cope with both patterns in the same model? $$ ARIMA(p,d,q)(p,d,q)_7(p,d,q)_{30} $$ Does the model above makes sense?
