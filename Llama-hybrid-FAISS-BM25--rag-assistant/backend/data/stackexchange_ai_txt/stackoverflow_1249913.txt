Without resorting to a specialized index, the best performing strategy may be to hunt for the answer. Issue a LIKE query for each possible prefix, starting with the longest. Stop once you get rows returned. It's certainly not the prettiest way to achieve what you wan't but as opposed to the other suggestions, indexes will be considered by the query planner. As always, it depends on your actual data. In particular, on how many rows in your table, and how long the average hunt will be.
