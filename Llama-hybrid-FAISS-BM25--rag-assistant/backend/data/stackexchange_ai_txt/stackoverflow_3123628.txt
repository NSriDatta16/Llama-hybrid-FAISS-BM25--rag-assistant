Extract from Php Array using Conditions

I would like to extract the data groups from the PHP arrays depending on the "RouterName". So, in the end, I will get 4 Big Arrays (ArrDeviceA, ArrDeviceB, etc.) I don't want to use foreach and loop every rows and put into the separate array. Moreover, there might be the chance that some arrays might contain more than 3 rows. The number of rows are not constant. Is there any function to query the array in PHP? The raw data of php array are as follow: Array ( [0] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceA [Reference] => R2a [AverageRSSI] => -36.00 [AverageQuality] => 63.00 [Date_Time] => 12-June-2010 ) [1] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceA [Reference] => R2a [AverageRSSI] => -51.03 [AverageQuality] => 47.97 [Date_Time] => 11-June-2010 ) [2] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceA [Reference] => R2a [AverageRSSI] => -53.63 [AverageQuality] => 45.37 [Date_Time] => 10-June-2010 ) [3] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceB [Reference] => R2 [AverageRSSI] => -38.19 [AverageQuality] => 60.81 [Date_Time] => 12-June-2010 ) [4] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceB [Reference] => R2 [AverageRSSI] => -38.64 [AverageQuality] => 60.36 [Date_Time] => 11-June-2010 ) [5] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceB [Reference] => R2 [AverageRSSI] => -38.67 [AverageQuality] => 60.33 [Date_Time] => 10-June-2010 ) [6] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceC [Reference] => SCN1010 [AverageRSSI] => -69.12 [AverageQuality] => 29.88 [Date_Time] => 12-June-2010 ) [7] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceC [Reference] => SCN1010 [AverageRSSI] => -70.99 [AverageQuality] => 28.01 [Date_Time] => 11-June-2010 ) [8] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceC [Reference] => SCN1010 [AverageRSSI] => -71.52 [AverageQuality] => 27.48 [Date_Time] => 10-June-2010 ) [9] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceD [Reference] => SCN1020 [AverageRSSI] => -62.48 [AverageQuality] => 36.52 [Date_Time] => 12-June-2010 ) [10] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceD [Reference] => SCN1020 [AverageRSSI] => -34.60 [AverageQuality] => 64.40 [Date_Time] => 11-June-2010 ) [11] => Array ( [RouterName] => DeviceD [Reference] => SCN1020 [AverageRSSI] => 0.00 [AverageQuality] => 99.00 [Date_Time] => 10-June-2010 ) )
