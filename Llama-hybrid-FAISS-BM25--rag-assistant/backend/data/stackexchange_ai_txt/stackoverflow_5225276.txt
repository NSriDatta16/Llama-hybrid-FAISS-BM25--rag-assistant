Is there a Ruby-Wayâ„¢ to handle this kind of loop?

I am trying print section titles for grouped elements in a flat array. I would only like the section title to appear once per group. The example below works, but it feels pretty inelegant for Ruby. I'm certain there must be a better way to do this ;) #!/usr/bin/ruby foo = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3] i = 0; f = foo[i] comp = f while(i Desired output Section 1 1 1 1 1 Section 2 2 2 2 Section 3 3 3 I was hoping there was some kind of Array#current or Array#next instance methods, but it looks like Ruby Array objects don't keep an internal iterator.
