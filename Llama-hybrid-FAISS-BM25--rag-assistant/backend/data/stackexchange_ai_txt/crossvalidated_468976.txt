Is there a visualization technique/statistical test to compare the growth rates of 2 treatment groups?

Is there a visualization technique/statistical test to compare the growth rates of 2 treatment groups in which patients in each group do not all have the same number of weigh-in dates The data in the actual dataset are linear and have anywhere from 6 to 12 weigh-in dates per patient. Below is some dummy data: library(plyr) #Make some fake data d1 I do not want to throw away data so I am looking for a way to posibly compare the average slope of patient's weight gain independent of when patients were weighed. Patients were not all enrolled and weighed at the same times as is common is most clinical studies.
