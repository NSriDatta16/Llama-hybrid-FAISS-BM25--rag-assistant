Survival analysis with discrete (non-binary) outcome variable

I would like to know whether there are any survival analysis methods to model a discrete or continuous variable, rather than a binary alive/dead variable. For example, asking not "how many patients will die by time X" but "how many near-fatal events they have by time X?" My data consist of times at which various participants (in 2 conditions) completed sequential tasks (t1, t2, etc.). Some participants dropped out early, so I don't have data for later tasks. Using survival analysis, I could predict when participants would complete a task for which I have incomplete data, by treating completion as "death" and marking the time at which a participant dropped out as "alive", with later data "censored." However, I would prefer to be able to answer the question, after 100 minutes, how many tasks would participants have, on average, completed in each group, assuming none dropped out. Here, I would like to model the continuous "tasks completed" variable over time, and account for missing data. Are there any methods well suited to this?
