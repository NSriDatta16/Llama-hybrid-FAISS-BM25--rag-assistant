How to create an image of a WPF UserControl at runtime

I've created a WPF application which has a Canvas on which I place UserControls which are moveable and resizeable by the user (just like a Windows-Window). Now I have detected that this can be very slow on older PC's which is a problem. As a solution I thought about generating a graphic showing the UserControl and show this while resizing/dragging the Control, to prevent WPF from recalculating all Elements permanently. The only problem is that I have no idea how to generate this image. Is there perhaps something like a function which does this in .Net? Or how could I do this on my own?
