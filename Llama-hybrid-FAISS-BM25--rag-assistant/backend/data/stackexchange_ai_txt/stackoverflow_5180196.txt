If you are using TCP, make sure your other program calls flush() (or equivalent in other languages) after writing one fragment. Otherwise your fragments may be collected by the sending TCP stack until enough data is there to fill one TCP packet (depending on implementation and maybe some settings). Of course, you still can't be sure to receive the packets/fragments one by one, but you'll at least be sure to receive them as fast as possible. If you need your packet structure, either use another protocol instead of TCP, or a protocol over TCP, which shows you when a packet starts and ends.
