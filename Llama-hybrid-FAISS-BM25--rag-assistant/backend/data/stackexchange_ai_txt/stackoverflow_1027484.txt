Test-First development tool for SQL Server 2005?

For several years I have been using a testing tool called qmTest that allows me to do test-driven database development for some Firebird databases. I write a test for a new feature (table, trigger, stored procedure, etc.) until it fails, then modify the database until the test passes. If necessary, I do more work on the test until it fails again, then modify the database until the test passes. Once the test for the feature is complete and passes 100% of the time, I save it in a suite of other tests for the database. Before moving on to another test or a deployment, I run all the tests as a suite to make sure nothing is broken. Tests can have dependencies on other tests, and the results are recorded and displayed in a browser. Nothing new here, I am sure. Our shop is aiming toward standardizing on MSSQLServer and I want to use the same procedure for developing our databases. Does anyone know of tools that allow or encourage this kind of development? I believe the Team System does, but we do not own that at this point, and probably will not for some time. I am not opposed to scripting, but would welcome a more graphical environment. Any suggestions?
