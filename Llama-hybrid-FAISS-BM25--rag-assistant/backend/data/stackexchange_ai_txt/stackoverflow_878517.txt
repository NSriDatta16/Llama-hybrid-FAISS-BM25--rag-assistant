This is just off the top of my head, and I'm on the way out the door, so it's untested. I also can't imagine that it would perform very well on any kind of large data set. I did confirm that it at least runs without an error though. :) SELECT value_column1, ( SELECT AVG(value_column1) AS moving_average FROM Table1 T2 WHERE ( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table1 T3 WHERE date_column1 BETWEEN T2.date_column1 AND T1.date_column1 ) BETWEEN 1 AND 20 ) FROM Table1 T1
