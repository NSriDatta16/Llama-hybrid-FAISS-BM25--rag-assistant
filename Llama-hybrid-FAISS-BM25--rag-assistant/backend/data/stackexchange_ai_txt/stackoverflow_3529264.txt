Try: @stat ||= Location.find(:all, :select => 'COUNT(locations.id) AS locations, COUNT(DISTINCT(city)) AS cities, COUNT(DISTINCT(countries.name)) AS countries', :joins => [ :places, :country ], :conditions => [ 'email IS NOT NULL' ]).first After that, invalidate the @stat variable on the time basis, or by some other events, like this: @stat = nil You can also accomplish that by using fragment caching .
