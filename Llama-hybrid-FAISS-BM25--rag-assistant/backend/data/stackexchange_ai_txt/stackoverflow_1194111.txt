I'm not sure about your first question, but for the second part: It's the same as when you're developing using the local table service, when you're using the ADO.NET Data Services client, at least. Just use the service root of your Azure storage account. Or you can use the REST interface, if you need the flexibility of the (schema-less) Azure Tables. I'm not aware of a tool similar to GAE's data viewer, but it's not very difficult to build something like that yourself.
