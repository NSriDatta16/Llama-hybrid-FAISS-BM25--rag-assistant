As suggested in an earlier answer , it may be difficult for ML techniques to break the encryption directly. But there are ways in which ML and neural network techniques can be used to break encryption (AES in particular because I have worked on it, but can be used for others too). I am concentrating on AES encryption in embedded devices. When a device is encrypting (or decrypting) it usually leaks out information in the form of power or electromagnetic radiations. These are called 'Side channel leakages'. Research has shown that these leakages correlate to the secret key being used during the encryption (or decryption). And if there is correlation, ML/neural network techniques can be utilized to retrieve the secret key being used. Check these papers that have used ML/neural networks for retrieving (a part of) the secret key used during AES encryption: Ref2 Ref3 Research in this field is still on-going and there is still a lot to accomplish. But all is not lost and there is still hope in using deep learning to break cryptography or a part of it.
