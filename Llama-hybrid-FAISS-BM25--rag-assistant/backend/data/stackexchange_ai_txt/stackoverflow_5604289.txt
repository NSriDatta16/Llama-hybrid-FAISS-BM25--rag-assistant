Unless you prefix it with a slash (on unix) or a drive path (Windows), QFile's constructor parameter is a relative path - relative to the current working directory. score.txt is created in the build/ directory because that's probably where you're executing the binary from. You can't store score.txt in the /usr/bin directory because, typically, you can't write there without root privileges. What you want to do is get a path to some directory where you can store your score.txt file. To do that, you can use the QDesktopServices class. That will give you directory information on a per-user basis. Here's an example: #include // this would go in main(), probably QCoreApplication::setApplicationName( "word jumble game" ); // now when you want to read/write the scores file: QString dataPath = QDesktopService::storageLocation( QDesktopService::DataLocation ); QFile scoreFile( dataPath + "score.txt" ); // on my system, this produces: "/home/adam/.local/share/data/word jumble game/score.txt" // it will produce something similar for Windows and Mac too You should set your appication name via QCoreApplication::setApplicationName before getting path information to keep the user data directory nice and organised. As for getting your application in the games list, you'll need to create a menu entry that follows the freedesktop.org spec. I can't help you more with that, but this is a good starting point. Somebody else might have more info for you. You need to create a .desktop entry file and install it using xdg-desktop-menu install . Here are two resources for you: freedesktop.org menu spec and adding .desktop files using CMake
