#ifdef inside #define

I am trying to write something like this: #define COV_ON(x) \ #ifdef COVERAGE_TOOL \ _Pragma (COVERAGE #x) #endif Is there any way to define COV_ON like this? I know what I have done above is wrong as I can't have #ifdef inside #define. ( # is not an allowed character in #define ). So is there any solution?
