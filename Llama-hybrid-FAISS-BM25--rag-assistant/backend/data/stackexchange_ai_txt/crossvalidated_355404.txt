Interpretation of logistic regression with normalized features

With logistic regression, a one unit change in $X_1$ is associated with a $\beta_1$ change in the log odds of 'success' (alternatively, an $\exp(\beta_1)$-fold change in the odds), all else being equal. But if one applies an initial normalization to cross-correlated features (e.g. subtract by mean and divide by standard deviation), is it valid to simply apply that inverse transformation to $\beta_1$ to interpret a one unit change in the un-normalized value when considering the raw data? The normalization explained above has no effect on the cross-correlation of the features themselves, but I am curious if it would affect the outputs (and signs specifically) of the $\beta_i$ that are being trained.
