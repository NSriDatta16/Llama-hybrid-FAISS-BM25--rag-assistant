My gut reaction - I think you're mad risking your data on a NAS. SQL's expectation is continuous low-latency uninterrupted access to your storage subsystem. The NAS is almost certainly none of those things - you local or SAN storage (in order of performance, simplicity and therefore preference) - leave the NAS for offline file storage/backups. The following KB lists some of the constraints and issues you'd encounter trying to use a NAS with SQL - while the KB covers SQL 7 through 2005, a lot of the information still applies to SQL 2008 too. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304261
