Regarding languages, I think F# is an example of a languages that's primarily 'functional' but also 'practical'. Scala and Clojure are probably others in this category. (Going one level deeper, I think the 'formula for success' here is a language that leans strongly towards 'functional', but has access to vast practical libraries (e.g. .Net/JVM/some C FFI) and has good tooling (e.g. IDE support).) I at least somewhat agree with the implicit premise of the question, namely that there is a tension between 'succinct/beautiful analytical power' and 'pragmatics'.
