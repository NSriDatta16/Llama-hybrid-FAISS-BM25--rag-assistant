Logistic regression model: interpretation of average marginal effect

This is more a beginner question but I am having trouble finding helpful information. Could someone explain to me how to interpret the "average marginal effects" of independent variables from a logistic regression model how they are related to the probability of the dependent variable in the logistic model Would really appreciate any simple/ intuitive explanations!
