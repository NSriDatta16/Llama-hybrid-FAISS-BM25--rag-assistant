Estimating single model for multiple time series is the realm of panel data econometrics. However in your case with no explanatory variable @Rob Hyndman answer is probably the best fit. However if it turns out that the means of time series are different (test it, since in this case @Rob Hyndman's method should fail!), but ARMA structure is the same, then you will have to use Arellano-Bond type estimator . The model in that case would be: $$y_{it}=\alpha_i+\rho_1 y_{i,t-1}+...+\rho_p y_{i,t-p}+\varepsilon_{it}$$ where $i$ indicates different time series and $\varepsilon_{it}$ can have the same covariance structure across all $i$ .
