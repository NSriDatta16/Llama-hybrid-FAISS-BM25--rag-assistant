Predicting average temperature is a regression task, not classification. You should be using DecisionTreeRegressor instead. Temperature is a continuous value and you are treating it as a category by using a classifier. Tinkering with the hyperparameters (maximum number of leaves, minimum samples per leaf, and maximum depth, etc) is still important since decision trees always are prone to overfitting. If you struggle to find good parameters yourself then you can try some automated methods such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV in sklearn.
