MVC architecture of PureMVC/JS is the most elegant IMO. I learned a lot from it. I also found Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture by Nicholas Zakas helpful in researching client side architecture options. Two other tips I've found view, focus, and input management are areas that need special attention in single page web apps I also found it helpful to abstract away the JS library, leaving door open to change mind on what you use, or mix & match should the need arise.
