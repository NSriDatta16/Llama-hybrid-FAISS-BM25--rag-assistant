Linear Regression: Calculating a treatment effect directly in regression vs. averaging potential outcomes

Suppose I have the following true model, where an individual $i$ at a particular point in time $t$ is either treated ( $W=1)$ or untreated ( $W=0$ ). The outcome for individual $i$ at time $t$ under treatment status $W$ is random variable $Y(W)_{it}$ . The true model is: $$y_{it}(0)=a_{i}+\gamma_{t}+\epsilon_{it}$$ $$y_{it}(1)=a_{i}+\gamma_{t}+\eta+\epsilon_{it}$$ $$\epsilon_{it}\sim\cal{{N}}(0,\sigma^2)$$ Where $\eta$ , then, is the treatment effect, or parameter, of interest. Suppose we have the following two ways of estimating $\eta$ : Run the regression from: $$y_{it}(W)=a_{i}+\gamma_{t}+\eta\cdot W_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$$ and obtain the coefficient estimate of $\hat{\eta}_{OLS}$ Exclude all observations for which $W=1$ . Estimate every $y(0)$ with: $$y_{it}(0)=a_{i}+\gamma_{t}+\epsilon_{it}$$ Then estimate $\eta$ with $$\hat{\eta}_{ATT}=\dfrac{1}{N}\sum\left(y_{it}(1)-\widehat{y_{it}(0)}\right)$$ I know the distribution of $\hat{\eta}_{OLS}$ . I am wondering if the distribution of $\hat{\eta}_{ATT}$ is different and how I can see this. My intuition is that the distributions are not the same, and that the first estimator is more efficient than the second.
