Meaning of 'Data Adaptive' and 'Non Data Adaptive' time series representations

I was reading a paper and came across a tree-figure which split time series representations into "Data Adaptive" and "Non Data Adaptive" representations. In the Data Adaptive branch were representations like SVD, Sorted coefficients, piecewise polynomial etc. While in the "Non Data Adaptive" branch were representations wuch as wavelets, fourier/cosine transforms, random mappings etc. So I was wondering, what is meant by 'Data Adaptive' and 'Non Data Adaptive'?
