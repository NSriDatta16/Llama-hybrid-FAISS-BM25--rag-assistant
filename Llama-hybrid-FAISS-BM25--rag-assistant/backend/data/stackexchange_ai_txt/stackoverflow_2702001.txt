Are you building against SDK 1.5, or setting android:anyDensity="false"? If your app does not say it supports densities, then Android will run in compatibility mode where it makes the screen look like an mdpi screen, scaling ALL coordinates and drawing to match the real screen density. Running in an hdpi screen like Droid, this is a 1.5x scaling, so every other "pixel" will be mapped to two pixels on the screen. Apps today should be written to support different screens, in which case the px and dp units will behave as desired on all screens.
