This is from the HoltWinters documentation in R. I had the same question and this answers why I could not calculate the same seasonal values. The function is using a decomposition method to find all the initial values when incorporating seasonality, whereas for single and double exponential smoothing it doesn't do this. "For seasonal models, start values for a, b and s are inferred by performing a simple decomposition in trend and seasonal component using moving averages (see function decompose) on the start.periods first periods (a simple linear regression on the trend component is used for starting level and trend). For level/trend-models (no seasonal component), start values for a and b are x[2] and x[2] - x[1], respectively. For level-only models (ordinary exponential smoothing), the start value for a is x[1]." Found this website that explains how to get initial values: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/hw-initialization/
