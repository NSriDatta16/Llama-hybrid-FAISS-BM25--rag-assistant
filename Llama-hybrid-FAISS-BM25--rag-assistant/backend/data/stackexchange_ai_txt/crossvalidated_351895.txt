Including many interaction terms in a logistic regression

I have a logistic regression model that is currently of the form: Event ~ Vacc + Age I want to start including interaction terms for different types of vaccine. I have been able to do: Event ~ Vacc + Age + Vacc*VaccRoute Where VaccRoute = 0 for intramuscular and = 1 for intranasal. This gives me nice results. Now I want to look at the effect of vaccine brand. There are approximately 20 different vaccine brands in my data. I have made dummy variables for them all. My question is, do I model this as A or as B? A, i.e. a single model Event ~ Vacc + Age + Vacc*Brand1 + Vacc*Brand2... + Vacc*Brand20 B, i.e. multiple runs of the model changing the interaction term each time Event ~ Vacc + Age + Vacc*Brand1 Event ~ Vacc + Age + Vacc*Brand2 ... Event ~ Vacc + Age + Vacc*Brand20 Do I "use up" statistical power more doing it one way? Do I generate erroneous confidence intervals doing it the other? Apologies for such a basic question but I haven't been able to find a succinct answer anywhere on CV or elsewhere.
