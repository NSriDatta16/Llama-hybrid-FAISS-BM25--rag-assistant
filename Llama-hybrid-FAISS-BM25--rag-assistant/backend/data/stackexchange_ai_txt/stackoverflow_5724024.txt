I ran into this same issue, and believe I set all the appropriate configs in .subversion/servers and .subversion/config, too, tried removing .subversion/auth, etc., but to no avail. I ended up saving the credentials by moving the .subversion directory (or removing it would work too) and running svn co. I got the following message: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATTENTION! Your password for authentication realm: Subversion repository can only be stored to disk unencrypted! You are advised to configure your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if possible. See the documentation for details. You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in '/home/davids/.subversion/servers'. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? I typed yes, and then got the same message. Stubbornly, I typed yes again. Now my password seems to be saved. Somewhat surprisingly, looking at the configs in .subversion, none of the settings are uncommented; they're all set to the defaults, so I imagine I would have to answer this warning twice to save a password for a different server in the future. Hope this helps.
