Many examples of "long run" behavior can be drawn from engineering, hydrology and climate change. One approach is the Hurst exponent, H . Developed by an English hydrologist working on the construction of the Aswan Dam on the Nile River in Egypt, it was used to calculate the dam height needed to protect against flooding. Bear in mind that the Egyptians, in what was likely the first-ever time series, began tracking the height of the Nile in the 8th c. and continued recording these measurements for centuries. Studying an Egyptian 847-year record of the Nile River's overflows, Hurst observed that flood occurrences could be characterized as persistent, i.e. heavier floods were accompanied by above average flood occurrences, while below average occurrences were followed by minor floods...Hurst developed the coefficient * H* as an index for the persistence of the time series considered. For * 0.5H used by practitioners is this: * H* may be interpreted as the chance of movements with the same sign. For * H>0.5*, it is more likely that an upward movement is followed by a movement of the same (positive) sign, and a downward movement is more likely to be followed by another downward movement.

Bear in mind that much of Holland is below sea level and is able to exist only due to the extensive dyke and levee system that's been in place for centuries. Like the Egytians, the Dutch have also been tracking flood heights for centuries, in their case for over 400 years. In the 50s, a storm surge eclipsed all previous levels, flooding much of the country, killing thousands. Using a "block maxima" approach to extreme value modeling, the Dutch estimated the height required to protect them against a 1 in 10,000 year surge and rebuilt the levee system to those specs. Today, as a bulwark against trends in global warming, the Dutch are again rebuilding this system around Amsterdam and Rotterdam to a 1 in 100,000 year event. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control_in_the_Netherlands http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/design/flood-control-in-the-netherlands-now-allows-sea-water-in.html?_r=0 http://www.iac.ethz.ch/edu/courses/master/electives/acwd/Xstat.pdf
