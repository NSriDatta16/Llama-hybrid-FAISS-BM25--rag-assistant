Creating a proper overloaded constructor pseudocode

I am a bit confused on how to create a overloaded constructor. Below is my assignment: Include the following: i) A default constructor and an overloaded constructor. ii) Accessor and mutator methods for each attribute. Below is my pseudocode. From what I created so far I assume a OVERLOADED constructor is a constructor that has parameters but I am not absolutely sure about that. public class Employee // declarations private employeeid : integer private employeesalary : integer public Employee () employeeid = 0 employeesalary = 0 return public Employee (id : integer, salary : integer) employeeid = id employeesalary = salary return public num getemployeeid ( ) return employeeid public num getemployeesalary ( ) return employeesalary public String getnumberofaccidents ( ) return numberofaccidents public void setCustomeraget(integer id) employeeid = id return public void setEmployeesalary (integer salary) employeesalary = salary return End Class Example: public policy holder (nr : num, age : num, nracct : num) set policynumber (nr : num) set customerage (age : num) set NumberAccident (nrAcct)
