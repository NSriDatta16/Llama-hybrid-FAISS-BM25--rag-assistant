Different method for parameter estimation auto.arima

I am trying to fit a multivariate time series with the auto.arima() function in R. Since my time series has seasonality I included Fourier approximation and used the following method proposed by Rob J Hyndman bestfit $aicc aicc) bestfit Aside from adding more variables that will increase estimation, it fits well based on the methods used by the package. In my understanding estimation is done by "CSS-ML". However, I am forecasting demand of products where the error is measured by a pinball loss function similar to: \begin{align} L(q_a, y) = \begin{cases}(1 - a/100) (q_a - y), & \text{if $y I would like to estimate my parameters by minimizing a pinball loss function like the one above for the auto.arima() function. It does not specifically has to be this function, but minimizing a loss function in combination with the auto.arima() function would be great. Does anyone has a suggestion how to do this?
