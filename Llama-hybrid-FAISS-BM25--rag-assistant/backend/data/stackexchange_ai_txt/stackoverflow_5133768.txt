I don't know much about the Infragistics suite, but generally speaking you should set you Background to Transparent (if you want to be able to click on the background) or {x:Null} (if you want to click through the background). Also if it's a window (derives from System.Windows.Controls.Window ), you'll need to set AllowsTransparency to true as well, but this might incur some loss of performance.
