It won't do anything in a modern linker, because it knows the executable doesn't actually use libfoo's symbols. With gcc 4.4.1 and ld 2.20 on my system: g++ linker_test.cpp -static -liberty -lm -lz -lXp -lXpm -o linker_test_unnecessary g++ linker_test.cpp -static -o linker_test_none ls -l linker_test_unnecessary linker_test_none They are both 626094 bytes. Note this also applies to dynamic linking, though the size they both are is much lower.
