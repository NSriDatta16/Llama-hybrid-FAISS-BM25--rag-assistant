How does a random forest algorithm deal with a few irrelevant input variables

I have a list of variables from which I would like to train a Random Forest Algorithm. I suspect that a few of my input variables, which have noisy distributions, won't be able to predict much. Can I use them anyway, knowing the algorithm will eliminate them in the process, or should I beware that these variables may biais my model?
