I'm with drthomas. Why on earth are you using javascript at all when you can just use css? .subMenuTD:hover { background-color: #ccc; } .subLink:hover { color: #fff; } Or even better (me thinks), get rid of styling the td elements that you shouldn't have and ought to be working on removing, set the links as display:block, and then you can declare the hover style under one element: .subLink { display: block; } .subLink:hover { background-color: #ccc; color: #fff; } And unless you have no control over the html or you have something mission-critical that relies on the markup staying the same, "it's already using tables, i know, sue me" is a really poor excuse. Here is your sub-menu, sans table: Newsletter News Archive Events That took about 30 seconds. Now here is the CSS for the navbar/rollover: .subMenu li { display: inline; list-style: none; } .subMenu a { color: #000; background-color: #fff; text-decoration: none; display: block; } .subMenu a:hover { color: #fff; background-color: #ccc; } That took maybe a minute more, because I had to make it look pretty. I'm not trying to be a bully or come down on you, but non-semantic code is not something that should be encouraged, and if you are looking for help with something, I wouldn't feel right giving it knowing it was going to be used on a site that wasn't compliant.
