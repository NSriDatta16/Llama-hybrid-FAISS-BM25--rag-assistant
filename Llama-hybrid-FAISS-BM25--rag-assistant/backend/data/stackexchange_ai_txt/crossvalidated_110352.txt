First things first, your model-building approach should be biased towards simplicity . What I mean is that it's entirely possible that your "best" model is one with only a few predictors, not 1000s. As a result, adding variables as specific as "HasXbox" is probably not the best approach to take.[1] My suggestion is to start with predictors such as: Number of items claimed Average price of items claimed Total claim size in $ (which would, in effect, function as an interaction term for first two) Max_Item_Price / Total_claim_size and perhaps even some measure of spread, too. [Note: with random forests you can usually specify some sort of "importance" parameter which will rank the predictive power of each of your predictors. Hence, you can generate a handful of these types of predictors and then the software will do the trimming for you]. Anyway, my point is that it's pretty easy to avoid the issue you're describing (i.e. of having a variable number of items per row) since--as you'll notice--every one of these predictors is defined regardless of whether the number of items claimed is 2 or 20 or more (you just have to be a little clever when defining your predictors). Is this helpful?? [1] Note: I'm going to assume that you're dealing with a relatively manageable-sized dataset and are doing a regular Statistical analysis and not, in contrast, some super-complex data mining approach with terabytes of data at your disposal.
