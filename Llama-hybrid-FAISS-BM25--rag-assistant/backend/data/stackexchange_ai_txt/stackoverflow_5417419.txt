Magento how to stop /checkout/onepage/success/ redirecting

I need to style Magento's order success page /checkout/onepage/success/ , but because it redirects when there is no order session I can't refresh the page to check my changes! Anyone know how I can temporarily stop this redirect for testing purposes?
