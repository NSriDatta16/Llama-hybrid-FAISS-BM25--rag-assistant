Workflow design advice for ASP.Net web application?

My team has been tasked with designing a web application that is workflow driven. I need some advice regarding the design. The workflows need to be dynamic. Meaning, users can define the workflows through some interface and apply those workflows to a given scenario (The definitions will live in a SQL 2008 Database). The scenarios are defined by the business and will never change. So there may be only 2 types of scenarios a workflow can be defined for. The workflows are not necessarily linear. Some sort of state will drive the workflow. States will also be dynamic, but only exist in a workflow. I have been looking at examples of workflows and state machines and my head is spinning. I am not sure I want o leverage Workflow Foundation or something we develop. I have seen this and think it may work, but I am not sure the state full implementation will work for us.
