Foursquare add venue post via curl php

Have anyone of you tried to add a new venue by using curl method in php? Below is my code: $value) { $post_items[] = $key . '=' . $value; } $post_string = implode ('&', $post_items); $curl_connection = curl_init('https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/add'); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)"); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_string); $result = curl_exec($curl_connection); print_r(curl_getinfo($curl_connection)); echo curl_errno($curl_connection) . '-' . curl_error($curl_connection); curl_close($curl_connection); ?> Hope you can help me out. Im not really sure if the POST is successful but it didnt returned any error. I tried checking the foursquare site if the venue has been updated but it doesnt. Thanks.
