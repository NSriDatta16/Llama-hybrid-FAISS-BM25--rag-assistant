Can constrained optimization techniques be applied to unconstrained problems?

I am looking at using Interior Point method for optimizing a convex function. The convex function is basically the log-likelihood of a binary logistic regression model. Can I use this technique? In generally, is there anything that prevents applying a constrained optimization technique to an unconstrained problem? From what I think, an unconstrained problem is just a constrained problem without the constraints and thus should be solvable using these techniques.
