Byecycle, an Eclipse plugin would help, but it has been removed from Sourceforge. Not in getting a thorough automated process, but in determining the dependencies. I'm not sure whether you can get it to work on Ganymede/Galileo, since I've used this a long time back. Update The Class Dependency Analyzer Tool might prove to be more helpful, since it comes with a plug-in extension API that could be used to create a plug-in to perform exactly the task that you intend to do. Update #2 In case you were wondering about the usage of Ant, you can use the ClassFileSet type to obtain a class and its list of dependencies. This can be referenced inside a copy task to copy the required class files . Do note that this doesn't copy source files. Internally, this method depends on the BCEL library , so if you wish to perform a copy of sources, you could attempt to write code to examine a .class file's dependencies, and copy the sources over to another directory.
