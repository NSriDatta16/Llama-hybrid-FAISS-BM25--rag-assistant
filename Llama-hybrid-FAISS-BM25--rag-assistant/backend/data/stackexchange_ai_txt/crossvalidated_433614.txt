Yes, you are calculating it pretty much correctly. Have a look at A guide to receptive field arithmetic for Convolutional Neural Networks and A guide to convolution arithmetic for deeplearning for formulas how to compute sizes of things in convnets including more complicated cases like non-unit strides etc. Also, note that theoretical receptive field is in practice not the same as the actual one. Have a look at the paper Understanding the Effective Receptive Field in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Luo et al., 2016) for some examples.
