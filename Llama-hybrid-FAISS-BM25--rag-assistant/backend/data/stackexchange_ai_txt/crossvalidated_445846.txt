Why do logistic regression standard errors vary depending on which variable is omitted?

I am trying to estimate the standard errors of the means of a binary outcome variable at different levels of a categorical variable using a logistic regression. However, these standard errors seem to depend on which level of the categorical variable is omitted. This can be reproduced with the following example: set.seed(5) var1 = rbinom(100,1,0.3) var2 = rbinom(100,1,0.6) conditions_strs = c(rep('var1',100),rep('var2',100)) df1 = data.frame('outcome'=c(var1,var2), 'conditions'=conditions_strs) df1 $conditions = as.factor(df1$ conditions) df2 = df1 # Change the omitted category in df2 from var1 to var2 df2 $conditions = relevel(df2$ conditions,family=binomial,ref='var2') model1 = glm(outcome ~ conditions,family=binomial,data=df1) model2 = glm(outcome ~ conditions,family=binomial,data=df2) Calling summary(model1) gives: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.5754 0.2083 -2.762 0.00575 ** conditionsvar2 0.9393 0.2911 3.227 0.00125 ** and summary(model2) : Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.3640 0.2033 1.790 0.07344 . conditionsvar1 -0.9393 0.2911 -3.227 0.00125 ** If I then want to estimate the standard errors of the estimate of var1 , which model do I use? Is the standard error estimate for a level that is not omitted dependent on the estimated standard error of the omitted level? Is a logistic regression not the best model to use in this case? I've used a logistic regression here because the problem I'm working on uses a mixed effects logistic regression - however, I discovered the same dynamic exists in logistic regressions without random effects.
