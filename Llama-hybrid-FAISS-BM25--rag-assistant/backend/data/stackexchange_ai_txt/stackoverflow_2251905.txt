Business logic layer, multiple tables, relationship

In the business logic we map, Tables to Objects and fields of this table to properties. What to do in one-to many relationship? Just an example: I have Table, Products and Categories. I need to drag all products and instead of Category_ID (Products table) need to display actual Category name wich is stored in Category table. What is propal way of doing it? In similar situations?
