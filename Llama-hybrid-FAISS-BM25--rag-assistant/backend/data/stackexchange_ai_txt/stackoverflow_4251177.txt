I'm not sure why your code is failing, since you didn't include drag and drop code, but there's an easier way to do what you want. For any event fired by the browser, you can access shiftKey property, which is going to be true, if the shift key is pressed: window.onmousemove = checkShift; function checkShift(e) { if (!e) var e = window.event; if (e.shiftKey) { ....Copy.... } else { ....Move.... } }
