1.URL is primary in your situation. Google does not like URL created from data base. So make a change to it. I recommend you make your URL in this way: www.yourdomain.com/BMW/12456/bmw-car-AD. The advantages of this URL are: It is user friendly, Google friendly(since it contains keywords)and system stable as well(see the ID). 2.All of SEO stuff like good title and description tag, your keywords, decently use ,keywords etc. It is worthwhile to read some related articles. Do not obsessed by SEO, do things Google encouraged you to do. 3.Good sitemap is also useful. Pay attention to URL structure of your whole site, if possible, please build some inbound links to your site, that is also helpful. Good luck to you!
