Interpreting lsmeans values from a mixed model with offset

I am using a generalized Linear Mixed-Effects model to look at the effects of different treatments on a density of trichomes. The model is : fitPoisson = glmer(Count_trichomes ~ Treatment1*Treatment2*Treatment3 + (1 | Block/Code) + offset(log(Length)), family=poisson(), data=dataset) Treatment 1 and 2 has 2 levels (0 and 1) and Treatment 3 has 3 levels (0,1,2). Block accounts for the replicates and Code, for each individual. Length is in cm. An anova(fitPoisson) told me that treatments 1 and 3 are significant and that there is no interactions. What I want now is to know what the density is for each level of treatments. So I used a lsmeans to look at the differences : > lsmeans(fitPoisson, ~ Treatment1) Treatment1 lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL 0 5.309106 0.06113705 NA 5.189280 5.428933 1 5.471452 0.06114033 NA 5.351619 5.591285 Results are averaged over the levels of: Treatment2, Treatment3 Results are given on the log (not the response) scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 I can see that the density of level 0 is lower than the density of level 1, but I dont understand what are the units used. It doesn't seems like it is for trichomes/cm, since the mean for level 0 is 107 trichomes/cm and the mean for level 1 is 131 trichomes/cm (calculated in excel). When I transform back from the log scale, it gives me : > summary(lsmeans(fitPoisson, ~ Treatment1), type = "response") Treatment1 rate SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL 0 202.1694 12.36004 NA 179.3393 227.9058 1 237.8053 14.53949 NA 210.9496 268.0799 Results are averaged over the levels of: Treatment2, Treatment3 Confidence level used: 0.95 Intervals are back-transformed from the log scale Which is still far from the means I found in excel. Maybe I just don't understand the information lsmeans is giving me, or I am not using the right function.
