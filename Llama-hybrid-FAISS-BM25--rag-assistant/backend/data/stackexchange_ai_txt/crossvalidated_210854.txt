Markov Decision Process - reinvesting rewards

I'm trying to find an optimal policy for a Stochastic game which I thought was simple, but seems increasingly complicated! It seems like this problem is accessible with a Markov Decision Process, but I'm unsure about how to include the rewards. I'm not very familiar with MDPs in general, but it feels like the decisons required in this game are appropriate for an MDP. The game: Players run a business where they make money by sending elves out to cut down christmas trees and sell them. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of 10 turns. There are three possible locations to send elves: Woods (\$10 per tree), Forest (\$20) and Mountain (\$50). Risks are associated with different tree locations, depending on the weather: If the weather is bad (where p(bad weather) = 1/3): Elves in the forest return empty handed Elves on the mountain get lost and never return. Each turn, players can hire more elves ($75 each) Players start with 12 elves, and $0. My questions: Could this be modelled using an MDP where the player state is number of elves, and amount of cash, and the actions are the allocation of elves to locations, and number of elves to hire? How would I do this specifically? What cost is associated with sending elves to the mountain (since it's delayed, and based on the weather)? Would I use reinforcement learning to find an optimal strategy? (Or even a good one!)
