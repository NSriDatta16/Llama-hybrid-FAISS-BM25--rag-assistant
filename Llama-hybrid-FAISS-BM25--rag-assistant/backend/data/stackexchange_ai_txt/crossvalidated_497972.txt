Are there time series models for weighted data?

Let's say I have the following time series: Weekly data spanning a few years; The dependent variable is the proportion of items that pass x. On average, that proportion is around 80%. The number of items is normally around 1000, but some weeks have only 100 items or so. time | items | passed | prop ---------------------------- 1 | 1100 | 900 | .82 2 | 1000 | 910 | .91 3 | 1010 | 920 | .91 4 | 105 | 91 | .87 I want to model and ultimately forecast this proportion. (The dependent variable should be the proportion to avoid out-of-range predictions and for normalization.) However, I would like the model to take into account the number of items per week such that weeks with, say, 900-1100 items have more impact than unusual weeks with only around 100 items. Does such a time series model exist that can take (analytic) weights into account? The weight in my case would be the number of items (or some function thereof). NB: I am aware of the fact that modeling a proportion may require a link function or a transformation. There is a related question that has a different focus (and no answers since it was posted in 2017) : Does there exist a variant of ARIMA allowing for weighted samples?
