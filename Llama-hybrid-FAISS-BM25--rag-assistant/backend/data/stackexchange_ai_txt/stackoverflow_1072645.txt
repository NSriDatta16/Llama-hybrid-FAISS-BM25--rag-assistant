Just did this exact test for a rather medium-large DB (200GB+), bigserial won by quite a large margin. It was faster to generate, faster to join, less code, smaller footprint. Because of the way postgres stores it, a bigint is negligible compared to a normal int. You'll run out of storage space from your content long before you ever have to worry about overflowing the bigint. Having done the computed hash vs bigint - surrogate bigint all the way.
