Unless I am missing something, your problem is that both GTK+ and libpcap are organized around events fired from a main loop. Without looking through the documentation, I don't know about GTK+, but there is another mode of operation for libpcap: You can use pcap_next() or pcap_next_ex() without giving up control over your program flow. It should be possible to register a function that periodically calls one of these two functions using g_timeout_add() or g_idle_add() , removing the need to mess around with threads and mutex mechanisms altogether.
