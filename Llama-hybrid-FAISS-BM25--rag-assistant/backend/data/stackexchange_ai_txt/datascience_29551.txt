turn off parts of features in a neural network?

Suppose I have a neural network which accepts two sets of features as inputs and generates corresponding outputs, for instance, generate average final grade from: 1. working hours for N students in a class, 2. mid-term grade for N students in the same class. During training, the neural network is trained with many different classes. What I would like to during inference is to turn off one set of the features (i.e. feed only working hours as inputs) and predict outputs using the same neural network. Obviously, setting the mid-term grades to be all 0s would not be a good option. I wonder if anyone know what would be a good way to do this? Thanks!
