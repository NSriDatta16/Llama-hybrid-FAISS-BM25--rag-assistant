Code reuse between django and appengine Model classes

I created a custom django.auth User class which works with Google Appengine, but it involves a fair amount of copied code (practically every method). It isn't possible to create a subclass because appengine and django have different database models with their own metaclass magic. So my question is this: is there an elegant way to copy methods from django.auth's User class? from google.appengine.ext import db from django.contrib.auth import models class User(db.Model): password = db.StringProperty() ... # copied method set_password = models.User.set_password.im_func
