Not really. Random Forests are closer to bootstrapping (there is a bootstrapping piece in the random forest fit). Bootstrapping can be seen as a Bayes analysis with a very specific prior and only looking at summaries of the posterior, but using a specific prior (that matches frequentist output) and not looking at the whole posterior does not really follow the philosophy of Bayesian analysis.
