Reading your question, it's not very clear to me if the associated table data is needed for assigning the "themes" (aka 'categories') to the labels-info per QUOTE: "...the label information would come from the text that is around these tables, usually right above it"...what I think you're trying to do is match / classify this label information (let's say "table header info") to themes. This is really just matching keywords to categories, you'll find neural network text classification online regarding, for example, website searches. If you apply the technique in my first answer, you can easily extract and separate the tables from the "table headers / label information" ie. using VBA's ".usedrange", etc. - so, once tables are removed you're left with label information, which can be parsed and listed as keywords. From here, I'm not sure if you need something like a RNN / deep neural network for UNSUPERVISED text classification, but it seems a Random Forest would be easy to do if you're doing SUPERVISED (manually assigning the label info's "keywords" to your themes (aka categories). You said the themes are known and fixed - so it's a matter of setting up a reference table; matching the themes to the label info's keywords for use with a random forest / naive bayes for text classification. I'm not familiar with the unsupervised, neural network methods well enough to assist with python, tensorflow, etc. code.
