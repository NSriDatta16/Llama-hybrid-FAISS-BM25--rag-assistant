In a regression model, an attempt is made to explain y (dependent variable) with the help of known independent variables.The simple one independent variable regression could be written as y = a + bx. It is quite possible that x alone cannot explain all the variations in y ie., there may be some error in the predictions of y by the selected model. The Intercept represents the average error that we are going to commit if we predict all the possible y values with the help of x values. The second interpretation is when X=0 what value y could take. So, mathematically, the intercept is the y value when x is made equal to zero. The third explanation could be that it is the unexplained variation in y due to X. It is expected that if a model is perfect, the unexplained variation in y should be 0 and thereby the intercept should be zero. In a regression model where the intercept is negative implies that the model is overestimating on an average the y values thereby a negative correction in the predicted values is needed.
