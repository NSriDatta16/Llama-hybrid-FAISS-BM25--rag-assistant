i would recommend one of the following: coverage - you can run a coverage tool in the hope of detecting some dead code caching - cache the dll on the client side on the initial activatio splitting - split the dll into several smaller dlls, start the application with the bootstrap dll and download the other dlls after the application starts compilation and linking - use smaller run time library, compile with size optimization, etc. see this link for more suggestions. compression - if you have data or large resources within the dll, you can compress them and decompress only after the download or at runtime.
