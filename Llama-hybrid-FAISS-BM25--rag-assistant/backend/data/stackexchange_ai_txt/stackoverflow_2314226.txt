Unless you do something special with persistent local storage, all javascript and ajax calls are blown away when a new page is loaded over the current page. Also when a submit is done on a form. To save things intra-page, save the data asap. Eg, perhaps save on key-up, perhaps periodically with a timer, not just on lose-focus. Re submitting the page: change the on-click behavior to first store, then to go to a new page. All of the effects that you are seeing are normal. Also, be sure to test on both slow (ie 6 or 7) and fast browsers (chrome)
