Upload an image on Facebook via FBConnect

I know many question has been post and answer for this question. I still stuck by a little thing. I did success upload an UIImage on Facebook via my iPhone app but I realize that photos goes to a pending album. And user had to accept it to get it post on their wall. Here is my code - (void)start { NSArray *permissions = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"read_stream", @"offline_access", nil]; [_fbEngine authorize:kFbAppId permissions:permissions delegate:self]; } #pragma mark - #pragma mark FBSession delegate - (void)fbDidLogin { NSMutableDictionary *params = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: self.image, @"picture", nil]; [_fbEngine requestWithMethodName:@"photos.upload" andParams:params andHttpMethod:@"POST" andDelegate:self]; } Is there a way to post a photo directly on the wall without passing by the pending album.
