Tables can be partitioned over storage, however it may not be in your interest: While partitioning can offer great benefits, it adds administrative overhead and complexity to the implementation of your objects, which can be more of a burden than a gain. Specifically, you might not want to partition a small table, or a table that currently meets performance and maintenance requirements. The sales scenario mentioned earlier uses partitioning to relieve the burden of moving rows and dataâ€”you should consider whether your scenario has this sort of burden when deciding whether to implement partitioning. Also, if your goal would be to separate data out into separate file groups (eventually disk groups/arrays), you could probably acheive this same goal using your storage system (SAN LUN with many drives in group, RAID array with many drives to spread the load). Your application may be fine using one table if your storage is ample and your code is tight.
