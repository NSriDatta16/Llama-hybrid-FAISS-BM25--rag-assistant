distribution VS average

Can anyone give me more details why is it always better to work with the distribution of a variable than with its average? I know that by taking the average we take into account the outliers but is it that bad? I mean it's quite easier to work with the mean... Can someone give me some examples why is it REALLY better to work with distributions.
