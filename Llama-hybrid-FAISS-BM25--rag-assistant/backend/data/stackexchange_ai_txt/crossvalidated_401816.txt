Log likelihood is just the log of the likelihood. You can read details of this (at various levels of sophistication) in books on logistic regression. But the value, by itself, means nothing in a practical sense. You can't say if it is good or bad or high or low and changing the scale (e.g. moving from inches to cm) will change the loglikelihood. Mostly, it is used when comparing models. The difference between two log likelihoods (on the same data) does have meaning. It is an indicator of how much better one model fits than another, and it is used in a lot of ways which, again, you can read about in books on logistic regression.
