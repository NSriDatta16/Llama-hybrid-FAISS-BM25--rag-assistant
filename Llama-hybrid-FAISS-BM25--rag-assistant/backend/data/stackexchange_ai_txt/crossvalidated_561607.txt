Model selection: comparing Bayesian models with likelihood vs likelihood-free (Approximate Bayesian Computation)

I have two families of models that can possibly explain the data at hand. One family is rather process-based, using fairly complicated simulations and Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the unknown parameters of the process. If I were to remain in the ABC framework, I know how I can use different simulation models to perform model selection. The other family of models is more descriptive and involves likelihood computations for Bayesian inference. Again, if I were to remain in this framework, I know I can compare models using Bayes factor and model posteriors for model selection. However, I would need to compare the two families of models (ABC estimations versus non-ABC estimations), and in that case I am much less certain: the parameters do not describe the same things at all, and the estimation methods are different too. Does it make sense to compare models between ABC/non-ABC estimations using BIC or is it unsound? I am not a statistician, so do not hesitate asking me to clarify, I will try my best!
