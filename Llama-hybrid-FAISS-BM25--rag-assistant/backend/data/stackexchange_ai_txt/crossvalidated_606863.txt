Continuous Bag of Words derivation

The continuous bag of words model has the following log probability for observing a sequence of words: $$\log P(\textbf{w})=\sum_{c=1}^{C}\log{P(w_c|w_{c-m},...w_{c-1}, w_{c+1},...,w_{c+m}})$$ I don't fully understand this. Probabilistically, shouln't it be define as: $$\log P(\textbf{w})=\sum_{c=1}^{C}\log{P(w_c|w_{c-1},...w_{1}, w_{0}})$$ as it is defined with other language models?
