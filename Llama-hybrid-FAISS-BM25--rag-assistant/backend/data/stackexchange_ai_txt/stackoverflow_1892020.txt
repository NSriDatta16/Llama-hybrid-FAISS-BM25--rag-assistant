Mixing two RGB color vectors to get resultant

I am trying to mix two source RGB vectors to create a third "resultant vector" that is an intuitive mix of the first two. Ideally, I would be able to emulate "real paint mixing characteristics", but for simplicity, I am trying to find a method where the resultant looks intuitively like what you'd get from combining the two source rgb's. minimally, these characteristics: RED + BLACK = DARK RED RED + WHITE = LIGHT RED optimally, also with real paint characteristics: RED + BLUE = PURPLE RED + YELLOW = ORANGE (etc) -- I am currently doing this the "lazy way" by adding the two source RGB vectors/255, then normalizing (and multiplying by 255). So, using this: [Red = * 255] + [Blue = * 255] gives Magenta= /sqrt(2) * 255, though the other colors are less intuitive or even visible... I need a better method! Please help :-)
