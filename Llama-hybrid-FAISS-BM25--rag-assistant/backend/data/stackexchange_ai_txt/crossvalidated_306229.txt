I don't think the Borel-Cantelli lemma is suitable for this exercise. To solve it, you will only need to use the basic definitions of probability theory. Three ingredients are involved. (1) Since $P\left(S_{n}\right)\to1$, we know that $P\left(S_{n}^{c}\right)\to0$. (2) By De Morgan's law, $P\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}S_{n}\right)=1-P\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}S_{n}^{c}\right)$. (3) By countable subadditivity, $P\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}S_{n}^{c}\right)\leq\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P\left(S_{n}^{c}\right)$. It's probably a good idea to show the result using these hints. I'll show a slightly more general result, namely that for any $\delta>0$ there is subsequence $\delta$-dependent subsequence $n_{k}$ such that $P\left(\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}S_{n_{k}}\right)\geq1-\delta$: Since $P\left(S_{n}^{c}\right)\to0$, there is a subsequence $S_{n_{k}}$ satisfying $P\left(S_{n_{k}}^{c}\right)
