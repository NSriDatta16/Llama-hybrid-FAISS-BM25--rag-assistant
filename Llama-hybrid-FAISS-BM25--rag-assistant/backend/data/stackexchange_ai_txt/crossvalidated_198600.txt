Statistic Book About Spearman Correlation

Could you recommend me a book or scientific article that explains the interpretation of the results of a Spearman correlation analysis (SC)? For example, I need a reference in the literature that says: SC = 0.5 is weak SC SC > 0.8 is strong SC > 0.9 is very strong I need it for a research paper, then to be something more "serious" than a web site. [UPDATED after whuberÂ´s help]: To be more specific, I'm using SC to evaluate an Information Retrieval System. I need to "correlate" the Rank result of my system against a rank calculated by some specialist.
