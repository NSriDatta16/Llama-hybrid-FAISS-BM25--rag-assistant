The issue you have started happening when Windows XP introduced the concept of window ghosting . Due to the unusual architecture Delphi uses (all forms are children of a hidden window â€” TApplication ) many Delphi applications experience the same problem. One way to quickly solve it is to disable window ghosting when initializing the application: var User32: HMODULE; DisableProcessWindowsGhosting: TProcedure; begin User32 := GetModuleHandle('USER32'); if User32 <> 0 then begin DisableProcessWindowsGhosting := GetProcAddress(User32, 'DisableProcessWindowsGhosting'); if Assigned(DisableProcessWindowsGhosting) then DisableProcessWindowsGhosting; end; end; Another possible (more elegant though laborious) solution is to normalize your Delphi application . A third option would be switching to Delphi 2006 (Delphi 10.0) . Besides the issue you're reporting Delphi's architecture introduces more oddities, among them the different task bar menu and the inability to flash .
