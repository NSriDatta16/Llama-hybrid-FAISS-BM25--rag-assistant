How to read multiple pcap files >2GB?

I am trying to parse large pcap files with libpcap but there is a file limitation so my files are separated at 2gb. I have 10 files of 2gb and I want to parse them at one shot. Is there a possibility to feed this data on an interface sequentially (each file separately) so that libpcap can parse them on the same run?
