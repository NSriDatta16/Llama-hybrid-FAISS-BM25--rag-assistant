Try this. We had this problem eariler, but eventually found the right solution. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ [yourtextfield resignFirstResponder]; // you can have multiple textfields here } This should resolve the problem with the keyboard not dissapearing when pushing the background.
