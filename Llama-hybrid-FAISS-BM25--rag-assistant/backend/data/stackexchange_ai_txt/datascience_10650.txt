Take a look at this paper [PDF] . The main focus is about NER task but the idea is the same - take pre-trained word2vec vectors and adapt them for a specific application. Many common neural network based applications for NLP frequently start with pre-trained vectors. For example a very recent paper [PDF] (NER and POS tagging tasks) does just this.
