Multiple tables in nested sets hierarchy

I have a number of distinct items stored in different MySQL tables, which I'd like to put in a tree hierarchy. Using the adjacency list model, I can add a parent_id field to each table and link the tables using a foreign key relationship. However, I'd like to use a nested sets/modified preorder tree traversal model. The data will be used in a environment that's heavily biased towards reads, and the kind of queries I expect to run favour this approach. The problem is that all the information I have on nested sets assumes that you only have one type of item, stored in a single table. The ways round this that I can think of are: Having multiple foreign key fields in the tree, one for each table/item type. Storing the name of the item table in the tree structure as well as the item ID. Both approaches are inelegant to say the least, so is there a better way of doing this?
