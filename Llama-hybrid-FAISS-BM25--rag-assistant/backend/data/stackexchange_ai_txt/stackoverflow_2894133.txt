How can I prevent 'objects you are adding to the designer use a different data connection...'?

I am using Visual Studio 2010, and I have a LINQ-to-SQL DBML file that my colleagues and I are using for this project. We have a connection string in the web.config file that the DBML is using. However, when I drag a new table from my "Server Explorer" onto the DBML file... I get presented with a dialog that demands that do one of these two options: Allow visual studio to change the connection string to match the one in my solution explorer. Cancel the operation (meaning, I don't get my table). I don't really care too much about the debate as why the PMs/devs who made this tool didn't allow a third option - "Create the object anyway - don't worry, I'm a developer!" What I am thinking would be a good solution is if I can create a connection in the Server Explorer - WITHOUT A WIZARD. If I can just paste a connection string, that would be awesome! Because then the DBML designer won't freak out on me :O) If anyone knows the answer to this question, or how to do the above, please lemme know!
