What i've done in my own similar case is to use a sql prettifier which will organize two sets of semi-disparate SQL in very similar fashion automatically. i then paste and compare the results with WinMerge. It's a two-step process but it's much more palatable than many other options, especially when many lines of code are involved. Link to web-based Sql Pretty printer that's decent.
