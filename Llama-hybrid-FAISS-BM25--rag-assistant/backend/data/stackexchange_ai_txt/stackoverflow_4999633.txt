I dont think there are any elegant solutions. I think you have two options - and they both involve search/replace which shouldn't be a big deal if you're proficient with perl. replace the $-function with jquery() in the datepicker library and add a jQuery.noConflict() replace the $-function in prototype with $$$ (or another name) and all it's instances The second option may be your best bet if you are in the process of removing prototype. It is less obtrusive - but then again it depends on the amount of code you have in prototype. I'd be interested to see if anyone has any other ideas.
