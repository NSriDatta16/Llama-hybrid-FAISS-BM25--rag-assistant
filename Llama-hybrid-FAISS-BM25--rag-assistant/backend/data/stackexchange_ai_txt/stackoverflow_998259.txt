There are ways to do what you want, but none of them are particularly elegant or foolproof. For instance, you could walk the call stack in your Field class when you detect and error condition, and assume that it is always invoked through the retrieval of a Field from an object. This will probably not always be true... Alternatively, you could use the LINQ expressions to pass the name of the field into the Field object when initializing it. There's a technique that's described here by Marc Gravell. In your case, this may not be perfect either. Ultimately, you are probably better off with a simpler, less complex implementation. Finally, you should consider whether this is really a case of duplication rather than unnecessary coupling . Why should the messages emitted from your code be tied to the names of properties or methods in it? What if you need to internationalize your code at some future point? What if customers want the messages to be clearer or more closely aligned the business domain ... are you willing to refactor your code to accommodate such changes?
