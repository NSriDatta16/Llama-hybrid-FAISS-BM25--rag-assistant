How to compare two datasets and understand if they are part of the same population?

I have two datasets "theoretically" collected from the same engine. I would like to merge these two datasets in order to train a single machine learning model; before doing this I want to be sure that I am not mixing two different things. Right now I compared min, max, mean and std dev of each variable but this analysis seems a bit trivial. Can you suggest me some statistic test or some procedure to confirm that the two datasets are collected from the same population and I can merge them? Thank you :)
