I suggest making Dao and Service classes. While Dao organizes access to data, Service uses Dao to manage data. The schema is: 1) Dao-class is getting access to data 2) Service-class is forming the repository 3) Service-class providing the repository for your factory It's very generalized schema, but I hope my answer will help you.
