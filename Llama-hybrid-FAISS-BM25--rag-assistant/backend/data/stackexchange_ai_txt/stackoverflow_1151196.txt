This is exactly the sort of thing Apple tells you not to do it, and clear you know it because you are attempting to guard yourself by checking OS revisions, etc. This is super fragile, it is entirely possible that this will change inside of minor updates or bugfixes. In 2.x Apple added and modified several keyboards. The fact you can't get sensible behavior is not surprising, who knows what Apple is doing inside the the keyboard view, they could be retagging or doing custom drawing caching off screen images of the view to increase drawing efficiency. If you want to do this you should implement your own custom numeric keyboard and pop it in and out when you need it. Probably not the answer you want to hear, but it will probably end up being a lot simpler than hacking around in your views, and a lot less likely to cause problems for your users.
