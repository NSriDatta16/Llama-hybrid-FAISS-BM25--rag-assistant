The basic of replication process is to maintain identical database organisation between different servers. Your question here can be considered as asking if a replication process can be used to break this basic replication principle. So the answer is no, but I am still interested in the reasons that let you formulate this question. Shall I say that this "dual primary key" option was seen as a way to solve another problem? I think you should go back to this initial issue and try to find another way to solve it.
