Does anyone have suggestions for how Goodfellow et al detected digits from the larger Street View images in their 2014 paper?

In their 2014 paper titled, " Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ", they write, We use an automated method (beyond the scope of this paper) to estimate the centroid of each house number, then crop to a 128 Ã— 128 pixel region surrounding the house number. Can anyone suggest possible methods they used to accomplish this task?
