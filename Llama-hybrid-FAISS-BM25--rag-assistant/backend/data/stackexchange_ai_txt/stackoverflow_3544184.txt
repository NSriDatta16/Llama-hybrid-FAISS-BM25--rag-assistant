Iphone - Video Recording Applications - Use Camera Roll or store in app / database?

For those of you making iphone applications that record video Are you utilising the camera roll for storage and then indexing the asset URL? Or are you somehow saving the video to the app / bundle / database? Does the stackoverflow community think it is viable to just store the asset url for replaying or that one should somehow store the recorded vid? The reason I ask, is that if you just store the URL, and the user inadvertently removes the video from the camera roll then the app will fall out of sync etc. This could be handled but far from ideal. Comments / queries / suggestions?
