"out of the box" I do not think this is possible. Look at the tolerance option. This is the extent of how you can define when the dragged item is over a target. "fit" or "intersect" might get you close to what you want, but not quite there. To get what you want would require patching in a custom tolerance option. Or just implementing your own drag&drop.
