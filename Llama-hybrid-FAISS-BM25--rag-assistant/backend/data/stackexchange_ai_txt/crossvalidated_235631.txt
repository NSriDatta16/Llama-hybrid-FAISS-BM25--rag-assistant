A random variable which is a constant with probability 1 is independent of itself. I leave the trivial proof to you as an exercise. Consider the deterministic function f(x) = x, applied to the random variable $Y$, which equals a constant, say $e^\pi$, with probability one. Therefore, the random variable $f(Y)$ is independent of $Y$. If you don't like that example because $f(Y)$ is the same as $Y$, then use the function $f(x) = 2x$. Same conclusion. This provides a counterexample to the incorrect statement "An univariate real random variable that is a deterministic function of another random variable is not independent of it." in the first paragraph by the answer by @Pere .
