How to use jQuery prevAll() to select nearby text nodes?

I'm getting a text node (node.nodeType == 3) returned from the getSelection range, eg.: var selectionRange = selection.getRangeAt(0); var startContainer = selectionRange.startContainer; This startContainer usually is a text node, eg the following html: Paragraph in parag raph. Would result in the text node with text "raph." if | denotes the selection: Paragraph in parag r|aph|. That's right, the selected text is aph and the text node is raph., because before raph there is a new text node inside the u node. Now, when calling $(startContainer).prevAll().each(function(index, node) ... I expected this to return U (which contains a text node with parag) and another text node (which contains Paragraph in ). However, it returns only U and not the text node to the left of it. Why is this? How do I get all same-level nodes before my startContainer, including text nodes with jQuery?
