It looks like a dataframe/nparray mismatch. Probably your model was trained on a dataframe; doing the training instead on an nparray may fix the problem. I've seen such errors in working with xgboost; see e.g. https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/2334 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/52578211/10495893
