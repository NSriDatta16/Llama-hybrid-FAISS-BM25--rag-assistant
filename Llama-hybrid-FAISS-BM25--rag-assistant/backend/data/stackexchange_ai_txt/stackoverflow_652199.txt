Do you want to copy the Index definition? Then you can reverse engineer the index, triggers etc using the "Script" option in the Microsoft SQL Management tool Simply right click on a table name in the SQL Management Studio table list and select "Script Table as" and then "Create to" You can't copy the Index data as it relates to the physical storage of the Index First check that you have "Tools/Options/SQL Server Object Explorer/Scripting/Script Indexes" set to "True". This is set to false in some version of the SQL Management tool (thanks Mark)
