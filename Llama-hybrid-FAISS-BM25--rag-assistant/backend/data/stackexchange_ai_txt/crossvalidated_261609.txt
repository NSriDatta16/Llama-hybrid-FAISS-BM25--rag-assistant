In your case, you do not seem to be looking for accuracy in the prediction, but try to understand which factors are influencing the success of an article. Regression may be quite hard to start with in your case (since the distribution of the output will need some pre processing). I would try to turn it into a classification problem "Has the video been viral ?" being equivalent to " PageViews(ArticleA) > 10 000 " (per example). Then I would try to calibrate a logistic regression (I would not bother with regularization in a first time - you have relatively few columns compared to the number of observations) or a naive Bayes. These two methods will help you (looking at the coefficients or the probabilities) to have an idea of the influence of each variable on the "virality" of the article. Another approach would be a decision tree , with a relatively low depth (to ensure each leaf represents enough information). This can help you identify combination of tags that contribute the most to the "virality" and is quite easy to visualize !
