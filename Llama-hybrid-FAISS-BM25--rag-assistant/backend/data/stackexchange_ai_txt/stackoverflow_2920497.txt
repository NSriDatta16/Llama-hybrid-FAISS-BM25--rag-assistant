Thread-safety of boost RNG

I have a loop which should be nicely parallelized by insering one openmp pragma: boost::normal_distribution ddist(0, pow(retention, i - 1)); boost::variate_generator dgen(rng, ddist); // Diamond const std::uint_fast32_t dno = 1 (unless I make an error each execution does not depend on others at all. Sorry that not all of code is inserted). However my question is - are boost RNG thread-safe? They seems to refer to gcc code for gcc so even if gcc code is thread-safe it may not be the case for other platforms.
