If you need to save the property on the webpart, add the WebPartStorageAttribute on the property, also throw on a FriendlyNameAttribute on there to make it clean: C# Version: [FriendlyNameAttribute("What the setting will be called")] [WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared)] private string MyStringThatGetsSaved { get; set; } VB.Net Version: Private mMyStringThatGetsSaved As String Public Property MyStringThatGetsSaved () As String Get Return mMyStringThatGetsSaved End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) mMyStringThatGetsSaved = Value End Set End Property Is this what you're after? If not can you clarify a bit further?
