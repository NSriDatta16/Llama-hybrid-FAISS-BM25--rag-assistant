How to graph the data points of n dimensions?

I'm very new to data science. I'm wondering how is it possible to graph data of n dimension. For example by Clustering high-dimensional data https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_high-dimensional_data How do we graph these data points? Do we use a specific data structure? Do we take only the three more relevant dimensions?
