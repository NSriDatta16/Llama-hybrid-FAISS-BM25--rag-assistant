decent html5 offline storage and caching examples

I'm keen to test out html offline storage and caching with a view to developing a prototype to show off the offline web application capabilities of html5. I've found some webkit-specific samples, but I'm battling to find any decent code samples that even work at all in Firefox 3.6 For a sample, I'd be happy with something that works with the following: Our company uses jquery extensively so I'd prefer samples that use that library or pure javascript. It should at least work on firefox (3.6+ is fine) Can anyone point me to some links that provide some guidance and code samples?
