Machine learning cookbook / reference card / cheatsheet?

I find resources like the Probability and Statistics Cookbook and The R Reference Card for Data Mining incredibly useful. They obviously serve well as references but also help me to organize my thoughts on a subject and get the lay of the land. Q: Does anything like these resources exist for machine learning methods? I'm imagining a reference card which for each ML method would include: General properties When the method works well When the method does poorly From which or to which other methods the method generalizes. Has it been mostly superseded? Seminal papers on the method Open problems associated with the method Computational intensity All these things can be found with some minimal digging through textbooks I'm sure. It would just be really convenient to have them on a few pages.
