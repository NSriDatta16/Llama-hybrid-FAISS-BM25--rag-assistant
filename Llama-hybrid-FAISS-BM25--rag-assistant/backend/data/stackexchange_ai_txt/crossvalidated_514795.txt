Empirical Bayes is a means of using the observed data to compute point estimates of the hyperparameters parametrising your priors . Which only makes sense in context of a hierarchical Bayesian model, where you have hyperparameters which parametrise priors on your model parameters. Maximum likelihood is a frequentist approach - you compute point estimates of the parameters, and there is no uncertainty being modelled in these parameters through the use of priors, parametrised by hyperparameters, on said parameters.
