Do some Bayesians assume that true values of parameters do not exist?

A comment in the thread Efficiency of Bayesian Estimator says Bayesian doesn't assume that there is a true value (of a parameter). Question: If it is so, could you give a reference to a branch of Bayesians that do not assume existence of true parameter values? And in absence of true values, what are Bayesian parameter estimators supposed to be targeting?
