likelihood ratio test for logistic regression with a complete separation

Can likelihood ratio test be used for logistic regression in the case of complete separation? I understand that individual parameters can go to infinity so Wald's test is not recommended, but does that also affect likelihood ratio test? Or in other words, is likelihood (and likelihood ratios) from models with a complete separation valid?
