You've got several options: "Global Script Protection" Administrator setting , which applies a regular expression against post and get (i.e. FORM and URL) variables to strip out , and several other tags Use isValid () to validate variables' data types ( see my in depth answer on this one ). cfqueryparam />, which serves to create SQL bind parameters and validate the datatype passed to it. That noted, if you are really trying to sanitize HTML, use Java, which ColdFusion can access natively. In particular use the OWASP AntiSamy Project , which takes an HTML fragment and whitelists what values can be part of it. This is the same approach that sites like SO and slashdot.org use to protect submissions and is a more secure approach to accepting markup content.
