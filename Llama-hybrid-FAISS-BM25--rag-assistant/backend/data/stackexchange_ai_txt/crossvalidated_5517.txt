How can one do an MCMC hypothesis test on a mixed effect regression model with random slopes?

The library languageR provides a method (pvals.fnc) to do MCMC significance testing of the fixed effects in a mixed effect regression model fit using lmer. However, pvals.fnc gives an error when the lmer model includes random slopes. Is there a way to do an MCMC hypothesis test of such models? If so, how? (To be accepted an answer should have a worked example in R) If not, is there a conceptual/computation reason why there is no way? This question might be related to this one but I didn't understand the content there well enough to be certain. Edit 1 : A proof of concept showing that pvals.fnc() still does 'something' with lme4 models, but that it doesn't do anything with random slope models. library(lme4) library(languageR) #the example from pvals.fnc data(primingHeid) # remove extreme outliers primingHeid = primingHeid[primingHeid$RT It says: Error in pvals.fnc(primingHeid.lmer.rs) : MCMC sampling is not yet implemented in lme4_0.999375 for models with random correlation parameters Additional question: Is pvals.fnc performing as expected for random intercept model? Should the outputs be trusted?
