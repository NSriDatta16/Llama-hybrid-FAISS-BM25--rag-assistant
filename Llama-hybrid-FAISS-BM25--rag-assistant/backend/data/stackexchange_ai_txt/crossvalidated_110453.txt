The different linkages are explained everywhere, including Wikipedia . I'm not going to copy and paste this here... As for related attributes: often it makes a lot of sense to merge highly related items into one. If you look at text data, stemming does exactly this, merging "go" and "going" and "gone" into one word. It's a best practise, but of course sometimes you may want to not to this; just as sometimes you don't want to use the stemmed words. If you keep multiple terms where you know they are highly correlated, you may also want to assign them less weight. So when your attributes are "pink", "rose", "salmon", "green", "blue"; then you may want to assign weights 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1, 1 to have less emphasis on the 50 shades of magenta.
