Mapping Hilbert values to 3D points

I have a set of Hilbert values (length from the start of the Hilbert curve to the given point). What is the best way to convert these values to 3D points? Original Hilbert curve was not in 3D, so I guess I have to pick by myself the Hilbert curve rank I need. I do have total curve length though (that is, the maximum value in the set). Perhaps there is an existing implementation? Some library that would allow me to work with Hilbert curve / values? Language does not matter much.
