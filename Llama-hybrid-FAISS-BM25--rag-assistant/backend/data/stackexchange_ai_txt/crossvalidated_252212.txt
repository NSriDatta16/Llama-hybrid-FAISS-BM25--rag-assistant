Time series modeling of circular data

I'm building ARIMA models for some wind/waves data. I'm building a separate model for each variable. Two of the variables that I need to model are wave and wind direction. The values are in degrees (0-360Â°). Is it possible to model this type of data where the value interval is circular? If not, which class of models is best for this kind of data?
