Robert C Martin (well known for the SOLID principles) presents a packaging rule of thumb that you might find helpful: "The granule of reuse is the granule of release." That is to say, when deciding how to group things in packages, split them up how you would want to use them. So, if you would want to use one class in an assembly, you should want to use most of them. If everything in your project is for the same specific purpose, then why split them up?
