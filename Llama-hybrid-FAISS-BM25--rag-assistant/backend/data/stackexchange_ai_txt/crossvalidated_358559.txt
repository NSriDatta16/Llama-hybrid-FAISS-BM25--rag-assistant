In a parallel trends test you will have to neglect one quarter of observations (which serves as the reference period) to which all others estimates are calculated in respect to. Usually, this is the period before the treatment starts. I assume that is $t_0$ in your case. Given this, it depends on the setup of your policy evaluation. Did the agents have the relevant information to "see the treatment coming"? can you credibly rule out any other "treatment"? Maybe you can provide evidence that in $t_{-5}$ some news about the policy were released and you consider the "announcement date" rather than the "implementation date" as the appropriate event date?
