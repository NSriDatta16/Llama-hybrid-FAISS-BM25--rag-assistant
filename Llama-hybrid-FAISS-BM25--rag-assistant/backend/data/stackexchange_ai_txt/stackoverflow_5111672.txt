Every once in a while someone comes up with a good solution. This is that time. HTML 5 offline storage is supported now in all major browsers since IE8. With that in mind, I decided to tackle form state once and for all so all scripting languages and even HTML pages can keep form state. No cookies needed, no memory-hogging sessions needed, no server-side programming needed and you can partially fill the form out go where you want to whatever URL, come back and the form is there where you left off. Just drop some small script and you are done. Here it is for free -> http://www.jasonsebring.com/dumbFormState Let me know what you think.
