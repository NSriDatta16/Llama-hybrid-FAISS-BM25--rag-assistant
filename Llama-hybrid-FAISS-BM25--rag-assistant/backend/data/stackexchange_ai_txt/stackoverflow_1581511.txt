--Edit: Just for others reading this post, I've been downvoted out of some weird personal grudge, not general inaccuracy in relation to this topic, give that consideration when reading, and vote how you wish! :) -- Old: The typical way to do this is with your 'Sequence' number (I call it 'SortOrder'). It's really quite easy. "Scalable" doesn't come into it; because you've already got a list of all the nodes you're working on (drag and drop, as you say) so what you're really doing is just swapping those numbers. Trivial.
