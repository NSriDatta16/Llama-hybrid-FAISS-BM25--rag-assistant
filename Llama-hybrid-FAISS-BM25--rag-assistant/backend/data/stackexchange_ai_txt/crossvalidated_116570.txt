Bayesian inference MCMC model for interval censored data

I have interval censored data for incubation period and I suppose that the exact time Ti included in each interval of the data [L;U] follows a lognormal distribution (mu,sigma2). I would like to use a bayesian approach MCMC model to estimate first mu and sigma2 and then the different Ti for the different patients. How I could do that ? Thank you for your help
