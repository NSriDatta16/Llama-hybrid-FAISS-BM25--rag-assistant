In general, Stata predicts the results of factor and principal components analyses as having zero mean. You can check this directly by summarize VERTRAUEN Look also at what is reported for the standard deviation. Nothing stops you re-scaling your new factor if you so wish, but it won't make interpretation of your regression any easier, and it will be an extra step you will need to justify and explain in any paper, report, dissertation or thesis. As you are asking this, you seem to be at a stage where you need to do much more reading about these methods and even the basic terminology. I have edited your question trivially, but I've let stand your use of both confirmatory factor analysis and PCA. What you are doing is not PCA.
