Not understanding that bool is a real type, not just a convention if (myBooleanVariable == true) { ... } or, even better if (myBooleanVariable != false) { ... } Constructs like these are often used by C and C++ developers where the idea of a boolean value was just a convention (0 == false, anything else is true); this is not necessary (or desirable) in C# or other languages that have real booleans. Updated : Rephrased the last paragraph to improve its clarity.
