WYSIWYM editor for desktop (.NET/WinForms)

What can I use as WYSIWYM editor for desktop application (preferably .NET/WinForms)? I need functions as paragraphs, headings 1, 2, 3, (un)ordered lists, strong and no other formating (restrictive). Editor wymeditor.org is bad for me purpose because I can paste anything to it from clipboard. I prefer no webbrowser/javascript editor integration. Thanks.
