Recall what a q-q-plot is: it plots theoretical against observed quantiles. When you ask whether it shouldn't be values in [0,1], you are thinking of the corresponding confidence levels. These are not plotted. (You could think of the confidence levels as parameterizing the sequence of dots in your q-q-plot: the dots in the lower left correspond to low confidence levels, the ones in the upper right to high ones.) When you create a q-q-plot for a linear regression model, you assume normally distributed errors, so the theoretical quantiles on the horizontal axis will be distributed around zero, and since a linear regression always forces the average residual to be zero, the observed residual quantiles on the vertical axis will also be distributed around zero. The vertical axis will be scaled proportionally to your estimated residual standard deviation $\hat{\sigma}$, and if your dots lie on a straight diagonal line (again, with slope equal to $\hat{\sigma}$), you are good. In particular, neither the theoretical nor the observed quantiles will necessarily lie in some specific interval, since the normal distribution takes values on the entire real axis.
