How to forecast intermittent demand when the future days with 0 demand are known in advance

I have an intermittent time series of the demand of some products. I have read some very useful answers (such as Forecasting Intermittent Demand with zeroes in times series ) as to how one would go about predicting such time series. In my case though I know already which periods in the future will have no demand as I know days when the products will not be available in the shops. How would one incorporate this information in the prediction? Should I use something like the croston method and just set to 0 the periods when I know that the demand will be zero? This seems to me like it wouldn't be using all the available information
