Write tests for your code ( http://www.phpunit.de/ ), setup a continuous integration server, run UI tests ( http://pear.php.net/package/Testing_Selenium/ ). With enough testing, you will find your problems straight after you commit bad code. Just keep the test code coverage high. That's one of the main points of unit tests - you can refactor your code without actually breaking it, because you check all functionality after every change.
