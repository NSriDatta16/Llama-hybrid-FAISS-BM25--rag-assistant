Stable PHP CMS for hacking against

I've used Wordpress and Joomla to build a couple of small websites, and done some hacking about to get them running exactly as I want. But both of these, and probably many other PHP CMSs, are subject to a constant barrage of security fixes. I don't have to time to test the fixes, make sure my customizations are still working, and roll them out before anyone attacks the site, then do the same thing again a month later - I'll never get anything else done with that kind of overhead. So my question is: Is there a (preferably PHP) content management system that somehow successfully avoids the constant barrage of security updates and resulting testing/sysadmin work? So I can just work on it when I have time, not keep racing to patch the latest attacks? Bonus points for having a sane plugin model to make it easier to code against. More bonus points if it provides an easy method to import data from Joomla and/or wordpress. Thanks EDIT: As rightly pointed out, avoiding updates entirely is not a sensible goal. Rather, I want to minimize the pain of updates. So what I'm really looking for is: Easy to adapt and theme in a way that is guaranteed not break during updates Simple update process
