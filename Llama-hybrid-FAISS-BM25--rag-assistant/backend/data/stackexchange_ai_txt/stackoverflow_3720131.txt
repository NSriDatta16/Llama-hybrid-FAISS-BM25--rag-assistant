Can Oracle Reports 10g create a PDF with usable text fields?

I have an Oracle Reports 10g report, that pulls data from the database and saves the result as a PDF file on the user's PC. The users are requesting that the resultant PDF have a couple of text fields, so they can open the the PDF in Adobe Acrobat and type in some data (small amounts, like dates and filenames; not entire paragraphs or anything) and then save the PDF with the data. Is this even possible? And if so, how?
