GLMs vs Time Series analyses

apologies for the dumb question but I’m a bit confused on using GLMs versus Time Series techniques. Say I am interested in determining whether or not a particular year has a higher mean than a baseline year. In my mind (assuming linearity) I’m thinking I could just build a linear regression with a response, $Y$ , and a dummy-coded year variable, $X$ . However, after doing an (albeit limited) literature review, this is frowned upon, and Time Series analyses are instead recommended. I just cannot seem to find out why. Are there theoretical advantages to using these methods instead?
