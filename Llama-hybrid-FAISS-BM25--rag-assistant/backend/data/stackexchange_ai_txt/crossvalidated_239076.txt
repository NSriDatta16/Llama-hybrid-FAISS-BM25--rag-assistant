About CNN, kernels and scale/rotation invariance

I have a couple of questions that are confusing me regarding the CNN. 1) The features extracted using CNN are scale and rotation invariant? 2) The Kernels we use to convolution with our data are already defined in the literature? what kind of these kernels are? is it different for every application?
