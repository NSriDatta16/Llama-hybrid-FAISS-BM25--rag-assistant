I took the liberty of capturing Windows Explorer with PAINT.NET (a great utility) and wrote the identical text above the captured text. Here's what I can tell you. The Font in Windows Explorer appears to be some compressed form of Seqoe UI. There's simply no other font that's close enough. However, it become apparent when you have a long word or phrase that the width has been compressed and the pixels bleed (aliasing). I've not yet found out how to reproduce the exact spacing, but I'm pretty convinced of the following: The font used by Windows Explorer is Segoe UI. The point size is most likely 9. The font is definitely compressed from what you would get using Seqoe UI 9.0.
