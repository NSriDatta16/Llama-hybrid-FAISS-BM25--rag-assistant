I'm going to assume you cleared your cache out. If "not having CSS" makes this hard to do via the admin, just delete the var/cache folder. Sometimes giving the CSS (or Javascript) merge settings a quick toggle from on, to off, to on again will force Magento to recalculate the paths. System -> Developer -> CSS Settings If you can't access this in the Admin, change the value manually in the database table core_config_data (identified by the path column having the value dev/css/merge_css_files ), clear your cache and reload your page
