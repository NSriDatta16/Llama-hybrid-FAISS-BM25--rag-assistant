Unfortunately you're kind of stuck - Microsoft's runtime headers seem to use single line comments in more than just sal.h (for example, stdlib.h uses them, too), so you can either: wrap the #include directives with pragmas to disable the warning while they're being included and reenable them afterward submit a bug report to MS at the Visual Studio connect site use some other runtime library (maybe Dinkumware will let you compile ANSI clean?) give up on disabling extensions (I'd like to know if anyone successfully uses that option for more than small demonstrations or experiments) or some combination of the above. Option #1 is likely to get you going pretty easily: #pragma warning( push) #pragma warning( disable : 4001) #include /* other runtime includes */ #pragma warning( pop) But I wouldn't be at all surprised if there are other non-ANSI things in the runtime headers. It looks like they've made some attempt to be ANSI clean for when the option was given, but I suspect it's not heavily tested (particularly at non-default warning levels).
