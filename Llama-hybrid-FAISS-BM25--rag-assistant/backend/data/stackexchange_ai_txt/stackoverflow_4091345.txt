What is this strange character and how can I get rid of It?

This shows up in both .NET and in VBA. The male sign: â™‚ You'll notice on lines 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 there is an extra character there. This is from a paragraph mark. On line 3 is a tab character, but that just shows up as spaces. This happens when I try to grab the text of a .TextRange.Text in PowerPoint. Above is the Immediate Window in the VBE, but it also shows up .NET controls when I try to put the text in a control, such as a ListView. It can be replicated by opening a new PowerPoint presentation and then in the VBE running: Sub Replicate() Dim ap As Presentation: Set ap = ActivePresentation Dim sl As Slide: Set sl = ap.Slides(1) sl.Shapes.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "One bad" & vbCrLf & "MOFO" Debug.Print s.Shapes.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text End Sub How can I get rid of this (i.e. just show nothing in place of the male sign)? Is this some kind of Unicode setting for my controls or RegEx on the string or...?
