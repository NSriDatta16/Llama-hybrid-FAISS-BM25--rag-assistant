How to do full stack integration testing of web applications

I'm looking to enhance our current test suites, and continuous integration builds with full stack integration/acceptance testing. I'm looking into tools like Culerity and Selenium that can execute front end javascript while running user stories. I'm looking for something that can provide coverage of front-end javascript and high level features without sucking up tons of development time maintaining a complex test environment. We're currently using Rspec, Cucumber, and CruiseControl.rb, so easy integration with those tools would be ideal. Are any of the headless browsers and js-capable test environments to a point where they are worth the trouble of setting up and maintaining? What are the best option you've come across, and pitfalls to avoid? Thanks.
