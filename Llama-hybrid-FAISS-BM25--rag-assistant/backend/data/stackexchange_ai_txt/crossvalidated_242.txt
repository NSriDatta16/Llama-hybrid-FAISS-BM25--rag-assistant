Using time series analysis to analyze/predict violent behavior

This is a bit of a flippant question, but I have a serious interest in the answer. I work in a psychiatric hospital and I have three years' of data, collected every day across each ward regarding the level of violence on that ward. Clearly the model which fits these data is a time series model. I had to difference the scores in order to make them more normal. I fit an ARMA model with the differenced data, and the best fit I think was a model with one degree of differencing and first order auto-correlation at lag 2. My question is, what on earth can I use this model for? Time series always seems so useful in the textbooks when it's about hare populations and oil prices, but now I've done my own the result seems so abstract as to be completely opaque. The differenced scores correlate with each other at lag two, but I can't really advise everyone to be on high alert two days after a serious incident in all seriousness. Or can I?
