Binary classification and target-label proportion

Suppose that we have a binary classification problem with a vector y = [1 1 0 1 0 0 1 ... 0] having the proportion: prop = (# of ones)/(# of samples) = 0.7 . Now, suppose that I fit any classifier clf and use it to predict the probability of every sample of the data to be classified as 1. Would the average probability coincide with the proportions of ones (i.e., would the average probability be 0.7)? Why? Thank you
