CATPCA - rotation failed to converge, but still get a Rotated Component Loadings matrix

I am conducting CATPCA using SPSS26 with six factors - after running it, I get a Rotated Component Loadings matrix; however, there is a footnote saying "Rotation failed to converge in 9 iterations". Reading previous posts and forums, it seems that I would need to increase the number of iterations - however, it is already set at 100, and increasing it to 200, etc, makes no difference. When I look at the matrix, all the loadings and how the items converge across the 6 factors make (theoretical) sense, so I was wondering if I need to worry about the lack of convergence?
