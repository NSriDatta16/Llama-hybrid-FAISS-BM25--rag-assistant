I think that steve and StompChicken both make excellent points: Picking the best algorithm is tricky , even for machine learning experts. Using a general-purpose package like Weka will let you easily compare a bunch of different approaches to determine which works best for your data. Choosing good features is often one of the most important factors in how well a learning algorithm will work. It could also be useful to examine how other people have approached similar problems: Qi, X. and Davison, B. D. 2009. Web page classification: Features and algorithms .
