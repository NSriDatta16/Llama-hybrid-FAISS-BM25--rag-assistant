The most functional way to rewrite your first code block would be to compose the three functions, map the composed function over the list of arguments, then apply fun0 to the list. Python doesn't really have a natural way to do function composition, so something like Jimmy's solution is where you'll end up. Python style tends to discourage lambdas, though, so I'd probably write it as a list comprehension instead of a map: fun0(*[fun1(fun2(fun3(x))) for x in [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]]) EDIT: Missed that fun0 needs separate arguments, not a list; adding * as per Alex Martelli's post.
