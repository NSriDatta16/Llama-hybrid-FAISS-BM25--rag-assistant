There is no reason for yearly data to be seasonal (for monthly data, one would expect seasonality), so this part makes sense. ETS and Holt-Winters (which is just a special case of ETS), and probably Prophet, and many ARIMA models, do output a flat line. Without trend, seasonality, autoregressive or moving average dynamics or predictors, that is exactly what should happen, because by definition no signal was detected that would change the forecast for one time point compared to another one. We have many threads on this. However, note that the forecast from ETS and Holt-Winters (and probably Prophet) is not just the overall average. Rather, it is a weighted average, with more recent data points weighted more heavily. See here. And all of these, plus the simple historical average, are usually the best you can do for short time series. Anything more complex, e.g., forcing a non-trivial ARIMA model because its forecasts are more "wobbly" and look more sophisticated , is almost guaranteed to yield worse forecasts: Best method for short time-series and Kolassa (2023) . There is really little else to do than to try to collect much more data (and even then it may well be that an almost trivial model yields the best forecast). Or to accept the fact that with little data, there is little forecasting one can do.
