Using both MSTest and NUnit?

Reading about MSTest and NUnit I couldn't really decide what to use in my project. We use TFS 2008 and VS2010. I like MSTest because of its integration into VS2010, Continuous Integration and Code Coverage reports. I like NUnit because it allows to formulate complex assert statements in a nice, readable fashion. Stumbling upon http://alsagile.com/archive/2010/03/09/stop-the-war-between-nunit-and-mstest-make-them.aspx I ask the community: is it possible to use both? I also think about sticking to MSTest and use Fluent Assertions to give me a more flexible way in formulating assert statements. Wouldn't this be the best option after all?
