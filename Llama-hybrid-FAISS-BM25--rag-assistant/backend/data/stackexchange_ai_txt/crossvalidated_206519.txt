This relates to the concept of Leverage . Since in typical regression we are usually minimizing the error of the fit to the data, the "high leverage" values get more weight in this calculation (a minimization problem). For SLR, these high-leverage points are the outliers or points far away from the mean, so the line will tend to be forced closer to these points than to points closer to the mean (which have less influence on the total fitting error). Thus, we'd expect points far from the mean to be closer to the line than the interior points.
