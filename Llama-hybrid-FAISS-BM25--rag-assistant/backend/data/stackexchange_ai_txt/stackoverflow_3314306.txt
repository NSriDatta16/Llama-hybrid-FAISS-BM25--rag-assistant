The latest Xcode 4 beta has git integration, however, it does not install it by default, neither does it use your currently installed git. What I had to do was install the "System Tools" option in the Xcode installer. (Which is skipped by default) after that, the organizer recognized that my project was already under git control, and integrated smoothly.
