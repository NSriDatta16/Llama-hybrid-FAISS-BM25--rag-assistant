I need help interpreting SATT estimate from logistic model on CEM matched data

(sorry in advance for a stupid question, I have no experience with logistic regressions and no one to ask) I'm trying to estimate the SATT point estimate from my matched data in R using a logit-model due to my dichotomous outcome variable. My treatment and control group is coded 1-0. Using the output from coarsened exact matching, this is the results i'm getting: Logistic model on CEM matched data: SATT point estimate: 0.26004 (p.value = 0.368663) I understand that it is not significant, but how do I interpret the effect?
