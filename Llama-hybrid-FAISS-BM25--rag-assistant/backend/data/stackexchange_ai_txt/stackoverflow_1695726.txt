The first problem I see is that the method recursive isn't actually recursive. I will assume the call to traverse was intended to be the recursion. The second problem is when index == params.size you aren't actually stopping the recursion. You're just printing "DONE" and then continuing. This explains the nil exception. The third problem is this pattern doesn't match your expectation anyway. Are you sure you intended it to be 1 11 22 33 44 55 66 51 2 11 ... and not 1 11 51 22 51 33 51 44 51 55 51 66 51 2 11 51 22 51 ... ? The latter is what your code is attempting to do, and is in fact what you get if you replace the puts "DONE" with return . The following is a slightly more elegant way of writing your method: def recursive2(params) return if params.empty? params[0].each do |p| puts p recursive2(params[1..-1]) end end recursive2(asdf)
