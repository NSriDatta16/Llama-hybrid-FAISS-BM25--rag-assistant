Here's a link to a website that simulates various kinds of color blindness: http://www.vischeck.com/ They let you check URL's and Screenshots with three kinds of different color blindness types (URL checking is a bit dated though. Image-check works better). I'd encourage everyone to check their applications btw. Seeing your own app with others eyes may be an eye opener (pun intended).
