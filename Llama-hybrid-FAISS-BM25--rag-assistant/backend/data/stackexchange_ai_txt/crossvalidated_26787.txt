As Erik said, yes you can check this for statistical significance. However, think for a moment exactly what it is you want to check. I think a more interesting question might be to ask how likely it is that the allegedly "improved" algorithm is better (or meaningfully better) than the original, given the data of an observed 1% difference. Asking questions in terms of "statistical significance" tends to lead to the opposite type of question: Given that the two algorithms are the same, is there less than a 5% chance observing an improvement of at least this much? To me, the latter question is backwards, but it has somehow become the standard. You can check out Wikipedia on the controversy in statistical hypothesis testing . You might subsequently be interested in Bayesian inference . If you really want to get into Bayesian data analysis, you can check out Gelman et al's "Bayesian Data Analysis" or check out this question .
