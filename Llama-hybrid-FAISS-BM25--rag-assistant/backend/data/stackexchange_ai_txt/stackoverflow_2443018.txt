LibrarIES like NUnit , xUnit or JUnit are just mandatory if you want to develop your projects using the TDD approach popularized by Kent Beck: You can read Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) or Kent Beck's book Test Driven Development: By Example . Then, if you want to be sure your tests cover a "good" part of your code, you can use software like NCover , JCover , PartCover or whatever. They'll tell you the coverage percentage of your code. Depending on how much you're adept at TDD, you'll know if you've practiced it well enough :)
