Prior elicitation with Inverse Gamma and parametrization issue

This is a homework problem. I am very new to Bayesian conjugate analysis, so hang on with me. I have a sample $(x_1...x_n)$ of $n=20$ observations from an experiment. These observations are breakdown times for some machinery. The average of these observations is 495 minutes. As information (given by the problem, an expert's opinion) I am suggested that the breakdown times are distributed exponentially with an average breakdown time of 400 minutes and one would be surprised if the machinery lasted more than 600 minutes. So, by the text, my sample distribution would be $f_{X|\Theta }(x|\theta)= \frac{1}{\theta} e^{\frac{-x}{\theta}}$,$x\geq0$, and since I'm assuing the observations to be iid, my likelihood function would turn out to be $L(\theta;\vec{x_n})= \frac{1}{\theta^{n}} e^{\frac{-\sum x_i}{\theta}}$. (I would really like to use this parametrization, since I can interpret the expected value of my random variable as a time average). My goal is to find the parameters of a conjugate prior (to then find the probability that the average machinery lifetime exceeds some value, through the posterior distribution). I know that an inverse Gamma distribution is a conjugate prior for my sample distribution. For it to be so, I must use the following parametrization: $$f_\Theta(\theta)=\frac{\beta ^{\alpha }}{\Gamma (\alpha )}\theta^{-\alpha -1}e^{-\frac{\beta}{\theta}}, \theta \geq 0$$ Using Bayes rule, I know that the posterior distribution must have the form of $$\Theta|Xn\sim IG(\alpha + n, \beta + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)$$. Attempt: a) I interpret my hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as "number of prior observations" and "sum of prior observations" as the posterior distribution parameters suggest. I also suppose that the extra information (would be surprised if machinery lasted more than 600 minutes) as $P(\Theta > 600)=1-P(\Theta b2) I say that $E(\Theta)=\frac{\beta}{\alpha-1}=400$, while the extra information stays the same. Both ways, when I try to find the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that satisfy the two conditions, I get into real trouble. ###Assuming beta/alpha = 400### library(invgamma) values.alfa The results are the following > a a [1] 0.9999958 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 [8] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 [15] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 [22] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 suggesting that the combinations of $\alpha$ that satisfies the conditions $\frac{\beta}{\alpha}=400$ and $P(\Theta > 600)=1-P(\Theta So, questions: 1) Are the interpretations of the hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ correct? 2) Which one (and why) would be the best rappresentation of my prior information? a) or b)? 3) Is the process of finding the hyperparameters correct? Why are the values so shifted?
