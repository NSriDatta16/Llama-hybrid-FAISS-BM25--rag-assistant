Organizing Master Graphics Files For A Web Application (Photoshop / Gimp)

Some of us programmers have to deal with graphic files every once and awhile... Making quick fixes to existing graphics Throwing together a quick sprite as a prototype Create an icon because the designer is too busy I don't think anybody should ever be editing web graphics (jpg / gif / png) directly. They should edit the master file and export over top of the web graphics. Right now all the psd files in our system are either on the designers or various other peoples drives and if a programmer ever needs to make a proper change they can't without high overhead. How should I approach solving this impediment? Save the *.psd / *.xcf files right along side the web graphics *.jpg *.png *.gif so they're easy to find. Either train the Graphic design in source control or have somebody responsible for integration. I tend to like this because it make everything very discoverable and you can just have your web publishing system skip *.pdf *.xcf. However I can also see a coder not liking 2mb psd files crufting up their repository and having to download that on svn update. Create a separate source control repository or network share for master graphics files. Continue as is... Any other suggestions?
