Should I gray scale the image?

I'm categorizing 30 types of clothes from the image using R-CNN Object Detection Library from tensorflow : https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection Does color matter when we collect images for training and testing? If I put only purple and blue shirts, I guess it won't recognize red shirts? Should I gray scale all images to detect the types of clothes? :)
