To rephrase the answer provided by @raghu . One major difference between categorical and numerical features is whether the magnitude of the numbers are comparable, i.e., is 2019 bigger than 2018, or December(12) bigger than March (3)? Not really. While there is a sequential order in these numbers, their magnitude is not comparable. Thus, transforming into a categorical value may make more sense.
