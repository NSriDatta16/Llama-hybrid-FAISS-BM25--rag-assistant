Desktops will be with us for decades to come. There is a lot of work to do, and I am sure the KDE Project has ample ToDo lists. So if you want to help, go for it! Or if you want to be so cutting-edge, contribute to a 'cloud' project. It's still computing, and you'd still be better off to work with something so well organised and put together as KDE. And I bet there are even KDE/Cloud integration ideas (PIM syncing comes to mind). Did you look? Just standing here and navel-gazing does not accomplish anything.
