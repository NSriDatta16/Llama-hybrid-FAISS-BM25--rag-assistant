The deeper properties of the object can't be accessed because LINQ-to-SQL uses lazy loading (that is, it automatically retrieves those records as needed, so when you access them for the first time it performs a database operation). Because the DataContext is disposed, it can't perform the necessary database operations. It is possible to have properties like this loaded "eagerly" (meaning at the time of initial retrieval), but you'll have to know all of these up front. In general, your DataContext should live for the duration of your unit of work , so it appears here that your DataContext needs to be declared outside of this method and passed in (or even declared as an extension method on your DataContext ). Here is a good blog post on DataContext lifetime management.
