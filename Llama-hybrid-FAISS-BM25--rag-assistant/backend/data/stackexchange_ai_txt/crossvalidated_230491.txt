2:) makes no sense to me. You would only do a t-test between control/treated if you want to test for difference in the sample means, but not for calculating the fold-change. Fold change is typically calculated by simply average of group 2/ average of group 1 . I'll give you a proof, in http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49101 , the author of DESeq2 wrote: (average in group2)/(average in group1) The question is why would you want to do this? There are good Bioconductor packages that can do that for you. For example, DESeq2 applies shrinkage methods to the fold-changes. Raw fold-change is not informative in bioinformatic statistical analysis, because it doesn't address the expression level (and variance) of the gene. Highly and lowly expressed genes can give you the same fold-change, and you don't want this to happen.
