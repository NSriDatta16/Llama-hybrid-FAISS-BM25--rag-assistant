How can I organize all my code, data, scripts, tasks etc?

What tools or approaches would you recommend to a 'one-man team' to keep organized? I'm doing research that involves a lot of coding, writing hundreds of throw-away perl scripts, C++ binaries that get used until I find some better approach, large amounts of data that gets preprocessed in different ways, where some new preprocessing makes the old way obsolete -- until I find out that the old way was actually better, and so on. My work is inherently a moving target, as I have to try many things out, and often none of it is perfect. It's not a completely chaotic situation, but it's also far from perfect. Are there general approaches that you would recommend in such a situation? I do use SVN for my code, although not for the different versions of the data because that gets too big. It's hard to keep track of all the scripts and binaries, so I always comment them, write down how I ran them etc. But I'm curious if you have some additional ideas. (I work on a linux system.)
