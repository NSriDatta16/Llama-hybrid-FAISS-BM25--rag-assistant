I have faced the same situation. In Management Studio the results came after twenty seconds but when I run the report in visual studio it locked the system. In SQL profiler I've traced the query and realised that it transforms my query as : exec sp_executesql N' .................... ....................' , @dateparameter1 = '2010-06-01 00:00:00' , @datepamareter2 = '2010-06-02 00:00:00' , @stringparameter=null I've examined the execution plan and realized that I was a victim of parameter sniffing. I've reorganized my query as it was told here , and it works fine now..
