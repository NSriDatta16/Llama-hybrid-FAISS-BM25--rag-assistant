Need to suppress "Warning: running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor" in Tomcat std out log file

I am using xslt transformations on my current project. The original xslts were written in stylesheet 1.0 format. The project is run on Apache Tomcat server. In the output logs from the server, the warning: Warning: Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor is constantly printing to the std out logs from Tomcat. I tried changing the stylesheet version number to "2.0" but parts of my project is not getting the correct data after the to the transformer. Only reason why I wish to fix this issue is because the log file is taking up too much memory space. So does anybody know how to suppress the warning for specific Tomcat server? Suppressing this one specific warning would be preferred but any opinions is much appreciated. Thank you.
