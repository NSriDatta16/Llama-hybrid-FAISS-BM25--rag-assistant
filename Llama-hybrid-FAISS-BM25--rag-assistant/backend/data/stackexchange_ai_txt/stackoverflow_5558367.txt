Tracking CPU and memory usage with Google Analytics

I'm looking for a good way to track CPU and memory usage for a variety of web applications and to be able to cross-reference this information with information on Google Analytics. For example, I'd like to be able to generate a report that shows the CPU and memory usage along with number of hits averaged over minute periods. One way I thought this could be solved is by adding custom page-level variables to Google Analytics for tracking CPU and memory usage. My questions: For those familiar with GA reporting as it pertains to custom variables, is this possible? Is there a better way to generate the kind of report I'm seeking? Perhaps even without using GA? Thanks.
