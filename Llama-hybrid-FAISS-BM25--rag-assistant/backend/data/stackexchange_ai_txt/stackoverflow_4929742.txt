How would I go about parsing this .xml for iPhone table

I am making a directory for an app and I need to parse the the names, e-mail, phone #, and office for each item that I want to display in a UITableView. I have a class made but I have never really dealt with pasring anything past simple txt files. I need to load a URL to a xml file, which consists of the following type of data at the bottom. It does not have xml tags, but it is saved as a .xml I have read up on the NSXMLParsers, but I wasn't sure if that would be the correct way to do this or if there was an easier way. Example of part of the .xml file below, this is just part of a few hundred lines that are organized in the same manner, by division, department, then person.
