in my opinion it depends on the people who are using your programs. In books for algorithms the pseudo code is very formal an near to maths, but is also described in a few paragraphs, so this is for scientific situations. If I develop in others environments I would prefer a not that formal way because that is easier to understand for most people. I prefer spoken words over formalism. If you want formalism you could read the code instead.
