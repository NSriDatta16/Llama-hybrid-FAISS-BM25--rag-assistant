Unsupervised pre-training for Reinforcement Learning

Since the advent of many unsupervised learning methods, as a pretraining step for the main supervised task (mostly under the name of Deep Learning), it shouldn't be strange to ask, what is the current state of "pretraining and learning from unlabeled data, for Reinforcement Learning"? Any recent/old works on this? Any suggestions for future work?
