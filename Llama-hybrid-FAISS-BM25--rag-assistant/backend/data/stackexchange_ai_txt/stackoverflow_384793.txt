The answer in my experience lies somewhere on a spectrum of values usually determined by where your organization's skills lie. The DBMS is a very powerful beast, which means proper or improper treatment will bring great benefit or great danger. Sadly, in too many organizations, primary attention is paid to programming staff; dbms skills, especially query development skills (as opposed to administrative) are neglected. Which is exacerbated by the fact that the ability to evaluate dbms skills is also probably missing. And there are few programmers who sufficiently understand what they don't understand about databases. Hence the popularity of suboptimal concepts, such as Active Records and LINQ (to throw in some obvious bias). But they are probably the best answer for such organizations. However, note that highly scaled organizations tend to pay a lot more attention to effective use of the datastore.
