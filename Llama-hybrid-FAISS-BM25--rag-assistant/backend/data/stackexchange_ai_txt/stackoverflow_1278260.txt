This isn't MySQL-specific, but there is some good stuff in here http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/ten-common-database-design-mistakes/ I don't agree with him about the use of natural keys versus surrogate keys. I have found surrogate keys in general work better for primary keys, but if you have a natural key you should put a unique index on it to prevent duplication of data. Pay particular attention to the sections on: - Not using SQL facilities to protect data integrity - Trying to code generic T-SQL objects - One table to hold all domain values Another good starting place is: http://www.deeptraining.com/litwin/dbdesign/FundamentalsOfRelationalDatabaseDesign.aspx [dead link Feb 17, 2015]
