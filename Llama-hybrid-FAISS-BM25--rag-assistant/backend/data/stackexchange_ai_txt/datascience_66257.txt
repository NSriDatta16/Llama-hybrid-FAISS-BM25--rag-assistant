Calculate Similarity using User's Personal Data?

I want to find out which users are similar to each other using their personal/organisational data, such as department, company, site, etc. I have this data in a boolean format, as shown below: Dep1 Dep2 Comp1 Comp2 Site1 Site2 U1 0 1 0 1 0 1 U2 1 0 0 1 1 0 U3 1 0 1 0 1 0 U4 0 1 0 1 0 1 U5 0 1 0 1 1 0 U6 1 0 1 0 0 1 I want to select a user and identify the other users that are similar to them, so that I can recommend them software/hardware that those similar users are using. I have looked into Cosine and Jaccard similarity but I have not seen much help when it comes to calculating them on Boolean data. I'm using Python and am not new to the language, but I am fairly new to Data Analytics and ML. Any advice is appreciated!
