The reason is that boost doesn't push/pop these pragmas in every file that needs data to be packed. They #include a separate file which does the push (abi_prefix.hpp), and then another (abo_suffix.hp) afterwards which does the pop. That allows them to reuse the same #pragma pack code everywhere, which is handy as it may vary between compilers. It's perfectly safe though. The #pragma push is followed by a pop, it's just included from a different file. So you should probably just disable that error.
