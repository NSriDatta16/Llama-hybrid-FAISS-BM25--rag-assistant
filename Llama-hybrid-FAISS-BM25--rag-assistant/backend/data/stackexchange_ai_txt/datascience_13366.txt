Check this video on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHsO10q7e2Y It is about a basic model (you can still optimize it) for churn prediction. uses all records available (churned and not churned). it only introduces sub-sampling when evaluating performances. You can also introduce sub-sampling in the training set, depending on the machine learning algorithm you are using. Hope this helps Rosaria
