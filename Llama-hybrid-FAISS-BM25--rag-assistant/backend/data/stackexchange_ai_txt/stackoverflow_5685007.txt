Making 'git log' ignore changes for certain paths

How can I make git log only show commits that changed files other than the ones I specify? With git log , I can filter the commits I see to those that touch a given set of paths. What I want is to invert that filter so that only commits that touch paths other than the specified ones will be listed. I can get what I want with git log --format="%n/%n%H" --name-only | ~/filter-log.pl | git log --stdin --no-walk where filter-log.pl is: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; $/ = "\n/\n"; <>; while (<>) { my ($commit, @files) = split /\n/, $_; if (grep { $_ && $_ !~ m[^(/$|.etckeeper$|lvm/(archive|backup)/)] } @files) { print "$commit\n"; } } except I want something somewhat more elegant than that. Note that I am not asking how to make git ignore the files. These files should be tracked and committed. It's just that, most of the time, I'm not interested in seeing them. Related question: How to invert git log --grep= or How to show Git logs that don't match a pattern . It's the same question except for commit messages rather than paths. Forum discussion on this subject from 2008: Re: Excluding files from git-diff . This looked promising but the thread seems to have dried up.
