Business Objects SQL generator. Generally, how does it work? Why did it do this:

I created a report that pulled 1 object from the Purchase_order table (PO_REF) and one from the ORG_ZONES table (ZONE_NAME). Why would BO generate a query that joined to a 3rd table, ORGANIZATION for no reason? Note that the ORGANIZATIONS table is related to both the PURCHASE_ORDER and ORG_ZONES table, so in a sense, if you were to look at an table relationship diagram, you would see a circle of links---if that is relevant! Here is the resulting SQL: SELECT PRELAY.PURCHASE_ORDER.PO_REF, PRELAY.ORG_ZONES.ZONE_NAME FROM PRELAY.PURCHASE_ORDER, PRELAY.ORG_ZONES, PRELAY.ORGANIZATION WHERE ( PRELAY.ORG_ZONES.ORG_ID=PRELAY.ORGANIZATION.ORG_ID ) AND ( PRELAY.PURCHASE_ORDER.SUPPLIER_ORG_ID=PRELAY.ORGANIZATION.ORG_ID(+) AND PRELAY.ORGANIZATION.ORG_ID >1 ) AND ( PRELAY.ORG_ZONES.ZONE_ID=PRELAY.PURCHASE_ORDER.REMITTO_ZONE_ID ) Why did the BO SQL generator generate SQL that includes the ORGANIZATION table if I am not selecting from that table and there is otherwise a direct link between the two tables that I am pulling from? Is this an example of a real bad SQL generation tool? Is there a way to avoid this-or only at the individual report level?
