In terms of popular frameworks, I would say jQuery UI which is built on top of jQuery. jQuery UI provides abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library, that you can use to build highly interactive web applications. The features in jQueryUI 1.8.6 at the time of writing include: Complex behaviors like drag and drop, resizing, selection and sorting. Configurable and themeable widgets such as Accordian, Autocomplete, Button, Datepicker, Dialog, Progressbar, Slider and Tabs Various utilities and effects There are of course many popular standalone jQuery plugins as well.
