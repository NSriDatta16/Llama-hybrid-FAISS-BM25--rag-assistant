As correctly explained by jbowman , you have to create a negative correlation between your simulations to implement antithetic variables: with a generic wblrnd function this is not possible. You thus have to get back to the definition of a Weibull $\mathcal{W}(\lambda,k)$, which is a scale transform of the $k$th power of an exponential variate, i.e. $$ X\sim \mathcal{W}(\lambda,k) $$ is equivalent to $$ (X/\lambda)^k \sim \mathcal{E}(1) $$ This can be reworded in terms of simulation as $$ X=\lambda(-\log U)^{1/k}\,,\qquad U\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)\,. $$ Therefore, you can implement the antithetic method by using a sample of uniforms, $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ and its complent $1-U_1,\ldots,1-U_n$ and compare the variance of the estimator of $\mathbb{E}[X^{1/3}]$ with the corresponding estimator based on $U_1,\ldots,U_{2n}$. To exhibit the improvement, you have to run a Monte Carlo experiment repeating the computation of those variances on many samples of size $n$. (You cannot see the impact of antithetic simulation on a single run.) The control variate is implemented in your case by choosing a known moment of the Weibull, for instance as suggested by jbowman , $$ \mathbb{E}[X] = \lambda \Gamma(1+1/k) $$ and using $X$ as the control variate. This means you compute the average of the simulated $X_i$'s along the average of the $X_i^{1/3}$ and the empirical covariance between the $X_i$'s and the $X_i^{1/3}$ as well as the empirical variance of the $X_i$'s to use jbowman formula. Again, checking the improvement brought by the control variate requires a Monte Carlo experiment with several runs.
