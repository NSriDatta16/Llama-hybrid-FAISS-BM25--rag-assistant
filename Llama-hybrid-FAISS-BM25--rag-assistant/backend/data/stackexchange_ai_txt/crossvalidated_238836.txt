Distinguishing responders and non-responders in studies of classical conditioning

I am concerned about the way "response" to certain experimental manipulations in psychology is defined and then used to claim that a specific subject did or did not "respond" to justify exclusion of "non-reponders" from the statistical analysis. More specifically, I'm talking about studies testing both Pavlovian fear conditioning and fear extinction in humans. During conditioning, one stimulus (CS+) is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) while another stimulus (CS-) is never paired with the US. Conditioning across subjects is found when the average response to the CS+ is significantly higher compared to the CS-. However, many studies exclude subjects where conditioning "did not work" by choosing arbitrary thresholds to make that claim. For instance, if a particular subject's average response to the CS+ was not higher (or not higher than 0.2 units or whatever arbitrary threshold) compared to the CS-, these studies might label the subject a "non-responder" or "non-learner" and exclude it. The thresholds that are applied to make this distinction vary from study to study. I suspect that many studies do this to exploit the "researchers degrees of freedom", i.e., to increase their chances of finding a significant result. However, I assume there is a statistical argument as well that it doesn't make sense to exclude "non-responders". Stephen Senn has repeatedly made the point for clinical trials that by design they usually do not allow for such a distinction, i.e., it is impossible to tell in any individual case whether the subject responded to the drug or not. I'm wondering if a similar argument can be made for fear learning experiments in psychology as well, that naively using response-rates (to manipulations) as an indicator of variation in true response, and my question is thus: am I right that one usually cannot decide whether a particular subject did in fact respond to a particular manipulation (in this case, fear conditioning)? Edit: This would be a (randomly picked) example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501228/ . It says that "we adopted selection criteria to establish that (1), conditioning was successful (defined as last two trials of acquisition > for both the CS + s vs. the CS−) and (2), extinction was successful (defined as the first two trials of extinction (trial 1–2) > the last two trials of extinction (trial 11–12). Adopting these selection criteria resulted in the exclusion of five subjects".
