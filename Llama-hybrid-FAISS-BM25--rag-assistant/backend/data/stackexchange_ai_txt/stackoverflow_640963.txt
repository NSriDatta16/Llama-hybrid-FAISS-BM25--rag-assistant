Actually, RFC 2965, the document that defines how cookies work, specifies that there should be no maximum length of a cookie's key or value size , and encourages implementations to support arbitrarily large cookies. Each browser's implementation maximum will necessarily be different, so consult individual browser documentation. See section 5.3, "Implementation Limits", in the RFC .
