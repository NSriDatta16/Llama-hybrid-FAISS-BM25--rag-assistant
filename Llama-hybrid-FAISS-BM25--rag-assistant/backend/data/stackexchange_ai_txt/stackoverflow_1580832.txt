How to install a custom plug-in in Eclipse Ganymede?

We have a custom plug-in. That is, the company where I'm working developed it in house. I would like to install it as an available plug-in in Eclipse Ganymede. How do I do that? From what I can figure out, the Eclipse software install only supports installation from Eclipse software update sites. I went to Help -> Install New Software... -> Add -> Local... to browse to a folder containing the plug-in. Although the dialog lets me add the directory as an update site, it doesn't work. It expects that directory to be a local Eclipse update site (I think). I get the error No repository found at file:/G:/TOOLS/... Next I just copied the plug-in into the plug-in directory under my Eclipse installation. That didn't work either. I also tried copying it into the dropins directory. No dice. Can anyone enlighten me how to install a plug-in that's not on an "update" site? Thanks in advance....
