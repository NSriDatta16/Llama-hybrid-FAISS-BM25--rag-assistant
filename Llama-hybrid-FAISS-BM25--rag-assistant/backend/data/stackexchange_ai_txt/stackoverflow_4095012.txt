I'd say use the IsDeleted flag rather than deleting the rows (or alternatively IsEnabled, which I use for stuff like User tables). Storage is cheap and just because the row is no longer valid doesn't mean the data is worthless. Another thing I usually have is a RowCreatedDateStamp column, its been useful many times.
