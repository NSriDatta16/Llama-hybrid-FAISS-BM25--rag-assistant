Visualizing the smooth terms in a logistic regression (GAM model)

We have a a logistic regression model (i.e. family=binomial ) estimated with gam of the mgcv package. How to visualize the smooth terms? A quick Google search shows (e.g. this or this ) that a few guys use trans=plogis in the plotting, which I simply don't understand. It suggests that they are trying to convert the results from logit-scale to the original (probability) scale, but why? It makes absolutely no sense without adding the intercept and adding all of the parametric terms (and in that latter case, specifying the level which was used for all of the parametric terms)... In contrast, using trans=exp would be the logical choice for visualization in my understanding: results don't depend on the intercept, don't depend on the parametric terms, and can be conveniently labeled as 'Odds ratio (OR)'. It seems so straightforward, yet, I wasn't able to find a single example for trans=exp , so I started to wonder if I miss something here...
