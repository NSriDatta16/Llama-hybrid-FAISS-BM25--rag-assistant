When you used a Feedforward Neural Network during week 4, that network has been already trained using backpropagation by Andrew, and provided to you to use for the classification task. In week 5, you went further and trained a network yourself using backpropagation. As you can see, there's no such thing as a feedforward only or a backprop only neural network. All neural networks are trained using backpropagation. For various reasons, you got a different accuracy score than Andrew's network. It's hard to say why, but I bet Andrew used his experience and knowledge to push the training further. Again, there was no difference in the nature of the networks.
