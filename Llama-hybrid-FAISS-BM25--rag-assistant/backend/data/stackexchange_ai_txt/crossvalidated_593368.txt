Testing the similarity of datasets containing many variables to asses model predictive performance

I have 2 large datasets containing many variables, A & B, where A is taken from period t and B is taken from period t + n. I have a model that was trained on dataset A whose predictive performance has now deteriorated on dataset B. I want to test the similarity of the 2 datasets in order to assess whether the decrease in performance of the model is due to; A statistically significant change in the underlying data, i.e., there is a fundamental change in the data- generating process and dataset A no longer contains predictive information for the behaviour The deterioration is due to overfitting Firstly, are points 1 & 2 essentially the same thing? If not, what are some methods to investigate this? I would be interested in hearing if there is a bayesian approach as well.
