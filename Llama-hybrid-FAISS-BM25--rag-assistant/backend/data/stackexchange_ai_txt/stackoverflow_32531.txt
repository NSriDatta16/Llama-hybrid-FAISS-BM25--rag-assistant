In the book Beautiful Code , there is a chapter called "Beautiful Tests", where he goes through a testing strategy for the Binary Search algorithm. One paragraph is called "Random Acts of Testing", in which he creates random arrays to thoroughly test the algorithm. You can read some of this online at Google Books, page 95 , but it's a great book worth having. So basically this just shows that generating random data for testing is a viable option.
