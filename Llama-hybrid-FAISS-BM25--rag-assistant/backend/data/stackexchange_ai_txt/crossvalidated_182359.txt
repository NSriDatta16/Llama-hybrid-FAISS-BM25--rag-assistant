Why do you wish to use logistic regresion or svm? Things like logistic regressions tend to optimize overall performance. Classify everything to negative and you will have a 95% accuracy misclassifying all your “interesting” cases. Which I am guessing is a horrible result for you in this case. Simply put, you need to optimize something else and as far as I know, logistic regression will is a lost case. However, this is a fairly common problem called “anomaly detection”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection You will end up optimizing your ROC curve. Which is a complicated way of saying that is going to be a tradeoff between your true positive rate and false positive rate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic Or you could check out Coursera and their Machine learning course from Andrew NG. (Week 9) Edit: removed bad advice.
