Answering question 1: You critic of DTW is met by introducing global constraints to the warping path. This effectively restrains both computational effort (since warping paths which are not allowed do not have to be computed) and prevents pathological warping. Therefore the answer is: DTW with global constraints There are several variants of such constraints such as the Sakoe-Chiba band and the Itakura Parallelogram as you can see in the following image. The image originates from a presentation, which is available online in a presentation done by Chotirat Ratanamahatana and Eamonn Keogh. Another possibly relevant time series distance measure is: LCSS - Longest Common Subsequence - has been originally developed to analyse string similarity but can also be used for numerical time series.
