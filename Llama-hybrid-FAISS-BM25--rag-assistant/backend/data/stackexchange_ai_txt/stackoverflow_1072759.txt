You could define a new command for this, temporarily adjusting the fill width before using the the Esc-q command: ;; -- define a new command to join multiple lines together -- (defun join-lines () (interactive) (setq fill-column 100000) (fill-paragraph nil) (setq fill-column 78) ) Obviously this only works, if your paragraph has less than 100000 characters.
