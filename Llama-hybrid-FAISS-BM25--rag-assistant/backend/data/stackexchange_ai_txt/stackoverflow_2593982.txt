Attempt 1 should work if you installed JSTL and declared the taglib the right way and declared the web.xml to be at least Servlet 2.4. Also see the questions: Where do I put jstl.jar and standard.jar so that Netbeans don't give errors/warnings? ModelAttributes not accessible on jsp To test if an object is empty or not, you should rather use the following construct: or Attempt 2 is strongly discouraged. Scriptlets are a poor practice and should always be replaced by taglibs like JSTL and EL (as you did in attempt 1). If it's not possible for technical reasons, then the coding ought to be done in a real Java class, (indirectly) starting with a Servlet. Attempt 3 is doable, but I would recommend to use servlet with a Javabean-to-XML serializer like XStream instead. This way you can just feed a collection of Javabeans to the outputstream of the response transparently.
