Asynchronous File Upload to Amazon S3 with Django

I am using this file storage engine to store files to Amazon S3 when they are uploaded: http://code.welldev.org/django-storages/wiki/Home It takes quite a long time to upload because the file must first be uploaded from client to web server, and then web server to Amazon S3 before a response is returned to the client. I would like to make the process of sending the file to S3 asynchronous, so the response can be returned to the user much faster. What is the best way to do this with the file storage engine? Thanks for your advice!
