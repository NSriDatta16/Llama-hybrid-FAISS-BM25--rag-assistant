There are actually 2 parts to the solution you're looking for: The database , which will store your data in a single organized place, and The application , which is the interface used by people to interact with the database. Basically, a database by itself is just a container. You need some kind of application which accept criteria from a user, pull the appropriate data meeting the criteria from the database, and display it to the user in a meaningful fashion - in this case, a graph or a spreadsheet. Normally for web-based apps the database and application are two separate components. However, for a small app with a fairly small number of users, and especially for someone just starting out, you may want to consider an all-in-one solution like InfoDome , sort of like MSAccess for the web. Either way, you're still going to need to learn about database design. There's many good tutorials out there, just do some searching. DatabaseAnswers.org has been useful for me. They have a set of tutorials as well as a large collection of sample database schemas.
