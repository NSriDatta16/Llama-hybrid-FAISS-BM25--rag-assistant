Do leverage values make sense outside of linear models?

I've been looking at leverage plots, but it seems to me that they are always related to linear regression models. For instance, this explanation of a hat matrix considers a linear regression model: Hat matrix and leverages in classical multiple regression Does it make sense to calculate leverages if we are using, say, a random forest regressor? Or are there more appropriate measures to identify X-outliers that are model independent, such as: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html
