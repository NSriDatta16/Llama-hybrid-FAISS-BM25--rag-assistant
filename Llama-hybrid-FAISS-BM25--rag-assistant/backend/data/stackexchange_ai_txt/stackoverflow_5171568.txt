Should I be using flash for this?

I am helping a friend with a website for her non-profit organization. The main page will be fairly simple, using standards compliant, semantic XHTML and CSS. My question revolves around a feature she wants to include. She wants to have a section of the site with the letters that spell out the organization's name across the top. She wants it to cycle through these letters, and for the "active" letter it should highlight the letter and then change the display in the rest of the box to pertinent images/info. SO - imagine the name of the org is Example- the box would say: E X A M P L E across the top, and first the "E" would brighten or highlight, then the box would fill with text saying "E is for blah" with a link to blah. After 5 or 10 seconds, that would fade out, the "X" would highlight, and the box fills with "X is for fooblah", etc..., repeat ad nauseum. I know I could easily do this in Flash, but I've always been wary of using Flash, especially for something like this which contains nav elements (although it is not the main site nav). How would the more experienced web developers here attack this problem? Should I bite the bullet and use Flash, or look into other technologies? I'd love to not alienate iphone/ipad users, but I can always sniff for Flash player and display a static image or something instead. Any advice is welcome and appreciated, and if it makes you feel any better, you helping this noob out is also helping a good cause. Thanks!
