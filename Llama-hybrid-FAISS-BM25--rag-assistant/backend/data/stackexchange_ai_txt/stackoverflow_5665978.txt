Setting Up a Backup on an External HD with Backup Exec

I have been trying to set up a back up on Symantec Back Up Exec 10d and it is not working. I have the external HD formatted into a NTFS and Mounted to the O:\ drive but it does not show up in the "Devices" tab. I added it as a removable storage device, but it only created the folder with nothing else in it. Everytime I run the test I receive the error saying "No online Media". Does anyone know what could be causing the device not the register?
