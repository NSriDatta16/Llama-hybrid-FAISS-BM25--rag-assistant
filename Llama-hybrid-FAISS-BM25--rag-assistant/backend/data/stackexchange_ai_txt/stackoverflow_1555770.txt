You can also do list.Find(x => x.Id == someOtherValue) != null in case you need support in C# 2.0 it can be written like this list.Find(delegate(Agent x) { return x.Id == someOtherValue; }) != null For LINQ it could also be done with bool listContainsId = (from item in list where item.Id == someOtherValue select item).Any();
