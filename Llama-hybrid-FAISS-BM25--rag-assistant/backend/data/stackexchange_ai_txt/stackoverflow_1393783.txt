Try reorganizing how your functions work. You could have a first "util.js" file like (outsite and without the document.ready function) : function showMessageBox(msg,msgBox) { alert("something"); $(msgBox).text(msg); $(msgBox).dialog('open'); } And then, on the files you need it: //first.js $(document).ready(function(){ $("#someButton").click(function(event){ showMessage("test","#messageBox"); }); }); I'd say because you are loading that function after the document has loaded, there is an order of precedence problem for calling it on the first file while it hasn't been loaded yet to memory (even if you put that file first). Putting it out the document.ready() function allows you to define it as soon as it's read by the browser and onto a globalesque scope.
