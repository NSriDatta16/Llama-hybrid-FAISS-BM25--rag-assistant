RFC 2109 says: To prevent possible security or privacy violations, a user agent rejects a cookie (shall not store its information) if any of the following is true: The value for the Domain attribute contains no embedded dots or does not start with a dot. The value for the request-host does not domain-match the Domain attribute. And also: Domain Defaults to the request-host. If your host is franklin : Cookies with domain=.franklin will be rejected, because it has no embedded dot. Cookies with domain=.franklin.local will be rejected, because it does not match the actual host name of your server. The solution is to rename your hostname to franklin.local or franklin. and set the domain attribute of the cookie accordingly ( domain=.franklin. ). Alternatively (as you found out), do not specify the domain , and let the user agent fallback to the request host.
