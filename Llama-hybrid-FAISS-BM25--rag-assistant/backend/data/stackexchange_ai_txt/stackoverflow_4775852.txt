NIO Connector + gzip compression

I've been a tomcat user for a long time and am now looking to start playing with tomcat 7 with a view to upgrading We use tomcat standalone using BIO serving many static resources...so this article in your "top ten of 2010" http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2010/03/24/myth-or-truth-one-should-always-use-apache-httpd-front-apache-tomcat-improve-perform was of great interest However our current usage(Tomcat 6 + BIO) uses gzip compression like: However I have noticed when perusing the documentation that both APR and NIO connector's don't have parameters / for compression. Can someone elaborate on how I can set compression in a similar fashion via server.xml / connector? If it's not available, are there any plans to incorporate this functionality? I'm aware we can write this myself using my own gzip filters etc; however the connector approach is easier and more elegant as gzip filter's would have to be applied to all our webapps(10+ webapps in a SOA architecture) Thanks
