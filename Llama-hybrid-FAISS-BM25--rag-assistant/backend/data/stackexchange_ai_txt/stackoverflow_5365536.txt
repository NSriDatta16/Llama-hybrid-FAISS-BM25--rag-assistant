Collections.max() Improper Arguments

I'm simply trying to find the max of a list of "Officers". The specs of the assignment I'm working on don't allow me to make the Officers comparable, so instead I'm using a Comparator to compare them. However, the compiler is complaining about the types of my arguments. Can anyone see what's wrong? (Don't worry about the return... I haven't done that yet.) Outside of the fragment below, officers is a List which has been initialized. Collections.max(officers, new Comparator () { public int compare( Officer a, Officer b ) { return -1; //will do after } } ); Any suggestions would be appreciated!
