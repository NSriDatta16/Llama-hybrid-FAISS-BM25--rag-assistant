Silerverlight dragdrop problem

Hi am using silverlight 3 with VS 2010. I am using controlsToolkit:TreeViewDragDropTarget along with drag and drop functionality. I found that Oct 09 release of silverlight toolkit added drag drop feature. but i could not download the same form anywhere. i downloaded the latest tool kit from http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/43528 but when i try to add following property mswindows:DragDrop.AllowDrop="True" it says AllowDrop not found in type DragDorp. Anyone encountered the same?
