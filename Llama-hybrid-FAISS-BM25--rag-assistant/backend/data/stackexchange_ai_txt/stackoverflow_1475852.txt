Consider a custom Value Converter that leverages the code you have shown, this should allow you to easily bind to the font families enum while providing localized names where available. The TypeConverter should only be used for Content binding, e.g. you don't want to translate the FontFamily itself in the combo box, you want to instead use it within an item/data template for the text display only. Alternatively, you can generate a container object that exposes a "DisplayName" property in addition to a "FontFamily" property, where DisplayName is the localized result you desire. Bindings against the SelectedItem (or similar) would have to include the "FontFamily" property in the binding path to continue functioning. Hope that helps.
