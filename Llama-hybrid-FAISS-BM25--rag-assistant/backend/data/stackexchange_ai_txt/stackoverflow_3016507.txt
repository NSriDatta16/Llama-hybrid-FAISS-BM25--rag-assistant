Can I float a block of text like an image?

If you change "float:right" to "float:left" in this W3schools example , you'll get an image floating to the left of the paragraph. I want to do the same thing with a block of text. The purpose is to be able to have little annotations to the left of paragraphs. If you know of any way to do this, I'd be very grateful. I'd be really grateful (and amazed) if there were a way to place this annotation midway in a paragraph and have text flow around it. I've searched all over for an answer but possibly don't know how to ask the question so that search engines can help me. So now I'm appealing to humans!!
