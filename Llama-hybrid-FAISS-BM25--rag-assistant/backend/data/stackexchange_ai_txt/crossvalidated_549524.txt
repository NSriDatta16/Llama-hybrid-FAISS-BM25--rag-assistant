Min and Max values of Bayesian Risk Classifier when Posteriori Probability and PDFs are Unknown

I'm struggling to come up with a well reasoned argument for this problem. Let $\tau_1$ be the posteriori probability and let $L(r^*)$ be the risk classifier. For this scenario, assume: $X\in\mathbb{X}=[0,1],Y\in\{ 0,1 \}$ $\pi_y=P(Y=y)=1/2$ for $y\in{0,1}$ Now assume $P(Y=1|x)=\tau_1\in[0,1]$ is unknown and the PDFs $f(x|Y=0)$ and $f(x|Y=1)$ are also unknown. In other words the only things that are known is that $f(\centerdot|Y=y):\mathbb{X}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a density function on $\mathbb{X}=[0,1]$ for each $y\in\{0,1\}$ . In other words $f(x|Y=y)\ge0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{X}$ and $\int_\mathbb{X}f(x|Y=y)dx=1$ . From this information I'd like to deduce the min and max values of $L(r^*)$ and provide conditions on $\tau_1$ , $f(\centerdot|Y=0)$ and $f(\centerdot|Y=1)$ in order to yield those values.
