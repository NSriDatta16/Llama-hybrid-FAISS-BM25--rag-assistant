Most of the problem solving task is to understanding what is asked from you. Teacher wants to make you show that you know how interfaces, abstract classes and classes are connected, and how do thy contribute to the whole object instance. There are few things that are assumed from you, but you would just be better of rereading notes provided for you - assuming, that you did not pay attention in the class. My experience shows, that struggling student do need a bit more then just advice to get going - if you need help, find a person who is ace'ing the class and just ask assistance. But for now, to get you going, this is what part of the assignement could look like package Assignment2; import java.util.Arrays; public class task { public static interface GeometricShapes { public double getArea(); public double getVolume(); } public static abstract class ThreeDShapes implements GeometricShapes { protected double a, h; } public static class Cones extends ThreeDShapes { @Override public double getArea() { return Math.PI * this.a * Math.sqrt(a * a + h * h); } @Override public double getVolume() { return (1d / 3d) * Math.PI * Math.pow(a, 2) * a * h; } @Override public String toString() { StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); builder.append("Cone [a=").append(a).append("; ").append("h=") .append(h).append(" ( area=").append(this.getArea()) .append("; volume=").append(this.getVolume()).append(" )]"); return builder.toString(); } } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(Arrays.toString(new ThreeDShapes[] { new Cones() {{ a = 3; h = 4;}}, new Cones() {{ a = 4; h = 5;}} })); } } Output: [ Cone [a=3.0; h=4.0 ( area=39.98594644342529; volume=113.09733552923255 )], Cone [a=4.0; h=5.0 ( area=71.08612701053386; volume=335.1032163829112 )] ]
