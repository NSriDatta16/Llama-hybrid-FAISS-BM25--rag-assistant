Word embedding/Word2vec for POS tagging

I am building a entity detection and relation classification method using deep learning approach which requires vector representation of POS tags and entity label. I am familiar with word-embedding method but I don't know the answer of following questions: How to convert pos tags into vector representation(say 20 dim) How to combine both word embeddings and pos embedding together to build the classifier. Similar question was asked in Cross validate community but I couldn't find the answer. Here is the link to question: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238016/deep-learning-word-embedding-with-parts-of-speech Research paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00770
