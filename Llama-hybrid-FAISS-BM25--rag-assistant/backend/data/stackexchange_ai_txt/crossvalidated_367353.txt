Monte Carlo Metropolis: Standard Error and Acceptance

In a time series data generated by Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm, when is the standard error (correlation between two data points is assumed to be negligible) is higher - when the change in the state of the system is accepted abundantly or when it is rejected most of the times, given that change is a accepted when a generated random number is less than the Boltzmann probability and rejected when it is greater?
