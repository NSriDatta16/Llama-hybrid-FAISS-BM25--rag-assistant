After you have made bets for all 1000 studies, an oracle ascends upon you and tells you which hypothesis are correct. This information allows you to settle the bets. My claim is that there exists an optimal strategy for this game. The problem in your setup is the Oracle. It doesn't usually come to settle the bets. Say, you are betting that the probability that it is true that smoking causes cancer is 97%. When will this Oracle come to settle the bet? Never. Then how would you prove that your optimal strategy optimal? However, if you remove an Oracle, and introduce other agents such as competitors and customers, then there would be an optimal strategy. I'm afraid it won't be based on p-values, though. It would be more similar to Gosset's approach with loss functions. For instance, you and your competitors in farming sector are betting on the weather forecast being true. Whoever picks a better strategy is going to make more money. There's no need in Oracle, and the bets are settled on the markets. You can't base strategy on p-values here, you have to account for losses and profits in dollars.
