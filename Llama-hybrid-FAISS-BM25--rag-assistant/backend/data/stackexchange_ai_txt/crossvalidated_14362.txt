It is very, with the hypothesis that your time series is stationary : To simplify the excellent answer of Macro Here you have your time series with 5 states : A, B, C, D, E AAAEDDDCBEEEDBADBECADAAAACCCDDE You just have to count first the transitions : - leaving A : 9 transitions Among those 9 transitions, 5 are A->A, 0 A->B, 1 A->C, 2 A->D, 1 A->E So the first line of your transition probability matrix is [5/9 0 1/9 2/9 1/9] You do that counting for each state, and then obtain your 5x5 matrix.
