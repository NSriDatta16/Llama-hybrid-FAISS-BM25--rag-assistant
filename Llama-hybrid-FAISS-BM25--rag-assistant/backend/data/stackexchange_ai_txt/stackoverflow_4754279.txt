Sounds kind of like you want to upcast back to the base class, but you don't want simply a reference, but an instance of your base class. If you wanted to do this generically, I guess you could use some reflection to get all subclasses of Animal and map that type back to Animal . Something like this: var currentAssem = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(); var animals = currentAssem.GetTypes().Where(t => t.IsSubclassOf(typeof(Animal))); foreach(var animalType in animals) { Mapper.CreateMap(animalType, typeof (Animal)); } Now you can map any animal subclass back to Animal : var cat = new Cat { NumberOfLegs = 4, FurColor = "blue" }; var dog = new Dog { NumberOfLegs = 4, WoofType = "squeek" }; var animal1 = Mapper.Map (cat); var animal2 = Mapper.Map (dog);
