From an object-orientated point of view, i would recommend not relying on the scope of the variable in parent.jsp being included in the child.jsp. This is because when i include a fragment in a jsp i tend to want to reuse that fragment in many different places. For example if i have a child.jsp i may want to use it in parent1.jsp as well as parent2.jsp. In the case it is better not to variable inheritence.
