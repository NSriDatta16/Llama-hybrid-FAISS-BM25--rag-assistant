I thought Bayesian is called Bayesian because of this Bayes formula: $$P(\theta|X)=\frac{P(X|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(X)}$$ This means two things: 1) every parameter has a distribution; 2) a joint distribution between model parameters and data exists. For the second point, I'd like to quote this quote : If you use Bayes' rule, you assume that a joint distribution between model parameters and data exists. This, however, only exists if your data and your parameters both exist, in the same Ïƒ-algebra. You can't have it both ways. You have to think your model really exists somewhere. The above two points don't hold in frequentist because it only optimizes the likelihood $P(X|\theta)$ , assuming that $P(\theta|X)=P(X|\theta)$ . We can see that frequentist doesn't utilize the Bayes formula to connect the parameters and data.
