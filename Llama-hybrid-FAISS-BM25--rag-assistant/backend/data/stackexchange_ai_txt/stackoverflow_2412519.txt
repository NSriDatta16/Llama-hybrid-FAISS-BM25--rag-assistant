It looks like your tabBarController's viewControllers are actually UINavigationControllers (you can see this by the unrecognized selector error). You probably want to look at that controller's own view controllers: UINavigationController *navController = (UINavigationController *) [self.tabBarController.viewControllers objectAtIndex: 0]; ViewControllerA *controller = [navController.viewControllers objectAtIndex: 0]; [controller setAnnoSelected]; You might want to consider doing this with a notification instead, however, as this method is a little fragile.
