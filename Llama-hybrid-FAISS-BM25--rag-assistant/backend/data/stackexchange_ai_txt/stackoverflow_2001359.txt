System for organizing multi-file Ruby programs?

Is there a standard or conventional system for organizing multi-file Ruby programs? I have embarked on my first large "project" in Ruby, a search program which is logically organized into multiple files and directories. I've outlined below my potential structure: The main file . This file implements the search class and general searching protocol. The algorithmic analysis file . This file implements functions that interpret search results. Protocols directory Contains one file per protocol to search. Feeds Directory Part of the program's purpose is to search archived news feeds. The files for this feature go in this folder. However, the code currently has a class (let's call it Searcher) that each protocol's search class inherits from (GoogleSearcher Aside from my specific example, I was wondering if there are any conventions, such as "more files rather than less", or "logical structuring of files is unnecessary". Is it common to have a file of "helper" functions (such as in Rails?) What level of abstraction is considered appropriate? Finally, I'm planning on integrating this into Rails someday as a library (not a plugin; I want it to work standalone as well). I don't know if this would affect the organization. I know this is a pretty open-ended question, but that's because I would appreciate any advice that is remotely relevant. Thanks in advance.
