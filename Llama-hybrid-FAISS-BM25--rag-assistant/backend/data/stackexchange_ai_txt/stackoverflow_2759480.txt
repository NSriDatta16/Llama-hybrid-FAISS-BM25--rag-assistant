The GWT Developer's Guide page on Cross-Browser Support gives a JSNI function that returns the UserAgent string. Note, however, that you probably want to use Deferred Binding to write browser-specific code, instead of detecting the UserAgent. Edit: Kasturi points out Window.Navigator.getUserAgent() , which is implemented like so: /** * Gets the navigator.appName. * * @return the window's navigator.appName. */ public static native String getAppName() /*-{ return $wnd.navigator.appName; }-*/; So yes, this should do what the function mentioned on the Cross-Browser Support page does (except that it doesn't call toLowerCase() on it), though again you may be better off using deferred binding.
