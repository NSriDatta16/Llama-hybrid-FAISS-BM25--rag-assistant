SEO Best Practices for page title, meta tag and page content

I have a question regarding search engine optimisation. I did some research on my niche and I found the following keywords to be most relevant to my niche (this is just sample text, not the real keywords): learn english learn english online learn english free Meta Tag If I were to add the keywords to the meta tag, what will the keywords have to look like? Must they be the exact phrases above, individual words or a combination of both? Page Title How would I use these keywords in a page title, what is best practices? Page Content If I write an introductory paragraph, do I need to include all 3 phrases exactly as they are? I am trying to follow best practices on SEO. I would appreciate as much comments as possible. Thanks
