Instrumental variable regression computation

For my thesis I am doing an Instrumental Variables (IV) regression and I was wondering if I did it the right way. Couple of issues I have: Comparing the linear model with the IV models, the sign of the effect changes (positive to negative or the other way round). Using Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with ivreg (from the AER package) gives negative R² values, so I decided to manually compute the 2SLS estimates. These give the same estimates as the ivreg code but now with statistically significant results. I have limited data and therefore I did not expect any significant results as I already did some non-parametric tests and the means of the different groups were not significantly different. I am researching the effect of policies of organizations on a given budget. The organization performs well if the budget residual is positive, so they have less costs than budgeted. The variable is a percentage, either positive or negative. There is non random selection into treatment as organizations can determine their own policy. Furthermore, the policy factors are mostly dummy variables, 19 variables are binary and 2 are categorical and 1 is ratio. My IV is any number between 0 and 1. This is what I did: 1. I estimate a simple Ordinary Least Squares model to see what it would do (I know the results don't mean anything). lm1 2. Then I performed an IV with the ivreg code, though the R² became negative which I thought was weird. ivreg1 3. So I tried to do the 2SLS in steps myself. Instead of fitted.values(reg1) I also used predict(reg1) . This gives the same output. attach(df) reg1 With this step I got a positive adjusted R² but I noticed that the policy factors are now significant and that the sign compared to the lm model changes. Question: Am I computing the IV regression wrong? Example data (not real numbers due to anonymity of data): df
