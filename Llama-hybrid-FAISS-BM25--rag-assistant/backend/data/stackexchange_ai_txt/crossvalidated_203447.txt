What you are calling the "weighted average" is the only proper way to calculate the percentage of satisfied customers in both shops. Taking average of percentages (what you call "unweighted" average) will give you useless results if your samples differ in size. Imagine extreme case: you have two shops A and B , in shop A there was one customer and he was not satisfied and in shop B there were 100 customers and 90 of them were satisfied -- would you conclude that 45% of customers of both shops were satisfied? Obviously not! The smaller sample is much less reliable, so it should not be included in the final estimate with the same weight as the larger one. Speaking more formally, estimates from the smaller sample has a greater error. Two shops: A and B , in A there are two customers, one happy, in B , there were 100 and 75 were happy. So they have 50% and 75% happy customers, so the average is 62.5%. Using your example from the comment: Standard error for the estimate from the first shop is $\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{\sqrt 2} = 0.18$ , while for the second one $\frac{0.75(1-0.75)}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.02$ . So the possible deviation from the true proportion of satisfied customers in shop A is much larger. If the samples differ that much in their reliability, you shouldn't give them equal trust and weight them equally when taking their average. You can easily convince yourself why using pooled mean is a much better idea than using the raw one by conducting a simple simulation study. I simulate two shops, with $n=8$ and $n=100$ customers, both having the same proportion of satisfied customers. If you compare the results obtained using raw mean ("unweighted") and the pooled ("weighted") estimates, you'll see that when using the raw mean the variability of the difference between the estimate and the true value is much greater. Saying this in simple English: using raw mean you are at greater risk of obtaining the wrong estimate than in the case of pooled mean. For much more advanced methods of pooling different probabilities, you can check Combining probabilities/information from different sources thread or this one Combining two estimates .
