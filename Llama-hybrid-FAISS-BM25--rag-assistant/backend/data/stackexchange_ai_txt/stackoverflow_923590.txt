I don't know of any out-of-the-box solutions for you. But, if the code files are organized into folders according to the wanted structure you could hack together a tool to do it for you, perhaps. The project files are not awfully complex in their structure, they are rather straight-forward XML documents, largely consisting of a list of the files that are included in the project. I would assume that the resulting project files may still require some manual labour, but you should be able to get the code to do the heavy work for you. And you may get a nifty tool to post on your blog.
