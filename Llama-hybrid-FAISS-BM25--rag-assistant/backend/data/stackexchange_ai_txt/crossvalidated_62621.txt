Recall and precision in classification

I read some definitions of recall and precision, though it is every time in the context of information retrieval. I was wondering if someone could explain this a bit more in a classification context and maybe illustrate some examples. Say for example I have a binary classifier which gives me a precision of 60% and a recall of 95%, is this a good classifier ? Maybe to help my goal a bit more, what is the best classifier according to you ? (dataset is imbalanced. Majority class has twice the amount of examples of the minority class) I'd personally say 5 because of the area under the receiver operator curve. (as you can see here model 8 has a low precision, very high recall, but one of the lowest AUC_ROC, does that make it a good model ? or a bad one ?) edit: I have an excel file with more information: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hq7ew5qpztwbo8/comparissoninbalance.xlsx In this document the area under the reciever operator curve can be found and the area under the precision recall curve. Together with the plots.
