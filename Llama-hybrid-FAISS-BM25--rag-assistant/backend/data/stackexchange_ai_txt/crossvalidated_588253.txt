Well, I've done a simulation where I used a simple criterion of saying the coin is biased if the current proportion is >0.55 else the coin is fair (middle between 0.5 and 0.6). Code in R: res=replicate(1e3,{ k=sample(c(0.5,0.6),1) s=sample(0:1,2e3,prob=c(1-k,k),replace=T) tmp=cumsum(s)/seq_along(s) ifelse(ifelse(k==0.6,1,0)==ifelse(tmp>0.55,1,0),1e4,-2e4)-seq_along(tmp) }) and this is what the average reward plot looks like note: i only tried up to 2000 draws as it has already converged somewhat by this time.
