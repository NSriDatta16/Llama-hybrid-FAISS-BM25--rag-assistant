Does Pearson Correlation require gaussian distribution

I see conflicting answers online from different statistic experts on this question. One one hand, stackexchange experts have note that Pearson Correlation does not require normal/gaussian distribution on a 10 years old post On the other hand, Jason Brownleen on his machine learning blog says the opposite : The correlation between two variables that each have a Gaussian distribution can be calculated using standard methods such as the Pearsonâ€™s correlation. This procedure cannot be used for data that does not have a Gaussian distribution. Instead, rank correlation methods must be used. Who is right? how can i check other than see how many more people agree on one versus the other ?
