Although a solution using a context manager (as proposed by others) is the most elegant, and would be what I would recommend too, I'd like to point out that your handle_exception function could be written more elegantly by re-raising the exception: def handle_exception(e): try: raise e except CommonException1: Action_always_taken_for_CommonException1() except CommonException2: Action_always_taken_for_CommonException2() except Exception: Default_action_always_taken()
