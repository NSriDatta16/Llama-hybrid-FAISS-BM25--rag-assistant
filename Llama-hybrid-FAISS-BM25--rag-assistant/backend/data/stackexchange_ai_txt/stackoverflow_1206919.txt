While this works in theory, many Delphi DLLs will use calling conventions like register, don't pack records in standard C ways etc. Then on top there are RTL issues, coprocessor status word issues etc. Probably most C compilers can workaround that by adding some pragma's, but I doubt the whole Java binding stuff will eat that. So unless the DLL is crafted with this in mind, this will probably work more often not than that it will. Reading and parsing the Delphi header is not that hard though. Pascal is easier to parse and transform than e.g. C. FPC (Free Pascal) has a pascal parser package that is used for its documentation tool that might be retargetable
