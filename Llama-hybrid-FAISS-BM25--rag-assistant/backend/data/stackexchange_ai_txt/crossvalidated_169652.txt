If "there is a little relation among variables", how can you reasonably expect R to be able to classify it? That kind of make me think maybe you have wrong expectation about CART. Without knowing your data, a few possibilities: nothing wrong with CART, those two variables indeed are the one that can explain best the predicted variable your tree is not deep enough, if you want to see other variables (but in any case, the top portion of the tree would highlight already the most relevant variables) your data is skewed (e.g. much more of [1] Dist than [2] Rese ) such that the prediction is biased. In any case, this may not even a code issue, and may belong less in Stack Overflow than other fora e.g. Cross-Validate (for stats) or Data Science communities.
