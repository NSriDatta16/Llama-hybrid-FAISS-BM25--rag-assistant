I feel that sometimes you have to make choices based on integrity and not fold to the demands of expediency or just because your under pressure from your boss. That doesn't mean I have an answer to your question, only you have to decide for yourself what is appropriate in this situation, with this customer, in your organization. Ask yourself: How much does your boss really know about what the customer wants? Do you know better than your boss? Is your relationship with the customer stronger? Where is the pressure coming from to do it quickly? Does the customer realize the costs/benefits associated with "quick and dirty"? What kind of orginization do you work in? Would you consider yourself kind of more of a consultant (very close to the customer) than an employee or vice versa? How well thought of is your boss (at your company or by the customer? Similarly how well thought of are you? Is the code truly throw away or if its going to actually be used in the future
