WPF: How to get the event when one FrameworkElement comes in contact with other FrameworkElement

I am developing a small application with images and trash box icon on right hand bottom. I have multiple images floating in the main window, and using mouse I can move image from one corner to other corner of window, left, right, top and bottom. I can't figure out how do I catch an event when a image touches and panel (with trash box image), in the right hand corner. Does anybody knows which event or handler to listen? This is not a drag and drop case since my images are floating so no point using drag and drop. Thank you
