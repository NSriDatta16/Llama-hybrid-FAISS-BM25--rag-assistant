It would seem best to organize by Project at the top level, since you're going to want to checkout an entire branch and have a working copy for the project. If you organize by module, you'll have to do multiple checkouts (one for each module you're using) in order to build your project to a point where it's useable. It could make sense to keep both projects and modules separate, E.g.: Projects Project 1 Project 2 ... Modules Module 1 Module 2 ... If you use that in combination with svn externals and/or vendor branches , you could support different branches for your projects that need different module versions, but still benefit from the having a single module source when projects happen to share the same version of a module.
