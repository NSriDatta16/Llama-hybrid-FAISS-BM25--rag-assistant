Is there a better way to convert from decimal to binary in python?

I need to convert from an integer to a list of size 8 that is the binary representation of that number (number list(bin(my_num)[2:].rjust(8,'0')) int("".join(my_list),2) I did some googling, but had a hard time finding relevant information. I'm just curious if there is a faster, or more standard way to do this. edit: Would using bit masking make it faster. E.g. something like this [(my_num>>y)&1 for y in xrange(7,-1,-1)] Like I mentioned in a comment I am using this for a steganography app I am writing, so I am doing this thousands of times (3 times per pixel in an image), so speed is good.
