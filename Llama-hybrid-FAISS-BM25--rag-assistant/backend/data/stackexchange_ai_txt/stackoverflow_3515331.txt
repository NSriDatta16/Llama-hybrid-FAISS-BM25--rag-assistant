How reliable are mySQL stored procedures?

This not a go/no go question. I've used all kinds of 4GLs (PL/SQL, T-SQL, PGSQL etc.) for database back-end coding and find very useful to establish data layer "closest" to database engine. Now MySQL stored procedures got my attention and very interested in coding in this brand new 4GL platform. I would like to start using it in one of my proof of concept projects. What you folks think about MySQL stored procedures? Crucial question is; Is it reliable? How "Oracle Corporation" supports MySQL stored procedures (i.e. documentation, forums etc.)? Thanks
