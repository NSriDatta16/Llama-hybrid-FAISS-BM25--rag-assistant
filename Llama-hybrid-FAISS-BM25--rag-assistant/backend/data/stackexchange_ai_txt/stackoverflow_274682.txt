I manage to create colors intuitively now (with some trial and error, of course), having practiced them a lot. Playing/using color mixers (with red/green/blue sliders for example) helps in understanding relationships. Now, I know that FFFF00 is yellow, FF00FF is magenta, 00FFFF is cyan, plus of course primary colors, and all others colors are in between.
