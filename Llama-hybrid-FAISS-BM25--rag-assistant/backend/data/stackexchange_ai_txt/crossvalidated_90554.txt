Gaussian Process Kernel and Ridge Regression

Can a Dual Ridge Regression produce the same prediction results as a Gaussian Process with a polynomial kernel $K(x,x')=(x^Tx'+1)^2$ in less time complexity (GP is $O(n^3)$ ) using Cholesky decomposition? If yes what would the complexity of the Ridge Regression be with a kernel that produces the same results? If not would an SVM model be suggested? I want to achieve linear to the number features time complexity.
