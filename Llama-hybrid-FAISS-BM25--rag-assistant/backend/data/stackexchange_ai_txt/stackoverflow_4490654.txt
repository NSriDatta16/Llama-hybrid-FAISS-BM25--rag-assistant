I usually organize my code by functionality. Let's say I've got an extranet project and some code for some intranet webparts, I seperate it out into a Extranet and an Intranet project, and seperate the different classes of code (eventreceivers, timerjobs, webparts, etc.) into different namespace. That way, I can deploy (sub)sets of functionality to different farms if I want to, and when editing code I got everything that depends on one another in the same place :)
