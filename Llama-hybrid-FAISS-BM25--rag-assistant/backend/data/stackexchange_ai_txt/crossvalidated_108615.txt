Citing the reference documentation: The algorithm of Hartigan and Wong (1979) is used by default. [...] The Hartigan–Wong algorithm generally does a better job than either of those, but trying several random starts (nstart> 1) is often recommended. In rare cases, when some of the points (rows of x) are extremely close, the algorithm may not converge in the “Quick-Transfer” stage, signalling a warning (and returning ifault = 4). Slight rounding of the data may be advisable in that case. So at each iteration you get different results as expected. The way to avoid this, is to set the random seed to a fix number, so that the behaviour of the algorithm is deterministic. See set.seed for details.
