Problem setting up Direct X for C++

I've downloaded Direct X SDK from the microsoft website but when I try to compile my code i'm getting this error: Error 1 error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _Direct3DCreate9@4 referenced in function "void __cdecl initD3D(struct HWND__ *)" (?initD3D@@YAXPAUHWND__@@@Z) C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\Tutorial\Tutorial\Tutorial.obj Tutorial I have added Direct X to my C++ build directories like that: $(DXSDK_DIR)include $(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x64 I've googled it and found out that most of the time people were forgetting this line: #pragma comment (lib, "d3dx9.lib") But it's there for me here are my includes and lib: #include #include #include #include #pragma comment (lib, "d3d9.lib") #pragma comment (lib, "d3dx9.lib") Can anyone help me with this? I'm using Visual studio 2010 Professional on win7 x64
