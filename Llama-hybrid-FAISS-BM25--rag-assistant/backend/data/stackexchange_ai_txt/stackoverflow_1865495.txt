A HTTP URL may contain these parts: protocol: http:// domain: localhost path: /test/editformquestions.php query string: ?formid=1 - always starts with a ? fragment: #something - always starts with a # - whatever comes after the # mark is NOT sent to the server. What you have in your first example ( http://localhost/test/editformquestions.php#?formid=1 ) is a fragment containing this: #?formid=1 . It does not matter that there's a ? in the fragment; as soon as it's behind the # , it is not sent from the browser. So, in essence, you are sending to the server only this: http://localhost/test/editformquestions.php - as you can see, there is no formid in that request.
