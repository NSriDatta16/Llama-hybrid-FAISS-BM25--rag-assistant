Connectivity between SQL server and VBA

I am not able to establish connection between SQL server and a VBA form. It's throwing the following error Compiler Error: User-defined type not defined Here's the code with server details: Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim cnn As ADODB.Command Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection Set cnn = New ADODB.Command cnn.Open "Provider=sqloledb;" & _ "Data Source= ;" & _ "Initial Catalog= ;" & _ "User Id= ;" & _ "Password= " MsgBox "connection successful" cnn.Close End Sub
