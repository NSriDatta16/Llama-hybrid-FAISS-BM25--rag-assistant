How to combine continuous variables for logistic regression: ratio and absolute numbers

I am trying to fit a logistic regression and I have variables which are in terms of ratios and in absolute numbers. How should I treat them? Is it okay to treat them equally, or should the absolute numbers be converted to something else? For example: $x_1$ is variable in terms of ratio, $x_2$ is in absolute numbers. Can I use them for LR as they are? Thanks.
