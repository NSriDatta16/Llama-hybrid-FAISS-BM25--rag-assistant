C# datagrid vs DevExpress XtraGrid, speed wise

I have a program that loads 10,000 rows into a datagrid and the datagrid can be slow to render/paint and occassionally doesn't display, you can tell it has loaded with data but the grid goes blank. I was thinking of replacing the datagrid with DevExpress XtraGrid, has anyone used this and can I expect it to render/paint quicker? Thanks PS This is a win form app, there are probably less than 10,000 rows in reality but safe to say a lot. I suspect we need to use paging maybe?
