A dirty secret about neural networks is that they do no classification. Neural networks create predictions on a continuum. It is common to use a classification rule that makes a predicted category of the category with the highest score on a continuum, but this is a second step, distinct from the neural network. In fact, when the outcome in binary, varying this decision rule is how we wind up with ROC and PR curves. With that in mind, this is just a mapping between some feature space and another space, typically $[0, 1]^K$ for $K$ categories, where the predicted values (such as from a softmax function) loosely have an interpretation as the probability of membership in the corresponding category. Assuming some conditions that seem typical to assume, the usual universal approximation theorems apply. If you want to apply decision boundaries from the decision rule of taking the category with the highest prediction, this is the subspace of the feature space that maps to outputs such that the output for some category is higher than the output for the other categories. In math, letting $N_K$ be the neural network output for category $K$ and $\mathcal{X}$ be the feature space, the space of feature values corresponding to category $K$ scoring highest and being predicted as the most likely category is $ \left\{ x\in\mathcal{X}\mid N_K(x) > N_L(x) \space\forall \space L\ne K \right\} $ . This space might not be connected. This space might not be convex. For the MNIST digits, this space $\mathcal{X}$ will be hundreds of dimensions, so instructive examples use feature spaces of two dimensions to allow for visualization, but the math is the same either way. As an example of the MNIST digits to give the space corresponding to a classification of the digit as seven: $$ \left\{ x\in\left\{[0, 255]\cap\mathbb Z\right\}^{784}\mid N_7(x) > N_L(x) \space\forall \space L\ne 7 \right\} $$ This is the space of $784$ -vectors with integer components between zero and $255$ such that the neural network output value predicted for category seven is greater than the neural network output value predicted for any of the other categories. (This "classification" would be according to the classification rule that assigns a category according to the category predicted with the highest value. While there are other possible classification rules, this is so common for problems like MNIST digit recognition that I am comfortable using such language.)
