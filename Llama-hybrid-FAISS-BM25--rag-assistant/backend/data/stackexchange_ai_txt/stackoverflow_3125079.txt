While this is perfectly acceptable, (its typically how I do it) unless there are more than one chars in a row, alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway, which could otherwise have been used for free by an int. I encourage you to investigate alignment, its rather straightforward but a little to verbose to explain + consequences here. At any rate, in order to avoid confusion (although I doubt there will be very much, but basically to each their own) you may want to use int8_t or which is typedef-ed to signed char anyway. EDIT: Something I forgot before: the malloc implementation on MacOS (also the basis of iOS) only returns chunks of memory 16 bytes or longer, rounding up. So If you're object takes, say 15 bytes, you're also wasting a byte, and if it takes 17 bytes, you're wasting 15.
