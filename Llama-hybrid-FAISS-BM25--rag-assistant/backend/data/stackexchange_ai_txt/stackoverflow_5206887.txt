You can have a look at keychain which takes care of starting ssh-agents as needed. From the rpm package description: Keychain is a manager for OpenSSH, ssh.com, Sun SSH and GnuPG agents. It acts as a front-end to the agents, allowing you to easily have one long-running agent process per system, rather than per login session. This dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your passphrase from once per new login session to once every time your local machine is rebooted.
