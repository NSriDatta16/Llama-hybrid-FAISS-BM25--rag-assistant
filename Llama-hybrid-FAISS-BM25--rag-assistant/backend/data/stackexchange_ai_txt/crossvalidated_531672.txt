The simplest way of likening logistic regression to standard linear regression is using the latent variable interpretation . The logistic regression model can be described by considering the observable responses: $$Y_i = \mathbb{I}(Y_i^* > 0),$$ based on the unobservable latent variables: $$Y_i^* = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \cdots + \beta_m x_{i,m} + \varepsilon_i \quad \quad \quad \varepsilon_1, ... \varepsilon_n \sim \text{IID Logistic}(0, s).$$ As you can see, in this model form the latent response variable follows a linear regression model with an error term that has a logistic distribution . We observe whether the latent response variable is above zero or not, but we do not observe its actual value. For estimation purposes, this manifests in a substantial difference in estimating the coefficients in the model. We do not estimate using OLS estimation, so this is not "just like multiple linear regression". Nevertheless, we do indeed get estimated coefficients and this does get us an estimated function for the conditional probability of the response outcome, so there are certainly similarities.
