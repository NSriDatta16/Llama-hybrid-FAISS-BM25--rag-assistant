The case for offline web applications

With many browsers adding proper local storage support (and with this whole HTML5 buzz), there is a lot of talk about offline web apps competing with desktop software. But, as a matter of fact - one quick "clear private data" on your browser (which a lot of people do) - clears all the local storage data. I'm now thinking that local storage in browsers can at best be used to cache data temporarily before being sync-ed with the web server, but truly offline web applications can't rely on HTML5's local storage permanently due to the problem I outlined above. Is there a scope for offline web applications that actually depend on data extensively?
