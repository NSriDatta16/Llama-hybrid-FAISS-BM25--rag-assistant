It depends on how you configure your model and the layers you're using. You can add other layer's of DNN and experiment with those. You should also consider using LSTM (Long short-term memory), since the past information do not get decayed quickly like in RNN, and you keep the present values, thus having a better model based on RNN. You can also you a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), which improve the learning process by using a cell state that runs through all your past data and generalize well for sentiment analysis. Keep in mind that RNN cannot detect negation in sentences, like saying "This movie was not good", usually ANN need more configuration to understand those kind of aspects. Another trick is to add a CNN layer to your model, so it can extract key words, thus when your data is forwarded to the RNN based layers, it will less noisy and more oriented to specific keywords.
