Not strictly Bayesian Statistics as such, but I can strongly recommend "A First Course on Machine Learning" by Rogers and Girolami, which is essentially an introduction to Bayesian approaches to machine learning. Its very well structured and clear and aimed at students without a strong mathematical background. This means it is a pretty good first introduction to Bayesian ideas. There is also MATLAB/OCTAVE code which is a nice feature.
