Best way to describe changes in performance through time.

I'm wondering how to explain changes in production/performance metrics quarter to quarter. In the example below, one can see that the average processing time for "widgets" has decreased substantially over two years. However, the last two quarters show a processing increase of 17%. Given the long term trend, this really isn't significant. What statistics would be best used in describing this?
