What's the reason for needing to store the files in the database, instead of just storing the path of the document on a file server or CDN? Would be a lot less load on your DB server, and give you more flexible options for document storage. If you're having issues with moved/deleted files in a system like the one I suggested, then perhaps also consider other options, such as: Locking permissions on the underlying file system to everyone except the role the application is running under (easiest option) Running a background service which listens for changes to folders etc and updates the database accordingly In the end, a database-only solution may be simpler, but I wouldn't underestimate the load you may hit upon by storing large files for tens of thousands of users.
