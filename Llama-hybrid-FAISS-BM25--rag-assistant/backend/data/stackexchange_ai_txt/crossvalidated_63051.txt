I'll bundle together some extra comments as another answer. It's taken a while for the structure of this project to become clearer. Given that influenza is now revealed as one covariate among several, quite what you do it with doesn't seem so crucial, or at least not to merit the scepticism expressed in some of my earlier comments. As everything else is on a daily basis, reducing everything else to weeks would throw away too much detail. The original focus of the question remains, on interpolation that preserves the weekly mean to which one (extreme) answer is that the weekly mean preserves the weekly mean. As that unsurprisingly seems unattractive or unrealistic, other interpolation methods seem more attractive and/or imputation methods as proposed by @Spacedman. (Quite whether that would be imputation with a temporal flavour or interpolation with added stochastic flavour I am not clear.) Two further specific thoughts: Taking the weekly values (divided by the number of days) and then smoothing with weighted averages would be likely in practice to preserve the mean to a good approximation. As the influenza cases are counts, smoothing the root or log counts and then back-transforming might work better than just smoothing the counts.
