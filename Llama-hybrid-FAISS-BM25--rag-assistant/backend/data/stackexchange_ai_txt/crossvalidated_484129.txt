You can used a paired t-tests on the individual users. Taking multiple measurements that vary in number, before and after a "treatment" (or equivalent) is common. Create a data set which has one entry for the average of User X under A, and one entry for the average of User X under B. Run a paired t-test on the two columns. Subject Average Miles Average Miles Group A Group B User 1 5.5 6.0 User 2 11.0 11.33 ... This gives you what you want. Make sure the other assumptions of a paired t-test are satisfied (other than that the data is paired). There are factors that can affect the results. What if it is considerably hotter on all the B days? That gets into study design.
