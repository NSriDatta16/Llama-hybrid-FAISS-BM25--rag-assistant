The Holt-Winters would not be applicable where those advanced and more complex proposals for multiple seasonalities would. There is, however, bigger room for errors by academic developers and misuses by practitioners with more complex methods. It is because of these potential problems simpler stuff, where it is applicable, may work better more often (and for more people). As to the performance of simpler methods , I would like quote O.D. Anderson "One would not train a modern soldier to use a net and trident, but some gladiators did very well with them!"â€”it's not about methods only, but also about who uses them and more importantly how. In reality, advanced methods may perform only as well as their practitioners. As to forecasting competitions mentioned in another answer , I'd like to quote O.D. Anderson again "A major point missed here is that the success of a methodology is highly dependent on the person applying it. Thus, if Mr Merit does a better job forecasting with method 'A' than Dr Dud using 'B', this tells us little. Moreover if, instead, Professor Passable employing both 'A' and 'B' finds that (for him) the former performs superiorly, it may well be difficult to discount the fact that it is just 'A' plus Passable which has outpointed the other combination, for the specific situation under investigation." Note the use of "for him" and "for the specific situation under investigation" to delineate the extent to which forecasting competitions are most useful. Anderson, O. D., A Commentary on 'A Survey of Time Series' International Statistical Review, 1977, 45, 273-297 (this is a critique of Spyros Makridakis (1976) that some may find interesting).
