Nginx + Passenger - Uncaught exception in PassengerServer client thread

I've installed Passenger with Nginx for testing here and I keep getting this error after some thousand requests: [ pid=57259 thr=0x40f07780 file=ext/nginx/HelperAgent.cpp:576 time=2010-12-15 14:04:25.876 ]: Uncaught exception in PassengerServer client thread: exception: write() failed: Socket is not connected (57) backtrace: in 'void Client::forwardResponse(Passenger::SessionPtr&, Passenger::FileDescriptor&)' (HelperAgent.cpp:368) in 'void Client::handleRequest(Passenger::FileDescriptor&)' (HelperAgent.cpp:502) in 'void Client::threadMain()' (HelperAgent.cpp:595) [ pid=57259 thr=0x40f07080 file=ext/nginx/HelperAgent.cpp:566 time=2010-12-15 14:04:26.416 ]: Couldn't forward the HTTP response back to the HTTP client: It seems the user clicked on the 'Stop' button in his browser. I have 2 servers, and I was running haproxy+apache+mongrel on them, I switched one of them for haproxy+nginx+passenger (haproxy is only a backup for my testing, so I can redirect to the old schema quickly in case of fire). So I noticed that my passenger dies after this message. Im using ruby-ee 1.8.7, rails 2.3.5 and FreeBSD.
