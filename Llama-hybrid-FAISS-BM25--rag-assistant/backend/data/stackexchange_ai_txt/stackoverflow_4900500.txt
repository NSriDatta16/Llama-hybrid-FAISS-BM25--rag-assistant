Integrate nodejs with ruby for payment processing

I'm building a new website from scratch (no legacy code) that is basically a blog/wiki/forum/ecommerce kind of thing, but I have a lot of custom things I want, and I'm willing to put in the effort to build them when I have to. I'm not really satisfied with the shopping carts out there, I don't want to use php, and I think there are a lot of great new technologies I'd like to use with my eye on the future. Specifically, I'd like to use Node.js and MongoDB. My big sticking point that is holding me back right now is payment processing. I know that there is a library for node.js to do payment processing, but I'm too worried about its stability right now. I'm willing to deal with some possible bugs/stability serving up a blog post, but I do not want to screw around when it comes to credit card data, etc. My current thinking is that my best compromise right now is to maybe leverage Ruby's Active Merchant to do just the payment processing. My question is: what is the best way to perform this integration, and does it even seem like a good idea? Do I need to set up a whole web server with rails hidden behind node or another proxy, or is there something simpler to just accomplish the payment processing?
