For text only, a textbox would probably do the trick. If you definitely need rectangles, you could construct several drawing objects: filled-in Rectangles for the coloured rectangles, textboxes for the descriptions and a Rectangle with a white background to act as a frame for the legend. Once drawn, you could Group them which would turn them into a single object from the users' POV. Here's a edited example from MSDN I've converted to C# and tested: Excel.Worksheet ex = (Excel.Worksheet)Application.ActiveSheet; ex.Shapes.AddShape(Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoAutoShapeType.msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 10, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpOne"; ex.Shapes.AddShape(Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoAutoShapeType.msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 150, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpTwo"; ex.Shapes.AddShape(Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoAutoShapeType.msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, 300, 10, 100, 100).Name = "shpThree"; object[] shapeArray = {"shpOne", "shpTwo", "shpThree"}; Excel.ShapeRange rng = ex.Shapes.get_Range(shapeArray); Excel.Shape grp = rng.Group(); This creates three triangles that are linked together - the user would drag them around as if a single object.
