How to interpret loadings and eigenvectors in PCA

I have a question about loading vectors and Eigen vectors. For the purposes of this discussion, a loading vector is an Eigen vector multiplied by the square root of the Eigen value. If the data is standardized (centered and divided by the standard deviation), is it correct to interpret the resulting loading vector coefficients as the correlation between the variables related to the loading vector coefficients and the loading vector in which the coefficients reside. If the data on which PCA analysis is performed is centered but we do not divide by the standard deviation, is it correct to interpret the loading vector coefficients as the covariance between the variables related to the loading vector coefficients and the loading vector in which the coefficients reside. If the data on which PCA analysis is performed is centered and the data is all in the same units (like TFIDF data for example), is it correct to interpret the resulting loading vector coefficients as the correlation between the variables related to the loading vector coefficients and the loading vector in which the coefficients reside. In any of the above cases, if we compute Eigen vectors instead of loading vectors, is it correct to interpret the Eigen vectors as containing the cosines of orthogonal transformation (rotation) of variables into principal components.
