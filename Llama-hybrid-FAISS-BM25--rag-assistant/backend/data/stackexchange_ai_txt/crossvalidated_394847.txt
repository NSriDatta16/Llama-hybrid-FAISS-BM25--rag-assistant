Making predictions in Logistic regression in R

Can anyone please let me know, what does a logistic regression model predict? For example, there are 2 variables. This may not be very appropriate example but it will clarify my question as follows: Survived: Yes/No (binary variable) Age (continuous variable) While building the model in R, as far as I am aware, we never specify what is a success or failure (p and 1-p) . Final model looks like log (p/1-p) = a+bx , but I never defined what would be p (success). The p or success for me, may be Yes or it may be No. So when the model is generated what will it predict, Yes or No
