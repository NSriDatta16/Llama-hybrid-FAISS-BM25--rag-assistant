One of the assumptions of the linear regression is homoscedasticity (constant variance). In the binomial model, the variance obviously depends on $p_i$ , which is the variable you're trying to model. As long as your curve is reasonably flat, or, in other words, the $p_i$ 's don't vary too much, this will probably not be an issue. But still, if I were to review your results, I'd probably ask why you hadn't used logistic regression. What are the benefits of using a model which you know is less suited than another?
