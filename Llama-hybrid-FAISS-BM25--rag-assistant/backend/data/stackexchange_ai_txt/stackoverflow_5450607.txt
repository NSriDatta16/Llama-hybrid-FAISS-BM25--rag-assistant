XML C++ library for simple messages

I need a XML library for constructing simple XML messages. I come from a Java background. I've found some suggestions pointing at Xerces-C++ XML library as it was transferred. Other suggested libraries have their advantages in memory in speed, but all of this is none of my needs. I need an API which supports an easy construction. Furthermore I would like to ask when sending XML via sockets, do I have to pay attention on serialization or can I send plain xml texts? Overall the focus is on building xml and none parsing at all.
