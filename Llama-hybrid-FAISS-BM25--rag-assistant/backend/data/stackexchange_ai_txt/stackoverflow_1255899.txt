An array is a pointer The differences between the * (dereferencing) and & (addressof) operators and when to use both And emphasize that the best (and really only) real place for C these days is in embedded systems and real-time apps where resources are scarce and run-time is a factor. I didn't really appreciate C as a language until I took my embedded microprocessors systems class and we implemented the hardware via a reading through the programmer's guide in the manual for the Motorolla Dragonball board. Consequently, if it's at all possible (which may be hard, as you'll need to get cheap hardware) try to have them work on projects similar (implementing UART and interrupt vector tables, etc)... Because although stuff like string processing, sorting, etc are toy classical school problems, they really aren't as useful anymore, and frustrate students who know there are easier ways. It's much more rewarding to & a byte with a bit-mask and watch an LED light up. Oh, and I never learned about how to use stuff like gcc in school, or what was actually going on with makefiles. Pragmatic Programmers say that's a good thing to know.
