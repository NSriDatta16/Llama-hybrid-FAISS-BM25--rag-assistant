mapkit and annotations

I am very new to XCode and iPhone development so please bear with me if this question is too simple. But I have a map and I have successfully added images (not pins) to it for my annotations. And I can change the image when the user selects one of the annotations. I created a class that inherits from MKAnnotationView with the following methods:- - (id)initWithAnnotation: - (void)setAnnotation: - (void)drawRect: and I am using - (void)touchesBegan to know when an annotation has been selected. And in touchesBegan I am doing :- UIImage *i = [UIImage imageNamed:@"A.png"]; self.image = i; to change the image. But what I am really stumped on is how do I change the image back to it's original image when the users selects the next annotation. I have tried:- NSArray *selectedAnnotations = map.selectedAnnotations; for(id annotationView in selectedAnnotations) { [map deselectAnnotation:[annotationView annotation] animated:NO]; } but it errors and I tried for (MKAnnotationView *ann in map.selectedAnnotations){ if ([ann isMemberOfClass:[Place class]]) { place = (Place *)ann; NSLog(@"second = %@"@" %f"@" %f", place.title, place.longitude, place.latitude); if (currentPlaceID == place.placeID) { //UIImage *i = [UIImage imageNamed:@"A.png"]; //ann.image = i; } else { UIImage *i = [UIImage imageNamed:@"pin.png"]; ann.image = i; } } } the above code works ok until I get to ann.image = i; then it errors. The errors I get are:- *** -[Place setImage:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4514370 *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[Place setImage:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4514370' Yes I can see that my place object does not have an image so that's why it is going wrong. But if I create an image property on my place object - how will that change the annotations image which what I am trying to do. Please advise as I have been going around in circles on this one for 2 days now!!!! Thanks in advance Cheryl
