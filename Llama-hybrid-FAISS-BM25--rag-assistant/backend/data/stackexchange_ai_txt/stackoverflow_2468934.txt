There are a whole bunch of UI issues here that should be addressed. In general, Drag and drop on the iPhone is a BAD idea. It's very hard to do, and getting feedback is going to be problematic, because your finger will be obstructing the drag operation using the table's selected cell to indicate 'dropability' may get you rejected by the app store reviewers; it's to indicate "I've selected this cell", not "I'll drop something onto it" That said, you'll probably want to manage all your touch events in the 'source' view, and send the table messages from there, rather than trying to juggle messages around. Once your -touchesBegan:withEvent: has been called in one view, all subsequent -touchesMoved:withEvent: and -touchesEnded:withEvent: will be sent to that view for the life-cycle of that touch; forwarding them around will confuse the heck out of everyone involved.
