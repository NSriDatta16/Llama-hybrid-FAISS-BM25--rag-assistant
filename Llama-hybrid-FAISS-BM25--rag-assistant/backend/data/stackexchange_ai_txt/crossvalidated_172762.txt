You explained variance plot tells me that PCA is pointless here. 11/18 is 61%, so you need 61% of your variables to explain 85% of variance. That's not the case for PCA, in my opinion. I use PCA when 3-5 factors of 18 explain 95% or so of the variance. UPDATE: Look at the plot of cumulative percent of variance explained by the number of PCs. This is from interest rate term structure modeling field. You see how 3 components explain more than 99% of total variance. This may look like a made up example for PCA advertising :) However, this is a real thing. Interest rate tenors are that much correlated, that's why PCA is very natural in this application. Instead of dealing with a couple of dozens of tenors, you deal with just 3 components.
