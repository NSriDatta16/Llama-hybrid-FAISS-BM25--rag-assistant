JavaFX embed panel into scene with scene's background

Although it is hard to explain, I am writting to find a solution. I added a panel to scene which has a background image. But also, I want that panel to grab the part of background picture where it is placed. When I move that panel on runtime, it should move with its background picture part (like selecting part of a picture and dragging in paint). Is it possible? Thanks in advance (I am sorry for my bad english)
