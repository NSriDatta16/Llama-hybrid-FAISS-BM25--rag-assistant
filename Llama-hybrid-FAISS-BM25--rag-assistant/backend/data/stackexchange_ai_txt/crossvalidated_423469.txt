How to measure the "Impact/influence" of a feature y on Logistic regression model based on the coefficients?

I have a dataset X which contains probabilities returned for classification 4 different classification models, say M1, M2, M3, M4 those probabilities are use to feed a fourth model M4 and that model also returns probabilities between (0, 1) The 4 models above try to measure the probability of a customer to fall in default, and each of them measure different characteristics of customers. So mi table X looks like: M1 | M2| M3| M4 | y .5 | .7|.3 | .6 | 1 .3 | .6|.2 | .7 | 0 .7 | .1|.2 | .1 | 1 .1 | .2|.4 | .1 | 0 .6 | .7|.1 | .6 | 1 .2 | .9| 0 | .5 | 0 I have another binary variable y for which I want to measure the impact of every model on y so I want to find a measure of impact /influence of each model on this variable y What I tried so far was to run a logistic regresion on X to explain y say I obtaine the coeffients: Intercept : -3.74587192 b1 : 4.647923 b2 : -0.354599 b3 : 2.984094 b4 : 8.983295 Q1: Haw can I find a measure of influence on y based on the Logistic regression coefficients? Q2: Is it possible to establish a relationship of relative importance of each feature based on the coefficients?
