Concurrency in django admin change view

My model: class Order(models.Model): property_a = models.CharField() property_b = models.CharField() property_c = models.CharField() Many users will access a given record in a short time frame via admin change page, so I am having concurrency issues: User 1 and 2 open the change page at the same time. Assume all values are blank when they load the page. User 1 sets property_a to "a", and property_b to "b", then saves. A second later if user 2 changes property b and c then saves, it will quietly overwrite all the values from user 1. in this case, property_a will go back to being blank and b and c will be whatever user 2 put in. I need recommendations on how to handle this. If I have to have a version field in the model, how do i pass it to the admin, where do I do the check so I can elegantly notify the user their changes can't be saved because another user has modified the record? Is there a more seamless way than just returning an error to the user?
