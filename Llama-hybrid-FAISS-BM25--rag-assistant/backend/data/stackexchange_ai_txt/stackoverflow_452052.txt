Firstly, sack your host, get off shared hosting into an environment you have full control over and stand a chance of being able to tune decently. Replicate that environment in your lab, ideally with the same hardware as production; this includes things like RAID controller. Did I mention that you need a RAID controller. Yes you do. You can't achieve decent write performance without one - which needs a battery backed cache. If you don't have one, each write needs to physically hit the disc which is ruinous for performance. Anyway, back to read performance, once you've got the machine with the same spec RAID controller (and same discs, obviously) as production in your lab, you can try to tune stuff up. More RAM is usually the cheapest way of achieving better performance - make sure that you've got MySQL configured to use it - which means tuning storage-engine specific parameters. I am assuming here that you have at least 100G of data; if not, just buy enough ram that your entire DB fits in ram then read performance is essentially solved. Software changes that others have mentioned such as optimising queries and adding indexes are helpful too, but only once you've got a development hardware environment that enables you to usefully do performance work - i.e. measure performance of your application meaningfully - which means real hardware (not VMs), which is consistent with the hardware environment used in production. Oh yes - one more thing - don't even THINK about deploying a database server on a 32-bit OS, it's a ruinous waste of good ram.
