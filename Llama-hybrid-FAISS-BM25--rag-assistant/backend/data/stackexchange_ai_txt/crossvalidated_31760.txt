First of all, this is not a problem to pin on frequentist testing. The problem lies in the null hypothesis that the means are exactly equal. Therefore if the populations differ in means by any small amount and the sample size is large enough the chance to reject this null hypothesis is very high. Therefore the p-value for your test turned out to be very small. The culprit is the choice of the null hypothesis. Pick d>0 and take the null hypothesis to be that the means differ by less than d in absolute value. You pick d so that the real difference has to be satisfactorily large to reject. Your problem goes away. Bayesian testing does not solve your problem if you insist on a null hypothesis of exact equality of means.
