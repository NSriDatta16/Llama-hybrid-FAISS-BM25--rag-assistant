Django - converting URL into links, images, objects

I'm creating simple comment-like application and need to convert normal urls into links, image links into images and yt/vimeo/etc. links into flash objects. E.g.: http://foo.bar to http://foo.bar http://foo.bar/image.gif to etc. Of course i can write all of that by myself, but i think it's such obvious piece of code that somebody has already wrote it (maybe even with splitting text into paragraphs). I was googling for some time but couldn't find anything complex, just few snippets. Does filter (or something like that) exist? Thanks! PS. There is urlize but it works only for the first case.
