I realize it's been a while since you've post this, but fwiw, it work's for me fine with CMake 2.6 or 2.7 (trunk) versions, generating for Eclipse/Ganymede. What I do is first run cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" /path/to/src which generates the Eclipse project files as well as the makefiles, then "Import Project" in Eclipse. Works beautifully... sly
