You could also try the triangular distribution. To fit this, you basically specify a lower bound (this would be X=2), an upper bound (this would be X=8), and a "most likely" value. The wikepedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution has more info on this distribution. If there is not much faith in the "most likely" value (as it appears to be, prior to observing any data), it may be a good idea to place a non-informative prior distribution on it, and then use the two data points to estimate this value. One good one is the jeffrey's prior, which for this problem would be p(c) = 1/(pi*sqrt((c-2)*(c-8))), where "c" is the "most likely value" (consistent with the wikipedia notation). Given this prior, you can work out the posterior distribution of c analytically, or via simulation. The analytic form of the likelihood is not particularly nice, so simulation seems to be more attractive. This example is particularly well suited to rejection sampling (see wiki page for a general description of rejection sampling), because the maximised likelihood is 1/3^n regardless of the value of c, which provides the "upper bound". So you generate a "candidate" from the jeffrey's prior (call it c_i), and then evaluate the likelihood at this candidate L(x1,..,xn|c_i), and divide by the maximised likelihood, to give (3^n)*L(x1,..,xn|c_i). You then generate a U(0,1) random variable, and if u is less than (3^n)*L(x1,..,xn|c_i), then accept c_i as a posterior sampled value, otherwise throw away c_i and start again. Repeat this process until you have enough accepted samples (100, 500, 1,000, or more depending on how accurate you want). Then just take the sample average of whatever function of c you are interested in (the likelihood of a new observation is an obvious candidate for your application). An alternative to accept-reject is to use the value of the likelihood as a weight (and don't generate the u), and then proceed with taking weighted averages using all candidates, rather than un-weighted averages with the accepted candidates
