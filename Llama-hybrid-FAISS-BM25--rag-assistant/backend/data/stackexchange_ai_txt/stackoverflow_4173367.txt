TabStop/TabIndex behaves erratically within TableLayoutPanel

I've got a rather complex TableLayoutPanel with close to 40 controls on it. Some are read-only, and some don't need user attention unless in very special cases (which can then be accessed with mouse). So I'd like to set TabStop=false to those controls, and arrange the rest in top-down left-to-right order. However for any control inside the TableLayoutPanel I cannot change the TabStop property. That is, I can, but it gets reset to False upon the next rebuild. Consequently all controls can be reached by the TAB key, even the ones I don't want to be reachable. What is going on here? Environment: Windows 7 Enterprise; VS2008; .NET 3.5 SP1; All controls are placed directly on the TableLayouPanel , there are no intermediary containers. Added more info: Robert Kerr reports that he is unable to reproduce. I forgot to mention that I used exclusively Telerik Winforms RadControls on the TableLayoutPanel. It also seems that buttons/checkboxes work fine, while textboxes, comboboxes and spinedits do not.
