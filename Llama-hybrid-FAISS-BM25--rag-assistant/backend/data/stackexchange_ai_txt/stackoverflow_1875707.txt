You can use these technologies, but you need to be smart about it, and you can't just generalize that any given technology sandbags accessibility. If you're developing for a web site, #1 tool you need is the Firefox Developer Toolbar add-on. In the Tools menu, there is a selection called "Validate Section 508" (which is a set of guidelines for accessibility). This is a quick n dirty way to get a laundry list of "what's broken" on your site, pertaining to accessibility. Beyond that, there are plenty of resources on the web with specific advice on how to design for accessibility. It's almost a fully robust sub-discipline on it's own. Most of it has to do with providing well-formed HTML. (appropriate and useful alt text for images, designing with colors that provide adequate contrast, accommodating colorblindness, use of table descriptions, make the the site navigable by keyboard (no mouse), correct descriptions on form fields, etc.) Now; drink deeply, from the Firehose of Knowledge. . . .
