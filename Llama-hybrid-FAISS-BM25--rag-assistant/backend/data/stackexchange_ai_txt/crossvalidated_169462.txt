The definition and the role of cliques in Markov random fields

I'm freshing up on machine learning (specifically image analysis) and of course looked into Markov random fields. I really cannot wrap my head around the concept of cliques and their application in MRFs. The definition of a clique is, to my knowledge from graph theory, that every vertex in a clique is adjacent to every other vertex. However, I have no idea how this concept of cliques relates to the concept of neighbourhoods in MRFs and the Markov properties. Could someone explain to me the concept / definition / role of cliques in MRFs?
