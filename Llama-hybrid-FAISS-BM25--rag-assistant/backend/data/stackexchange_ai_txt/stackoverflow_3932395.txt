In my experience, the speed with which you can get something up and running in Groovy far outweighs any slowdown caused by its dynamic nature... And in the rare instances it is severely impacting your application, you can always drop out the Groovy code, and write a Java class which adheres to the same Interface, and should plug straight in... Hmmm...not really an answer this. I guess you could see it more as words of encouragement from the touch line ;-)
