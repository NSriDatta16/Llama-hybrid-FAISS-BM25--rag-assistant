If your data has a time component you shouldn't do randomized train-test split in the first place. Neither should you shuffle - if your data has temporal nature, you'll distort it by shuffling. Why is that? When you do this, you'll get points at time $t$ that are in the test set and some points $t'$ for $t' > t$ that are in train set. That makes model to use information from the future (but you don't want it right? You most likely want to predict the future). What you should use instead is TimeSeriesSplit . Other than that, try googling 'Python time series crossvalidation', there are lots of blog articles that describe it in details.
