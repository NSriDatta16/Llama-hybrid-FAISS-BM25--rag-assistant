Some important points I can bring up are: AI/ML learn (stable) patterns from what they are given. But, if forced, they will find (irrelevant) patterns even in noise . Cannot learn what they did not see . So, generalisation is actually possible only for variations (allowed by the underlying architecture) of what were already seen. AI/ML may discriminate and not be fair , where fairness is required (this can happen for various reasons). It is not always interpretable , so one cannot know why one gets this or that result. More importantly one cannot verify (in a straightforward manner at least, before the fact) if any of the previous issues happens.
