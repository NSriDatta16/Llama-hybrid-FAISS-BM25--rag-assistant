A possible way is to exeucte so called "Equinox transformer hooks", see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_Transforms You can checkout the bundles with some examples (see the wiki-page for more infos), I made good experiences with the XSLT transformer, to manipulate certain plugin.xml files before they're contributing their extensions to the platform (the only challenge is to find out which bundle is contributing the annoying context-menu entry, but you can use PluginSpy to determinate the "evildoer" :-P.
