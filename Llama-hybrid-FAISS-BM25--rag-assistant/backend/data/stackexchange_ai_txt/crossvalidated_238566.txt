This approximate lognormality of sums of lognormals is a well-known rule of thumb; it's mentioned in numerous papers -- and in a number of posts on site. A lognormal approximation for a sum of lognormals by matching the first two moments is sometimes called a Fenton-Wilkinson approximation. You may find this document by Dufresne useful (available here , or here ). I have also in the past sometimes pointed people to Mitchell's paper Mitchell, R.L. (1968), "Permanence of the log-normal distribution." J. Optical Society of America . 58: 1267-1272. But that's now covered in the references of Dufresne. But while it approximately holds in a fairly wide set of not-too-skew cases, it doesn't hold in general, not even for i.i.d. lognormals, not even as $n$ gets quite large, even for fairly generous interpretations of "approximate". Here's a histogram of 1000 simulated values, each the log of the sum of fifty-thousand i.i.d lognormals: As you see ... the log is quite skew, so the sum is not very close to lognormal. Indeed, this example would also count as a useful example for people thinking (because of the central limit theorem) that some $n$ in the hundreds or thousands will give very close to normal averages; this one is so skew that its log is considerably right skew, but the central limit theorem nevertheless applies here; an $n$ of many millions* would be necessary before it begins to look anywhere near symmetric. * I have not tried to figure out how many but, because of the way that skewness of sums (equivalently, averages) behaves, a few million will clearly be insufficient Since more details were requested in comments, you can get a similar-looking result to the example with the following code, which produces 1000 replicates of the sum of 50,000 lognormal random variables with scale parameter $\mu=0$ and shape parameter $\sigma=4$ : res (I have since tried $n=10^6$ . Its log is still heavily right skew)
