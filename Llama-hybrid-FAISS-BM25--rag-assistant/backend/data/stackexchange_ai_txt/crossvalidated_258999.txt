Meaning of Standard Deviation when scales vary

On crowd sourcing sites like mechanical turk, we may ask people to rate two models in the scale of, say 1 to 5. Obviously, some people will give 5 for the good one and 1 for the bad one, while some may give 3 and 2, etc. In other words, each person has their own scale within the specified range. As such, standard deviation turns out to be large. Let's say we ended up with ratings for two models, collected from 5000 people where each people rated both models. We have average 3.35 with std 1.0 for model A, and average 3.17 with std 1.08 for model B. Since the ratings for A and B significantly overlap when applying avg+/-std for the models, I am not sure whether A's superiority is statistically significant. So my question is, could such results as described above be considered significant despite large std? If so, should other metrics like p-value be introduced to make the significance more clear? ===========edit====== I am now grouping the results into three cases, where A was rated better than B, equal to B, or worse than B. How would the situation change?
