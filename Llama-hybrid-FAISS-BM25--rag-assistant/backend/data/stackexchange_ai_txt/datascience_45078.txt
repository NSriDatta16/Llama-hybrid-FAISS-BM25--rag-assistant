To add on to @Tasos, if you have passengers who have taken multiple flights you can also calculate the lag between flights / bookings, the number of flights taken in total, the number of flights taken within a time period, etc. You could then also layer means, medians, and standard deviations onto these features. An important consideration when feature engineering date variables is the "distance" between encodings. As an example, you might encode Sunday == 7 and Monday == 1 . By most metrics, the "distance" between these two encodings would be quite large, even though we know in reality that there isn't that much difference between them. (Similar examples include December == 12 and January == 1 ; last week of year 1 == 52 and first week of year 2 == 1 ). A neat solution to this is to use cyclical transformations like sin and cos , adjusting appropriately for periodicity.
