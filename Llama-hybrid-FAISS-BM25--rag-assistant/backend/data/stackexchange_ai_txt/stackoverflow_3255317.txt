Well if you are using PHP to pull the videos out of a database and populate an XML with all the video, in that same PHP script you can just count the number of videos and add that to your XML. Something like this would work: ... where "count" is total number of videos in the XML, then just retrieve that value in your even handler and store it in a class variable. Or else, considering you are doing a loop on each video in you for each in the videoRetrieval_resultHandler handler, you can get the video count there too.
