Real-world use of Mercurial with a Team Foundation Server?

My shop uses TFS & is generally happy with it with the exception of the lack of local repository commits/reverts. I'm starting to use Mercurial locally myself to help manage smaller chunks of changes, then posting them to TFS. I see that Subversion has a 'bridge' component to automagically enable this if the central VCS is Subversion. I have not found one for Team System. This encourages me that other folks have gone down this path with integrating DVCS with CVCS systems. (1) Does anyone know of one? I'm sort of doubting it (quick search didn't find anything). (2) Is anyone using Mercurial/TFS in this manner? If so, can you share your experiences. I'm particularly looking for any insights into what issues might come up that aren't obvious regarding commits to TFS after significant activity via Mercurial. It seems like a total win-win so far with just me using if for a few days--but I know enough then to think it's just that easy.
