This is probably because there is no benefit is trying more nuanced architectures anyway. Stock prices are usually incredibly noisy data, neural networks excel when you have data with a complex structure yet not noisy ( e.g. images, text, speech). Stock prices are the opposite, simple structure a lot of noise. I would advise trying to model your data with something more simple, such as ARIMA or exponential smoothing.
