processing negative number in "accounting" format

I have dataset, which negative value is presented with a bracket around the number i.e. (10)==-10 , it is in csv format, how can I process it so that R will interpret the (10) as -10 ? Thank you. UPDATE I know I can work it out by replacing ( as - , remove ) , and use as.numeric afterwards, but is there a more elegant way for this issue?
