KISS -- just use sessions so that you're using an ID that is already automatically created by the server-side scripting language of your choice. That's hard enough to guess. Then, if it's stolen, store the IP address and user-agent of the visitor in the session (making sure never to output that) and only consider the session valid only if the already stored IP address and user agent match that which is found for the remote client. In this scenario, the attacker would have to do the following three things: Steal the victim's cookies Spoof the correct IP address Spoof the correct User Agent It also helps to make sure that the attacker doesn't already know all of the things he/she would have to do in order to correctly take over a victim's session. IE: They may assume just the cookie is needed and then fail... and have to figure out everything else through a very long trial and error. In this way, you gain security through obscurity and through difficulty, depending on the skill of the attacker and his/her existing knowledge of the system.
