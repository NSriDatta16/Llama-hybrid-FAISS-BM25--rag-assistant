I lose my newly inserted row when I cancel the BeforeRowUpdate event

I am using a WinUltraGrid to enter new rows into our database. When a new row is being entered and the user finishes entering the data, I am checking for null values in the BeforeRowUpdate event which occurs when the user leaves that row by clicking the save button or by clicking another row in the grid. If any of the columns are null then I set e.cancel to true to cancel the event after displaying a user friendly message. My problem is that when I return to the grid, my partially entered row is gone and I have to start over. Any ideas on how to keep the partial data in the new row at the top of my grid? I am using VS 2008 and C# .Net. Thanks
