Yes, you could fit a binary classification network for each class, and the resulting models would have much higher combined capacity. However neural networks aren't really limited by model capacity, but rather by the amount of data and need for regularization. Wouldn't it be more efficient to have a NN for each label or class as the convolutional filters learned will be more specific and accurate? The popular Imagenet classification test consisted of 1000 classes. Surely, a 1000 models with a combined 1000 times more filters wouldn't be more efficient by any sense of the word (it would also be prohibitively difficult to train). Since dogs, humans, and many other classes of objects all share at least some common patterns, lines, and shapes within them, it makes more sense to fit just one model. In other words, CNNs are already too good at learning specific features. The challenge we now face is to prevent them from overfitting.
