There's one limit which isn't really of concern here, if the string's over 512 bytes then the dom fragments created by it aren't cached , but it seems you're more concerned with an upper-bound of content in general. In that case, it's really whatever the limit of .innerHTML in the browser is (pretty damn high), though when appending lots of content you may get some extreme lag in older browsers especially.
