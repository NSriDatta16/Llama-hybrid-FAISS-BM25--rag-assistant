Explicit interface implementation limitation

I have a very simple scenario : a " person " can be a " customer " or an " employee " of a company. A " person " can be called by phone with the " Call " method. Depending on which role the " person " plays in the context of the call , e.g. the announcement of a new product or the announcement of a change in organization, we should either use the phone number provided for the " customer " role or the one provided for the " employee " role. Here is a sum-up of the situation : interface IPerson { void Call(); } interface ICustomer : IPerson { } interface IEmployee : IPerson { } class Both : ICustomer, IEmployee { void ICustomer.Call() { // Call to external phone number } void IEmployee.Call() { // Call to internal phone number } } But this code doe not compile and produces the errors : error CS0539: 'ICustomer.Call' in explicit interface declaration is not a member of interface error CS0539: 'IEmployee.Call' in explicit interface declaration is not a member of interface error CS0535: 'Both' does not implement interface member 'IPerson.Call()' Does this scenario has any chance to be implementable in C# in a different way or will I have to find another design ? If so what alternatives do you propose ? Thanks in advance for your help.
