As a woefully incomplete list, I find statistics most frequently correct in 1) physics papers followed by 2) statistical papers and most miserable in 3) medical papers. The reasons for this are straightforward and have to do with the completeness of the requirements imposed upon the prototypical model in each field. In physics papers, equations and applied statistics have to pay attention to balanced units and have the most frequent occurrence of causal relationships, and testing against physical standards. In statistics, 1) units and causality are sometimes ignored, the assumptions are sometimes heuristic, and physical testing is too often ignored, but equality (or inequality), i.e., logic is generally preserved along an inductive path, where the latter cannot correct for unphysical assumptions. In medicine, typically units are ignored, the equations and assumptions are typically heuristic, typically untested and frequently spurious. Naturally, a field like statistical mechanics is more likely to have testable assumptions than, let us say, economics, and, that does not reflect on the talents of the prospective authors in those fields. It is more related to how much of what is being done is actually testable, and how much testing has been done historically in each field.
