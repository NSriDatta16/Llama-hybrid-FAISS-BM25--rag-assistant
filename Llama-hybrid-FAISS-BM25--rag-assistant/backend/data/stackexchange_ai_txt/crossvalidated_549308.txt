Handling "Skip" in random forest and rpart

I have a dataset that contains 30 variables out of which I need to combine 10 variables into 1 variable (interparental conflict). Each of these 10 variables contains about 68% missing data. Out of that, about 50% is "skip" since interparental conflict does not apply to single parents. I want to use this variable (interparental conflict) as a predictor variable for my outcome variable (child GPA) in rpart and randomforest. How do I handle "skip" in this case? I cannot impute it since the question is not applicable to single parents.
