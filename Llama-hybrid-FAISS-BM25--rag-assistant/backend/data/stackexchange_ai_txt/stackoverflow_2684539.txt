How To Create An ASP.NET Designer Host

I have been asked to build an application where I can drag and drop few WebControls onto the WebPage designer surface. So far I have read some articles on .NET Framework Design-Time architecture, like, MSDN Article: Hosting WinForms Designers , Developer Function Article etc. But I can't a find a way to host WebForms designer. The only open source implementation that I could find was Mono Develop ASP.NET Visual Designer . But in mono they have used GTK# & Gecko etc to host the designer. I can't find a way to do the same using WinForms. Please suggest me what should I do. Give me some pointers. Should I go ahead and implement it using GTK# and Gecko? PS: My requirement is not very huge. I need just a way to drag and drop simple web controls and save the page.
