When working with Flash from a webpage or as a desktop app, you are limited to a small security sandbox and you will not be able to make any relevant OS call. I thought that switching to AIR would give the developper more flexibility but it doesn't seem correct either. From " The Pros and Cons of Adobe Air ": AIR apps have file access, clipboard access, support multiple windows, support drag and drop, and can trigger notifications (toast in Windows). If you app needs to interact with the desktop in other ways, the chances are that AIR is not suitable. For example, there is no access to COM automation, and no way to execute external applications. The reason is to maintain cross-platform compatibility. That's a worthy goal, but it would be good to have a way out of the sandbox. Unlike Java or .NET, you cannot extend AIR with custom native code libraries. Nor can you call operating system APIs. As Alex Jillard commented, if your swf is called inside a C# desktop application, you should be able to access more OS funcionalities although I'm not sure how.
