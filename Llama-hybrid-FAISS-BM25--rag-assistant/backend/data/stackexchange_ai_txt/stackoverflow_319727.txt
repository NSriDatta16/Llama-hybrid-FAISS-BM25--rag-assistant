Non-web Javascript frameworks

Are there any good JavaScript frameworks out there which primary audience is not web programming? Especially frameworks/libraries which improves the object orientation? The framework should be usable within an desktop application embedding a JavaScript engine (such as Spidermonkey or JavaScriptCore), so no external dependency are allowed.
