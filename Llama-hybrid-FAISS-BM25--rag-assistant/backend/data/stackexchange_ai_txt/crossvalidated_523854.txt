Structural equations models (SEM) with time series data

I'm quite new to SEM and I'd like to use them to model a system in which there could be either a direct and an indirect effect between some variables. The indirect effect would, in my case, be mediated through a latent variable (similar to the MIMIC model, for my little understanding). The doubt that I have is that my data comes from a multivariate time series which shows some autocorrelation and I am afraid that this is something that needs to be considered during the analysis. Does anyone know if I need to do something in particular to account for the autocorrelation? I mostly work in R so ideally I'd need something which is implementable in lavaan , but general considerations are, of course, more than welcome.
