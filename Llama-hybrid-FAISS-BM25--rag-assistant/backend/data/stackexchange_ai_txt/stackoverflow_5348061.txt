How to display CSS3 columns on IE?

IE doesn't support CSS3 columns â€” no big deal, right? Even though, I'm trying to find any modernizr-like library to do the trick. I don't really want to code different CSS for IE, as that would be giving way too much care and attention to something we all despise. Any suggestions?
