Using datatypes means that you'll be able to actually use the data in a meaningful way. For example, you can do date arithmetic (using DATE_ADD, for example). It also means that ordering by numbers will work as expected (it won't with strings). It also allows mysql to choose the appropriate amount/type of storage for the data you're representing. There are many reasons, not least that it makes it easier for anyone else using your schema to know what kinds of values to expect. It also allows mysql to do validation on your data (what happens if your "date" column contains "Once in a blue moon"?)
