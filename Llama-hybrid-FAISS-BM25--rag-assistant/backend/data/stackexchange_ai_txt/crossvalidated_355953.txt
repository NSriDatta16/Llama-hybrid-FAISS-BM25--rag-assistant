The question to ask is "Do they have any affect at all?" If your astrological sign can somehow impact your salary, then yes, if you do not include it in your model then it is white noise. However, if astrological sign has no impact on a person's salary then how can it even generate white noise different from zero? An example off the top of my head... Cucumber growth rate on average grades in a philosophy class. Side note: In this specific instance, astrological sign is related to your birth month so that is something to consider.
