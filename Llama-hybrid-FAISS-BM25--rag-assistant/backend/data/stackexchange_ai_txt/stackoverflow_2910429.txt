Storing SQL queries in Table in sql server

We have multiple jobs in our system. These jobs are listed in a grid. We have 3 different user types ( usertypeid 1,2,3). For each user listing is different and he can filter listing by selecting view from a dropdown. ViewName in the below table is the view which needs to be displayed. To achieve this functionality, a fellow developer has created the following table structure and stored sql fragments in SQLExpression in the below table. According to me the query should not be stored in database. What are the pros and cons of this approach and what are the available alternatives? JobListingViewID ViewName SQLExpression UserTypeID 3 All Jobs 1 = 1 3 4 Error Jobs JobStatusID IN ( 2 ) 1 5 Error Jobs JobStatusID IN ( 2 ) 2 6 Error Jobs JobStatusID IN ( 2 ) 3 7 Speech JobStatusID IN ( 1, 3, 8 ) 1
