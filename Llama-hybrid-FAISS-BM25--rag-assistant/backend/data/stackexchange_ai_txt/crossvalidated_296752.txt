What does the 95%CI from the median mean? The 95% CI means exactly what all confidence intervals mean; that if you were to re-run the sampling process, and recompute the CI multiple times, the true median of the underlying data generation process would be contained in the CI 95% of the time. Now, this is not exactly correct since you are using the bootstrap, but it's approximately correct. How many of future measurements are likely to be inside the CI? This cannot be said without further knowledge of the underlying data generation process (probability distribution) and the number of samples. I recommend a simulation study to investigate this. In a Bayesian framework it is somewhat more straightforward to compute predictive distributions (which is essentially what you seem to be looking for). I recommend looking into this. How many bootstrap samples would you use and why? I have more than 1000 samples (in some cases even 9000) and I know that the theoretical answer is as many samples as I can but I'm interested in a practical low limit of this number so the computation time will be reasonable. Again, I recommend a simulation study to figure this out.
