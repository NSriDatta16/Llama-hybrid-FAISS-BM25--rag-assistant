There are two options: 1 - Scale everything so that it is sized at a certain percentage of the screen/window. For example, if you want your object to be 1/4 of the screen, then it's width is ScreenWidth/4 and height is ScreenHeight/4. The problem with this technique is that a screen's aspect ratio may make things short and fat or tall and wide. Usually this is addressed by determining one dimension and then using the screen's aspect ratio to determine the other dimension. Ie, Width=Height*AspectRatio. 2 - Make everything the same physical dimension. For example, you may want an object to appear exactly 1" by 1". You can use the screen's resolution (dots per inch) to scale your drawings accordingly. The problem with this is that while it may work well for 'average' sized screens, images may be too small on large screens or too large on small screens. Most games use technique #1 (with compensation made for the aspect ratio). AR was not always a big deal, but now with widescreen monitors being so popular, it's almost required. Also, like Richard said, WinForms is not great for games (except minesweeper!), but probably okay for teaching yourself.
