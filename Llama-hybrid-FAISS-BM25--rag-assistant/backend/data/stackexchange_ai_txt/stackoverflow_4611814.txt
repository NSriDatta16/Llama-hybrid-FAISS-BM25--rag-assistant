Odd datetime representation in Quickbooks My Time files

I'm attempting to process Quickbooks My Time imt files using PHP. The imt file is a plaintext XML file. I've been able to use the PHP SimpleXML library with no issues but one: The numeric representations of datetime in the My Time XML files is something I've never seen before: 308073428.00000000000000000000 0 3600 310526237.59616601467132568359 You can see that attritube[@name='start'] has a value of: 308073428.00000000000000000000 This is not Excel based method of storage 308,073,428 is too many days since 1900-01-00 and it isn't Unix Epoch either. So, my question is, has anyone ever seen this type of datetime representation?
