I think what doesn't help the learning of a fully connected NN is that so many of your data point are highly correlated, though if you had enough examples, it should be able to work it out. Try to apply some dimensionality reduction like PCA to reduce the size of your NN and try again. Another idea might be to feature engineer your data a little bit. The definition of a spike in my book is a spike in the 2nd derivative. So difference your data twice and train the model to detect spikes, which should be easier. "Differencing" is to replace your data x0, x1, x2, ... by x1-x0, x2-x1, ... and you need to apply that procedure twice to get the second derivative.
