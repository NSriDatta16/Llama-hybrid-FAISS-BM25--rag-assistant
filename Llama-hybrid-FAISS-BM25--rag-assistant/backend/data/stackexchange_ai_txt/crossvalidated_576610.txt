Can confidence intervals be found for the difference in marginal probabilities from two different logistic models of the same sample?

So, I have two multivariable logistic regressions for the same sample. They differ in one independent variable: Model A has a dummy variable for membership in the top 50% (compared to the bottom 50%) of X, and Model B had a DV for membership in the top 25% (compared to the bottom 75%). The other control variables are the same. I presented my results as marginal estimated probabilities for these dummy variables with 95% confidence intervals, keeping other variables at their means. A reviewer wants me to present the difference in marginal probabilities between the models with confidence intervals. Is it possible to create confidence intervals for a difference in marginal estimates for separate models? Or can I only compare logit models by making Relative Risk Ratios or by using Y-standardization for the coefficients?
