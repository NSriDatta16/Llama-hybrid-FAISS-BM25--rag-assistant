Best practices for organising structure/running "builds" on a large solution

I am making a very large web app (currently at 70 projects and 150k loc but with a lot more to do). I use FinalBuilder to run build scripts. However, what are the best practises for structuring such a large project? What about build dependencies? What effect does the structure of my projects have on the performance on the code (if any)? I've seen some previous threads about this but I can't find those. I've seen threads about solutions exceeding 600 projects in the solution, for the sake of clear answers, lets imagine this system will grow to that size (I would like to know how to organise a project bigger than what mine ends up to be, as it would mean I can organise a smaller solution). If it matters, the system is mostly in .NET 3.5 (C#, LINQ, SQL Server etc) but will use Python/Erlang too.
