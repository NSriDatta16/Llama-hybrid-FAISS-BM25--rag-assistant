Simulation of logistic regression's accuracy

I ran a MC simulation of $10^5$ GLM regressions (logistic, logit link) in R. To do so, I assumed: The outcomes ( $y$ ) were repeatedly sampled from a Bernoulli distribution ( $N=1000$ ) The one explanatory variable ( $x$ ) was sampled independently from y from a half-normal distribution ( $x≥0$ ) I then calculated the accuracy of predictions (with cutoff 0.5) as true positive + true negatives over all N Naïvely, I was perhaps expecting an mean/median accuracy of 0.5, but that wasn't true. The average accuracy was around 51.5%. Is there a good intuition or theoretical result for this?
