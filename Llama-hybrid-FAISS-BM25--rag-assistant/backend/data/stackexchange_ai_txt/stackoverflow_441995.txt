RFC 3986 ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt ) says in Appendix B The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a well-formed URI reference into its components. ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))? 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability; they indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired parenthesis). We refer to the value matched for subexpression as $. For example, matching the above expression to http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related results in the following subexpression matches: $1 = http: $2 = http $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu $4 = www.ics.uci.edu $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/ $6 = $7 = $8 = #Related $9 = Related where indicates that the component is not present, as is the case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can determine the value of the five components as scheme = $2 authority = $4 path = $5 query = $7 fragment = $9
