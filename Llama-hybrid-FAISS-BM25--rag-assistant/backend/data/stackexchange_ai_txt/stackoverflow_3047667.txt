The most basic difference is how the test is verified. Is it done via a programatic check or is there a human inspection done? The big challenge with automated testing is getting the manual tests to be automated and ensuring that there isn't the need for a human interpretation of the result,e.g. if a program involves an audio or video output this may be very hard to verify exactly. Both require an attention to detail, patience and organization skills to have credibility in saying, "Yes, this is a high quality product/service." The differences can come where automated testing uses special software usually. Manual testing can be costly as there is someone watching the tests being run while the automated tests can generally be run without someone watching it. However, manual testing can be underrated when it comes to those areas where things can be very subjective such as styling of web pages or how well does this song sound if we make these changes to it? Those would be where I'd see a human being preferred over a machine. As for career paths and job opportunities, this is to some degree an open question. As not every place hires testers and sometimes testers are just brought in as needed for projects, there are different perspectives on testing. This is without getting into the question of how much should developers write their own tests and does this make a developer a tester as well? I suppose this isn't answering your question because I'm looking at this in the bigger scale of just who is doing the testing as that is something else to consider here.
