The point estimator that maximises $P(x|\theta)$ is the MLE. This is a commonly used point estimator in frequentist statistics, but it is less commonly used in Bayesian statistics. In Bayesian statistics it is usual to use a point estimator which is either the posterior expected value, or the value minimising the expected-loss (risk) in a decision problem. There are certainly some cases where the Bayesian estimator will correspond with the MLE (e.g., if we have a uniform prior, or in some special cases of minimising loss), but this is not a common occurrence. Hence, as a general rule, the MLE is usually a frequentist estimator.
