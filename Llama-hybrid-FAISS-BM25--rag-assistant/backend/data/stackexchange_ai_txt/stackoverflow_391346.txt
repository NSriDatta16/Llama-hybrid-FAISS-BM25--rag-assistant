What can I expect to be difference when I transition from C & C# to C++?

Here's a simple question. I've done plenty of work using both C & C# (2.0) but never anything in C++. What can I expect to be different when learning C++? Will there be any big gotcha's or hurdles I should pay attention too? Does anyone good crash course book/website recommendations for learning C++ for the experienced programmer?
