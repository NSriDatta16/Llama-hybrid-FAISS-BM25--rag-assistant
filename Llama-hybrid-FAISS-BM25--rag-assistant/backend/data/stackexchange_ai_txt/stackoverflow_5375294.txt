Binding IsEnabled to the parent ViewModel instead of the UserControl ViewModel

I developed a user control in SilverLight that contains several child controls. Textboxes , ComboBoxes and so on. The problem is, when I include that UserControl into a parent view and set the complete control to IsEnabled=False , the child controls in that specific UserControl are still enabled. After all I found the problem. Adding something like that, implies that the IsEnabled Binding is located in the UserControl binding, not as expected from myself in the DataContext of the parent. QUESTION: But there's still the question how I can bind the IsEnabled to the ViewModel of the Parent? Because it's not very elegant to copy the CanModify Property to the ViewModel of the Child Control.
