I've worked on software with similar features to this. Instead of data being updated in the database, every change was inserted as a new record. Each row in the database has a start and an end date. The latest record is the one with no end date. From there, you can query the state of the data at any give date just by searching for the records that were active at that time. The obvious downsides are storage, and the fact that you have to abstract certain aspects of your data layer to make the historical tracking transparent to whoever is calling it.
