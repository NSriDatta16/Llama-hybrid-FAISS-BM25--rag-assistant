Just like in English, in which there are many ways to say the same thing, all three of those queries are asking for the same data. The SQL Engine (the query optimizer) knows that and is smart enough to know what you are asking. Even more appropriately, the engine has information that you don't (or likely don't know) - how the data is organized and indexed. It uses this information to make it's own decision about what the BEST way to get the data is, and that's what it is doing. Although there are ways to override the optimizer, unless you really know what you are doing, you will probably only hurt performance. So your best option is to write the queries in whatever way make most sense to you (or other humans) for readability and maintainability.
