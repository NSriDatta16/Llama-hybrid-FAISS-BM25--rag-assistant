As I expected, no one probably uses MI to perform variable selection, and thus I will stick with other methods such as variable clustering, random forest, PCA, correlation assessment among potential predictor variables, and other methods in lieu of using MI to deal with high dimensionality. Additionally, MI is likely not that useful for continuous variables, which encompass a large percentage of the candidate predictor variables in a typical dataset that I work with, so I am likely much better off without making using of MI as another variable selection technique even if it is a worthwhile approach to do so with continuous potential predictor variables. PLEASE correct me if I am wrong, as I would enjoy exploring a new technique (at least to me) of avoiding the use of stepwise techniques to reduce the number of candidate variables in my logistic regression models!
