You're doing nothing wrong, on the surface, and as the error page says you should contact the site's administrators because they're the ones with the server logs which may explain what's happening. Fortunately, bitbucket's site admins are a friendly bunch! No doubt there is some header or combination of headers that browsers set one way, urllib sets another way, and a bug on the server gets tickled in the latter case. You may want to see exactly what headers are being sent e.g. with firebug in firefox, and reproduce those until you isolate exactly the server bug; most likely it's going to be the user agent or some "accept"-ish header that's tickling that bug.
