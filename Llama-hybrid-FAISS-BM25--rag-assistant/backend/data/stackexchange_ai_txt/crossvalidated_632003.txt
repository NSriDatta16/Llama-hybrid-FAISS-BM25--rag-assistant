Appropriate way to configure contrasts and interactions in GLM likelihood ratio test

I have a pretty large experiment where we are looking for differences in gene expression in RNA sequencing experiments. We are using EdgeR's GLM functionality, and then using contrasts to look for differences between groups. We are unclear on the most reasonable way to form powerful, informative contrasts that take into account interactions. The general setup is this: We sample R unique regions (here let's just take R = 2), C unique cell types (again C =2 for simplicity), from N patients from four unique conditions (two diseases each with two levels). Here's a table that describes this with the minimum possible N (in reality we have many replicates of each group so that this makes more sense). Individual Region Cell Type Disease A Disease B Group 1 A A - - A.A.-.- 1 A B - - A.B.-.- 1 B A - - B.A.-.- 1 B B - - B.B.-.- 2 A A + - A.A.+.- 2 A B + - A.B.+.- 2 B A + - B.A.+.- 2 B B + - B.B.+.- 3 A A - + A.A.-.+ 3 A B - + A.B.-.+ 3 B A - + B.A.-.+ 3 B B - + B.B.-.+ 4 A A + + A.A.+.+ 4 A B + + A.B.+.+ 4 B A + + B.A.+.+ 4 B B + + B.B.+.+ The simplest question one can ask is "What's the difference between +- and -- within a region x cell type pair?" We address this with the contrast (for instance) (A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) From here, we get a little lost. One question we would like to address is "Within a fixed celltype/ region, what is the effect of disease A regardless of disease B?". We have tried a few different approaches and are unclear what is appropriate. The first is to construct (A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) and (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.-.+) and take the intersection of the significance sets. However, I get the feeling that 1) the intersection is not a smooth operation, so things that are "almost significant" in one will be excluded, which is not desirable and 2) If there are interactions between disease A and disease B, or if the effect of disease B is quite large, then significance can easily be obscured. Our next attempt at answering this question is to take the average effect of disease A: 1/2((A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.-.+)) , which is more of a "soft intersection", but does not deal with any interactions in disease B status. Does including a term like 1/2((A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.-.+)) - 1/2((A.A.-.+) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.+.-)) account for those interactions? We are very concerned that we are overspecifying here. If this larger contrast w/ extra interactions is appropriate, can a similar approach be applied to ask questions of the form "Given a cell type, what genes are different in disease A region A that are not different in disease A region B?"? This contrast formula would be (effect of disease A in region A) - (effect of disease A in region B) , or: (1/2((A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.-.+)) - 1/2((A.A.-.+) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.+.-))) - (1/2((B.A.+.-) - (B.A.-.-) + (B.A.+.+)-(B.A.-.+)) - 1/2((B.A.-.+) - (B.A.-.-) + (B.A.+.+)-(B.A.+.-))) In contrast (ha), would the sum of the two terms be the answer to "what genes are expressed in both regions in disease A?", e.g., (1/2((A.A.+.-) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.-.+)) - 1/2((A.A.-.+) - (A.A.-.-) + (A.A.+.+)-(A.A.+.-))) + (1/2((B.A.+.-) - (B.A.-.-) + (B.A.+.+)-(B.A.-.+)) - 1/2((B.A.-.+) - (B.A.-.-) + (B.A.+.+)-(B.A.+.-))) In general, can I just continue this line of thought for further specification to cell types? Can you recommend any resources that tackle these more complex multifactorial experiments?
