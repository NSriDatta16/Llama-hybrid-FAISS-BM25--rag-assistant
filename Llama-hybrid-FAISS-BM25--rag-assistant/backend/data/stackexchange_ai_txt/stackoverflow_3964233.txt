How to remove all cross-sell product links from Magento?

I want to remove all of the cross-sell product links from the store - we have around 22,000 links that was the result of an auto cross sell extension that I have since removed. I imagine it has something to do with removing records from the table catalog_product_link? Or is there a way to do this programmatically?
