Is it feasible to predict a numerical variable with only 100 measures in 70 000 observations?

A quick explainer: I have a data set of 5 numeric variables, and a numeric target variable. The total observations / rows are about 70 000, but I only have about 90 measurements of the target variable. Cluster analysis of the 70 000 returns from 5 to 8 clusters. In reality I expect there to be about that many groups or classes as well, and that the target variable would naturally group within them. I wish to predict values of the target variable for those observations where it is missing, and have some There are no missing values in the 5 variables for the 70 000 data set. A slightly larger total of observations (100 000) would exist, with a greater number of variables (nearly 30), if I allowed missing values. There would be an increased number of target variable measurements as well, to 114. I have been attempting to use self-organising maps to model and then predict values, hoping to take advantage of its simplicity, plus I was introduced to them via a proprietary software package! Is it feasible to predict values for the target variable from this data set?
