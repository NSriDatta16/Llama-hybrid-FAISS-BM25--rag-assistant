Some QPainter::drawPixmap() variants has the option to specify the rectangle in the pixmap to be drawn. This will help you keeping the sprite sheets without breaking them up into small images. For repeated sprites, QPainter::drawPixmapFragments() probably will have better performance and also allow sub-image drawing.
