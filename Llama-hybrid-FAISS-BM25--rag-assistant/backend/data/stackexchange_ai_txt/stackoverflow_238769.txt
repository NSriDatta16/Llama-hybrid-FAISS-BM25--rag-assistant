If it's medical data and you live in the United States, there is an excellent chance that access to it is subject to HIPAA regulations, including security requirements. You should review http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/Downloads/SecurityGuidanceforRemoteUseFinal122806.pdf . If you don't live in the United States, I would suggest that you could still point to HIPAA as relevant to the domain. If your vendor tries to push back with an additional fee, say "Are you saying that you're not compliant with the relevant governmental standards? Golly, maybe you should provide us with complete documentation on your security and privacy standards, safeguards, and procedures. Because obviously if we got hit with a fine, we'd be coming after you. " (IANAL and all that.) From a technical level, certainly the suggestion of an ethereal trace showing how easy it is to scavenge usernames and passwords should be eye-opening to your management. Given how trivially easy it is to sniff normal network traffic and how easy it is to use SSL for transport, the idea of a vendor pushing back on that as a "security enhancement" is outrageous.
