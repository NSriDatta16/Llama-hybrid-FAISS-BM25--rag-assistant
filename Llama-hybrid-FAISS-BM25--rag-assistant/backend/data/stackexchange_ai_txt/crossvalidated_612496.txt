Linear regression vs. average of slopes

Suppose that we want to know how the price of a house changes per meter square of the area of the house. Further suppose that I have a dataset as the following: Area | Price 100 200k 120 230k ... That is, only the area and the price of a set of houses. Given this setup I can think of two different ways: Fit a linear model (using linear regression) and look at the coefficient of Area. For all pairs of houses $i$ and $j$ find $\frac{price_i - price_j}{area_i - area_j}$ then take the average. My question: Are these solutions different? If yes, in what ways they are different? or pros and cons?
