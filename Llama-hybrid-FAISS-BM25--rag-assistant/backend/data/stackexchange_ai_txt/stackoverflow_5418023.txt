Text Weighted to Last Line of Paragraph

An unusual one this, and a toughie to explain eloquently! I'm trying to force the first line of a paragraph to have the least number of characters where under normal circumstances it would be the last. that probably didn't make much sense, so I'll use an example. Text usally formats like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur mollis lorem sit amet nisl scelerisque mollis. Vestibulum tincidunt sodales turpis quis convallis. Curabitur id diam dictum arcu placerat lobortis. I want the text to format like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur mollis lorem sit amet nisl scelerisque mollis. Vestibulum tincidunt sodales turpis quis convallis. Curabitur id diam dictum arcu placerat lobortis As you can see the first line is the shortest one. I've tried searching for a solution, but to no avail; it's hard to know what to actually search for! I'm assuming if anyone has ever done this the solution will be in scripting rather than CSS. I would normally script this myself in PHP, but the thought of it hurts my brain! Anyone have any ideas?
