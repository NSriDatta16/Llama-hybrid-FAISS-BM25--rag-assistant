Too many high residuals in PCA

My question is similar to How do I interpret high residuals for the reproduced correlations in factor analysis? . I have 5-item Likert-scale questionnaire. I carried out a PCA with N=1253 and I extracted just one factor, and this is consistent with what my items are about. KMO, Cronbach's Alpha, Bartlett's test are all good, but I have 70% of residuals with absolute value higher than .05. I'm unsure if I have to use a technique other than PCA (frankly, I'm not familiar with any other). Moreover, I was wondering if there is a way to keep my factor like it is while citing authors who did the same and motivated it in a convincing way. I did not find anything... Does anyone know an exemple? Thanks!
