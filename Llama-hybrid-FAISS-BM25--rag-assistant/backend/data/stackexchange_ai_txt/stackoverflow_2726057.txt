A hash means a 1 to 1 relationship between data. This is a common datatype in languages, although sometimes its called called a dictionary. A hash algorithm is a way to take an input and always have the same output, other wise known as a 1 to 1 function. An ideal hash function is when this same process always yields a unique output. So you can tell someone, here is a file, and here is its md5 hash. If the file has been corrupted during then the md5 hash will be a different value. In practice a hash function will always produce a value of the same size, for instance md5() is will alway return 128bits no matter the size of the input. This makes a 1 to 1 relationship impossible. A cryptographic hash function takes extra precautions in making it difficult to produce 2 different inputs with the same output, this is called a collision. It also makes it difficult to reverse the function. Hash functions are used for password storage because it if an attacker where to obtain the password's hash then it forces the attacker to break the hash before he can use it to login. To break hashes attacks will take a word list or an English dictionary and find all of the corresponding hash values and then iterate though the list for each password looking for a match. md5(), sha0 and sha1() are all vulnerable to a hash collision attacks and should never be used for anything security related. Instead any member of the sha-2 family, such as sha-256 should be used.
