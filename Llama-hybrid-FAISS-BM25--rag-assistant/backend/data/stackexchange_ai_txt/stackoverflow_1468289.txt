The effect of the app ending is likely being caused by 1 of 2 things: An unhandled exception (likely an OOM) is causing it to unwind. You should be handling these . The WinMo platform itself is killing the app via the WM_HIBERNATE message . As has been pointed out, ensure you are calling Dispose on all GDI-related objects (Bitmaps, Pens, etc). Descriptions of a bug related to Bitmaps can be found here and here . Another thing to be aware of is that Components on a Form are not Disposed when the Form itself is (unlike Controls, which are). So if you're doing a lot of Form creating and destruction, pay close attention to that. If you can upgrade the project to target 3.5, even if it's only for internal testing, running the CF 3.5 CLR Profiler can certainly help you find the leak.
