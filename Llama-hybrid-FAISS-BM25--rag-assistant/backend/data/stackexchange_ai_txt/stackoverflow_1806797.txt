robots.txt to restrict search engines indexing specified keywords for privacy

I have a large directory of individual names along with generic publicaly available and category specific information that I want indexed as much as possible in search engines. Listing these names on the site itself is not a concern to people but some don't want to be in search results when they "Google" themselves. We want to continue listing these names within a page AND still index the page BUT not index specified names or keywords in search engines. Can this be done page-by-page or would setting up two pages be a better work around: Options available: PHP can censor keywords if user-agent=robot/search engine htaccess to restrict robots to non-censored content, but allowing to a second censored version meta tags defining words not to index ? JavaScript could hide keywords from robots but otherwise viewable
