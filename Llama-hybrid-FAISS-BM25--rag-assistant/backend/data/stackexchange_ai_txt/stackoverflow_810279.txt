In your project, add an AliasLibrary task from the General palette. Add the jar file to the AliasLibrary containing the Class you want to access. Within a BusinessWorks process activity, drag a "Java Method" task onto the canvas. Use the configuration tab to specify the AliasLibrary and then use the finder to locate the Class and method you wish to invoke. The "Advanced" tab gives you some options for managing the java instance lifecycle associated with this method call. Optionally, if you want to instantiate a global java instance which is shared among multiple jobs/processes, then use the "Java Global Instance" task from the Java palette. In the configuration tab, point to the AliasLibrary and use the finder to locate the Class and static method you want to execute. The "Java Method" task can be used to invoke a method on this global instance. The "Java Global Instance" may also be necessary if you don't have a default constructor on your java class.
