One other solution is, of course, something like "SELECT DISTINCT Project FROM ... AS a WHERE 'Apple' IN (SELECT Category FROM ... AS b WHERE a.Project = b.Project) AND 'Banana' IN (SELECT Category FROM ... AS b WHERE a.Project = b.Project)", but that gets pretty computationally expensive pretty quickly. I was hoping for something more elegant, and you guys haven't disappointed. I'm including this one mostly for completeness in case someone else consults this question. It's clearly worth zero points. :)
