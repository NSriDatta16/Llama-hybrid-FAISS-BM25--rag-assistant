I'm not certain if this is the problem in your specific case, but in general, the use of implicit transactions is discouraged when using Nhibernate as discussed here . Your data access should always follow this pattern: using(var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession()) using(var tx = session.BeginTransaction()) { // execute code that uses the session tx.Commit(); }
