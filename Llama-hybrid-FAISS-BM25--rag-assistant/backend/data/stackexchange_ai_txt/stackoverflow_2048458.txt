What is the correct way to set up an observer in Magento?

I'd like to set up an observer in Magento that performs an action when the status of an order changes. I'm familiar with process of creating modules. What I'm looking to understand is what needs to placed in the modules config.xml, and what is the naming convention for the classes and/or methods that need to be created.
