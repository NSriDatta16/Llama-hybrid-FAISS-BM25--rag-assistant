The specialist track in Coursera from John Hopkins for Data Science seems to be perfect for your needs (if I am interpreting your needs correctly). https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage The classes are designed for R, but given your background and their intro to R classes (at the beginning of the specialist track) you shouldn't be slowed down at all by the programming language. All of the classes have additional links or texts suggested for further study if you want a deeper understanding of theory. Oh, and it's free! (unless you want to earn their specialist degree. In that case, it costs money.) Good luck! edit: Depending on your exact goals and given that you haven't had a probability course, I would recommend getting an probability book to complement the course for background. Specifically, I used Hogg and Tanis in my college class and actually think it's pretty great (I still reference it every now and then). http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistical-Inference-Robert-Hogg/dp/0321584759/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415908500&sr=8-1&keywords=Hogg+%26+Tanis+-+Probability+%26+Statistical+Inference Again, depending on your exact goals, I would order the book and set up a schedule for getting through all of chapters 1-4 (making sure to grasp concepts, possibly working so many problems from each chapter). Then I would make sure to hit 6.1, 6.2, 8.1 possibly 8.3, and most of chapter 9 (these aren't all the areas that would be touched on in the Coursera course, but I would reference the others during the course, not prior to it). From there, I would start the Coursera course work and reference Hogg and Tanis whenever necessary. The book is focused on probability and statistical inference (not regression), but the Coursera course is pretty focused on the practical (how we do it) parts of data science and this book, I believe, would help someone with a math background but little probability experience understand the more conceptual (why we do it and how it works) type of questions. There are loads of good intro books out there though, if that's a direction you are strongly considering.
