With Adobe always go with the latest and greatest because legacy products won't be support for long. As others have mentioned the new Spark Components are much better and super helpful when coding UI. Sliders and other UI components are a breeze, but there is nothing lightweight about AIR or Flex. I see no cons of Using Flex 4, but just like the Adobe Flash Player the newer the better. There are constant security fixes and over all improvements. Not to mention Adobe is fixing and optimizing the Flash Player which will encourage any users to upgrade to the latest and greatest. The only reason why I would pic one version of Flex over another is if you want to use some 3rd party plug-in that is only supported by another version. Otherwise, use the newest version.
