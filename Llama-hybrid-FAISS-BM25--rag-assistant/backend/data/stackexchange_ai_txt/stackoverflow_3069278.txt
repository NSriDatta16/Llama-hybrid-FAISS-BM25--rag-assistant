Regardless of how you organise your build, developers should understand how references work , and be aware when they make changes to references that they shouldn't check those changes in unless they intended to make a change to the build process . On the subject of organising your builds - as Dmytrol says, project references should work between solutions (As long as the target is already built, however that's also the case for file references anyway). My advice would be to group your projects into small workable solutions and use project references within those solutions. Your main solution file / build can use project references too, however if you find project references between the smaller solutions too difficult to maintain you can use file references instead, and control the build order through project dependencies or the project build order (accessible within Visual Studio by right-clicking on a project in your solution).
