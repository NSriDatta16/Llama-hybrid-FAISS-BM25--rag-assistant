Since the Extraversion score is just the average of the Assertiveness and Enthusiasm scores, each of these variables is a linear function of the other two. Thus, once you already have two of the variables in the model, adding the third gives you non-identifiable effect terms. I recommend you include only the latter variables in your regression model and exclude Extraversion . If you wish to make inferences about the Extraversion variable then you can do so by looking at the average of the coefficients for the other two variables.
