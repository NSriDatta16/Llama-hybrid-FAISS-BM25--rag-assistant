SOLUTION (eeehhh - work-around): It's an export from flash-problem - I read some other posts about flash not exporting style 3 and 4 of the fla file.( Font wont export out ) This made me try this: I applied 'bold' as style to the first word in the sifr3-r436- fla file (the word 'Make') and exported it. In the demo index.html file i called this swf file but I DID NOT change the css code part to bold (font-weight: normal) - for the first time I was able to display the 'bold' style of the font using sIFR. I think I'll stick to a work flow making seperate swfs for each font-weight. Mark, I guess a lot of people struggle with this - are you going to tell people about this problem on the sIFR documentation site? PROBLEM: I also struggle with that problem. Only 'normal' works with some of the fonts. One of the fonts I'm trying to use don't have 'BoldItalic' so I set this to 'bold' - could that be the reason for 'bold' to fail? Have anybody solved this problem yet? If not I'll try to set up a demo page for Mark to explore. Like Jay I wonder if this is a font problem - are problem with some fonts a known issue? Actually 'bold' 'italic' 'bold&italic' is a problem with almost all the fonts I try out. Only success with verdana and georgia... What critical info have I missed? Do I do something wrong in the fla file? I tried something to check whats doing what - I applied the bold font style to the 'normal' word in the fla file - but that does not have any effect. I guess it's just a question of embedding the font style in te swf-file.
