is the test dataset needed for cross validation?

I read about cross-validation and I want to fit ordered and unordered logistic regression models on my data and consider the performance of these models. should I split the whole dataset before doing cross-validation? or I should do that on the whole dataset? after doing cross-validation on the whole data set, I should run the selected model again on whole data, am I correct?
