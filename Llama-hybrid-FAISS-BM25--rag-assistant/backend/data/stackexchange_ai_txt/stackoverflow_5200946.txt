Coverage by intersecting smaller genomic interval data over larger genomic intervals using R

I want to intersect two genomic intervals in R. And I want to get coverage stats of the smaller interval over the larger interval. The larger interval data is a data frame like this .... Chr Start End Name Val Strand chr7 145444998 146102295 CCDS5889.1 0 + chr7 146102406 146167735 CCDS5889.1 0 + chr7 146167929 146371931 CCDS5889.1 0 + the smaller interval with more than 2 million rows is like this . Chr Start End Name Val Strand PhyloP chr7 145444386 145444387 CCDS5889.1 0 + 0.684764 chr7 145444387 145444388 CCDS5889.1 0 + 0.684764 chr7 145444388 145444389 CCDS5889.1 0 + 0.684764 chr7 145444389 145444390 CCDS5889.1 0 + 0.684764 The interval data is in the 2nd (from) and 3rd (to) columns in both data frame. The situation is similar to Large Interval: [-----] [-----] [--------------] [-------------------] Small Interval: ||| |||| ||||||||||| |||||||| |||| || ||||||||| || |||||||| I want to know how much of each of the larger intervals is covered by the smaller intervals. Also, I would to associate the intersecting $PhyloP values for each of the large intervals for later access for plotting.
