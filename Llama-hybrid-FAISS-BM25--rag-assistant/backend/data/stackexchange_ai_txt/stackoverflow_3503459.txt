Trying to run corflags from TFS Build 2010

I am using an InvokeProcess activity in TFS 2010 to try and run the corflags application on a built exe. C:\Builds\4\testing\Sources\BuildAssets\corflags.exe C:\Builds\4\testing\Binaries\Executable.exe /32bit+ However I am getting the following message: corflags : error CF001 : Could not open file for writing I am running the TFS Build Agent on my local machine because I am currently in a testing phase, and when I run the exact same command from the command line, the corflags application completes without error. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
