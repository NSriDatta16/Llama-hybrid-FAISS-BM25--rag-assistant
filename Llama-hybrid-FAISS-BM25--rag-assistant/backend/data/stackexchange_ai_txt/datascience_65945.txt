what is darknet and why is it needed for YOLO object detection?

what is darknet and why is it needed for YOLO object detection ? I read that its a neural network written in C , but why is it needed for YOLO object detection when we have lot of machine learning framework,api like tensorflow,keras,pytorch . Im trying to train yolo from git code and i could see they are using tensorflow/keras as well but not sure why darkenet is used initially for traning yolo . darknet/yolo algorithm
