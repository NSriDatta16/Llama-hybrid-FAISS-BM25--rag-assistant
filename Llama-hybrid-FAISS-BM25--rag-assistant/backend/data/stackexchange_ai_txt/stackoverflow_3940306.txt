How to detect the touch (CGPoint) of a scroll view in its content size in iPhone?

I want to detect the touch (CGPoint) of a scroll view in its content size. If I detect the touch in the scroll I get the CGPoint only with reference to the scroll view frame, but I want the position with reference to content size. Here is my code -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch* t; NSLog(@"inside touches began"); if([[event allTouches] count]==1){ t=[[[event allTouches] allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; p1=[t locationInView:scroll]; } My scroll view frame is (0,0,320,460) and content size is (320,800); If I scroll my view and touch it at bottom, the CGPoint value obtained is 450 but I want to get as 750 (with reference to content size).
