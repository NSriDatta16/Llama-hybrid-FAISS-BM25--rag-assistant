Bootloaders don't have "int main()"s, unless you write assembly code to call it. If you are writing a stage 1 bootloader, then it is seriously discouraged. Otherwise, the osdev.org has great documentation on the topic. While it is probably possible to make a bootloader in C++, remember not to link your code to any dynamic libraries, and remember that just because it is C++, that doesn't mean you can/should use the STL, etc.
