Is there a way to force a transformer to return a pandas dataframe?

I am having issues with scikit-learn converting dataframes to numpy arrays. For instance, the following code from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame(dict( x=[1, 2, np.nan], y=[2, np.nan, 0] )) SimpleImputer().fit_transform(df) Returns array([[1. , 2. ], [2. , 1. ], [1.5, 0. ]]) Is there a way to use an imputer that returns a pandas dataframe instead of a numpy array? Is there a scikit-learn implementation for that? I am aware of sklearn-pandas , but the interface is kind of different.
