Do you have to create dummy variables for ordinal data?

Using Python and utilizing XGBoost for classification. I have three columns that is supposed to be categorical and are ordinal (ranging from 1-5). Since the columns do not contain strings, I was thinking that simply converting them to type category (utilizing Python Pandas) would be enough. Is that the correct logic? Here is my code: ser = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype='category') ser = ser.to_frame() ser = ser.T type(ser[0][0]) #Returns numpy.int64 Any help would be great!
