Can bimodality exist in a multivariate sense?

Consider a hypothetical discussion about a Lotkaâ€“Volterra experiment involving foxes and rabbits: > Ernie: Species is categorical. > Bert: In fact it is bimodal. > Ernie: Can you specify the units of the axis you claim species is bimodal? > Bert: Sorry no, because it is bimodal along several axes. Ignoring whether the phenomenon is categorical or continuous, is it possible for bimodality of some quantity to exist not independently but along several axes - eg. as a function of length, height, weight, speed, and others - in the way Bert asserts?
