Output interpretation of mixed anova with lme4 package in R

I'm quite confused about interpreting the results from the lme4 package. When looking through this webpage and google, it seems like more people are generally confused. I cannot find a clear overview on what to do with all the output, so I hope this thread can function as a general overview for more people. I'll use my data as an example: I have a 4 (between:groups)x 2 (within:time) design. I am looking for an interaction effect on reaction times of an attentional control task (e.g. stroop task). Since I have an unbalanced design (16, 19, 14 and 17 obs per group) after removing outliers, I wanted to use the lmer function to run a mixed anova (or mixed model now) in R. I run the following command: options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")) lmer_mixed_ANOVA print(Anova(lmer_mixed_ANOVA,type=3)) print(anova(lmer_mixed_ANOVA,type=3)) print(summary(lmer_mixed_ANOVA)) and I get this as output: [1] "data_RT_control" Analysis of Deviance Table (Type III Wald chisquare tests) Response: control_out Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) (Intercept) 291.1728 1 F) time 8164.2 8164.2 1 58.039 9.3639 0.003348 ** Groups 1848.8 616.3 3 58.980 0.7068 0.551774 time:Groups 5672.4 1890.8 3 57.995 2.1687 0.101448 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Linear mixed model fit by REML t-tests use Satterthwaite approximations to degrees of freedom ['lmerMod'] Formula: control_out ~ time * Groups + (1 | ID) Data: all_dataframes[[i]] REML criterion at convergence: 1301 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4262 -0.5228 -0.1374 0.5249 2.3927 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Is there an overview, or would someone be willing to create an overview of how to interpret these outcomes step by step.
