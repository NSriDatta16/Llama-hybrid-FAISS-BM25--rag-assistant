You're not revealing many details about what you're doing, but the mod_rewrite solution (catching the USER_AGENT variable and checking whether it is IE, and redirecting internally to the matching .png file) sounds the most elegant to me, because it works sans JavaScript, and you can keep the file extension. The .svg extension should be meaningless as long as the right Content-Type header is sent.
