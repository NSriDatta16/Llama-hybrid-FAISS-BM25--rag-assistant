Note the documentation for the WebHeaderCollection , most of the useful headers are restricted, it doesn't list pragma but then it also says that restricted headers is not limited to the list provided. These restrictions are in place since the underlying browser would normally handle http requests and it would therefore control such headers using its own algorithms. It may be possible to do this with the ClientHttp like this:- var url = new Uri("http://lonmw32795/RBSM_Portal_RESTfulWebService/HostInterrogationService.svc/host/environment"); req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequestCreator.ClientHttp.Create(url); Note that you will need to manage any cookies needed manually which may be a little tricky if the cookies are set as part of a response to requests that use BrowserHttp.
