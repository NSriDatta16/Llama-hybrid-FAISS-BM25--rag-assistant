istream from file_descriptor_source (boost::iostreams) or file

I need to do something like this for my program's input: stream input; if (decompressed) input.open(filepath); else { file_descriptor=_popen("decompressor "+filepath,"r"); input.open(file_descriptor); } input.read(...) ... I can see one solution - to use _popen in both cases and just copy the file to stdout if it's already decompressed, but this doesn't seem very elegant. Funny how difficult this is compared with C - I guess the standard library missed it. Now I am lost in the cryptic boost::iostreams documentation. Example code would be great if anyone knows how.
