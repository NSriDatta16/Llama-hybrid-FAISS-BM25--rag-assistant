I'm going to "split the fence" and say use the database for all of your analysis/archiving log entries (such as your Telnet communications). This will grant you the benefits of full text searching, columns, and easy ways to search out the data. Use a flat file (or XML format since the file shouldn't be too big) for any of your debug/critical error type logs. If you have a broken database connection, or something has gone wacky with your table structure, logging to the DB will be meaningless. Come to think of it, if you are looking for a slightly more "lightweight" solution, you could use SQLite to log all your telnet traffic so that you can leverage the advantage of the DB structure, but also have the availability of the file. With another nod to log4net, you could easily accomplish this with the ADO appender they have.
