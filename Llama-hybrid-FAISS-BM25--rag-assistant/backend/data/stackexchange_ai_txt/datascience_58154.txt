If you have enough storage, covert all these to some common format like 320kbps MP3 or WAV. This will save some issue with analysis pipeline (and move these issues to ETL pipeline). Issues are : Compatibility issues with Audio processing libraries (Such as a specific library might only accept raw audio, another might accept mp3) Compatibility issues with Metadata tagging and extraction (Some libraries will not read tags from wav, others wont read them from m4a) Artifacts introduced by format conversion at runtime (Offline conversion can afford to spend more CPU cycles) This will need ~10TB or 40TB of storage.
