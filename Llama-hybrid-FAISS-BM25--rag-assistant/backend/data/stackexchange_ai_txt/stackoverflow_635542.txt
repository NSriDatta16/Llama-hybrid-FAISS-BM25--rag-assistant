The problem is that UNION should be used just to get similar recordsets together. If you try to unify two different queries (for example, with different columns being fetched) it's an error. If the nature of the queries is different (having different column count, or data types) you'll need to make several different queries and treat them all separately. Another approach (less elegant, I guess) would be LEFT JOINing your activities table with all the others, so you'll end up with a recordset with a lot of columns, and you'll need to check for each row which columns should be used depending on the activity nature. Again, I'd rather stick with the first one, since the second procudes a rather sparse recorset.
