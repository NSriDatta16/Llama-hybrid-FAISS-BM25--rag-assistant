I do not think those are equivalent and in fact I believe one of them H0:μ=μ0; Ha:μ>μ0 is incorrect. Philosophically, the 'rules' for forming the Ho and the Ha are that they be a-mutually exclusive and b-exhaustive, and so I think technically that form of the null is incorrect because it's not exhaustive (e.g. it omits the result in which (using your single sample example) the obtained mean is actually significantly lower). Pragmatically, you are correct there aren't any cases where anything that's rejected by the second version of the hypothesis wont be also rejected by the first version - because the critical value for rejection region would go in the tail corresponding to the alternative hypothesis, leaving the entire other part of the distribution in the zone of the null. But the fact that the practical implication is invariant doesn't make the expression of the hypothesis correct (for the reason stated above, that it fails one of the rules of hypothesis formation).
