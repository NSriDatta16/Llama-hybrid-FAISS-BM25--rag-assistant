We have used mongodb in the one of the projects to capture event logging for a distributed app. It works really well and it makes sense to do some calculations beforehand about the amount of storage, sharding and other factors. As a suggestion, go with capped collection and have a mapreduce operation run every 24 hours or so to reduce the logs to an aggregate table of wanted value. I have noticed, that due to being "schema-less" the documents in mongodb can cause the db file size to grow really fast.
