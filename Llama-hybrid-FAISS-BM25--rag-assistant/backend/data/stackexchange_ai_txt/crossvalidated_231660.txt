How is PCA used for 3D face reconstruction from 2D image?

I have learnt PCA in my data mining course and I know it is used for dimensionality reduction but I am confused about it how does it used for making 3D Morphable Model. Here is the paper link: Volker Blanz and Thomas Vetter, 1999, A Morphable Model For The Synthesis Of 3D Faces . I have read this paper but I did not get the concept of how PCA works in 3DMM. Can anybody explain it in layman's terms?
