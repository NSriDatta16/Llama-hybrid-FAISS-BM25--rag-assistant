Standardization of continuous variables in binary logistic regression

My data contains binary outcome variable and 4 regressors. 2 regressors are binary and 2 are continuous (truncated to whole numbers). Under what circumstances should the continuous variables be standardised in logistic regression? According to this article variables should be standardised if they are not in the same scale. However, this is slightly confusing for me, we have not talked about standardisation in the context of logistic regression in class.
