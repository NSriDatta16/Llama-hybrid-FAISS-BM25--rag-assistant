SGDClassifier: Online Learning/partial_fit with a previously unknown label

My training set contains about 50k entries with which I do an initial learning. On a weekly basis, ~ 5k entries are added; but the same amount "disappears" (as it is user data which has to be deleted after some time). Therefore I use online learning because I do not have access to the full dataset at a later time. Currently I'm using an SGDClassifier which works, but my big problem: new categories are appearing and now I can't use my model any more as they were not in the initial fit . Is there a way with SGDClassifier or some other model? Deep learning? It doesn't matter if I have to start from scratch NOW (i.e. use something other than SGDClassifier ), but I need something which enables online learning with new labels.
