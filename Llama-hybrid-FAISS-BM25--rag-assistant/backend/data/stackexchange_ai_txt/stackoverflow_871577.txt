WPF Button, Command Target, Binding Question

I have a DesignerCanvas (derived from canvas) that I can add UIElements to, then drag\drop\move\group and move them around. On the toolbar I have a button that is bound to a group command. The problem that I have is that I can have a control that also contains a DesignerCanvas. So there are nested canvas's, and I want the GroupCommand on the toolbar to apply to the canvas that is in focus. In the above binding it is binding only to the root canvas. I suppose I could track the current canvas and expose it in the viewmodel for the binding, but I'd prefer to avoid tracking the activecanvas. Any suggestions for a creative binding here? Thanks, jeff
