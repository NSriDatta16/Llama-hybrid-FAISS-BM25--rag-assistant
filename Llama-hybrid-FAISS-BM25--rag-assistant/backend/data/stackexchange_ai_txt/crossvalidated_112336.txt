I strongly suggest you All of statistics for a basic background. Such as covariance, mean, Test Hypothesis and so on. More related to machine learning the best book is absolutely The element of statistical learning If you want to go more in the software engineering implementation of this method for big data problem than a good book could be Mining massive dataset I think that would be very difficult - impossible to learn well only from these books in your own. This is because the field is too wide. I suggest you to do some free online courses. The website Udacity as some good course on statistics and machine learning and there is also a very popular course on Coursera.
