You'll want to use touchesBegan: and touchesEnded: methods of UIResponder. All UIViews are UIResponders. So just override those methods on whatever UIView you want the users to touch. Note that there are four touches methods: touchesBegan: touchesMoved: touchesEnded: touchesCancelled: If you override any of them, you are required to override all of them. So for the ones you don't care about, just have practically-empty implementations that just call [super touchesMoved: arg1 withEvent: arg2] , etc.
