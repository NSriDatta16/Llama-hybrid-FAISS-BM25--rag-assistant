You can use the WriteCodeFragment task to generate with each build a new source file (named perhaps _AssemblyInfo.cs) that is not in source control and that contains only the AssemblyVersion attribute. Add the _AssemblyInfo.cs file to the project normally and generate it in a custom target that executes prior to the Build step. That would be less intrusive than manipulating the assembly after you've built it.
