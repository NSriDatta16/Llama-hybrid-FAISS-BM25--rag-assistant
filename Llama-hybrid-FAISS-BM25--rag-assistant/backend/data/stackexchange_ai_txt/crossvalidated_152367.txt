While reading this book here (Nagarajan, 2103 [1]), I came across this valuable information that I am shamelessly citing here: Using prior knowledge on the data. The boundaries of the intervals are defined, for each variable, to correspond to significantly different real-world scenarios, such as the concentration of a particular pollutant (absent, dangerous, lethal) or age classes (child, adult, elderly). Using heuristics before learning the structure of the network. Some examples are: Sturges, Freedman-Diaconis, or Scott rules (Venables and Ripley, 2002). Choosing the number of intervals and their boundaries to balance accuracy and information loss (Kohavi and Sahami, 1996), again one variable at a time and before the network structure has been learned. A similar approach considering pairs of variables is presented in Hartemink (2001). Performing learning and discretization iteratively until no improvement is made (Friedman and Goldszmidt, 1996). These strategies represent different trade-offs between the accuracy of the discrete representation of the original data and the computational efficiency of the transformation. This information is provided, in case you want to justify the binning method you wish to use and not just use a package directly. [1]: Nagarajan R.
