Embedding IE seems to be an easier way to do this as DR says , but you can also do this manually by drawing it all on a canvas, an easy way would be to create two bitmaps (one without a selection and another selected (could be as complicated as you like - dashed, colored, ... )), and you need to know the positions/rects of all your characters which would be somewhat difficult for long texts. You basically show the unselected bitmap, and overlap the selected parts by portions of the second image. You would also need to handle the selection manually by OnMouseDown, OnMouseMove, OnMouseUp...
