My question is: Is there any down-side(Performance, maintenance, etc...) to having an application with many dlls? A downside with many DLLs ? No A downside with too many DLLs ? Sure. So how many is too much? An assembly is an means of organization, like namespaces and classes. Namespaces define logical boundaries, assemblies physical boundaries. You should try to keep assemblies coherent, and view them as system modules. And yes, there would be a (small) performance problem if you had hundreds of them. But with 40, I don't see a problem.
