I would also suggest k2 blackPearl.. it has great workflow capabilities and integration with sharepoint but K2 blackPoint (another k2 software) also integrates very nicely with SharePoint, actually you can only use it with sharepoint. if you want to cut costs k2 blackPoint could be an option rather than k2 blackPearl. and because BlackPoint can integrate with infopath, you can make better gui rather than filling out Sharepoint lists when you want to make a new item. not that i have anything against filling out lists, look are important for me (personal preference i guess) anyway, using any k2 application cuts development time, coz its relatively easy to develop (drag n drop kinda stuff). K2 say's no coding, but you can add code.
