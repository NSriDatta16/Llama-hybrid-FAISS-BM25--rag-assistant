How to use correlated input data to create a ML model in R

I would like to create a machine learning model with R using, for example, the simple linear regression. For independent observations, I use the command model But I have the following dataset, where the observations are correlated: To be specific, I have different types of steel (IDs) and 2 substances (X1 and X2) that have a corrosive effect (Y) on them. The substances are considered in 2 different quantities (in ascending order) and all the 8 rows consider their different combination. For example: Row1 -> taking only subtance1 in quantity 1cl, gives the effect of 1% of corrosion for the steel of type1. Row 8 -> the combination of subst.1 in quantity 2cl and subst.2 in quantity 2cl gives the effect of 9% of corrosion for the steel of type1. Then, I have other types of steel (steel2, steel3, etc.) treated with the same subtances (subst.1 and subst.2) in different quantities (1.5cl and 3.2cl for steel2, 2.3cl and 3.8cl for steel3, etc.) in all the 8 combinations. What I would like to do with a machine learning model (if it is possible) is to predict the value of the effect of the 2 substances for a new kind of steel, taking as input the 2 subtances and their effects when they are taken singularly, in order to have the prediction of the effects when the substances are taken combined. Do you think it is possible and, in this case, could you give me any suggestions about the method I have to use? Many thanks in advance.
