It sounds like you want the linktractor script from my HTML::SimpleLinkExtor module. You might also be interested in my webreaper script. I wrote that a long, long time ago to do something close to this same task. I don't really recommend it because other tools are much better now, but you can at least look at the code. CPAN and Google are your friends. :) Mojo::UserAgent is quite nice for this, too: use Mojo::UserAgent print Mojo::UserAgent ->new ->get( $ARGV[0] ) ->res ->dom->find( "a" ) ->map( attr => "href" ) ->join( "\n" );
