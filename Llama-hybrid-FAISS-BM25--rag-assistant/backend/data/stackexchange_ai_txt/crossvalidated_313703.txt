Factor for rows without attribute and rows with attribute and additional characteristic

I have run an experiment in which I've measured some metric X , and collected an associated attribute attr 's value if and only if the value of X exceeds some threshold t . If a case's X value doesn't exceed t , then attr is not captured. Here's what my data look like: ID attr_val no_attr outcome 0 NaN 1 0 1 NaN 1 1 2 0 0 1 3 4 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 1 0 0 Where ID is a unique identifier for each case, no_attr indicates whether the attr value was captured for that particular case (i.e. whether the X value exceeded t ), and the binary outcome outcome is shown. Now, I want to predict outcome based on the attribute value if a case's X exceeded t , and I also want to measure whether a case's X not exceeding t is predictive, as well. In order to keep IDs 0 and 1 in the model, attr_val will need to be populated with some value, not just nulls. But I don't really feel comfortable filling in 0, for example, because IDs 0 and 1 didn't have a chance to give their attr_val because their X values didn't exceed t . However, this X -exceeding- t criterion is very important to my experiment, so I can't just take the attr_val s for rows 0 and 1 anyway. Running a logistic regression of the form outcome ~ attr_val + no_attr currently would make the design matrix singular, as just zeroes are included for no_attr if I haven't filled in any nulls in attr_val . Is the right approach here to augment no_attr by 1 so we're not multiplying by zeroes down the line? Or is there a better way to encode this problem?
