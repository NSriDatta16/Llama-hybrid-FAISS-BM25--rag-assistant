If you're using one of the Astra components you'll need to drag it into your library (or on stage, and then delete it if you'd rather created it with ActionScript). The classes are pre-compiled into a symbol (just like the other fl.* components, like Button or List) and the skins are also symbols that must be in the library (unless you manually change all skin styles using the appropriate setStyle() calls).
