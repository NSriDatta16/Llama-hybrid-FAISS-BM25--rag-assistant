Can I compare the average coefficients of variation?

I have two datasets. The first shows a populations choices for mode of transport (3 modes) in 6 different areas. The second shows the same populations responses to concerning attributes (13 attributes) in their public transport experiences across the same 6 different areas. I would like to compare how varied each dataset is. For the first dataset I find the coefficient of variation for each mode of transport across the 6 different areas. I am left with 3 coefficients of variation. For the second dataset I find the coefficient of variation for each attribute acrosss the 6 different areas. I am left with 13 different coefficients of variation. Could I take the average of the 3 coefficients of variation and compare it to the average of the 13 coefficients of variation as a means of comparing the variance between the two datasets? i.e. Dataset 1 has a low average coefficient of variation, while Dataset 2 has a high average coefficient of variation, therefore, Dataset 2 is more varied than Dataset 1. My knowledge of statistics is quite basic and I'm sure my use of language reflects that. Let me know if you need any clarification. Thanks!
