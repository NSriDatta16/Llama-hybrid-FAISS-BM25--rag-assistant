How can I make a "greenscreen" web app?

In informal conversations with our customer service department, they have expressed dissatisfaction with our web-based CSA (customer service application). In a callcenter, calls per hour are critical, and lots of time is wasted mousing around, clicking buttons, selecting values in dropdown lists, etc. What the dirrector of customer service has wistfully asked for is a return to the good old days of keyboard-driven applications with very little visual detail, just what's necessary to present data to the CSR and process the call. I can't help but be reminded of the greenscreen apps we all used to use (and the more seasoned among us used to make). Not only would such an application be more productive, but healthier for the reps to use, as they must be risking injury doing data entry through a web app all day. I'd like to keep the convenience of browser-based deployment and preserve our existing investment in the Microsoft stack, but how can I deliver this keyboard-driven ultra-simple greenscreen concept to the web? Good answers will link to libraries, other web applications with a similar style, best practices for organizing and prioritizing keyboard shortcut data (not how to add them, but how to store and maintain the shortcuts and automatically resolve conflicts, etc. EDIT: accepted answers will not be mini-lectures on how to do UI on the web. I do not want any links, buttons or anything to click on whatsoever. EDIT2: this application has 500 users, spread out in call centers around North America. I cannot retrain them all to use the TAB key
