So, instead of storing the previous point, you'd rather store the previous angle? Perhaps I can discourage you from doing that. Instead of keeping a struct of two floats, you'd keep a single float (angle), but add complexity to the application, for very little gain. Revisit that code in 6 months and you'll wonder why you spent all that time fiddling with trigonometry just to save one float. My 2Â¢. It is an interesting trig problem nonetheless :)
