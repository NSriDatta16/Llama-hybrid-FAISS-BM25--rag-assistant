This shouldn't be too bad under the constraint that you hold an Int64 in memory for every line-feed in the file. That really depends upon how long the line of text is on average, given 1000 bytes per line you be looking at around (10,000,000,000 / 1000 * 4) = 40mb. Very big, but possible. So try this: Scan the file and store the ordinal offset of each line-feed in a List Binary search the List with a custom comparer that scans to the file offset and reads the data.
