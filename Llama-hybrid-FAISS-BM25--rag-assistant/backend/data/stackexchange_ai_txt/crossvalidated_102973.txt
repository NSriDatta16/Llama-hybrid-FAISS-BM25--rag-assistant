Creating observed/expected ratio using logistic regression

I am using logistic regression to benchmark the performance of some students in different years. I created a scenario as below: mydata 0.5, # then it is assumed that the student will get admitted compare.data[,"predict_admit"] 0.5, 1, 0) table(compare.data[,c("admit", "predict_admit")]) # predict_admit # admit 0 1 # 0 59 6 # 1 26 9 From the table, it is seen that 15 students were predicted to get admitted and actual number of students get admitted is 35, so the observed/expected ratio is 35/15 = 2.33 , as it is larger than 1 , so I will say that students in year 1996 are performing better than the benchmark. Can I draw my conclusion using the method mentioned above? Also, how should I set the threshold? Or should I sum(compare.data[,"predict"]) and treat it as expected value? Update 1 I tried and used ROC curve to determine the threshold: library(ROCR) benchmark.data[,"predict"] And the charts suggests that threshold at 0.35 seems to maximize sensitivity and specificity.
