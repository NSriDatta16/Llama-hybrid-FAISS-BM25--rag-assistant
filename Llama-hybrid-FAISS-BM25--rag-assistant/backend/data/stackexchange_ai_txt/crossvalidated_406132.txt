You should update your confidence in B by comparing the probability of seeing D given that B is true versus the probability given that it is false. This is Bayesian updating. It's unclear what your discussion of "trust" means. Presumably, you mean something along the lines of "S said that X was true, but I don't have complete confidence in S's accuracy, so I'm not certain that X is true". But Bayesian updates are on what you see. If you see S claiming that X is true, then the Bayesian update is done based on the probability of seeing S claim that X is true. Whether X is in fact true is not important, because that's not what the update is based on.
