Pooling data for logistic regression

I want to run a logistic regression on greyhound races. For each race I have a dummy variable (y) that takes value one when the dog wins and zero otherwise. Unfortunately the number of hounds in each race can vary as some are withdrawn for whatever reason. Currently I pool the data by vertically concatenating to create one huge column or race results and one large column for each independent variable. Is this the correct way to pool the data for this type of problem? Are there any issues with the fact that the data originally came from separate races often with different numbers of dogs running?
