If you're still having trouble, you can get the entire JavaEE API (including javax.persistence) at: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/documentation/apis-139520.html The link is entitled "Download the Java EE 6 API Specifications". I linked to the main page, because that is a good place to start for any JavaEE documentation.
