Apache .htaccess redirect for webdav storage?

I have the webdav service up and running on my Apache web server. When I upload a file via webdav, it is placed at the root of my public_html directory. I also have full visibility to all the files and directories under public_html. Is it possible to redirect webdav to point to a specific file directory, preferably to a directory like https://mysite.com/storage ? I'm assuming this will be a htaccess technique but would appreciate any advice or pointers. Thank you.
