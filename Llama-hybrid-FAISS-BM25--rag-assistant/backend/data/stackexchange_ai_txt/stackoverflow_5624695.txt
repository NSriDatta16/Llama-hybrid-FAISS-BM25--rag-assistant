Printing the names of all the people greater than age 18?

This was a pretty good question that was posed to me recently. Suppose we have a hypothetical (insert your favorite data storage tool here) database that consists of the names, ages and address of all the people residing on this planet. Your task is to print out the names of all the people whose age is greater than 18 within an HTML table. How would you go about doing that? Lets say that hypothetically the population is growing at the rate of 1200/per second and the database is updated accordingly(don't ask how). What would be your strategy to print the names of all these people and their addresses on an HTML table?
