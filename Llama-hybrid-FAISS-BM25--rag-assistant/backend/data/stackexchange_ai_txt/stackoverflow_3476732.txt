How to loop backwards in python?

I'm talking about doing something like: for(i=n; i>=1; --i) { //do something with i } I can think of some ways to do so in python (creating a list of range(1,n+1) and reverse it, using while and --i , ...) but I wondered if there's a more elegant way to do it. Is there? EDIT: Some suggested I use xrange() instead of range() since range returns a list while xrange returns an iterator. But in Python 3 (which I happen to use) range() returns an iterator and xrange doesn't exist.
