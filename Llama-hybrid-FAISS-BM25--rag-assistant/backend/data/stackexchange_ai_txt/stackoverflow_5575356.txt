A number of things to look at: You could be getting the path incorrect. The most robust way to implement the file path calculation is. (This is probably NOT the problem, but it is tidier this way ... and it gives you a myFile object for testing later on.) // This avoids assumptions on what the pathname separator is File dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File myFile = new File(dir, "recordertest.3gp"); mFileName = myFile.getAbsolutePath(); // ... and write the pathname to your log so that // you can confirm it is what you expect Check that your application has permission to create / write files to that path. Check that your application is actually getting past the point in the code where it should have created the file. After the application has gotten past that point, use File.exists() (on the myFile object) to check if the file has been created. Check the log using logcat ...
