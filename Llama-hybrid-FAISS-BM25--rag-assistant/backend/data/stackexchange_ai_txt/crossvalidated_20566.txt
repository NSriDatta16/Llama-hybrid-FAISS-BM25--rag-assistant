the Jaccard index is a positive definite kernel as can be checked in A Short Tour of Kernel Methods for Graphs , by GÃ¤rtner, Le, and Smola; see definition 1.4 and references below. Doing a PCA on a matrix of Jaccard similarities is akin to doing kernel PCA , that is doing PCA in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions (on sets) induced by the Jaccard similarity (or better said, kernel). There's a relatively good understanding of such a method for data analysis.
