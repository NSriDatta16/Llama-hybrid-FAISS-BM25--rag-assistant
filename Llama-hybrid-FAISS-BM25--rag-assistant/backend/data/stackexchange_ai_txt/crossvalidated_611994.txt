Principal component analysis and correlation

Hello everyone and good day to you, Could you please explain how to use principal components in principal component analysis in a correlation analysis? I performed a PCA on my dataset and extracted 2 components form 8 variables; Now I'm wondering how to use pearson or spearman correlation analysis to find out the correlation between PC1(or PC2) and, let's say, another variable. I mean, I want to do a regression analysis in which my two extracted components are independent variables and each participant's age (for example) is the dependent variable. How should I do this? Many thanks.
