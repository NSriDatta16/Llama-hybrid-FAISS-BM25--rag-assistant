Prediction of unknown triples for relational learning tasks using RESCAL

Background: I am focusing on a relational learning task, where links between entities are predicted across several relations. An example of a relation in this task is if two entities have the same survival outcome after a natural disaster; e.g. if Mary and Bob survived then an edge (or a 1) exists between. These relations are concatenated into a 3 mode tensor and the RESCAL relational learning algorithm is applied for entity link prediction. Refer to: Factorizing YAGO Scalable Machine Learning for Linked Data, Nickel, M. et al for specifics. RESCAL is available in Python with pip install sklearn-tensor . My Question: In 1 , Section 3.1.1, link prediction for new data is given as X_i_j_k ~= A * R_k * A.T. But it's not explicitly stated which matrices are used to predict entity links in relation k. Given a factorization A, R for training relational data and a new factorization new_A, new_R for new relational data, are new links predicted from new_A * R new_A.T? Code: from numpy.random import binomial from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, coo_matrix from sktensor.rescal import als as rescal_als X1 = csr_matrix(binomial(1, 0.25, size=(4,4))) X2 = csr_matrix(binomial(1, 0.25, size=(4,4))) X3 = csr_matrix(binomial(1, 0.25, size=(4,4))) A, R, _, _, _ = rescal_als([X1, X2, X3], 2) new_X1 = csr_matrix(binomial(1, 0.25, size=(4,4))) new_X2 = csr_matrix(binomial(1, 0.25, size=(4,4))) A_new, R_new, _, _, _ = rescal_als([new_X1, new_X2], 2) # Prediction of Unknown Triples # see: Section 3.3.1: http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/papers/p271.pdf new_X3 = A_new.dot( R[2] ).dot(A_new.T) new_X3 > new_X3.mean() # link prediction for some threshold theta?
