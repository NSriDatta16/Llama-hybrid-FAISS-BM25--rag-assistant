Boost Python example failed twice

Am I alone who tried to use following combination: boost_1_45_0, MSVC 10, Python31 ? I have discovered that basic sample from boost (boost_1_45_0\libs\python\example\quickstart\embedding.cpp) Neither compiled (I found how to fix it see below) nor works. Compile time problem: if (PyImport_AppendInittab("embedded_hello", initembedded_hello) == -1) throw std::runtime_error("Failed to add embedded_hello to the interpreter's " "builtin modules"); I have discovered that correct name is not initembedded_hello but init_module_embedded_hello . So my first question am I right about this renaming? The second problem is SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call when importing my declared module: from embedded_hello import * Commenting out importing shows that internal python's modules (like a io) works fine. So the second question what the problem with importing? Any help would be appreciated!
