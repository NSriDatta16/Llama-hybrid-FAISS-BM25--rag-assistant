This is not a complete answer, but may be the start of one. It's as far as I got with this in an hour or so of playing; I'm posting it as an example of what I'm looking for, and perhaps an inspiration to others working on the problem. I start with S 0 , which is the average resulting from the previous average S -1 and the sample Y 0 taken at t 0 . (t 1 - t 0 ) is my sample interval and α is set to whatever is appropriate for that sample interval and the period over which I wish to average. I considered what happens if I miss the sample at t 1 and instead have to make do with the sample Y 2 taken at t 2 ? Well, we can start by expanding the equation to see what would have happened if we had had Y 1 : S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)S 1 , where S 1 = αY 1 + (1-α)S 0 Substituting: S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)(αY 1 + (1-α)S 0 ) S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)αY 1 + (1-α)(1-α)S 0 S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)αY 1 + (1-α) 2 S 0 I notice that the series seems to extend infinitely this way, because we can substitute the S n in the right-hand side indefinitely: S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)αY 1 + (1-α) 2 (αY 0 + (1-α)S -1 ) S 2 = αY 2 + (1-α)αY 1 + (1-α) 2 αY 0 + (1-α) 3 S -1 etc. Ok, so it's not really a polynomial (silly me), but if we multiply the initial term by one, we then see a pattern: S 2 = (1-α) 0 αY 2 + (1-α)αY 1 + (1-α) 2 αY 0 + (1-α) 3 S -1 Hm: it's an exponential series. Quelle surprise! Imagine that coming out of the equation for an exponential moving average! So anyway, I have this x 0 + x 1 + x 2 + x 3 + ... thing going, and I'm sure I'm smelling e or a natural logarithm kicking around here, but I can't remember where I was heading next before I ran out of time.
