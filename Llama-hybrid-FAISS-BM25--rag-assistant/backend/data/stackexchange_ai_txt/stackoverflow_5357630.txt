I don't believe there are any Microsoft-made DITA libraries available for .NET. There was a paper written for SIGDOC 2008 called "Pragmatic DITA on a budget" that refers to generating DITA content from commented C# code. A PDF is available here. This probably isn't quite what you're looking for, but it could be useful... It might be worth getting in touch with the author about this project.
