If linear combination of two time series processes is non-stationary does it mean one of the two series is non-stationary

Suppose I have 2 time-series processes. If they are jointly weakly stationary then the linear combination is weakly stationary. If the linear combination is non-stationary does it mean at least one of the two processes is non-stationary? I can't come up with an example of where this last statement is false.
