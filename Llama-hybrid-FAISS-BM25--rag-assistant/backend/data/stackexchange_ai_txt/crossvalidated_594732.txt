Interpolate / Impute time series (sparse measurements)

I observed a manufacturing process that yielded ~40,000 parts I sampled 200 of these parts (every 200th part) and measured their properties My ultimate goal is to show that sensor data, that describes each of the ~40,000 production cycles, can be used to predict the resulting part quality. If I fit a regressor to just a random test split of the 200 measured parts and score the model on the testsplit, this already works pretty well (with a coefficient of determination around .66 for linear regression and even better results with non-linear models). I want to synthetically increase the amount of data points though to test how the regressors perform with more data (since the data has a clear trend: with a continuing process, the part quality decreases). What I tried is linear interpolation and spline interpolation. However, these don't account for the uncertainty in the measurements itself and in the data points around the measurements, e. g. in the part quality of part 100 that lies in between two real measurements. I think that my problem has been tackled countless times before, but I am missing keywords to research . I know what I want to do is called imputation, but I don't find approaches that account for uncertainty besides Gaussian Processes / Gaussian Process Regression. But tbh, I am lost with these since I've never worked with Gaussian Processes. Another idea I had was to add noise to the interpolation depending/weighted on/by the distance to a real measurement. Hence, my questions: Are GP a valid approach towards my problem? Are there any other approaches towards my problem that I have not thought of? Any keywords that I could research? I tried out the Python/sklearn implementation for Gaussian Process Regression, however, couldn't find out just from the docs how to choose the kernel and the length scale of the kernel parameters. If you have any resources that could help me with best practices, I would be very glad. Thanks in advance!
