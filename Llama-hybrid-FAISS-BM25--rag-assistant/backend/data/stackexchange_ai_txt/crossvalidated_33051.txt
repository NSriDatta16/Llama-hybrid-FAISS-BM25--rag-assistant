One standard approach is to use a restricted Boltzmann machine to do the feature extraction, and then reconsider the RBM as a neural network and finish the training using back-propagation. See, for example, G. E. Hinton, "To Recognize Shapes, First Learn to Generate images," Progress in brain research, vol. 165, pp. 535-547, 2007. This is an example of automated feature extraction . It sounds like you are also interested in human-directed feature extraction , for which I am looking forward to other people's answersâ€¦
