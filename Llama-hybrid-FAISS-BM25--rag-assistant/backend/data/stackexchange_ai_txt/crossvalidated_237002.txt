Estimating percentage time foraging using binomial data

I have collected data on an animal that is either in its burrow (0) or out foraging (1). Each data point has a time stamp associated with it. What I want to know is, what percentage of time does the animal spend in the burrow? Example data Date Time Foraging 10/1 10:00 1 10/1 10:30 0 10/1 13:30 0 . . . 10/1 17:00 1 Here is some sample code that will create a toy data set: state = rep(seq(0,1),5000) time = NULL for (i in 1:length(state)){ if (state[i]==0) {time[i] = rpois(1,4)*10} if (state[i] == 1) {time[i] = rexp(1,1) * 10} } df = data.frame(state,time) the dataset df represents state (0 = "in burrow", 1 = "foraging") and a time spent doing the activity. I wrote the code so that the animal spends ~ 40 minutes in its burrow and 10 minutes foraging, drawing from different distributions. I am assuming that I should be able to sample from the toy data set and recover the values. If I can do this, I may be reasonably sure of the estimates that I obtain from the collected data. I thought that I would do a simple binomial, but the data points are not equidistant, so then I thought possibly a poisson distribution, but that would get me a rate.
