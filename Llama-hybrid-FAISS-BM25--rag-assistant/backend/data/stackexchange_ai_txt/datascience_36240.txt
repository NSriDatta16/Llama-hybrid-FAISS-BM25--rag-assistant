How to deal with Nominal categorical with label encoding?

So if my dataset looks like this: names life_style instrument times 0 sid creative piano 1.5 1 aadi artistic guitar 1.4 2 aman traveller drum 1.1 3 sid artistic guitar 1.5 4 aadi creative drum 1.4 Now i want to deal with those Nominal categorical variables , Easy and go to approach is use Label encoding , But suppose if i am using sklearn label encoder then: from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder big_data = dataset_pd.apply(LabelEncoder().fit_transform) which will output: names life_style instrument times 0 2 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 1 2 0 0 3 2 0 1 2 4 0 1 0 1 Now it is converting each column but each column have same numeric values range from 0 to 5. The instrument variable is now similar to 'names' variable since both will have similar data points, which is certainly not a right approach. I have few questions : How should i treat those values without loosing information ? better approach for this type of data points ? I am thinking to use random forest for this type of data , Any suggestion on model also will be helpful for me. If some variable are appearing only once in huge dataset should i remove those variables ? Thank you in advance !
