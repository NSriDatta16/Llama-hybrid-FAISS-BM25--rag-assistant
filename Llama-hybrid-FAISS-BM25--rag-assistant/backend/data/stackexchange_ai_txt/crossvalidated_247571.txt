Measures of association between multiple binary time series

I have two time series that are binary -- $$ Y_i(t_m) \text{ for } m = 1,..., \tau $$ and $$ Y_k(t_m) \text{ for } m = 1,..., \tau $$ where either time series only take on the values 0 or 1. $$ Y_j(t_m) \in \{0, 1\} \text{ for } m=1,...,\tau $$ I want to measure the association between these two times series, where the two time series are intrinsically non-linear and therefore estimators of cross-correlation are not the most appropriate statistics. I've seen some information on Mutual Information, but I'm unsure how to calculate a measure over the time course of a pair of time series.
