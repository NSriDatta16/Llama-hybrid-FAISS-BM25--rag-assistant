If (())=41()+92()+43() is the equation of the SVM, what in the wikipedia entry for SVM is the formula $w^T x - b$ , (or better $w^T \phi(x) - b$ after you use the kernel trick) then points in the support vector should have $f(\phi(x)) = \pm 1$ (see this figure in the wiki page ). So just plug in the values of the two points and check whether $f(\phi(x))$ and $f(\phi(y))$ is either +1 or -1.
