Reference for Bayesian statistical methods in high dimensional settings

I am starting to get a knowledge about the Bayesian methods in high dimensional settings. The following two references are what I am getting at. Hjort, Nils Lid. "Bayesian approaches to non-and semiparametric density estimation." Preprint series. Statistical Research Report http://urn . nb. no/URN: NBN: no-23420 (1994). MÃ¼ller, Peter, and Fernando A. Quintana. "Nonparametric Bayesian data analysis." Statistical science (2004): 95-110. Interestingly enough, most Bayesian nonparametrics/parametrics reference did not mention high dimensional setting in full details. The only work that I know of is Chap.9 of : Ghosh, Jayanta K., Mohan Delampady, and Tapas Samanta. An introduction to Bayesian analysis: theory and methods. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007. This is a nice short chapter with emphasis in classical hypothesis testing. However, its material is obviously a bit out-dated given the research progress in this field. A book-length treatment assuming a relatively high-level of pre-knowledge is Frigessi, Arnoldo, et al., eds. Statistical Analysis for High-Dimensional Data: The Abel Symposium 2014. Vol. 11. Springer, 2016. And most high-dimensional related introduction did not give enough time to Bayesian modelling in high dimensional setting. My question is : Are there any reference/introductory paper that allows readers to grasp a panoramic view of Bayesian procedures in high dimensional settings? Preferably it should be readable and gives a big picture instead of falling into too much technicalities. Thanks,
