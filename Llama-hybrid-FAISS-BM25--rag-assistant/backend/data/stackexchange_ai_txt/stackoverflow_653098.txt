I was playing around with a PEG parser to do what you wanted (and may post that as a separate answer later) when I noticed that there's a very simple algorithm that does a remarkably good job with common forms of numbers in English, Spanish, and German, at the very least. Working with English for example, you need a dictionary that maps words to values in the obvious way: "one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, ... "twenty" -> 20, "dozen" -> 12, "score" -> 20, ... "hundred" -> 100, "thousand" -> 1000, "million" -> 1000000 ...and so forth The algorithm is just: total = 0 prior = null for each word w v v: prior+v else prior*v else if w in {thousand,million,billion,trillion...} total For example, this progresses as follows: total prior v unconsumed string 0 _ four score and seven 4 score and seven 0 4 20 and seven 0 80 _ seven 0 80 7 0 87 87 total prior v unconsumed string 0 _ two million four hundred twelve thousand eight hundred seven 2 million four hundred twelve thousand eight hundred seven 0 2 1000000 four hundred twelve thousand eight hundred seven 2000000 _ 4 hundred twelve thousand eight hundred seven 2000000 4 100 twelve thousand eight hundred seven 2000000 400 12 thousand eight hundred seven 2000000 412 1000 eight hundred seven 2000000 412000 1000 eight hundred seven 2412000 _ 8 hundred seven 2412000 8 100 seven 2412000 800 7 2412000 807 2412807 And so on. I'm not saying it's perfect, but for a quick and dirty it does quite well. Addressing your specific list on edit: cardinal/nominal or ordinal: "one" and "first" -- just put them in the dictionary english/british: "fourty"/"forty" -- ditto hundreds/thousands: 2100 -> "twenty one hundred" and also "two thousand and one hundred" -- works as is separators: "eleven hundred fifty two", but also "elevenhundred fiftytwo" or "eleven-hundred fifty-two" and whatnot -- just define "next word" to be the longest prefix that matches a defined word, or up to the next non-word if none do, for a start colloqialisms: "thirty-something" -- works fragments: 'one third', 'two fifths' -- uh, not yet... common names: 'a dozen', 'half' -- works; you can even do things like "a half dozen" Number 6 is the only one I don't have a ready answer for, and that's because of the ambiguity between ordinals and fractions (in English at least) added to the fact that my last cup of coffee was many hours ago.
