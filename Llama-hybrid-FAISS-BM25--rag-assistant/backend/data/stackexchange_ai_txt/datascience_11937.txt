The best way to be successful at getting the job that you want it to show that you can do it. The MOOCs that you mention will give you a good grounding in the basics and should be enough to get you started solving your own machine learning/data science problems. Try a Kaggle competition or two, that is a great way to improve your skills, and a decent grade there will be of interest to a potential employer. Publish your results on Github using something like an iPython Notebook, which will allow your work to be easily seen and judged. Try an analysis on other public data sets, like the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset , or the UCI Diabetes Treatment Dataset those are lots of fun to try, and show that you are keen and willing to develop your skills.
