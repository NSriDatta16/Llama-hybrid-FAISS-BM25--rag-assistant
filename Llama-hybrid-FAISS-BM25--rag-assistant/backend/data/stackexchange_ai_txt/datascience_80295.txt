Neural Networks are very flexible and with a proper architecture + training they can model just about anything. The reasons you don' see ANNs used everywhere is because ANNs are "black boxes", we don't really understand how they work contrary to simpler methods They are very computationally intensive ANNs are indeed used more often in non-linear data because regression is much more efficient to use on linear data. What this shows is that ANNs can solve just about any problem even if the programmer doesn't understand it which is where the saying "Neural Networks are always the second best answer to every problem" comes from; in this case understanding that this is a linear relation and using regression would be the best solution. However, the picture you are referring to appears to be the showing the prediction error rather than a linearity; if the model was 100% accurate then all the points would be on the line, if the predicted value is lower than the real value the point appears above the line and if its higher it appears above it.
