Yes, you can POST asynchronously to HTTPS with XHR. However, cross-site posting is generally disallowed and something as silly as a bad/unknown certificate may throw the process off. On the other hand, it could just be a blatant bug in the code. Follow with standard debugging procedures using a tool that can monitor XHR requests, such as Firebug and pay attention ("use") the XHR error handling mechanisms.
