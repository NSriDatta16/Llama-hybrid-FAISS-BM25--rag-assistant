As mpiktas points out one has to specify the criteria. If one is concerned about adhering to fundamental mathematical/statistical principles you might look at the book ( page 671 and on) Principles of Forecasting . If you want to get a recent evaluation , incomplete in my opinion, you might see this software survey . Sometimes ease-of-use is important , sometimes detecting and incorporating Gaussian violations and augmenting the simple ARMA model is important. Sometimes the degree of "automatic model selection" is important and how they limit the "sample space" from wich to select the "best model". There have been a lot of developments in ARMA modelling and most pieces of software seriously lag academic developments. If I were you I would take one time series that you were interested in and evaluate the software vendors on that one series, not necessarily for how well their automatic procedure worked but HOW IT WORKED. In other words understand their model selection/validation procedure.
