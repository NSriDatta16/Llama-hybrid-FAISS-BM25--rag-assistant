Perhaps you are missing a typename arguments for templatized class like std::map? What is the class or data type for your key/value pair? Seems like you want std::string for your key and pointer to CRTSLogManager object as the value. In that case, your typedef alias FileNameToStorageClass should probably be: typedef std::map FileNameToStorageClass; However, the code you posted does not seem to be a working program at all. For example, this line: string strFilename = "MyFile" won't work unless you defined your own class "string" or have std namespace loaded. I am assuming you are using std::string.
