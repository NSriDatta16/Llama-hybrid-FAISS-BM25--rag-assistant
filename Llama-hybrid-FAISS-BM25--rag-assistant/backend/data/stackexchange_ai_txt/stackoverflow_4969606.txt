Yes there is such a thing very much indeed. We have just put Neo4j hosted in Windows Azure and as such it may naturally back an ASP.NET solution or any other front end solution that you might want to have! Besides it is very easy to communicate with the Neo4j server from .NET since it speaks over HTTP using REST. It's as natural to speak to it as it is to speak with Windows Azure Storage. http://neo4j.cloudapp.net/
