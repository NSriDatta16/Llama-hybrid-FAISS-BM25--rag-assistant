I have to say I regard that as an abuse of XML. But I've checked and sadly it is well formed so NSXMLParser (which I assume is what you are using) should be able to cope with it. You basically need to check which element you are in by handling the start element and end element events in your NSXMLParserDelegate . Then after receiving the –parser:didEndElement:namespaceURI:qualifiedName: message for begin-paragraph grab all the text you receive in -parser:foundCharacters: until you receive –parser:didStartElement:namespaceURI:qualifiedName:attributes: for end-paragraph
