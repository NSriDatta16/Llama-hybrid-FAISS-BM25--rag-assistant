Is it possible to take sample_weight in account with MLPclassifier

I am building 4 different models on the same dataset (classification tree (CT), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR) and neural network (NN)). Here is my dataset structure: Rows correspond to each day Dependant variable tells if that day had an avalanche (event) or not (non-event) Dependant variables was originally continuous (1, 2, 3, 4, etc. events par day), but I transformed it to binary (non-event = 0 and event = 1). Event though the dependant variable is now binary, it is still important to give more weight to days with several events than days with only one event. Sample_weight can be used directly in the fit(X, y[, sample_weight]) command for CT (DecisionTreeClassifier), RF (RandomForestClassifier) and LR (LogisticRegression), but it isnâ€™t working the same way for NN (MLPclassifier). I am thus wondering if there is any other way to consider the sample_weight for the MLPclassifier model (NN)?
