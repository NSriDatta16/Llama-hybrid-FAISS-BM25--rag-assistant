how does google analytics calculate metrics like "average time spent"?

how services like google analytics calculate parameters like " average time spent " "number of users that came to the website via search Vs user that hit the url directly etc. I would imagine that google can easily record a HIT when someone clicks on a link in serach result. But after that how long and deep the user is brwosing that perticular website is out of tap...hmmmm ?
