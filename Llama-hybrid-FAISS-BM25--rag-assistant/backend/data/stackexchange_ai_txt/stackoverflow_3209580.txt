What's the best way to parse a string for "bad" words in C#?

I'm thinking of something like: foreach (var word in paragraph.split(' ')) { if (badWordArray.Contains(word) { // do something about it } } but I'm sure there's a better way. Thanks in advance! UPDATE I'm not looking to remove obscenities automatically... for my web app, I want to be notified if a word I deem "bad" is used. Then I'll review it myself to make sure it's legit. An auto flagging system of sorts.
