Applying neural network for simple x^2 function for demonstration purpose

I have tried to train a neural network for a simple x^2 function I developed training data in excel. First column (X) is =RANDBETWEEN(-5,5) i.e random integer between -5 and 5 Second column simply squares first column And third column, my output 'y' column is 0 or 1. 0 if second column is less than 12.5 else 1 I made 850 training examples and used the first column as 'X' and third column as 'y' However I am only able to get a training accuracy of 63%! Where could I have gone wrong? I changed input_layer to 1 and tried hidden units between 5 and 35. Tried regularization lambda 0 to 2 but still only 63% accuracy! Where could I have gone wrong? My predict function is p = 1 if h2(i)>0.5 else 0. Any help will be much appreciated! :-) I also noticed that my neural network's output is 0.3XXX for all training examples ...how is this possible??
