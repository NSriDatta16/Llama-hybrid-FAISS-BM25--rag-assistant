The methods you list in the question are discriminative (i.e. you do not indicate that you used the one-class variety e.g. of SVM). Have you considered one-class classification ? One class classification is probably better suited for credit fraud detection than discriminative classification and as a side effect it does (by construction) not have any difficulties with class imbalance. One-class classification is good for situatione where a* well-defined ("positive") class is to be separated from cases that do not belong to this class. well-defined means that the data points of this class form a (or maybe few separate) clouds, but we need not expect "surprises" in future cases (this is really not different from how we think of classes in discriminative settings) and there are sufficient cases available from this class * there can be several such classes, they are treated separately. cases that do not belong to the positive class (aka the negative class) are ill-defined: We cannot (or need not be able to) describe those cases better than saying they do not belong to the positive class. There may be many reasons (classes) of cases that do not belong to the positive class any new case that does not belong to the positive class may not belong there for an entirely new reason. Side note: specific known classes within the negatives can be modeled as their own class - this does not affect the performance of the recognition of the positive class in any way. In one-class classification, a case can belong to more than one class (consider medical diagnosis: a patient may have several diseases that are independent of each other). Your task sounds to me as if the no-fraud cases are a prime example for a positive class. In addition, if you have examples of specific known types of fraud, you can also model them as their own class. If only few cases are available, recognition of that that (sub)class of fraud will of course be uncertain. But this will not disturb the performance of recognizing no-fraud cases.
