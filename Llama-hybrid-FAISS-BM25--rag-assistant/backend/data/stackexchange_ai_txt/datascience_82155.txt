Here are few things you can try to reduce overfitting: Use batch normalization add dropout layers Increase the dataset Use batch size as large as possible (I think you are using 32 go with 64) to generate image dataset use flow from data Use l1 and l2 regularizes in conv layers If dataset is big increase the layers in neural network. USE callbacks tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau here Hope this mat help, also plot the history graph of training to have a better understanding of your model.
