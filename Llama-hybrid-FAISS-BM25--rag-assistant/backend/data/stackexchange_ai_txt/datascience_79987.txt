The question seems more about notation than autoencoders: $ a,b = argmin_{a,b}f(a,b)$ simply means that $a$ and $b$ are chosen to minimize $f$ . w.r.t. autoencoders, the argmin statement is saying that we want the decoding of the encoded data $X$ to be as similar as possible to the original $X$ . To represent "decoding of the encoding", we can use function composition : $\psi\circ\phi X$ which means $\psi(\phi(X))$ , hence the decoding of the encoding of $X$ . So overall, we are saying that we choose the encoding and decoding functions to minimize the delta between input $X$ and encoded/decoded $X$ . Where the question asks: what does the arg min section and beyond mean? The latter half " and beyond " should be more specific.
