.Net is a managed runtime with libraries. It is not exclusive to building "web" applciation or pages. The .Net Framework is 'the libraries'. The CLR is the runtime (where the specification thereof, is deposited into a standarization organization) C#/VB.Net/F# are flavors of different syntaxus (how do you spell this in plural?) used to instruct the runtime, using the libraries, to perform actions in an order you define (AKA programming) Wanting to learn .Net is akin to learning another language/gammar. If you have no previous knowledge of "language/gammar" itself, you are using this specific language/runtime to learn 'language' in general. Hope this helps,
