changepoint detection and its analysis

I applied changepoint detection provided by ecp package against a given time series. The time series plot marked with identified change points is shown as follows. My question is that, given such a plot, how can I explain to the audience why these are change points. Just based on the observing the plot, it seems to me that it is not very clear why these should be change points.
