I really think that the use of @: to work around such code is an abuse of that escape sequence. The problem should be addressed instead by correctly refactoring the code so that balanced tags can be easily written: @foreach(var section in Model.GroupBy(i => i.SectionName)) { @section.Key @foreach(LocalStorageItem lsi in section) { string fld_name = "f_" + lsi.ItemName; @lsi.ItemName . } } 12 lines of code instead of 18
