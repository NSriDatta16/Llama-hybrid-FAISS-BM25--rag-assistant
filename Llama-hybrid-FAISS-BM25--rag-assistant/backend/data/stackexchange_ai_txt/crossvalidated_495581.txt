Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is mainly concerned with characterizing the linear association between two blocks of variables (or more blocks in generalized CCA). We can think of it as an extension of the use of a correlation matrix to summarize correlations in a multivariate dataset. In this respect, no single block plays the role of a response block which might motivates the idea of regressing one (or more) block onto another one. Partial least squares approaches are better suited for that purpose. However, there already is a very instructive thread on this site: How to visualize what canonical correlation analysis does (in comparison to what principal component analysis does)? , which also points to another thread related to CCA versus PCA+regression. Finally, I should note that there's now a unified approach to all such multi-blocks approaches ((generalized) CCA, interbattery factor analysis, redundancy analysis, hierarchical PCA , multiple co-inertia analysis and PLS path modeling), the Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis, available in R , theorized and implemented by father and son.
