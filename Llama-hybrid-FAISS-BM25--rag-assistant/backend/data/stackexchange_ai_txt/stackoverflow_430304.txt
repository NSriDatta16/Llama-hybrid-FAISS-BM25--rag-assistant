Do you really need the SSO server itself to be running on .net? OpenSSO runs as a Java web app, but it can authenticate users against AD, do Windows Desktop SSO (aka SPNEGO, aka Kerberos) to authenticate users from their Windows login, with no additional username/password step, interoperate with ADFS via WS-Federation and protect web apps running on IIS via a policy agent. So, you can hook up all the Microsofty stuff, plus do SAML 2.0 single sign-on to external partners.
