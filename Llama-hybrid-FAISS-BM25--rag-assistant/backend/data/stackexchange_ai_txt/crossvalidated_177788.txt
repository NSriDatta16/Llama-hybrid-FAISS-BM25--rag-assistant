Generating Lasso Path for Feature Selection

I am building a Logistic regression model and exploring LASSO for feature selection. I generate the lasso path using the following code: lasso_mod This is the plot that I get: Now, I have couple of queries on this plot: As the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) increases, you would expect more and more coefficients to progressively shrink towards zero. And this is what you do see in the plot, except for one variable (var. #8 - the one with the red line on the bottom half of the plot). The coefficient of this variable starts from zero and then moves to a non-zero value at higher values of lambda. Is this expected and if yes, what does this imply? Secondly, I believe that there should be one line for each variable (including the dummy variable that gets created for categorical data). Now, as you can see in the plot there seems to be only 14 lines, but the number of variables that I have (incl. the dummy ones) is 17. And I can access it using the coef function. Am I missing something here?
