How to train a neural network *not* to give a certain output?

I have a neural network with a softmax layer as final layer. The loss function I use is the categorical crossentropy loss. I want to classify an input to belong to exactly one of N classes. But for some of the inputs, I don't know which class they belong to, but only which class(es) they do not belong to. What is the best way to implement this as a training example? The approach I used is best explained by an example: Suppose we want to separate 4 classes and are given a training example that we know does not belong to classes 2 and 3, then I would supply the following vector as target vector: [0.5, 0, 0, 0.5] If instead we knew that the training example does not belong to class 1, then I would supply the following vector as target vector: [0, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3] Is this the correct approach? Is my choice of activation function in the final layer correct?
