I'd like to suggest the Torque Game Engine. Some of the things you're asking for aren't really possible (as others have pointed out), but are problems that have to be tackled in a round about way (like faking the airfoil physics). The Torque engine would be a good starting place for you. There's also a 2D version called Torque Game Builder which might be easier to start with. www.garagegames.com
