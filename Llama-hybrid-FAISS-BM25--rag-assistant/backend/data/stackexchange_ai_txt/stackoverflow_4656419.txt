PHP/MySQL Code Error - Outputs fine via phpMyAdmin but Errors in Browser

I'm running a MySQL Query, here it is: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE LeaderBoard ( `agent_name` varchar(20) NOT NULL, `job_number` int(5) NOT NULL, `job_value` decimal(3,1) NOT NULL, `points_value` decimal(8,2) NOT NULL ); INSERT INTO LeaderBoard (`agent_name`, `job_number`, `job_value`, `points_value`) SELECT agent_name, job_number, job_value, points_value FROM jobs WHERE YEAR(booked_date) = 2010 && WEEKOFYEAR(booked_date) = 49; INSERT INTO LeaderBoard (`agent_name`) SELECT DISTINCT agent_name FROM apps WHERE YEAR(booked_date) = 2010 && WEEKOFYEAR(booked_date) = 49; SELECT agent_name, SUM(job_value), SUM(points_value) FROM leaderboard GROUP BY agent_name ORDER BY SUM(points_value) DESC If i run this query in the phpmyadmin sql field, it works and I get the correct data that I want to use! But when I put this into my PHP script it comes back with an error saying: "Warning: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, string given in C:\xampp\htdocs\reporting_2010.php on line 383" Here is my PHP Code: Reports - Yearly Summary 2010 Reports - Yearly Summary 2010 // - - - - Summary of job booking times by hour Hour Jobs Points Apps "> Summary of job booking times by day Day Jobs Points Apps "> Summary of weekly results Week Starting Jobs Points Apps "> Week Starting Jobs Points Apps "> Week No. , Starting: Day Jobs Points Apps "> Total Agent Jobs Points Apps ">
