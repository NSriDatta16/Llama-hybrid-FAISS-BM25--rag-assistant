How can you encourage your colleagues to communicate better? Lead by example. In my company we often you the term 'to drive something'. Somebody needs to drive a project, needs to drive the testing etc. That means to take on the responsibility for this task and persue it actively. Do not just expect your colleagues to share information, show them what to do and how to do it. When you find out some nice new detail about VS2008, share it with them. But be professional about it. Do not just tell it to the two guys you are having a coffee with later today, prepare a small presentation or word document describing your findings and communicate it to all team members. I definitely would prefer to give a short presentation instead of just sending them an email, but that may not be possible. You can fit this in to regular informatione exchange meetings, but I think it is vital that you keep the same attitude in your day to day work. Don't just do it, live it. (Oh my, I sound like one of those stupidly overpayed motivation coaches! Well, maybe they are right and deserve all the money ;-)
