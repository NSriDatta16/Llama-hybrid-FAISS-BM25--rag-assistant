The loss function in SVM consists of both Classification error and Margin error. Now C is constant that attaches itself to the classification error as given below: SVM_Error = C*Classfication Error + Margin Error So, the high value of C means that classification error will be more than the marginal error and therefore model will focus on classifying all the data points accurately. Conversely, if the low value of C means that marginal error will be more than the classification error and therefore model will focus creating the larger margin for the hyperplane
