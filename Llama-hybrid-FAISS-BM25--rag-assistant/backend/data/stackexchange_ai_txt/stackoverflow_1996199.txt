rails, `flash[:notice]` in my model?

I have a user model in which I have a method for seeing if the user has earned a "badge" def check_if_badges_earned(user) if user.recipes.count > 10 award_badge(1) end If they have earned a badge, the the award_badge method runs and gives the user the associated badge. Can I do something like this? def check_if_badges_earned(user) if user.recipes.count > 10 flash.now[:notice] = "you got a badge!" award_badge(1) end Bonus Question! (lame, I know) Where would the best place for me to keep all of these "conditions" for which my users could earn badges, similar to stackoverflows badges I suppose. I mean in terms of architecture, I already have badge and badgings models. How can I organize the conditions in which they are earned? some of them are vary complex, like the user has logged in 100 times without commenting once. etc. so there doesnâ€™t seem to be a simple place to put this sort of logic since it spans pretty much every model.
