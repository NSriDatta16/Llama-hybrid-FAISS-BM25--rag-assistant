how to handle large categorical values in data frame?

I have over 2 million records which I am using to build the machine learning model. But I have a column with categorical values over 1600. I cannot convert the data into 1600 1-dimensional columns (1,0,0,...) which makes my data frame too complex with a large number of dimensions. Is there any way I can handle the categorical data more efficiently? Reference to some research papers will also help
