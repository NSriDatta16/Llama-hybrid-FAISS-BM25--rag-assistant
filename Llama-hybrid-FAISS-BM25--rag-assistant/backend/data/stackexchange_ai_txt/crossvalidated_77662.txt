Mincer-Zarnowitz regression

I know that Mincer-Zarnowitz type of regressions are typically applied in a time series setting to evaluate forecasts. My question is whether the same type of regressions can be used in a cross sectional setting? Say, my forecast of a variable for entity $i$ is $f_i$ and the realization of the variable is $a_i$. Does it make sense to run the following regression and conduct the joint test $\alpha=0$ and $\beta=1$? \begin{equation} a_i = \alpha + \beta f_i + e_i \end{equation}
