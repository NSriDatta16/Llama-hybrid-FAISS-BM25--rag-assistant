scikit-learn pipeline strategy with both numeric and categorical columns

We are implementing an sklearn pipeline as follows (pseudo code): feature_num = numeric_columns feature_cat = categorical_columns num_pipeline = Pipeline([('feature_select', DataFrameSelector(feature_num)) ,('feature_num_prep', custom_num_prep) ]) cat_pipeline = Pipeline([('feature_select', DataFrameSelector(feature_cat)) ,('feature_cat_prep', custom_cat_prep) ]) feature_pipeline = FeatureUnion(transformer_list=[ ('num_pipeline', num_pipeline) ,('cat_pipeline', cat_pipeline) ]) Since we have in the custom_num_prep transformer the possibility to remove outliers - when we get to the feature_pipeline there is an error: ValueError: [blocks[0,:] has incompatible row dimensions.... The reason is obvious since the cat_pipeline has observations that the num_pipeline has removed. The question is: 1. is there a pythonic way to sync the two dataframes within the pipelines? 2. if not what strategy is there for such situations?
