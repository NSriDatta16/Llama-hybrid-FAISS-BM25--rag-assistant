UX for letting user drag a Google map marker and enter form fields

I want to allow the user to specify the location of something by dragging a marker onto the map. And I also want to let them enter some information about that spot. The problem is that this makes a very complex form. Can this be done in one step? Or do I have to make them choose location first, and then in a second form take the form-field input? How would you guys go about doing this? Are there any good tutorials for this sort of thing out there? Thanks, Alex
