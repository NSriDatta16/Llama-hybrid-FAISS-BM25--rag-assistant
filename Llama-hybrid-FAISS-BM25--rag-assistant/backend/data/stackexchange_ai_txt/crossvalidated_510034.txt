Is there a word or phrase to describe a model that is basically unidentifiable in practice?

So suppose we have a model $f(x|\theta)$ that is theoretically identifiable, so that $\theta_1 \neq \theta_2$ implies $f(x|\theta_1) \neq f(x|\theta_2)$ . However, suppose that data collection is very limited and that, for all samples $X$ taken in practice, for every $\theta$ there exists a $\hat{\theta}$ such that $f(X|\theta) \approx f(X|\hat{\theta})$ . And an example of this would be if $X=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is a time series model in equilibrium, i.e., it is basically constant, over the time period considered, such that $X_i \approx x_c$ for all $i=1,2,3,\dots,N.$ If this was the case, and if for example we had $f(x|\theta) \propto \exp \left(-\prod_i \left(\Delta x_i-\alpha x_i^\beta \right)^2 \right)$ , then the model would, for practical considerations, be unidentifiable since we would have $$\log f(x|\theta) \propto - \prod_i \left(\Delta x_i-\alpha x_i^{\beta_1}\right)^2 \approx - \prod_i \left(\Delta x_i-\alpha x_c^{\beta_1}\right)^2 = -\prod_i \left(\Delta x_i-\tilde{\alpha} x_c^{\beta_2} \right)^2\\ \approx -\prod_i \left(\Delta x_i-\tilde{\alpha} x_i^{\beta_2}\right)^2 $$ for any $\beta_1,\beta_2 > 0$ , where $\hat{\alpha} = \alpha x_c^{\beta_1-\beta_2}$ . If the above was the case, then it would be practically impossible to determine between $(\alpha,\beta_1)$ and $(\hat{\alpha},\beta_2)$ , even though the model is theoretically identifiable. I am curious if there is a word or phrase to describe this situation? And whether my concerns make sense.
