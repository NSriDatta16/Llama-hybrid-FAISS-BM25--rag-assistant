Choosing the best set of features is the objective of feature engineering . Feature engineering combines domain expertise and algorithms in order to extract the best set of predictors for a given problem. The process follows these steps: Domain experts determine which factors may be useful towards predicting the target variable. These factors are transformed into input features Data is collected Feature selection is applied in order to measure the relative importance of each feature to predict the target variable. We can both measure such importance for each feature individually or for combinations of features. Multiple feature selection methods exist, so you would have to choose which one is the best fit for your project requirements. Additionally, and as part of the feature selection process, one could create new features by combining sets of raw input features. We check how the features work with the model, and repeat the process from step 1 if necessary by contacting the domain experts again. As you can see, creating the best set of features is not an automatic process, and domain expertise is very important. This is a very common thing in many data science related tasks, as you will see in the next point. There is not such a thing that a perfect mapping between type of problems and algorithms. The model you may end up using will strongly depend on the nature of your data. You would need to explore the data and ask the domain experts in order to make an informed decision on what method to use. Experience will make the process easier with time, but it is likely that you will have to apply different types of models to your problem in order to look for the best one.
