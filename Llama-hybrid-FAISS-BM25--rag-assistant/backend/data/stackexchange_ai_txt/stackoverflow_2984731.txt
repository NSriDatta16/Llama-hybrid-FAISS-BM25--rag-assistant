The NMAKE utility has been distributed with Visual C++ since back when it was called Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler, and is very similar to Unix make. Previous versions of the IDE actually used NMAKE makefiles, but this isn't true anymore. You can write NMAKE makefiles yourself if you want, but it sounds like you want to know what the IDE does. Starting with VS2010, the build system changes to MSBUILD, which bertelmonster mentioned. But not in VS2008. In VC++ 6.0, C++ projects have their own build engine integrated into msdev.exe . In VS2002 - VS2008, it's a separate tool, VCBUILD . But you can still invoke it via the main IDE, devenv.exe, see the /BUILD option , and devenv is the best way if you have inter-project dependencies in your solution.
