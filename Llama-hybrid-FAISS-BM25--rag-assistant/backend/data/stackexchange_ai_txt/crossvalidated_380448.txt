Is there a standard way to write row-wise median in matrix notation?

The background: I have estimated N time series models, each having the same coefficients. From each of the models i have a column vector of the coefficients: $(\alpha_{i,0},\alpha_{i,1},\alpha_{i,2},\alpha_{i,3})^T$ I store these into a matrix such as: $\Omega = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{1,0} & ... & \alpha_{N,0}\\... & ... & ...\\ \alpha_{1,3} & ... & \alpha_{N,3}\end{bmatrix}$ Now, if i want to calculate row-wise mean, i could have something like: $\overline{\Omega} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{1,0} & ... & \alpha_{N,0}\\... & ... & ...\\ \alpha_{1,3} & ... & \alpha_{N,3}\end{bmatrix} * \boldsymbol{1}^T/N$ That seems like a pretty decent notation anyone can understand (I figure i could just write in words that i calculate a row-wise mean and be done with it...). The question: Is there a common approach in mathematics or statistics how to denote a calculation of row-wise median? Or perhaps slightly different question: can i calculate row-wise median using matrix algebra?
