In your first version you are overriding the paint method and not calling the superclass' paint method. In the second, you are, this allows the code in the base class to paint the text. If you don't want to call the superclass' paint method, you have to change your paint method to calculate the extent of the string you're going to draw and to split it at the appropriate points, making multiple calls to drawText to draw each fragment separately at a different y location. That's what the paint method in LabelField does by default, so you need to emulate it. When you do call the superclass paint method, the reason setting the font on the superclass works and setting the font in your paint method doesn't is because the superclass' paint method is calling setFont on the Graphics object, overwriting what you just did in your paint method.
