Pattern recognition is the “automated discovery of patterns in a training set”, and so it is a general term for machine learning. Classification is the supervised learning problem whose target value is a finite set of classes (as opposed to regression , wherein the target value is a continuous variable). Therefore, classification is a kind of pattern recognition problem.
