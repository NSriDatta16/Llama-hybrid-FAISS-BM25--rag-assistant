Extreme high autocorrelation in MCMCglmm but good prediction

I am fitting a logistic regression model without random effects with options set to: list(R = list(V=1, fix = 1)) nitt=100000 burnin=30000 The data set is very small, around 100 observations. I have categorical and numeric predictors. The auto-correlation is pretty bad in the model for most predictors, and the posterior mean estimates are correspondingly crazy, and keep increasing as I increase the number of iterations. HOWEVER, the predictive power is great. In leave-one-out corss-validation (which is what I am interested in), the model performs perfectly most of the time (some times it makes one error). What does this mean? I understand that the estimates must be wrong, but can I claim the model is in fact doing something right?
