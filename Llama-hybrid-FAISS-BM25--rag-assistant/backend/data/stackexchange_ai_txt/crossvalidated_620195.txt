My odds ratio and CI’s are very high, is it still okay to continue and report the results?

I do my analysis on SPSS and I was doing a ordinal logistic regression to see if the group they belong in (binary, 2 groups ) predict scores on a likert scale 1-7. Whether one of the groups score fall into a higher category of the likert scale. However, the odds ratio is very high (it’s like 18) and the confidence interval for the odds ratio is lower CI = 7 and upper CI is 42. Is this due to the fact that the sample sizes is unequal between the 2 groups. Is it still okay report?
