Yes, this is a slight and common abuse of notation. Recall that in Bayesian statistics there are no point hypothesis under a continuous model since they have probability $0$. No, this is incorrect. The matrix $L_{1\vert 2}$ depends only on $L_1$ and $L_2$, see slide 5. Only the asymptotic distribution of the estimators of $\beta$ depends on the covariance matrix. This is a classical result. The basic idea in the slides is more related to nested models, although they use a conditioning notation. See the following discussion for a distinction between notation and conditioning http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/double-misunderstandings-about-p-values/
