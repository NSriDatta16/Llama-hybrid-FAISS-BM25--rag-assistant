Is there a natural way to determine a threshold for required number of data points?

Often you want to compute a statistic, but only for entities that meet criteria for having a meaningful sample size. For instance, in baseball you often see a footnote like "among batters with at least 100 at bats". A player might have one at bat, get a hit, and have a perfect batting average, but we don't want to include these hitters because the number of data points makes this hitter non-representative. But that choice of 100 at bats for the threshold often seems arbitrary. Is there a way to let the data yield its own optimal threshold value? This would be a procedure that naturally fits the data set with a line separating the players with enough data points from the ones without, based on the relevant metric (e.g. batting average) in the data set itself.
