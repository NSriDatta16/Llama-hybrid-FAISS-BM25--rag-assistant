It sounds very much like you want to do is weight the correlation or beta correlation between an interaction. players belong to a given subset (striker, midfielder, forward, etc) In the "ranking" equation certain interactions would be weighted higher in the ranking (i.e. the interaction between striker + number of goals). To achieve this, you need to create dummy variables for each position (1 or 0). You then weight the beta coefficient of the variable with a given dummy variable. So your equation for rank might be Y (rank) = X (number of goals) + X (position) + (X + W) (striker x number of goals). Where W is some weight. You can also do it as you suggested with some w(X) with each coefficient being weighted. It just depends on how you feel the weight should be applied. The real trick to making this work well is deciding what W will be. So how can you assume that? The problem with weighting beta coefficients is that the weights imply some prior distribution (of which you do not know). You could always do things the Bayesian way.
