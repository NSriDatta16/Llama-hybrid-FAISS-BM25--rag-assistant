On DOS there were a good many different 'GUI' APIs available before Windows came along, all of which basically hid the underlying VGA calls you needed to make if you wanted to code directly. Ones I personally worked with included TurboPascal and Foxpro. There was even, briefly, a Visual Basic for DOS which included a similar API. As well as outputting text these APIs would often include such functionality as drop-down menus, drawing simple boxes, and shading. Some of the more complex ones would even have character-based 'Windows' you could drag around the screen with the cursor. VGA could be accessed in either Text (very much like a mainframe terminal where you effectively just output a character at row/column) or Graphics mode which was much more similar to GDI (although you had to do everything yourself, was slow, and rarely used for anything except early paint and cad programs). Your example is text-mode. On Unix, where such considerations are much more current, the standard is to use Curses , which is a similar text-mode API which hides underlying terminal characteristics.
