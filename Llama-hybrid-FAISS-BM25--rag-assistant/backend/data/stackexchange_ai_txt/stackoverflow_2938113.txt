This may be caused by memory fragmentation. When the application runs for a long time, memory can be fragmented, which means it is filled by many small allocated blocks and free spaces. If you want to allocate a memory block larger than the largest free block, your allocation will fail, even though the total amount of free space suggests that there is enough memory for the allocation to succeed. You may also want to check if you were not accidentally trying to allocate a huge block of memory at one point. I suggest you check the size of the allocation that failed.
