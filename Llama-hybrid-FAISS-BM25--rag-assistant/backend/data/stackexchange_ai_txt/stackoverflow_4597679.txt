How do I register a Tomcat 6 server on NetBeans 6.9.1?

I have just downloaded NetBeans 6.9.1 for JavaEE and installed it with Tomcat 6. Everything went fine and I can run NetBeans, start and stop Tomcat from within the IDE and add and remove servers at will. However when I try and create a Java EE Enterprise Application project my server list is empty. The message I get at the bottom of the wizard for creating projects is "No servers are registered in the IDE. To register a server, click the "Add..." button. If I add a new server from there the drop down list remains empty, however if I then cancel from the wizard and look at the server list (Tools | Server) I wind up with a duplicate Tomcat server in the list, but still no way of selecting it from the setup dialog for the project. This means I cannot create a project and am stalled. I have Googled and got nothing and looked at the NetBeans docs and got nothing, so thought I would ask here. Has anyone else has encountered this problem? Am I missing the magic "make this server show up in the wizard" button? I am running Netbeans 6.9.1, Java 1.6, Tomcat 6.0.26 and Windows 7.
