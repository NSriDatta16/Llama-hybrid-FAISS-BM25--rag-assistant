Repeated measures techniques for uneven trials per condition?

if I have a data set with 3 within-subjects conditions, with different number of trials on each (e.g., cond. A = 8 trials, cond. B = 6 trials, cond. C = 5 trials), what repeated measures technique can I use to evaluate for a within-subjects effect? Is using repeated measures ANOVA fine? I tried using a repeated measures logistic regression via GEE but it says something about "Hessian matrix is singular". Any thoughts on techniques for analyzing uneven number of trials per condition?
