Would OLS be just as good as OLR for analyzing this survey?

I want to use a regression in survey analysis, to determine the extent to which a variety of ordinal (and a few nominal ) independent variables predict a variety of ordinal dependent variables. My understanding is (based on this Laerd guide ) that I can't use OLS, because the dependent variables are ordinal. Instead, I need to use Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR), which can accept continuous, ordinal, or categorical variables as independent variables as long as the dependent variable is ordinal. However, reading similar papers to the one I'm trying to write, I am not seeing much use of OLR for survey analysis. Instead, it seems like social scientists sometimes use OLS even when the dependent variable is actually categorical or ordinal. This paper , for example, appears to be using OLS with a categorical dependent variable. Is it ok or better to use OLS in my survey analysis, even though Laerd says one should not? Is it acceptable in the social sciences? Some more details: I am using SPSS. My field is internet studies/communication. I have not yet checked all the assumptions for OLR, but I am working on it. I have about 500 data points. I am also looking for a non-linear regression technique that will work with my data, because I expect the participants' age to have a roughly parabolic effect on some of of my dependent variables. Tips on what to use are welcome. Thank you so much for your help!
