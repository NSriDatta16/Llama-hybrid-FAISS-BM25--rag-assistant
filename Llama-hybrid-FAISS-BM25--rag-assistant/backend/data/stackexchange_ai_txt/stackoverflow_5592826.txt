Log Garbage Collection in Java Webstart

I want to log the GCs in my Java Webstart Apps. I already tried the option in the jnlp file, but neither in the java console nor in the specified file gc.log appears any logging. I also tried a absolute file-/pathname. I reduced the Xmx to a size, where a GC definitly would happen after a short time.
