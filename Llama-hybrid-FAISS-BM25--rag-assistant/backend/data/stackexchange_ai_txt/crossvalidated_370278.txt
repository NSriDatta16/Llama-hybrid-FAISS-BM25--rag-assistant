Yes. The method you are talking about is called Stacking. It is a type of ensembling method. In this method, in the first stage multiple models are trained and the predictions are stored as features which will be used to train the second stage model. A lot of Kagglers use this method. Generally, you should use more than 2 models for the first stage while stacking (I generally use at least 4-5 models). There are also many methods in which stacking can be performed like simple averaging, majority voting etc. Here is a link to a kaggle kernel which implements stacking on the famous Titanic Dataset which is also a binary classification problem.
