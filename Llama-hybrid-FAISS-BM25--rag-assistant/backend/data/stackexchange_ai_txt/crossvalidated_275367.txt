What exactly does the correlation mean? That question has been asked before, and is answered here. Also, what exactly is meant by the fixed effects intercept? First, it means that it is the average intercept; all of the cities vary in their intercept (as specified by the 1 in the (1|City) argument), but the average intercept is 6.59. The standard deviation of these intercepts is 3.37, so about 68% of the intercepts lie between 6.59Â±3.37. Second, what does the intercept mean? It is the predicted value of the dependent variable when all of the other independent variables are zero. So if you want your intercept to be meaningful, consider rescaling your independent variable such that the zero value is meaningful. For example, if the predictor was measured on a scale of 1 to 7, then the intercept (when the IV = 0) isn't really meaningful because it isn't actually a value in the scale.
