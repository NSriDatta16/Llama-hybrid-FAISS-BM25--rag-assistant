Resize Sprite Flex/ActionScript

I am creating Sprite objects as simple shapes, and would like to know how to resize them dynamically. my question: How can I enable the Sprite to be re-sized on mouse drag(perhaps enabling a only a portion of the Sprite for this behavior)? It might be important to note that I am using the Flex SDK, and therefore do not have full access to the Flash libraries. Thank you in advance.
