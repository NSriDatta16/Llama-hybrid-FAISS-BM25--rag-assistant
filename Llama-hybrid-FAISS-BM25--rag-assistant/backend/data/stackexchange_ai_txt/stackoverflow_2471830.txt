How to get rid of Internet Explorer 7 reloading on fragment change

I have an anchor General somewhere in my page. Clicking this in any browser but IE7 (haven't tried IE6) causes no page reload, as expected. However, under IE7 it reloads the page as soon as it's clicked. The strangest thing is that I have the exact same anchor elsewhere in the page and it causes no reload. The only difference I can see between these is a slight difference in style, and the fact that the faulty anchor is deeply nested in divs, where the other is closer to the top. My questions: Is this a known bug with IE7? If so, is there any work around? If not, any clue as to what might be going wrong? Edit: If you want to see this yourself, go to http://filouguestbook.appspot.com/#!main sign-in with a google account and click on the Settings link in the the top bar. Switch between the General and Accounts pages, the app will reload. From the Accounts page, click on Settings in the top bar, this will switch tab but not reload!
