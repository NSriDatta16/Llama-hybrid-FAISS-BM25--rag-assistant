Setting PHP variables in httpd.conf?

I'd like to automatically change my database connection settings on a per-vhost basis, so that I don't have to edit any PHP code as it moves from staging to live and yet access different databases. This is on a single dedicated server. So I was wondering, can I set a PHP variable or constant in httpd.conf as part of the vhost definition that the site can then use to point itself to a testing database automatically? $database = 'live'; if (some staging environment variable is true) { $database = 'testing'; // and not live } If this isn't possible, I guess in this case I can safely examine the hostname I'm running on to tell, but I'd like something a little less fragile Hope this makes sense many thanks Ian
