I'm surprised that nobody answered with the 'Cake' way to do this. For a straight link, you'll have to tinker a little as the helper expects a path relative to controllers, but it's not difficult. It's the best way to do it if your url is internal to the site, i.e. an action/view handled by CakePHP. link('View', $value->url); ?> http://book.cakephp.org/view/1442/link edit: ...and of course a better way to do it in PHP would be to leverage the double quote parsing - View "; ?> or, if you want to be picky, View "; ?>
