Vague question, but yes. A program's stack in C++ typically starts high in the virtual address space of the program and moves 'down' towards the virtual address space of the program heap. EDIT: Because I have started a controversy in saying yes to this, I will append to the answer. The C++ standard does not call specifically for a stack to be used to implement local storage. It is, however, a common implementation practice to do so as described above.
