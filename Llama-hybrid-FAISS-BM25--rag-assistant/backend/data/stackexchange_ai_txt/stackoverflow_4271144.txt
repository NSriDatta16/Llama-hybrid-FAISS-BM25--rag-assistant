Github push origin master not working

First time since a tutorial in July that I'm trying to do a remote push on Github. I added my SSH key, and i can successfully connect to Github, but when i do: $ git push origin master I get ssh: github: no address associated with name fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly I tried: $ git remote set-url origin git@github:oscargodson/storageLocker.git As i saw that on other posts, but it doesn't seem to help... My project is: https://github.com/OscarGodson/storageLocker in case that helps... maybe my syntax is wrong? Also, not sure if this changes anything either, but I'm on a Windows 7 64bit machine running the Git Shell app (MINGW32) EDIT So, i'm super close, but it's driving me insane. I had a non-fast-forward error, so i pulled my project and now i rm --cached all the files, now im trying to add new files (since this is a complete rewrite of the project) but it says "you cannot do a partial commit during a merge." so i do git merge [FILE] and it says "you have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)" WTF?! It's like an infinite loop... i can't merge until i commit and i can't commit until I merge?!
