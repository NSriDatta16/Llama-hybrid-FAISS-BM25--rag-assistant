Class probabilities in Neural networks

I use the caret package with multi-layer perception. My dataset consists of a labelled output value, which can be either A,B or C. The input vector consists of 4 variables. I use the following lines of code to calculate the class probabilities for each input value: fit I thought that the class probabilities for each record must sum up to one. But I get the following: rowSums(p) # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # 1.015291 1.015265 1.015291 1.015291 1.015291 1.014933 1.015011 1.015291 # 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # 1.014933 1.015206 1.015291 1.015291 1.015291 1.015224 1.015011 1.015291 Can anybody help me because I don't know what I did wrong.
