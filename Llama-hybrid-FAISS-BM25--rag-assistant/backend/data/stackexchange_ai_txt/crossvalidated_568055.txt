Adjusting one distribution of numbers to match another

Disclaimer: I'm fascinated by statistics but it is not my greatest field. I am a rookie who has taken a few basic stats classes and majored in data science. I have the opportunity to use stats more in my career due to my current project and I'm very excited, but I want to seek guidance from experts instead of trying to figure it out by myself. I am not asking anybody to solve this problem for me, I'm looking for advice on how to approach it. I have two distributions of numbers. They are NOT normally distributed. They represent the signal strength of two different radio transmitters. One of the transmitters is more powerful than the other and the signal strengths in that distribution are higher by a statistically significant margin. I need those two distributions to look the same. I need to adjust the signal strengths sent by the weaker transmitter to match the equivalent signal sent by the stronger transmitter. I started by standardizing these distributions, but I'm wondering if there's more that can be done. I have this concept of a single variable curve, something that knows how much weaker the signal is at that given signal level and adjusts accordingly. Maybe when the signal strength is 10, the stronger device is only 1-2 points higher, when the strength is 50 it may average 4-5 points higher, and when it reaches 80 say they are the same. Can this be accomplished with any statistical methods? Thanks for reading and I'll appreciate any feedback.
