That might not be the answer you are looking at, but if you are going to store user's credentials for a third party service, there is no way to secure the storage with software only. As you mentioned it yourself, your app needs to be able to retrieve from that store the original credentials, in order to impersonate the user. And if your app can do it, so can any other code running on that box. Thus, the only real solution is to ensure that only your software is running on the box. That assumes physical security as well, limited access to the machine, full audit and lowering the attack surface as much as possible, by turning off all unnecessary services. On a separate note, if the school services support access delegation (through OAuth for example), you should consider going that route, and get out of the credentials storing business.
