Magento 1.4.2 - Make Registration Fields Not Required

I have tried a very commonly used method to make the telephone field not required during registration, but it doesn't seem to work with Magento 1.4.2 I've made a copy of magento/app/code/core/Mage/Customer/Model/Address/Abstract.php to magento/app/code/local/Mage/Customer/Model/Address/Abstract.php and removed the following code from the validate function in that file if (!Zend_Validate::is($this->getTelephone(), 'NotEmpty')) { $errors[] = $helper->__('Please enter telephone.'); } I have also removed the class="input-text required-entry" from the register.phtml file, but I can't get past the validation. I keep getting the error "Telephone" is a required value. "Telephone" length must be equal or greater than 1 characters. Thanks
