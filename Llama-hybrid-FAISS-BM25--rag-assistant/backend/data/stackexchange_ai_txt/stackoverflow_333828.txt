php mysql date/time question

I've built a small application which has User Management, a frontend console to enter data and a backend console to control parts of the frontend. The frontend adds rows to a MySQL database which are timestamped. The backend needs to be able to select rows from the database between X and Y dates. Everything works so far, except the date part which I'm really struggling with. The frontend SQL input looks like this (simplified with spurious code removed): $date = time(); $top_level_category = $_POST['top_level_category']; $sub_level_category = $_POST['sub_level_category']; $company = $_POST['company']; $agent_name = $_POST['agent_name']; $ticket_id = $_POST['ticket_id']; $sql = "INSERT INTO dacc_data (" . "id, top_level_category, sub_level_category, " . "agent_name, date, ticket_id, company" . ") VALUES (" . "NULL, '$top_level_category', '$sub_level_category', " . "'$agent_name', FROM_UNIXTIME('$date'), '$ticket_id', '$company'" . ")" ; $result = mysql_query($sql) or die (mysql_error()); That seems to work ok, the timestamp is being picked up and added to a DATETIME column in my table. It displays as dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss within the database. So ... my first question is - is this the right way to do it? The second question being, what sort of SQL statement would I need to pull out an array of rows between X and Y date. Apologies if this is rambling a bit, hope it's clear but if you need more information let me know.
