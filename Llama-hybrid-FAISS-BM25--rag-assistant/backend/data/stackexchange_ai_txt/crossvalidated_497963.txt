With respect to BART's ability to handle continuous treatments, I have found two useful references: (Hill, 2011): Section 6 of the paper (named "Estimating Dosage Effects") uses BART to estimate the causal effect of getting a dosage level $d\in \mathbb{R}$ compared to getting a dosage of 0. (Woody et al, 2020): The paper develops a BART model with a linear causal effect of a continuous variable, which is non-linearly moderated by a set of moderator variables. References : Jennifer L. Hill (2011) Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling for Causal Inference, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 20:1, 217-240, DOI: 10.1198/jcgs.2010.08162 Spencer Woody, Carlos M. Carvalho, P.
