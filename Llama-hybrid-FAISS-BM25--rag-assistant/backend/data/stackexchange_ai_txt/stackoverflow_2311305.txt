I have gone half way between using UpdateModel and using the FormCollection, as follows: // POST: /IllnessDetail/Edit [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Edit(IllnessDetail ill) { IllnessDetailFormViewModel mfv = new IllnessDetailFormViewModel(ill); try { ill.username = User.Identity.Name; IllnessDetail sick = idr.GetLatestIllnessDetailByUsername(User.Identity.Name); sick.IdInfectiousAgent = ill.IdInfectiousAgent; sick.IdEncephalitisSubType = ill.IdEncephalitisSubType; sick.IdEncephalitisType = ill.IdEncephalitisType; UpdateModel(sick); idr.Save(); return RedirectToAction("Current", "IllnessDetail"); } catch { ModelState.AddRuleViolations(mfv.IllnessDetail.GetRuleViolations()); } return View(new IllnessDetailFormViewModel(ill)); } Specifically, I have manually updated the properties on the model data that refer to the cascaded ddls that get shown or hidden according to user input in the first one: sick.IdInfectiousAgent = ill.IdInfectiousAgent; sick.IdEncephalitisSubType = ill.IdEncephalitisSubType; sick.IdEncephalitisType = ill.IdEncephalitisType; I am aware that this is a complete fudge, but I have no idea why it is necessary. As you can see, I am using the model binder in the method call: // POST: /IllnessDetail/Edit [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Edit(IllnessDetail ill But even though the ill object is populated with the correct data, the later call to UpdateModel(sick) does not work. Does anyone have a clue as to why this is happening? By the way, I stated above that I had been ill last year. No, not encephalitis. What I had was endocarditis, an infection inside the heart, usually on the heart valves. Nasty job, but all is well that ends well. Even if it ends in heart surgery...
