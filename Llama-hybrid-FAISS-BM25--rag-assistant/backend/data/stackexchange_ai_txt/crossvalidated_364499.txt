How to handle 2 input representations ("channels") of a data that is associated with the exact same label?

I have a data sets of matrices with non negative values. For each learning instant I have 2 representations of the input data which corresponds to the same label. Namely for each matrix label $\mathbf{Y}_{N\times N}$ I have 2 labels $\mathbf{X}_{N \times N}^1$ and $\mathbf{X}_{N \times N}^2$. The output/label matrix is matrix of 0's and 1's. Since $\mathbf{X}^1$ and $\mathbf{X}^2$ are matrices in different representations of the input signal I would like to use both as inputs. The thing is that the average value of $\mathbf{X}^2$ is significantly larger then $\mathbf{X}^1$, so I am not sure that feeding a Neural Network with 2 channels is a good idea. Do you have a suggestion what should I do, beside training 2 separate networks and having some voting mechanism? Can I use some multichannel network , although the scale of each input matrix is different. What if $\mathbf{X}^1$ $\mathbf{X}^2$ are quite sparse (~20% aren't non zero elements)?
