I have found that using my own, local copy of SQL Server Developer Edition on my notebook is the best way to do dev work overall; then a separate test and production database on servers. I like keeping my local dev server so that I am never at the mercy of connections to do dev work. As a principle, I don't expose SQL servers publicly ever, so working through a VPN is the only way I can access my typical test/production servers. If my dev server was there, too; I would often be unable to do dev work when, for example, I am at a location where VPN pass-through is not permitted. As for updating the production/test databases; I always generate change scripts when ever I change the dev server, and then keep them organized so they can be applied to the test and then later production servers. You can generate those scripts via SQL Server Management Studio or Visual Studio.
