Look into UINavigationController - Class Reference . This lets you organize a hierarchy that will slide in from the side. Or you can play with the UIView animation blocks . Figure out whats best for your app. If you have several things you will be pushing from the side, like categories, use UINavigationController. If you just have a simple view you want to come in from the side and leave, you'll want to use the UIView animation or other animation methods. The UIView animation will look like this: [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; //code to move view on to screen [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.5]; [UIView commitAnimations];
