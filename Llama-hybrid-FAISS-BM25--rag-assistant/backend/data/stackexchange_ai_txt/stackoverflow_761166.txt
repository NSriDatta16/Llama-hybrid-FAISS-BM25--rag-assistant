Copying this from meandmycode to accept it as answer. IE doesn't specify the long version number in the user-agent header so you have absolute no chance of detecting this other than sending a 'snoop' page with javascript to detect the complex version number.. but doing something like that is dodge city, and javascript may not be able to find the full version either.
