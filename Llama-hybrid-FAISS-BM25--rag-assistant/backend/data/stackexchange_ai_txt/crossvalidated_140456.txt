Algebraically, correlation matrix for two variables looks like that: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Following the definition of an eigenvector, it is easy to verify that $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$ are the eigenvectors irrespective of $\rho$ , with eigenvalues $1+\rho$ and $1-\rho$ . For example: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}=(\rho+1)\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}.$$ Normalizing these two eigenvectors to unit length yields $(\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2)$ and $(-\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2)$ , as you observed. Geometrically, if the variables are standardized, then the scatter plot will always be stretched along the main diagonal (which will be the 1st PC) if $\rho>0$ , whatever the value of $\rho$ is: Regarding TLS, you might want to check my answer in this thread: How to perform orthogonal regression (total least squares) via PCA? As should be pretty obvious from the figure above, if both your $x$ and $y$ are standardized, then the TLS line is always a diagonal. So it hardly makes sense to perform TLS at all! However, if the variables are not standardized, then you should be doing PCA on their covariance matrix (not on their correlation matrix), and the regression line can have any slope.
