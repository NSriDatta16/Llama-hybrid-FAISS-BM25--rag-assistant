If you are using an RBF kernel as in the code example, you should be optimizing $C$ and $\gamma$ together . The most common way to optimize hyperparameters is through grid search, but this is not efficient. Principled method to optimize hyperparameters are available in specialized libraries, such as Optunity (code example specifically for SVM here , disclaimer: I'm the lead dev of Optunity). Such libraries offer specialized black-box function optimizers that efficiently find good sets of hyperparameters. Alternatives include Hyperopt, SMAC and Spearmint.
