You can't do what you're asking, but you can make the process much easier for your normal users. First, to get their UDIDs you can encourage them to download an app like UDID+ (there are a bunch in the app store, I really don't know which is best, UDID+ is the one I happened to use). It makes it dead-simple for them to email their UDID to you, along with some helpful device info. Then for installing the builds, if they're running iOS 4 you can use the super-cool Build And Archive method that allows your users to simply visit a url (that you create) in Mobile Safari and tap on a link there: poof, both the .mobileprovision file and the app are magically installed on their devices. That second process can be made easier for you by using the slick and free Beta Builder app: http://www.hanchorllc.com/2010/10/08/ios-beta-builder-1-0-1/ It's not incredibly easy, but those two things make it worlds easier, good enough for most potential beta testers.
