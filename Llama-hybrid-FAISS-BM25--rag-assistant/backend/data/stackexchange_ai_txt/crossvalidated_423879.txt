Based on the example given in your question, I believe you are looking for a way to divide your population into two independent groups, specifically emphasizing responsiveness to ads. Since you know their "buying behavior" you can use that to create an initial, estimated threshold, for example by using the median of buying frequency to classify them into two groups: above and below that median buying frequency. Then, I would perform a regularization method like Elastic Net in order to simplify your multiple-dimension features to leave behind only the most important features. However, you should be lenient on this first regularization step by using a lower lambda value since your initial threshold was estimated and rather arbitrary. Again, since your initial threshold was so arbitrary, I would then consider using principal component analysis for further dimensionality reduction -- the difference in this method being that there is no "target" feature (i.e. buying frequency), rather PCA simply looks for a set of linearly uncorrelated variables within the whole feature set. Lastly, I would use either support vector machine or random forest and look at their top layers, which should tell you which features to look at and where to divide those features (i.e. "threshold") in order to define the feature reacts_to_ads to be 1, otherwise 0. Again, like many of the comments to your question, there is a lot of tuning to be done within these procedures based on your goal / use / purpose for this analysis. While some may think that Elastic Net and PCA are unnecessary, I would argue that they help you clean out the variables that do not impact your target and make your final SVM / Random Forest Trees more interpret-able.
