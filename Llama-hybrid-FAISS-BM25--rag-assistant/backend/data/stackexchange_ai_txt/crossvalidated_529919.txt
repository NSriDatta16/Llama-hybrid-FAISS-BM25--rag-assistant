Definition of the word "embedding"

The mathematical definition of the word "embedding" requires the mapping to be injective , so in that context one speaks of, for example, embedding real numbers in complex numbers (ie, embedding A in B that is of a higher cardinality or dimension). However, in ML contexts, the word "embedding" typically means a map from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space (eg, " word embedding "), which by definition cannot be injective. Does that mean the two definitions are technically different?
