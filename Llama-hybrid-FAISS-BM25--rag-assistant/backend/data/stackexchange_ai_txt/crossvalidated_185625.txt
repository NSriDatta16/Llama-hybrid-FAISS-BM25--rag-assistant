Classification problem with statistically insignificant variables

I am working on a binary classification problem taking one categorical and four numeric variables. I started with t-test and logistic regression, which resulted in high p-values for all the variables I considered. As, all the variables I considered are statistically insignificant, what should be my next approach for the classification task?
