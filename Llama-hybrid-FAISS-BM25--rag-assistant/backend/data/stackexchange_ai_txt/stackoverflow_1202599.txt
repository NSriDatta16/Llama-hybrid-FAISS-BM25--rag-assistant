I have found this link to be handy http://www.ssas-info.com/ Check out the webcasts section where in they walk you through different aspects starting from, what is BI, Warehousing TO designing a cube, dimensions, calculations, aggregations, KPIs, perspectives etc. In OLAP aggregations help in reducing the query response time by having pre-calculated values which would be used by the query. However, the flip side is increase in storage space as more space would be needed to store aggregations apart from the base data. SQL Server Analysis Services has Usage Based Optimization Wizard which helps in aggregation design by analyzing queries that have been submitted by clients (reporting clients like SQL Server Reporting Services, Excel or any other) and refining the aggregation design accordingly. I hope this helps. cheers
