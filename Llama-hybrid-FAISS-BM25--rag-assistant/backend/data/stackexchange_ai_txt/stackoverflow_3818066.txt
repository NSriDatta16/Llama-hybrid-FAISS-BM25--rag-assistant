Silverlight formatting text from XML source

I have a large chunk of customer relevant information that I am storing in an XML file. Each XML element requires some sort of rich text formatting (bold, italics, new line, paragraphs, etc...). I have complete control over the XML file (i.e. I can wrap the text in other XML elements if required), and it is static (which makes life a bit easier). What is a good way to store the information in the XML file so that I can load it into my Silverlight page with the correct formatting? For Example: I have a string like so: var str = @" Courier New 24 "; I cannot just do this: MyTextBlock.Text = str; because it prints out literally as the string is defined (no formatting) However, in XAML, I can define the TextBlock like so: Courier New 24 And the XAML parser will convert that into the correctly formatted version. How can do this in C#?
