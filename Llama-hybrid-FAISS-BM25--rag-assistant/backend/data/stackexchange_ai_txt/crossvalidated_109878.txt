Ordinal logistic regression with likert scales

I'm currently have a bit of difficulty determining how to analyze this data via logistic regression analysis. - Q18 = DV (satisfaction score ranging from 1-10) - Q10_1 = IV (Customer Service likert score from 1-5) - Q10_2 = IV (Sales likert score from 1-5) - Q10_3 = IV (Performance likert score from 1-5) - Q10_4 = IV (price likert score from 1-5) - Q10_5 = IV (proposal likret score from 1-5) - Q10_6 = IV (collateral likert score from 1-5) - Q10_7 = IV (reporting likert score from 1-5) - Q10_8 = IV (manager likert score from 1-5) My guess is that you need to use an ordered logistic regression model but i'm not sure what to factor in my formula just the DV or everything? Which equation is correct here? nps.olr or nps.olr After that I'm have trouble interpreting the results. For the first model the odds ratio I believe is this after I exponentiate the coefficients: exp(nps.olr$coefficients) Q10_1 = 1.834354 Q10_2 = 1.354964 Q10_3 = 3.259454 Q10_4 = 1.269431 Q10_5 = 1.326062 Q10_6 = 1.432196 Q10_7 = 1.424732 Q10_8 = 1.010827 I appreciate any guidance here and of course just let me know if I need to supply more information! I should mention that I'm using R for software and that I'm less interested in making a predictive model and more in making recommendations on how to increase satisfaction from these variables.
