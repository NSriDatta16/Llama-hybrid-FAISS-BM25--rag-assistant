You can do something like following: Create a TabControl user control with all of the tabs that you want to display. Drag a place holder on your asp.net page, for example phTabHolder. Add the user control to place holder control upon button click event, and show/hide the tab pages that you want to display. For instance, phTabHolder.Controls.Add(m_UCtlMyTabControl) See this for dynamically adding the a control.
