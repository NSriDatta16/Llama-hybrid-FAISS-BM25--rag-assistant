It appears that you missed the general information given in the sub-section beginning, i.e. sub-section $3.8$ (Page 12). That paragraph makes a general statement valid for all questions under section $3.8$ unless stated otherwise. So, you'll assume FPR = 0.08, which is the missing information in part (a), i.e. $P(+|NC)$ . I've used $P(+|NC)=0.08$ , plotted your equation, and obtained same graph given in the solution: Again, for (2), you have $P(+|C)$ value given as $0.9$ . For (3), your comment is correct. It has the biggest gap around $P(C)\approx 0.3$ and this gap represents the information you've gained by applying the test vs no-test.
