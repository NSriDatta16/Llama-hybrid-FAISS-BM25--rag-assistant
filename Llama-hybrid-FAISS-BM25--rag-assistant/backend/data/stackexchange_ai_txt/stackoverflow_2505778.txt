DataContractSerializer vs XmlSerializer: Pros and Cons of each serializer

My desktop application serializes objects using XmlSerializer . I was suggested to leverage DataContractSerializer instead. Under which scenarios should I use DataContractSerializer ? Many thanks Comments. 1. The output XML file is stored locally. No other applications deserialize objects from that XML file. 2. My application runs with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.
