Can one compare Hazard Ratio and Average Hazard Ratio?

I would like to compare three predictors of survival by comparing three cox regression models. One model violates the PH assumption which brought me to weighted cox regression as implemented by coxphw package by Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and Heinze (2018). However, I was wondering whether one can compare Hazard Ratios from cox proportional hazard models and average Hazard Ratios from cox weighted hazard models (i.e. "predictor a was associated with a greater risk of ... (HR = ...) than predictor b (AHR = ..."). Edit: Following the sugesstion of @EdM, I elaborate my plans. The goal is to evaluate the predictive power of three predictors for occurence of a specific disease (i.e. baseline test A, a novel baseline test B and a combination of these C). Three different models are to be set up in order to adjust for covariates. I would like to establish a statement like "Predictor C was associated with a greater risk of occurence of the disease than Predictor A and B (HR A = ; HR B = ...)". However, one model does not meet the PH assumption (mainly due to predictor B, which is categorical ), this led me to weighted cox regression and to the question whether one can just compare averaged HR with HR obtained by proportional hazards cox regression. Or is this like comparing apples and pears?
