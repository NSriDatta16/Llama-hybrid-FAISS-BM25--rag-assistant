How do you integrate nlp into an existing website?

Let's say I have a db driven app which has two tables: people and organizations. I run my documents through a named entity recognition program. Now - what do I do with this additional ner information? Does it go in my existing db tables? Do I have to rewrite my existing tables to accommodate the ner data? Do I make new tables for the ner data? Do I connect them to my older tables with foreign keys? Do I need new functions that pull response data from these new ner objects instead of, or with, my original ones? Are these new entities "objects" in the traditional OOP sense? But they are different objects from the ones in my original db tables, so do they replace the old, non-ner objects? Does it matter what kind of datastore the new ner objects go into in order to be fully utilized? rmdbs? key/value? document based? The only thing Iâ€™ve been able to find online about this is a Medium post that pickles the model - it says nothing about any other kind of datastore - and the Flask website just displays the information by accessing it through an api. A search here on datascience.stackexchange.com got this: We couldn't find anything for integrate with existing website And now I get a warning that my question "appears to be subjective and is likely to be closed". I'm sure that's machine learning at work. Granted, the step by step details might be different if your site is php vs python, but the issue is a major one I assume a lot of people are going to run into sooner if not later. My site is in Django. How do you integrate the product of nlp into an existing, complex website with many apps and functions?
