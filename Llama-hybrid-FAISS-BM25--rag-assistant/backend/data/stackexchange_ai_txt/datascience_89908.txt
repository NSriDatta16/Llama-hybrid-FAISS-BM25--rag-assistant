Sliding window in this context is regarding what is given as input to the CNN. It is a sliding window of the input image. I have seen it being used in medical domain where the images are too large to fit into a network and reshaping them into smaller sizes doesn't help. So, a sliding window is done on the bigger image and the sliding window is fed into CNN for achieving whatever task you are trying to achieve.
