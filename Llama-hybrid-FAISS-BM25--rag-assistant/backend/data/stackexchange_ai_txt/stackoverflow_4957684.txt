How to set up memcache on nginx+fastcgi

On an ubuntu server, I have a drupal site which uses nginx+fastcgi as webserver and uses xcache. I am quite happy with the configuration but trying to set up memcache hoping to boost the site's speed, but I am not sure how to do so. After installing memcached, i added extension=memcache.so to /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini and I see that memcache process is running. However, after a few hours, instead of better performance I just see higher server load (average 5 instead of usual 2). So I appreciate your hint to set up memcache. (I know that I could use nginx as reverse proxy to apache, and define memcache on apache but I am particularly keen to avoid apache by any means).
