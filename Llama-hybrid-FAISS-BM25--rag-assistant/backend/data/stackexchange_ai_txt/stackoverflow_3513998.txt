I have a strong suspicion that you are changing the price as the item goes into the cart. Is that right? Magento, for some reason which is probably justifiable but not less irritating, will recalculate the price of the item on every page load. This means that, effectively, you must change the implementation so that the product's internal price calculation is modified to your needs, or the price will never stick. Hope that helps. Thanks!
