When to use GEE vs. GLMM

I'm trying to decide whether I should use GLMM or GEE for my analysis. My study is repeat cross-sectional using longitudinal data (with 3 timepoints). I have a binary outcome and both continuous and categorical predictors. Data is hierarchal with hospitals as clusters. So far, I know that: GEE: population averages, MCAR, Fixed effects GLMM: individual averages, MCAR or MAR, random and fixed effects I understand that the Research question is a key indicator of which analytic approach to use. However, I am unable to find examples of how a research question should be phrased to distinguish if its focus is on the subject level or population level. Any help/examples would be appreciated in terms of application. Thank you!
