You will need a command line tool to deal with so much data. Comparing every possible pair of images will not scale to such a large set of images. You need to sort the entire set of images according to some metric so that further comparisons are only needed on neighbouring images. An example of a simple metric is the average value of all of the pixels in an image, expressed as a single greyscale value. This should work only if the duplicates have not had any visual alterations. Using a lossy file format can also result in visual alterations.
