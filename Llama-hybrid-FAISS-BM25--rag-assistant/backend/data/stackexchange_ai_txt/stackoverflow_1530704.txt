How to use Eval("x") value in ListView

I'm wondering how I can use the Eval values in a ListView? I mean displaying it as text is simple enough, even sending it to the codebehind via some parameters in a button click event for example. But how do I actually use that information as is on the aspx page without using any triggered events? Basically I get an Eval("Storage") that contains the number of products in storage. Now based on that number I will either show a dynamic "Add to cart" linkbutton or not. But I simply cannot find a way to touch that storage information. This is undoubtedly a newbie question but I can't find an answer to this anywhere. Thanks.
