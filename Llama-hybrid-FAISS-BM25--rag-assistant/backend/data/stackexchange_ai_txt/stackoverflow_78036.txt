I've been given the impression that Sun wants to discourage the creation of Applets and encourage the usage of Java Web Start. I think this issue of signing applets is part of the problem. See this documentation from Sun: Java Web start FAQ . I haven't tried this, but could you segment the features that need signing into separate jars that only require permission checks when the user needs the functionality in those jars?
