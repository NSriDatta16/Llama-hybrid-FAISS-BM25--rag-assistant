XMLMax will do this. It allows you to load multiple large xml files in separate instances because it uses at most 20mb memory per file. you can cut/copy/paste xml fragments between the documents. You need only select the start element, then Ctrl +C will copy the entire fragment, regardless of how large it is(tested to 10Gb). treeview is extremely fast even with multi-gigabyte size files. it supports schema and dtd validation, including inline dtd. Google it: xmlmax editor. 30 day trial has not limitations.
