Are samples from sliding windows independent samples?

Are samples from sliding windows independent samples? E.g. if I have window size of 90 seconds counting the number of cars on a street and I output the average within the window every second for 30 seconds, do I have 30 independent samples or not? I'd say yes, as it looks (to me) like sampling with (partial?) replacement. But I'm not sure. I'm asking, because I thought if the samples were independent and I collected n>30, the central limit theorem could be used for further calculations.
