Sorry to resurrect the dead here, but I wanted to add that I just shared and resolved a similar experience. For me, will_paginate was running fine for months (Rails 2.3.8 and will_paginate 2.3.15), and then all of a sudden, I began having the same problem as you on 2/3 servers (without making ANY changes to packages on the server or code). I fixed the problem by uninstalling will_paginate, restarting the rails server, re-installing will_paginate, and restarting one more time. Restarting rails in the middle and having it come up in a faulted state was necessary for this to work.
