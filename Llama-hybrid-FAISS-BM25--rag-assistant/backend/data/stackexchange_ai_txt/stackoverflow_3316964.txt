In HTML (I'm assuming that's the context) there is no such thing as "lines" in regards to source code, since it's not really possible reliable to determinate how a text wraps (unless you do all the wrapping yourself with or ). However there is the CSS pseudo-element :first-line that will let you format the first line of an element (for example a paragraph): p:first-line { font-weight: bold; }
