Yes, very common. Getting the customer to understand the extent of the problem is another matter. At one customer I had to resort to writing an application which analyzed their database and beeped every time it enountered a record which didn't match their own published data format. I took the laptop with their DB installed to a meeting and ran the program, then watched all the heads at the table swivel around to stare at their DBA while my machine beeped crazily in the background. There's nothing quite like grinding the customer's nose in his own problems to gain attention.
