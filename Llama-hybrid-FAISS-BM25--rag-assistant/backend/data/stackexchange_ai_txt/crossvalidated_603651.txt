Logistic regression panel data fixed effects

I heard a remarkable claim at work last week Fixed effects in logistic regression of panel data introduces bias, so we would want to do a linear probability model. I find this remarkable for two reasons. The usual maximum likelihood estimator for a logistic regssion is biased, so if you are intolerant of biased estimators, the usual logistic regression was never for you. The whole point of GLMs is that they do so much similar to linear models, just with a nonlinear link function, and the proposed alternative of a linear probability model is exactly such a model. What's the deal with including fixed effects in a logistic regression on panel data? (Why) Does such inclusion cause problems in a logistic regression but not in a linear regression?
