How to display part of a line in a .txt file - C#

I'm need of some basic help. I've got a Folder, in which there is a File. In the File, there are two lines, and the data in the lines is seperated with a "//". Example: There is a folder at location @"C:\ExampleFolder_ABCD\" In the folder there is a file @"C:\ExampleFolder_ABCD\ExampleFile_ABCD.txt" In the file there are two lines: Name_1 // Description_1 Name_2 // Description_2 I need my program to display the first part of each Line , the part before "//" and only this part. I've done some research, but am counting on some real-time help. Of course, any help, be good or bad, will be greatly appreciated. NOTICE : This has nothing to do with homework. It conserns a project of mine, that will help me organise my phonebook. Lovro Mirnik If you feel like testing, copy the below code into a newly created Namespace, edit and execute it. string MainDirectoryPath = @"C:\ExampleFolder_ABCD\"; // Example directory path - Completely random name (100% no overwrite) string MainFileName = @"C:\ExampleFolder_ABCD\ExampleFile_ABCD.txt"; // Example file path - Completely random name (100% no overwrite) Directory.CreateDirectory(MainDirectoryPath); // Create the directory. StreamWriter CreateExampleFile = new StreamWriter(MainFileName); // Create the file. CreateExampleFile.Close(); // Close the process. StreamWriter WriteToExampleFile = File.AppendText(MainFileName); // Append text to the file. WriteToExampleFile.WriteLine("Name_1 // Description_1"); // This line to append. WriteToExampleFile.WriteLine("Name_2 // Description_2"); // This line to append. WriteToExampleFile.Close(); // Close the process. // // // I would like to know how to display both names in a list // without the Description part of the line. // Maybe with a command that contains "* // *" ??
