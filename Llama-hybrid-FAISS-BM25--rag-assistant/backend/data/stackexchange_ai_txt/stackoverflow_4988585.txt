Generate (Poisson?) random variable in real-time

I have a program running in real-time, with variable framerate, e.g. can be 15 fps, can be 60fps. I want an event to happen, on average, once every 5 seconds. Each frame, I want to call a function which takes the time since last frame as input, and returns True on average once every 5 seconds of elapsed-time given it's called. I figure something to do with Poisson distribution.. how would I do this?
