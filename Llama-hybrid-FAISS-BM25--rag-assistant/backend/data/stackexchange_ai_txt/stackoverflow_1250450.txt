I'd want to put the singleton pointer into whatever the system's thread local storage method is. You've named several, and I don't know the right incantations for them, but most threading systems have some kind of thread local storage concept. If your threading system does not, AND your threading system does have a unique thread identifier, then a hash table (keyed by thread id) is probably your best bet.
