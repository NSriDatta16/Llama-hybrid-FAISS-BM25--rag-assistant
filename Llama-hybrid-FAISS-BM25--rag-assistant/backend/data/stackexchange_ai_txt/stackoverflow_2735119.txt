Generally that is not a good thing to do. I am not even sure if that approach is thread-safe. Instead of doing textBox1.Text = bmr.masaTextBox.Text; try adding public properties to your form1, and keep your data there. Or alternatively pass the necessary data to form2's constructor. Anyways, textbox should not be a data storage where you keep a value then access from somewhere else... textbox should be used for displaying data and reading it.
