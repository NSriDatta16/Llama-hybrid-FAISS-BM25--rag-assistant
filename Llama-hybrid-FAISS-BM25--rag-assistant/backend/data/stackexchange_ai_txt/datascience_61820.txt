Supposing that you refer to the performance of tuning algorithms as the improvement in algorithm performance (accuracy, error, etc.). The effectiveness of parameter optimization (or tuning) is different for different algorithms. Many papers have discussed it, and Olson et al. have shown how much performance may vary for several algorithms. SVM and LR (those that you mentioned in your question) were not improved so much after tuning. If you have bad performance in several algorithms you tried, the problem may not be in the tuning algorithms, but in your features-target set. I suggest you take a look at the Domingos paper, it's a nice read to build a successful model.
