Averaging probabilities predicted from two logistic regreesion models for multi class classification

The data have 4 outcome classes, 1, 2, 3, 4. (1 is worst outcome, 4 is best outcome) There are two logistic regression models proposed: Model A: classify group 1+2+3 vs 4 Model B: classify group 1+2 vs 3+4. Then for each individual, the predicted probabilities from the two models are averaged. The questions are: 1) How to interpret the averaged value? 2) What does this value classify for? 3) Can we use this value find cutoffs to assign the indivuals to one of the 4 classes? (Based on sensitivity/specificity from the ROC curve). Thanks.
