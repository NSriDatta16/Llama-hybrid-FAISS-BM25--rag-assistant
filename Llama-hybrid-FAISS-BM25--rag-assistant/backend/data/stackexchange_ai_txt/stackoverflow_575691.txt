LSL IMHO is not really a great language, I think it even started more as a hack to quickly make SL object scriptable. As Second Life now uses mono and LSL just on top I'd expect that on the long run there will also be "real" language such as C# or Python provided. It definitely would make sense and there also has been some questionaire about this some time ago. There also are standardization efforts underway at IETF (called MMOX ) which might or might not come up with a different or new way of scripting anyway. I am also not sure what you actually want to do with it. If you are planning to develop web apps with it, I really would discourage that. Use it in SL because there is no other choice or simply use a real language outside SL.
