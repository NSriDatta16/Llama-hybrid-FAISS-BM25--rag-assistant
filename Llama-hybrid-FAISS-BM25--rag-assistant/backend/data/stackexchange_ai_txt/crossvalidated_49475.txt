The correlation coefficient $r$ gives you a measurement between $-1$ to $+1$. This gives you information about the strength of the linear relationship that can be interpreted independently of the scale of the two variables. Again, when $sd_y=sd_x$, then $m=r$. So, $r$ is the slope of the regression line when both $X$ and $Y$ are expressed as z-scores ( i.e. standardized). Remember that $r$ is the average of cross products, that is, $r=\frac{\sum Z_xZ_y}{N}$ So, it turns out that $r$ is the slope of $Y$ on $X$ in z-score form. This correlation coefficient tells us how many standard deviations that $Y$ changes when $X$ changes $1$ standard deviation. When there is no correlation ($r = 0$), $Y$ changes zero standard deviations when $X$ changes $1$ standard deviation. When $r$ is $1$, then $Y$ changes $1$ standard deviation when $X$ changes $1$ standard deviation. The regression $m$ weight is expressed in raw score units rather than in z-score units. To move from the correlation coefficient to the regression coefficient, we can simply transform the units: $m=r(sd_y/sd_x)$ This says that the regression weight is equal to the correlation times the standard deviation of $Y$ divided by the standard deviation of $X$. Note that $r$ shows the slope in z-score form, that is, when both standard deviations are $1.0$, so their ratio is $1.0$. But we want to know the number of raw score units that $Y$ changes and the number that $X$ changes. So to get new ratio, we multiply by the standard deviation of $Y$ and divide by the standard deviation of $X$, that is, multiply $r$ by the raw score ratio of standard deviations.
