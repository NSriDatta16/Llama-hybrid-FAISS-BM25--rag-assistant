If possible, I also need to be able to drag column headers and make them row headers and have the data summarize and group accordingly. Something along the lines of old ActiveX DataDynamics Dynamicube. http://www.datadynamics.com/Products/ProductOverview.aspx?Product=DC Auto Summary, Filtering of the Data Items being used, etc. without having to write a lot of code to do it in a custom fashion.
