Get relative position between 2 DOM elements using JavaScript

I've implemented a set of draggable elements that can be dropped into some containers using jQuery. What I need is an animation that moves an element to a specific container without user interaction. The problem is that the elements and the drop containers are in completely different parts of the DOM and mostly positioned using float. All I need is some code to get the absolute position difference between 2 floating DOM elements, preferrably using jQuery. The only thing I found were some hacks parsing upwards the DOM but always very browser-specific (e.g. "this does not work well with Firefox or IE or whatever"). Best would be something like this: var distance = getDistance(element1, element2); or in jQuery notation: var distance = $(element1).distanceTo($(element2));
