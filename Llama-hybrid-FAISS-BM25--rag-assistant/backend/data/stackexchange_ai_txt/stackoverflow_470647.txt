embedding audio in html - ie and firefox using php

I'm trying to create an audio captcha system for the visually impaired. I have a system that will glue several wave files together, but I'm having trouble embedding them in ie and firefox. function EvalSound(soundobj) { var thissound=document.getElementById(soundobj); thissound.Play(); } using this works, however ie (vista) will just play the sound straight away, it should wait until the speaker has been clicked. IE on win xp seems to lock up for some reason. I have tried changing the embed for this: however ie on winxp still sems to lock up - ie on vista plays the sound straight away and firefox will not play it saying no play() function. does anybody know why ie on windows xp would lock up? - Suggestion appreciated
