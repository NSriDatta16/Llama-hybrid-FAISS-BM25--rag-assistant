There are basically two ways of integrating c/c++ with python: extending: accessing c/c++ from python embedding: accessing the python interpreter from c/c++ What you mention is the first case. Its usually achieved by writing wrapper functions that serves as glue code between the different languages that converts the function arguments and data types to match the needed language. Usually a tool called SWIG is used to generate this glue code. For an extensive explanation, see this tutorial .
