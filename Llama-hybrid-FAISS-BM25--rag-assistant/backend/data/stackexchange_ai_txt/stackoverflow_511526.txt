I haven't had any trouble with the common tags/branches/trunk organization. General ongoing development happens in trunk. Maintenance of a release in production happens in the appropriate release branch. Changes to release branch which are still relevant to trunk are merged. When a new version is ready for deployment it is tagged from trunk, then a branch is created from that tag. The new release branch is checked out to the server, parallel to the current release. When it's time to switch, the paths are juggled ("mv appdir appdir.old && mv appdir.new appdir"). Developers supporting the production release then svn switch their working copy to the new branch, or do a fresh checkout from it.
