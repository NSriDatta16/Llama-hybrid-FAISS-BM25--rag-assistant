Resources on on-line machine learning

I am wondering if there are any books/articles/tutorials about "on-line machine learning"? For example, this website has nice lecture notes (from lec16) on some of the aspects: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/eecs598course/fall2015/web/ or this book: https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/pmwiki/uploads/AGT/Prediction_Learning_and_Games.pdf I can't seem to find much resources on this. I'm trying to understand the basics, not read research papers. If anyone can share resources that would be nice.
