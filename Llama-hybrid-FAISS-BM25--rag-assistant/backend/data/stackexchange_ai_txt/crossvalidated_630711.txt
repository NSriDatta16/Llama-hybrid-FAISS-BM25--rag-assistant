When you calibrate the model and then calculate the Brier score, you are calculating the Brier score of a two-stage model that first does some machine learning model and then does a calibration step. It is legitimate to calibrate a model, but the two-stage model is a different model than the one-state model, and the Brier score of the two-stage model does not apply to the one-stage model, which will (probably) have a different Brier score (so, no, you can calculate the Brier score without first calibrating).
