how to model this multivariate time series?

Say I have a dataset as follows. |Time | Unemployment_rate | GDP_growth | Customer_defaults | ------------------------------------------------------------- | 2000 Q1 | 4% | 2% | 5% | | 2000 Q2 | 6% | 2% | 6% | forecasting the defaults rate (but I already have the forecasts for the factors) | 2000 Q3 | 5% | 3% | ??? | I have timeseries data for some macroeconomic factors which drives the customer defaults for home loans. The important point here is that I ALREADY HAVE the forecasts for the factors and want to use those to forecast the defaults. I know this is like a multivariate time series modelling problem. But from what I have read those models would forecast my factors as well which I don't want (as I already have forecasts received from experts). So my question is what kind of techniques I could use to solve this?
