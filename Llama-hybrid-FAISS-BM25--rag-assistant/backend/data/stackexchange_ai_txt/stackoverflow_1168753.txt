Application to generate Java class hierarchy diagram

Looking for a tool that: Produces a visually pleasing (not garish), orthogonally structured graph hierarchy Outputs high-quality PNG images (300dpi+) Visually differentiates classes, abstract classes, interfaces, and enumerated types (preferably by colour) Interactive user interface Allows pruning of packages and/or individual classes from the diagram Seeds (e.g., File Â» Open ) using a set of: Directories JAR files Individual source files Individual compiled classes Performs a fully automatic analysis of class dependencies Searches classpath to resolve as many unmet dependencies as possible Uses a single executable Is lightweight (~5MB) and fast (loads in under one second on an average 1.5GHz machine) Is simple (under 10 clicks to generate a graph) Is quick (graph 100 objects in a few seconds) Is easy to use (minimal interface, focused on graph generation) Is OSS or GPL (Optional) Generates a call-graph hierarchy Tools that will not accomplish this task include: Doxygen + GraphViz (or dot) Eclipse UML modellers Structural Analysis for Java (cannot parse source files) JUDE Community (awkard interface, unsuitable autogeneration) Integrated development environments (too complex, and use too much memory) Any ideas?
