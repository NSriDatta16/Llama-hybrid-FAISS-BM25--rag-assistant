Create a new column in your view to display the average. You'll add a formula to this column to calculate the average. If the two columns you wish to average are simply based on items in your documents, then add this formula: (Column1 + Column2) / 2 If your columns are more complex, for example they contain calculations themselves, then you'll want to refer to the column using its programmatic value. On each column, right-click on the column and then click "Column Properties". Select the last tab and set the Programmatic name to some text, for instance Calc1 and Calc2. Then use this formula in your third column: (Calc1 + Calc2) / 2
