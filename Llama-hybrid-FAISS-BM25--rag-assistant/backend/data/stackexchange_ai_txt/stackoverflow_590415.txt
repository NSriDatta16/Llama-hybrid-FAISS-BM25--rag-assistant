NHibernate: Column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails

I have 2 entities Person and Address, Person has one Address. EDIT: The Address already exists, Im just wanting to save the foreign key. When I do this: PersonDTO person = new PersonDTO(); person.Age = "Bob"; person.Address = new AddressDTO {Key = 123}; Save(person); I get this exception: Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'Key', table 'Address'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.The statement has been terminated. Mapping file fragment from Person I don't understand why this happens, im giving Address Key a value. Is my approach flawed?
