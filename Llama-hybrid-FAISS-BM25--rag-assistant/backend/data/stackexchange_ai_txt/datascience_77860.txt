Should I accept a model with good validation loss & accuracy but bad training one?

I am training a model for 3D CT scan classification (is there a nodule or not in the image). I'm using a 3D CNN and I obtaint the following curve; (blue curve is the validation data (10% of dataset)) as you can see, I obtain good result on both validation loss (categorical cross entropy, up to 0.16 for val) and metric (categorical accuracy) (up to 1.0 for val) but not on the training data. I'm using a grid deformation on the training data and several dropout layer since my dataset is very small (120 samples), so it could explain the lower result on training set. Still, I dont know if I can accept this type of result ?
