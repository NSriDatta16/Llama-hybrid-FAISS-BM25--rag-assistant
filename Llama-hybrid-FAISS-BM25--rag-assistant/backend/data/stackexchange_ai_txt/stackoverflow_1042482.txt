touchpad horizontal scrolling in emacs

app on Mac OS X on a MacBook. Most applications on the computer allow me to scroll both vertically and horizontally with a two-finger drag on the trackpad. I would like to use this ability to position the cursor in emacs. Adding the following lines to .emacs allows me to move the cursor vertically: (global-set-key [wheel-up] 'previous-line) (global-set-key [wheel-down] 'next-line) I don't know of an equivalent setting for wheel-left or wheel-right. Can anyone help?
