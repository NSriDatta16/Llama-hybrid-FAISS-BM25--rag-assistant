What you need is test coverage data, which measures the ratio of tested code to total code. WHile your exhibited test may provide a high ratio, other than guesswork you have no way of knowing that. You can get accurate data from a test coverage tool. Test coverage tools for many languages (including Java, C#, C++, C and COBOL) can be found at Test Coverage Tools .
