Playing Dailymotion videos in iPad

I am developing an iPad application that lists News Videos from Dailymotion. I also want to play these news videos in my webview. I tried playing the URL corresponding to the tag "media:player url=" in iPad. It does not work because iPad is not compatible with flash. Also, I tries embedding the code given as comment inside the tag media:player" in my HTMl code. But, still it does not work. Could someone help me out. How to play Dailymotion videos in iPad Thanks in advance. Regards, Deepa
