It is fairly well explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_whether_a_coin_is_fair Basically, using the Bayesian inference method and assuming an uniform prior distribution, which is reasonable (it represents maximum initial uncertainty about the fairness of the coin), the posterior probability for the actual probability $r$ of obtaining heads in a single toss after having observed $h$ number of heads and $t$ number of tails (therefore $n=h+t$ is the total number of tosses) is a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha=h+1$ and $\beta=t+1$ $$f(r|H=h,T=t)=\frac{(h+t+1)!}{h!t!}r^h(1-r)^t$$ This will give you an idea of how r is distributed. The maximum-a-posteriori estimate (mode) is $$r^*(h,t)=\frac{h}{h+t}$$ And the expected value is $$E[r](h,t)=\frac{h+1}{h+t+2}$$ One can use the standard deviation as estimation of the uncertainty $$\sigma(h,t)=\sqrt{\frac{(h+1)(t+1)}{(h+t+2)^2(h+t+3)}}$$ As you can see it doesn't depend just on the total number of tosses $h+t$ but also on $h$, so the criterion for a given confidence interval will be different depending on the sequence of results of the tosses.
