I've caught somewhere the idea about rich text in SSRS 2008. As I see it will allow me to make such static text "Some test with some text in bold and some italic text" with a single text box which was impossible in RS 2005. (even don't know good way to make it there) You wrote it doesn't require SQL Server 2008 to be installed. What about IDE for reports development ? Looking forward with big hopes for SSRS 2008, thanks for attention in advance, Alex
