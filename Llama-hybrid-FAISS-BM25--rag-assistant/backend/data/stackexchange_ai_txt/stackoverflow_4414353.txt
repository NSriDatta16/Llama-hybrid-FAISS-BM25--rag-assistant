How do StyleTriggers work?

I defined the following resources: But unfortunately, the StyleTriggers aren't working how I thought. The Opacity is changed, but the Background is still the same. I also tried it with only one setter, but the background still didn't changed: What's the problem here? ===EDIT=== Here the code I use to get the ContentControl: ContentControl cursorVisual = new ContentControl() { Content = data, Style = window.FindResource("CursorStyle") as Style }; List devices = new List (); devices.Add(e.Contact); ItemsControl dragSource = ItemsControl.ItemsControlFromItemContainer(draggedElement); bool startDragOkay = SurfaceDragDrop.BeginDragDrop(sender as Grid, draggedElement, cursorVisual, data, devices, DragDropEffects.Move); if (startDragOkay) { e.Handled = true; //draggedElement.Visibility = Visibility.Hidden; }
