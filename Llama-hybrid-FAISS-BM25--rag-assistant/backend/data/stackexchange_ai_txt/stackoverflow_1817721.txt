To drag, you must put the mouse button down first, then move the mouse. Programmatically, you should probably post kCGEventLeftMouseDragged , not kCGEventMouseMoved , between the LeftMouseDown and LeftMouseUp events. You can install a custom event tap and log real mouse events to confirm or correct this.
