When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a summary line that looks like this: 1238099 100% 146.38kB/s 0:00:08 (xfer#5, to-check=169/396) In this example, the file was 1238099 bytes long in total, the average rate of transfer for the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes per second over the 8 seconds that it took to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file during the current rsync session, and there are 169 more files for the receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not) remaining out of the 396 total files in the file-list. from http://samba.anu.edu.au/ftp/rsync/rsync.html under --progress switch
