How can a .NET code know whether it is running within a web server application?

I have a library code, which should be aware whether it is executed in the context of a web server or standalone application server. The obvious that comes to mind is to check the name of the application configuration file and if it is web.config - then this is a web server, otherwise - standalone application server. Another way is to look for something like "Temporary ASP.NET files" in the path of the shadow folder. But I dislike both of these, since they seem too hacky and fragile. Is there a robust way to do what I want? Thanks. P.S. One may define a dedicated app config setting - IsWebServer, but I dislike it even more. EDIT: While looking for a solution to another problem, I think I solved this one - the details are here
