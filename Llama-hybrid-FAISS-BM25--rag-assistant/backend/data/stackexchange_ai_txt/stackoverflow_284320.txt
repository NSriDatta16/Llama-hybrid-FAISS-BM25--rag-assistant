There is an event. I don't remember exactly what it's called, but it's got to be something like 'DataRowBound' or 'ItemDataBinding', etc.. Also, this article might help. Not that this has anything to do with your question, but I'd stay away from heavy use of Infragistics controls - they're very heavy and will slow down the page rendering process considerably. Just my $0.02.
