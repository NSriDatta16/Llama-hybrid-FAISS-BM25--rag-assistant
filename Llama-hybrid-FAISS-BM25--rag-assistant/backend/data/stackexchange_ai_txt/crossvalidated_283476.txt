Since the autocorrelation function cuts off at lags higher than 2 you have a MA(2) process $y_t = w_t - \theta_1 w_{t-1} - \theta_2 w_{t-2}$. In general, to find the moving average coefficients, you equate the autocorrelations expressed in terms of the $\theta_i$'s to each $\rho_k$. For an MA(1) process you end up with a quadratic equation with up to two solutions. For an MA(2) process you end up with a non-linear system of two equations with up to four solutions. You can solve these equations numerically, e.g. using the rootSolve R-package. Suppose that $$ \theta(z) = (1-r_1 z)(1-r_2 z) \tag{1} $$ is the MA-polynomial corresponding to a solution you've found and suppose $|r_1|>1$ such that the model is non-invertible ($\theta(z)$ has one root $1/r_1$ inside the unit circle). Then a reparameterized invertible model $$ \theta'(z) = (1-r_1' z)(1-r_2 z) $$ where $r_1'=1/r_1$ is also a solution since this MA(2)-process has the same autocorrelation function as (1) (you may want to verify this for yourself). In general you can always find an invertible MA$(q)$ model through this form of reparameterization unless $\theta(z)$ has one or more unit roots. This can be easily proved using autocovariance generating functions.
