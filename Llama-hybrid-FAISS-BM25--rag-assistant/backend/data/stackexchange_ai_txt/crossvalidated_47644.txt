Imputing outcome data is very common and leads to correct inference when accounting for the random error. It sounds like what you're doing is single imputation, by imputing the missing values with a conditional mean under a complete case analysis. What you should be doing is multiple imputation which, for continuous covariates, accounts for the random error you would have observed had you retroactively measured these missing values. The EM algorithm works in a similar way by averaging over a range of possible observed outcomes. Single imputation gives correct estimation of model parameters when there is no mean-variance relationship, but it gives standard error estimates which are biased toward zero, inflating type I error rates. This is because you've been "optimistic" about the extent of error you would have observed had you measured these factors. Multiple imputation is a process of iteratively generating additive error for conditional mean imputation, so that through 7 or 8 simulated imputations, you can combine models and their errors to get correct estimates of model parameters and their standard errors. If you have jointly missing covariates and outcomes, then there is software in SAS, STATA, and R called multiple imputation via chained equations where "completed" datasets (datasets with imputed values which are treated as fixed and non-random) are generated, model parameters estimated from each complete dataset, and their parameter estimates and standard errors combined using a correct mathematical formation (details in the Van Buuren paper). The slight difference between the process in MI and the process you described is that you haven't accounted for the fact that estimating the conditional distribution of the outcome using imputed data will depend on which order you impute certain factors. You should have estimated the conditional distribution of the missing covariates conditioning on the outcome in MI, otherwise you'll get biased parameter estimates.
