removing # fragment identifier from address bar

Hi i hope someone can help. i want to hide the fragment identifier from the address bar so instead of: www.mydomain.com/example.html#something i just get: www.mydomain.com/example.html when i click on an anchor tag. I have looked at lots of related questions and forums but still can't quite figure it out. I'm pretty sure i should be using something along the lines of: window.location.href.replace(/#.*/,''); //and or .hash put just cannot figure it out. localScroll plugin allows you to hide or keep the identifiers and by default they are hidden. i think many gallery plugins have a similar option too. but when i try and do it myself (bit of a novice) i get crazy to no results. below is some basic example script i would like it to work with: .wrap{ width:300px; height:200px; margin:auto; } .box{ width:300px; height:200px; position:absolute; display:none; } #one{background:red;} #two{background:blue;} #three{background:green;} .load{display:block;} One Two Three This is Box 1 This is Box 2 This is Box 3 $(document).ready(function() { $("ul li a").click(function(){ $("div.box").fadeOut(1000); $($(this).attr('href')).fadeIn(1000); }); });
