Add an rss feed subscription to Outlook via Javascript (ActiveX)?

I want to provide a link to automatically add my rss feed into outlook. So subscribe to the feed with outlook. I get the already subscribed RSS Feeds which are Folder Objects then, but create a new folder doesn't make the new folder to a rss feed subscription. I can get the Feed URL from the StorageItem associated with the Folder object (via GetStorage("IPM.Sharing.Binding.In", 2) ). That StorageItem holds the feed Url in it's Subject property. But when I create a new Folder and set the StorageItem's Subject to the new feed url, doesn't make the folder to a subscription folder too. Any hints?
