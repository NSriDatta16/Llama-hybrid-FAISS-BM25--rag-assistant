Given a series of sequences of events at certain times, how can I calculate the degree of similarity / dissimilarity?

I'm analysing a series of feature analyses for live music, where identified segments or key changes are associated with a given timestamp, i.e: ((C Minor, 0.00), (D Minor, 5.00), (C Minor 50.00)) ((C Minor, 2.00), (D Minor, 4.00), (C Minor 50.00)) ((C Minor, 6.00), (D Minor, 14.00), (D Minor 80.00)) etc. etc. How can I calculate the average differentiation or skew between the sets? I'm trying to find a way to see if a particular track differs from the other dramatically, but lack the mathematical knowledge to devise a way to do this.
