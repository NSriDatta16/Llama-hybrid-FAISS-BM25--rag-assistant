The easiest way to create a basic project that you can 1-step copy-and-paste between machines is by setting up the project in a specific way: 1) Physically copy the dependency jars into the project folder, or a subfolder of the project folder: 2) Right click the JARs and select "Build Path" -> Add to Build Path. This structure will let you copy the project to a new machine by simply copying the project folder. It is not the most scalable organization, and I encourage you to explore other options as your project grows.
