javascript conditional returning unexpected result

I'm doing a simple number comparison on the keyUp event of an input field. For some reason, I'm not getting the expected result, and I can't figure out why. What should happen is that if the user-entered number is larger than that stored in the html attribute, the background should turn red, otherwise it stays white. Simply entering '9' will turn the background red. ?? var admin = $('input[name="diskStorage"]').attr('data-adminstorage'); // 2097152000 $('#new-user input[name="diskStorage"]').keyup(function(){ if(admin When I debug these values, if(2097152000 is returning true. Here's the html, in case that makes any difference: ... Disk Storage Limit: megaBytes ... Here it is live: http://jsfiddle.net/JMC_Creative/dqAJj/2/
