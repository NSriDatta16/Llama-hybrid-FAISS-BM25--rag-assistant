I suspect there is a more elegant answer, but I think the confines of a SQL where clause make this a little more difficult. Assumptions: 0 0 max_lat - min_lat max_lng - min_lng SELECT user FROM user_location WHERE ((min_lat = 0 AND ((min_lat = 0 AND ((min_lng In one dimension, if min = 0 then x must fall between min and max, or it must fall between 0 and max - 360. The format above is presented for clarity. If you move the addition and subtraction of 360 to the x and y parameters, the comparisons become constant and probably speed the query dramatically.
