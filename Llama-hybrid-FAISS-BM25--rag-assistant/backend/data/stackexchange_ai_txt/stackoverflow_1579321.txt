Git, Mercurial and Bazaar come highly recommended. Mercurial is basically Git with some small implementation changes, and a pure python implementation, which means you can closely tie in mercurial with scripts. Why I choose mercurial above git for our workplace is because it's a lot simpler for a new person to pick up. One command. I haven't used Bazaar myself, but I read it's very nice. If you're considering SVN because "I don't need the distributed part": the modern VCSes are not only distributed, but much much more elegant in functionality. They are thought out properly. SVN has a lot of issues in it's implementation, including the messy .svn subfolders in every project's folder, so basically if you just mv folder1 folder2, you're doomed with SVN. If you're not too used to the unix way, I'd highly recommend Mercurial, it's very easy to pick up. BTW don't take my word for it, have a look at this talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8
