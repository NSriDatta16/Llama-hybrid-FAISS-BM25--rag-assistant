Problem pulling images from high res folder

I have 3 drawable folders in my res folder. drawable-ldpi, drawable-mdpi, and drawable-hdpi. I have low, medium, and high res images for these respective folders. I've been testing my application on a Samsung Moment, which is an mdpi screen. Today, I went to test my application on a Samsung Epic (480x800), which is a hdpi screen. Unfortunately, the images my application is using are incorrectly pulled from the drawable-mdpi screen and not the drawable-hdpi. Does anyone know why? The images in both folders are named the same. Also, in my manifest, I have the following tag: I'm not quite sure why it wouldn't be pulling the images from the drawable-hdpi folder.
