I haven't worked with SAPI in a number of years, but it sounds to me like what you want is not a grammar, but a language model . This is a set of probabilities that one word follows another (my, that's an over simplification...) Anyway, most speech engines give you the ability to create a language model based on a corpus of sample text. The more text, the better it will work.
