It sounds to me like you need to read up a bit about psychometrics . Therefore, I'm going to address the conceptual issues behind your question rather than how to accomplish specific tasks in Excel. If you have no idea a priori how many clusters are in your set of items, the general procedure in psychometrics is to do an exploratory factor analysis . The first step of an exploratory factor analysis is a principle components analysis , which tells you how many factors are likely in your set of items, after which one generally does what is called a factor rotation, which tells you which items correspond to which factors. By examining the items that tend to cluster together, you can interpret what each cluster of items is measuring. While there are some general guidelines for how to conduct an exploratory factor analysis, the process is as much an art as a science -- there are no goodness of fit tests for whether your EFA was "successful". If you have an idea a priori of how many clusters are in your set of items (and which items are in which clusters), the general procedure in psychometrics is to do a confirmatory factor analysis . Confirmatory factor analysis tests whether a given measurement model has good fit to a set of data. Once you have some idea of which items correspond to which constructs, it is generally acceptable to take the average of those items and treat that average as one variable. However, you should still assess the reliability and validity of your instrument before diving into other analyses. Reliability refers to whether, if you measure something multiple times with the same instrument, those measurements will produce similar results. In the context of a multi-item scale, reliability is often measured using Cronbach's alpha , which measures the extent to which the items on a scale "hang together" or cohere. Validity, on the other hand, refers to whether a given instrument actually measures the thing that it is intended to measure. Some ways to assess the validity of an instrument are through obtaining sets of correlations to determine whether your measure is positively related to the constructs that it should, logically, be related to, and whether your measure is unrelated to the constructs that it should, logically, be unrelated to. This is often accomplished by constructing a multi-trait multi-method matrix . Really, psychometrics is a big field of study, so I recommend doing some reading so that you know what's possible (and what makes sense in the context of your data) before diving in head-first.
