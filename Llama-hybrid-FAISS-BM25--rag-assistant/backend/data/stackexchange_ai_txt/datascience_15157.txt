How many vectors does paragraph vector generate for each paragraph?

For example,if I have a corpus with two paragraphs, does paragraph vector generate two vectors?Additionally, on Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents (Q. Le, T. Mikolov) paper I do not understand why paragraph vectors are unique among paragraphs but the word vectors are shared. Why?
