Programming User registration in web application Java Spring MVC

I am building web application where i am building the first stage with user registration and login. I am thinking of class User { private userid; private firstname ......... //getters and setters } class UserService { public boolean authenticate(username, password) {} public addUser() public saveuser() public ConfirmEmail() public resetPassword() ...... } I have few questions Is my approach correct? Also i have diff function in front end and for backend admin user, so should i put all in one class or, i have to make diff for front end and backend? As this is the most common thing which every organisation requires, so is it possible to find it from internet so that i can see how enterprise people approach this?
