1. Definition The abstract to " Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data " (reference 1) has no intent to define, but provides description of "rare event" data as "binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). Since this description spans a wide range (1 in 12 to 1 in 1000), I find it somewhat unsatisfying. 2. Significance One of Gary King's research interests is the study of rare events. He's in the Department of Government (at Harvard) so he comes at it from a political science perspective. A selection of articles describing difficulties and solutions to working with rare events data can be found on his webpage, here .
