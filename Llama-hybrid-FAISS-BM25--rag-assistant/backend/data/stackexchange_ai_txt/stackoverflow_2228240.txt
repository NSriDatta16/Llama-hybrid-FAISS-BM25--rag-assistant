How to calculate given time average only

Curretly I am using below CDEF settings in my rrdcgi to show day time i.e. 7AM to 11 PM. Is there any setting to calculate the average of perticular time period only. I need to show the 7 day graphs so the average should be of 7 day, day time (7AM to 11 PM) only. 7 Day Performance /rrdimg/7dayperformance.png --title="Performance" -w 1048 -h 266 --imginfo ' /rrdimg/%s WIDTH=%lu HEIGHT=%lu >' DEF:p1= /data1.rrd:data:AVERAGE DEF:p2= /data2.rrd:data:AVERAGE CDEF:p=p1,p2,2,AVG CDEF:gate=p1,POP,LTIME,86400,%,3600,/,FLOOR,DUP,23,LT,*,6,GT,INF,UNKN,IF #for daytime image --end=midnight --start=end-7d AREA:gate#e0e0ff:"Day time" LINE2:p#ff6666:"performance" EDIT I am planning to filter out the logs from 7AM to 11PM and create new rrd files to create graphs. Is this a good approch. I dont think so because it will also include the null values.
