Yii and cron jobs

I have created a Yii command that needs to be run every month. If I go to my protected folder and run the command manually: protected/yiic ganadores It works fine. I have tried to add the following command line to etc/cron.hourly and etc/crontab with no success: /usr/bin/php5 /var/www/path/to/project/protected/yiic ganadores (etc/cron.hourly/ganadores) 0 0 1 * * root /usr/bin/php5 /var/www/path/to/project/protected/yiic ganadores (etc/crontab) If I run the file ganadores inside etc/cron.hourly manually, it's working also. What am I missing here? Edit: Finally got it solved. I had some extra spaces in the cron line. Used tab instead spaces and it started working..
