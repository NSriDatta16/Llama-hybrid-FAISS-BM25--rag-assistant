In TFS2008, the AT should ping the unreachable build agent on a regular period (15-30 minutes, can't remember the interval at the moment) to see if it is back up. Are you not seeing this behaviour - do yours stay unreachable? That said, it is possible to write a bit of .NET code that you could run periodically to set the status of the build agent. Alternatively you could run it as a scheduled task after start-up on the windows machine that is running as your build agent to go talk to TFS and set it's status back to good. To write the code, you want to use the TFS Build API (Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Client). In particular you want to look at the IBuildAgent . Get the appropriate one from the IBuildServer , change the status and then call buildAgent.Save().
