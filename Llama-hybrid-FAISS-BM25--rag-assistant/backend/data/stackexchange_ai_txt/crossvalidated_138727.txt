Suppose you have an increasing trend, say $y_t=t$, i.e., $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$ and a moving window of length 4. Then at time $t$, the actual value is $y_t=t$. But the moving average is $$ \frac{1}{4}(y_{t-1}+y_t+y_{t+1}+y_{t+2}) = \frac{1}{4}(t-1+t+t+1+t+2)=t+0.5\neq t=y_t.$$ So your moving average is biased upward by $0.5$. And completely needlessly so: if you use a symmetric moving window of length $5$ (from $t-2$ to $t+2$), the bias will disappear. The same happens if you have seasonal data, e.g., a sine curve. Then a moving average from a rolling window of length 4 (e.g., from $t-1$ to $t+2$) will anticipate the seasonality. It will be "ahead of its time", so to say. If you use a window from $t-2$ to $t+1$, the moving average will lag the seasonality. To be honest, the effect will likely be minor, especially for real data where the signal is obscured by noise. But it's an unnecessary ugliness, so we like to avoid it.
