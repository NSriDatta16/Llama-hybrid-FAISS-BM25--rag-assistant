Permutations in matched-pair study where combinations of pairs change

Matched pairs studies are well documented, but what happens if we were to alter the manner in which events were paired to one another. Say we change the order of our data and pair without replacement, so that event 1 may pair with event 23 in one instance, but also event 36 or 102 in other instances. Matched pair study can then be used to determine the effectiveness of, for example a treatment program, on a given outcome. The outcome may be continuous or variable. Therefore, a conditional logistic regression model can output an odds ratio (and confidence intervals for the treatment coefficient). Or we may use a paired t-test to assess if the difference in means between the pairs differ. I am more favored to the logistic regression and output of the odds ratio, however it changes for each permutation. As too does its confidence interval. So my question is how can we report on a string of given odds ratios - how can be arrive at a statistical sound conclusion? Or accounting for the study design, where we achieve different combinations of matched pairs, how can be comment on the effectiveness of a given treatment program? Below I have attached a code, which simulates a 100-fold permutation. Set.seed(123) # prepare the data for the simulation #1. library(Matching) library(survival) library(dplyr) #2. require(doParallel) cl 8125, 1, 0)) # adjust the order of the data lalonde % group_by(Pair_ID) %>% filter(abs( age[treat == 1] - age[treat == 0])
