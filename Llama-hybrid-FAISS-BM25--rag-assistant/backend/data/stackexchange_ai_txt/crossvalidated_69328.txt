I think the use of the term residual is not consistent with Bayesian regression. Remember, in frequentist probability models, it's the parameters which are considered fixed estimable quantities and the data generating mechanism has some random probability model associated with observed data. For Bayesians, the parameters of probability models are considered to be variable and the fixed data update our belief about what those parameters are. Therefore, if you were calculating the variance of the observed minus fitted values in a regression model, the observed component would have 0 variance whereas the fitted component would vary as a function of the posterior probability density for the model parameters. This is the opposite of what you would derive from the frequentist regression model. I think if one were interested in checking the probabilistic assumptions of their Bayesian regression model, a simple QQplot of the posterior density of parameter estimates (estimated from our MCMC sampling) versus a normal distribution would have diagnostic power analogous to analyzing residuals (or Pearson residuals for non-linear link functions).
