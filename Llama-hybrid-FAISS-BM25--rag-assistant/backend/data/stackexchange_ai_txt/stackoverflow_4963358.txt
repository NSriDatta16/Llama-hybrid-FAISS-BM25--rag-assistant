Guava / Voldemort / MySQL flushing to DB issue

Does anyone have experience when using Guava in front of voldemort (with the mysql storage option on the back-end) I have in-depth experience with MySQL but voldemort and guava are quite new to me. I'm simulating writes through the system but cannot actually see all of the records in the mysql table after the writes complete. MySQL only seems to write about 80 to 90 % of the records I throw at Guava. Subsequent reads in some cases get the records to flush into the backend mysql, but I was wondering if ther was better way to issue a flush command. (As a shutdown of the voildemort daemon won't issue a flush either) Any ideas? Thanks in advance! C
