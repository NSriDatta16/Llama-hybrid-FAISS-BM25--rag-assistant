If you decide to use 'full coverage' then you might have troubles because most literature that speaks about coverage (and indeed, the tools that measure coverage as well) talk about the lines of code that are executed in the code under test after all tests are run. The test cases that you propose would be said to cover the domain of the function (and assuming a function that is at least 1-to-1, they will cover the range as well).
