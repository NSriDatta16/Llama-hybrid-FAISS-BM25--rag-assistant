How to organize an automated changelog in Trac?

I would like to get an automated changelog from Trac, that will include references to tickets that made some important changes to the architecture/design of the code. My ideal scenario would look like this: According to some ticket I make a change to SVN I add some specific line to the ticket saying that this changeset created an important change to the code/wiki I go to some dedicated Trac page and see a full list of such changes made with the project. In other words, it's going to be a changelog, which is available for all project participants, and the entire team will be updated about the important changes with source code and wiki. Can you suggest any Trac plugin for this? Or maybe Trac itself can do it? ps. Would be excellent to have another "Plans Log", where everybody can post their plans on future changes. Again, inside tickets.
