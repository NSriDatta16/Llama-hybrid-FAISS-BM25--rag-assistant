Why does sklearn list weighted precision and micro precision separately if they are the same thing?

This post explains that micro precision is the same as weighted precision. (And the logic applies to recall and f-score as well.) So why does sklearn.metrics list micro and weighted as separate options? For example at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score the possible values for the average argument are ‘micro’, ‘macro’, ‘samples’, ‘weighted’, ‘binary’}. How are micro and weighted any different?
