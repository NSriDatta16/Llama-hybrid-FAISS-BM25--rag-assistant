Can a model for a resampled time series be useful for modeling the original time series?

Say we have a time series $x_i, i=1, \dots$. If it is hard to model, then is it possibly acceptable to model the resampled one $y_i := x_{ik}, i = 1, \dots$ for some fixed natural number $k$? (Assume no special requirement or restriction, just a general case.) If I have a model for $y_i$'s, can that be helpful in modeling the original $x_i$'s, and how? Thanks!
