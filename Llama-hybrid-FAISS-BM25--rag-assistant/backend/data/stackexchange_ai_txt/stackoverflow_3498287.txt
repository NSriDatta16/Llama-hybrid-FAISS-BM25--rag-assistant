How to set up extended tool tips in WPF Ribbon Control?

I have been playing with the new Microsoft Ribbon for WPF and looking at the tutorials published in the WPF Team Blog. The tutorial for extended tool tips shows this screen shot: Extended tool tip screen shot http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/800x0/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-01-38-64/0871.Post6-_2D00_-Rich-RibbonToolTips.png Unfortunately, the tutorial doesn't show the markup to create that tool tip. I've got a couple of questions about the screen shot that I am hoping someone can help me with: How do I embed a paragraph break in the tool tip, like they did in the screen shot? How do I assign a Control-key shortcut to a RibbonButton? As to the second question, I can see how they embedded the '(Ctrl+Shift+C)' in the tool tip--I'm guessing thay just made it part of the ToolTipTitle. What I am trying to figure out is how to assign the Ctrl-key combo to trigger the button press. Thanks for your help.
