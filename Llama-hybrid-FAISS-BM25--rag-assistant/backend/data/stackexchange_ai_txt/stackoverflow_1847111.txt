The following does exactly what you describe: select (abs(my_R - t.r) + abs(my_G - t.g) + abs(my_B - t.b)) / 3 as difference, t.* from RGBtable t order by difference desc; However, you might get better results with something that was non-linear. In the "take the averages" approach, if you goal color is (25, 25, 25) the color (45, 25, 25) would be closer than (35, 35, 35). However, I bet the second would actually look closer, since it would also be gray. A few ideas come to mind: you could try squaring the differences before you average them. Or you could do something complicated with finding the color with the closest ratio between the different values. Finding the closest ratios would get you closest to the right hue, but won't account for saturation (if I'm remembering the terms right...)
