Edittable Template System (Like Wordpress)

Hey all, working on creating a template system for my own open source software. I want to make it completely edittable like a wordpress theme. I was wondering what the most efficient method is in terms of fwriting/fileputcontents and overall organization of how it's done? I mean, I'm essentially taking a file say footer.php, fopen'ing it in a+ mode and putting all of it's content into a textarea. The user then edits it, and then I would clear the files contents, and write the textareas content to the same file. Then close that file. Perhaps there's a better way of doing it, and that's my question :P. Thanks.
