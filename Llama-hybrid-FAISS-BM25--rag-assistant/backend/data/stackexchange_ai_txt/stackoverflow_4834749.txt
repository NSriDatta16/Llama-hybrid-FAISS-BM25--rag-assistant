It sounds like you maybe want to create some form of a Captive Portal. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal Captive Portals are the type of site you see when you connect to a wifi network and it asks for payment or some other form of authentication regardless of what site you attempt to navigate to. If your intent it to actually serve the user agent's requested page in addition to serving them a popup ad, you would need to intercept this request, and insert some javascript into the page that would trigger the popup, and return this modified markup to the user agent.
