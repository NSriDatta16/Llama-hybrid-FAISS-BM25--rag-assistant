It is right. Let $X\rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ be a Markov chain. The joint probability $p(x,y,z)$ can be factorized thanks the Markovian property: $$ p(x, y, z) = p(x)p(y|x)p(z|y) $$ At the same time, you have (using Bayes theorem): $$ p(z|y) = \frac{p(y|z)p(z)}{p(y)}\\ p(y|x) = \frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)} $$ which gives: $$ p(x,y,z)=p(x)\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}\frac{p(y|z)p(z)}{p(y)}=p(x|y)p(y|z)p(z) $$ which can be represented as $Z\rightarrow Y \rightarrow X$ . This is an important property extensively used in Bayesian networks.
