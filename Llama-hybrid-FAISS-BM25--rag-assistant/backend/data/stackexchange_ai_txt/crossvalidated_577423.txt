Best way to perform logistic regression for two dependent variables simultaneously

Explanation: Lets say we have a dataset, df with ' n ' columns/variables. Two of ' n ' variables are named as Case 1 and Case 2. Case 1 and Case 2 are categorical variables with value levels "Low" and "High". Logistic regression: Dependent variable: Case 1 and Case 2 Independent variable: Remaining ( n-2 ) columns Objective: I want to predict the probability of getting a low and high level based on variable "Case 1" and "Case 2". Question: What are alternatives to multivariate logistic regression or what is the best way to perform this kind of multivariate logistic regression?
