Maybe you can take a look at JCR (Java Content Repository). JCR is a standard for content repository which captures the common requirements of content management like versioning, full-text search and edit. Also it provides a level of abstract on the content storage, which means you can use one API to put contents into any kind of storage system like database, xml file, etc. Of course you can add metadata to your document by adding some properties to document node with JCR API. You don't have to worry about how the document and metadata will be stored. JCR will take care of it. Jackrabbit is the reference implementation of JCR. Have a try.
