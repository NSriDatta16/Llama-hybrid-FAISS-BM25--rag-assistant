I'm not aware of any way to compress data during transmission and have the database automatically understand and decompress it on the other end just to save on bandwidth, if that's what you're talking about. And I'd only recommend compressing data to send to your database if it's a large BLOB or block of text. If so, just compress it like Lars mentioned and store the compressed result as a BLOB field. But for ordinary data, it's best to leave it decompressed and in normal SQL format. That way your database can optimize its storage for speed and index it properly.
