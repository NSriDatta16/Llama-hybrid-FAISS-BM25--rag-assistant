It is a possible way, but this class of problems falls under outlier detection in machine learning . The defining feature is that one can only train for usual events not rare events, there are few or even no data at all, so a different approach needs to be taken. Since usual neural network training requires adequate samples from each class, a workaround is needed. For example autoencoder networks are an option for outlier detection
