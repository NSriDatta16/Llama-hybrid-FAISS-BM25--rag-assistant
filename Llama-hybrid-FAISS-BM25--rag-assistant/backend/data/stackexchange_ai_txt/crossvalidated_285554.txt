Parametric approach to estimating Average Treatment Effect on matched data with zelig()

I've been using the R packages MatchIt and Zelig to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for a health care study with propensity score matching. One approach for estimating the ATE is as follows: m.out Question: Can I use the coefficient on treatment in the zelig() regression, rather than the sim() output, as a parametric estimate of the ATE? This is attractive because it allows me to pick apart which variables (and also interactions between the treatment & variables) are contributing to the ATE.
