A resource that helped me, was looking at some actual projects that others have created. Pick some projects that use .NET and NAnt, download source, and look at their build files and how they organize them. This might shed some light on why you would want to use certain things and some tips and tricks. Example projects that were useful for me to look at their NAnt build procedures: NAnt, they have NAnt files to build the whole thing, who else would it be best to learn from? NUnit SharpZipLib
