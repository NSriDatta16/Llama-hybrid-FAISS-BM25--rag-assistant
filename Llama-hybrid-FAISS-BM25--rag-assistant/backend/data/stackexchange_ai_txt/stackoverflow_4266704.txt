Elegant way of enabling specific Columns in a dynamic WPF UniformGrid to be resizable

like the title says: Is there an elegant way of enabling specific columns in a dynamic UniformGrid to be resizable? The details : I have a ItemsControl and set the ItemsPanelTemplate to be of type UniformGrid. The ItemTemplate is set to a Custom Control that renders the column content. Here is the xaml excerpt: Now, what i'm trying to achieve is to make it possible, that specific columns are resizable, giving them a static width while still allowing the other columns to be sized uniformly in width. Has anyone some direction to point me to? I was hoping to avoiding too specific custom implementations of the Rendering of the UniformGrid, is there a smart and easy way doing this? thanks in advance with regards Ole
