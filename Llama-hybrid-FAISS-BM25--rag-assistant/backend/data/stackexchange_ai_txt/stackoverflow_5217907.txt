Ignoring report generation for specific classes in cobertura maven plugin

I've been using Cobertura plugin for report generation and instrumentation (with surefire). Here is the issue I am facing: I am unable to make the plugin ignore report generation for specific classes in my project. PF below the related excerpt from pom.xml, I have added the ignore tag, but that just ignores instrumentation for the ignored classes. I want the report for specific projects to not be generated at all. Firstly, due to my limited knowledge of both Maven and Conberture, I want to know is it possible, and if yes, then what are the changes I need to get done in pom.xml. pom.xml maven-surefire-plugin false net.sourceforge.cobertura.datafile target/cobertura/cobertura.ser org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 50 50 true 50 50 50 50 deshaw.dportal.alert.* deshaw.dportal.atc.* deshaw.dportal.basket.* deshaw.dportal.fcs.* deshaw.dportal.event.* deshaw.dportal.filings.* deshaw.dportal.glg.* deshaw.dportal.icp.* Edit: This my directory structure: module | |-apps | |-alert | | |-src | | |-target | | |-pom.xml | |------------------- | |-company | | |-src | | |-target | | |-pom.xml |----------------------- |-jobs | |-job1 | | |-src | | |-target | | |-pom.xml | |-job2 | | |-src | | |-target | | |-pom.xml I tried the following in module/pom.xml **/apps/*.* I still get the reports being generated in both the alerts and company directory. Probably the exclude regex is not right?
