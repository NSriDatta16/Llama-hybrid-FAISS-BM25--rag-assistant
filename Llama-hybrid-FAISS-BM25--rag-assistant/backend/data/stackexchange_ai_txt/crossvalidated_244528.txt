I assume this is a classification problem, and by "query point", you mean the cutoff value of the Logistic Regression that you use to classify as Positive or Negative? If so, you choose your cutoff based on what metric of is important to you. It may be Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix for more information on a Confusion Matrix and various metrics you might use.) For example, an investigative organization might care a lot about the False Positive Rate, because their most valuable resource is investigator hours. (If you're really going to do it properly, you need to account for the losses or costs associated with each quadrant of the confusion matrix.)
