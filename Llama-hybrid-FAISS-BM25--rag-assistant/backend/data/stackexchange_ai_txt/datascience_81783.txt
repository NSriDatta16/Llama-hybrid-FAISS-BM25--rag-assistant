How we can identify the problem of Overfitting and underfitting and maintain bias?

Basically, I'm new to the data science field, and I'm getting a little bit of confusion about overfitting and underfitting. Are overfitting and underfitting is totally depending upon the number of datasets or the behavior of data ? Can anyone explain the term of overfitting and underfitting and how to deal with this kind of problem?
