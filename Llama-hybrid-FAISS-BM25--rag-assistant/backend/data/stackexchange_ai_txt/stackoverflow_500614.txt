As both an active Rails and PHP developer (with experience going back to 2000), I strongly disagree with the statement. I maintain that Ruby offers significant advantages over PHP, and Rails is a better framework than anything in the PHP world. A lot of this has to do with the language itself - Ruby can do things that PHP just simply cannot. Once you grok the elegance of meta-programming, a whole new level of expressiveness opens up to you.
