Why is Visual Studio 2010's solution explorer so friggin' jumpy?

I am getting the following error on when I try to compile: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.WinFX.targets(269,9): error MC6000: Project file must include the .NET Framework assembly 'WindowsBase, PresentationCore, PresentationFramework' in the reference list. This project is the Web backend for a Silverlight Business Application with very little modification. When I do add these references, everything breaks. I've tried removing every single reference from my references until all I had left was a reference to System. I still get the error though. In fact it is the only error that shows up. Edit Figured it out, and I have a new question: I accidentally moved (dragged) a XAML file from my Silverlight front-end project. Visual Studio is very finicky and will drag something at the drop of a hat. When I click an item, even if I release the mouse right away, sometimes it will drag the item following the mouse. Is there a way to make it less jumpy?
