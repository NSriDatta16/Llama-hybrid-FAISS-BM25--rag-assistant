assuming that you're working in list.phtml , this should work. $_productCollection=$this->getLoadedProductCollection(); $_productCollection->toArray($requiredFields) where $requiredFields is null (if you want all fields) or an array containing the fields that you're interested in. Note that your choice to convert to array and then sort is particularly inefficient. You should be using Magento's inbuilt Collection sorting mechanisms. Read the documentation and API then then give setOrder('position') a try. Good luck, JD
