How does a classifier work on categorical features?

I have a dataset with a categorical variable year which has the years:: 2015,2016,2017,2018,2019. What I am trying to understand is how does a classifier work on this feature? Let's take a decision tree or XGboost classifier. It goes ahead and does the split when it is the turn for this feature but if I have a test dataset whose year column has values such as 2020 or 2021, then what happens? what would the classifier do in this case?
