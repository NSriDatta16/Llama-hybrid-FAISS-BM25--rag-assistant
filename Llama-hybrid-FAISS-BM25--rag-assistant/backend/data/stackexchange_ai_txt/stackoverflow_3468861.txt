There is no way to auto refresh the DBML to match the database. If you have added new tables to the datbase you can simply drage them into the designer window. If you have added or changed fields on existing tables or altered foreign keys/relationships, your best bet is to manually edit the classes and properties in the DBML file. ~You can delete them and the drag them back in from server explorer which will refrech them from the datbase but you will lose any custom modifications you have made such as changing properties from public to protected or setting up inhertance or other things.
