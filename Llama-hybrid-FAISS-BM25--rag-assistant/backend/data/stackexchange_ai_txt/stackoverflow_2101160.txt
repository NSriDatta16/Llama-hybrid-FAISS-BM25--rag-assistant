Interesting question. As mentioned by Domonic Roger, if its working then you probably want to be leaving it. For me the question is not "What is the JQuery code for this snippet?", but how to I use jQuery to achieve the same solution. Sometimes it is not just a simple case of a straight code replace. Take the following: function updateparent() { window.opener.document.getElementById('t1').value = document.getElementById('t2').value; window.close(); } Now, the jQuery code might be something like this: function updateparent() { window.opener.$("#t1").val($("#t2").val()); window.close(); } But, I wouldn't do this. I would use pop window functionality available in the jQuery UI, or some plugin (e.g. blockui ) to acheve the popup window. Also, this code: In jQuery we are encouraged to use late binding of events, so any inline JavaScript would go: And be bound once the document is ready: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#MyInput").click(updateparent()); });
