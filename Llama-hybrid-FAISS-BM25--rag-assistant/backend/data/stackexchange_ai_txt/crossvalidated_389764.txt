Estimating sample size en poussant

If we have sample mean of $n$ observations as $\bar{x}$ . It is given that maximum value of the whole set is $M$ and minimum value is $0$ . How many more observations we need so that the estimate for average we have differs from the true average by not more than 10 with 99% confidence?
