It is a little late ..... but , review the Slutsky Effect where a linear (weighted ) combinations of i.i.d. values leads to a series with auto-correlative structure. This is why assuming any filter picket out of the blue can be dangerous. X11-ARIMA assumes a 16 period equally weighted average ( you can change 16 to another integer ) to smooth the series not knowing the impact of assumed filters. Long live analytics !
