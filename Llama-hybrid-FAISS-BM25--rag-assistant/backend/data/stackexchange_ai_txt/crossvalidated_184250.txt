As your error message says Error in node xtrue[1] Invalid parent values the xtrue variable has invalid parent values, so let's check what is it xtrue[i] ~ dnorm(mu, tau) ... mu ~ dnorm(0, 10) tau ~ dnorm(0, 50) $\tau$ cannot have a normal distribution since it is a precision parameter, i.e. inverse of variance, and variance cannot be negative , while you use as a prior for it a symmetric distribution centered at zero... In such case you should use a distribution that does not allow negative values (e.g. truncated normal, as noticed by Rasmus Bååth , or gamma). See also Andrew Gelmans blog , his paper "Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models" (2006, Bayesian Analysis ), or this thread .
