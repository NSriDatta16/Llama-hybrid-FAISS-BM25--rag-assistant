segmentation fault using OMP

all! Typing from Italy This little piece of code works if the matrix size is less then 800 and fails with a segmentation fault for higher sizes.... I have tried it with gcc 4.3.2 compiler in linux and macosx and VisualStudio compiler in windows. Seemsthe problem is in the stack size..... how can I increase it ? How can I solve the problem for bigger matrix sizes ? The code works fine in serial put fails in parallel execution. Thanks. #include #include #define Nu 4000 int main() { float A[Nu][Nu],B[Nu][Nu],C[Nu][Nu]; int i,j; #pragma omp parallel printf("Hello from thread %d, nthreads %d\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads()); #pragma omp parallel for private(j,i) shared(A,B,C) schedule(static) for(j=0;j
