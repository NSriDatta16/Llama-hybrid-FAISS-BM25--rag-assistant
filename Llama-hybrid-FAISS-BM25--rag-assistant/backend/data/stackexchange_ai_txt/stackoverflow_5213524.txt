Incompatibility between InfoPath 2007 WebServiceConnection and WCF

I am trying to post data from InfoPath using the WebServiceConnection, to a WFC service inside of AppFabric. The messgae never arrives in AppFabric, and I think I know why. My WCF service is configured like this And when it is called by WCF Test Client, it generates the header http://tempuri.org/WorkflowOperation/ReceiveFormPayload However, InfoPath does not generate this Soap header, it only generates the HTTP header POST /Workflow1.xamlx HTTP/1.1 SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/WorkflowOperation/ReceiveFormPayload" Content-Type: text/xml; charset="UTF-8" User-Agent: SOAP Toolkit 3.0 Host: localhost:51842 Content-Length: 1893 Connection: Keep-Alive Cache-Control: no-cache How do I configure my WCF endpoint to only need the HTTP-header action, and not the Soap Action?
