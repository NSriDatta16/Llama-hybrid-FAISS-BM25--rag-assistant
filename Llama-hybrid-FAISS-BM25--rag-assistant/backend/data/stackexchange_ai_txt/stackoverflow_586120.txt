John's answer is good. Also you might try sort the probabilities find the largest gap between successive probabilities work up from there From there, it's starting to sound like a pattern-recognition problem. My favorite method is markov-chain-monte-carlo(MCMC). Edit: Since you clarified your question, my first thought is, since you only have 8 possible answers, develop a score for each one, based on how much probability it contains and whether or not it splits at a gap, and make a heuristic judgement. Further edit: This sounds a bit like logistic regression. You want to find a value of P that effectively divides your set into members and non-members. For a given value of P, you can compute a log-likelihood for the ensemble, and choose P that maximizes that.
