Magento - link to a frontend skin js file from an admin file

I'm already using jQuery in my frontend skin files. I've now added some extra functionality in an admin phtml file, that also needs to use jQuery. I don't want to have to include it twice, but how can I link to the existing jQuery file dynamically, assuming I don't know what theme package name is being used on the frontend (because obviously that can change, so I don't want it hardcoded)? For example, I tried this, but it gives me the admin theme package name, not the frontend package: Anyone?
