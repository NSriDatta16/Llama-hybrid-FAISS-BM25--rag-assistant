interesting rails association challenge

I have stumbled on an interesting challenge regarding active record associations: I have an Account model which can have multiple and different organisations attached to it (like for example a Company, a Contractor, a Person) and it also has a different role with each association (accountant, owner, viewer, etc.). So I am not sure whats the best way to associate them.
