information_schema.columns returns 0 rows to my SQL Server Agent

I'm just stuck in with this problem and unfortunately I couldn't find anything to it not even when googling around... I'm running the following query on a SQL Server 2005 database: select @TableCount = count(distinct table_name) from information_schema.columns And I'm getting different results for @TableCount in different databases, such as: 59, 22, ..etc BUT when I let my SQL Server Agent run the same query on the same databases he always gets 0 (zero) as the result. I.e. no exception, no error message that something's wrong with his access rights - just simply a 0 (zero) as the result. Plz help if you have any idea: What could be wrong with my SQL Server Agent? How comes that I don't get any error message whatever the problem is? Thx a lot in advance for any ideas / suggestions !!!
