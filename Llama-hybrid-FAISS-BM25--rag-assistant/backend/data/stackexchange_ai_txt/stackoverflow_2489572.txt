Sales by Category in Magento?

We have a category called "Clearance" on our Magento website. Ideally it would be nice to be able to get a report of all orders sold in that category. Is there anyway I can join the orders collection with the products collection and filter by category id? Here is a similar thread: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/44296/ Any ideas, or am I crazy? It doesn't need to be pretty.
