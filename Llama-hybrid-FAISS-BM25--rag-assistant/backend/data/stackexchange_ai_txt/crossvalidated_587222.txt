From what I understood, you would like to understand if there is a change across quarters per channel, of the percentage of clients of your company. I would use a GLM, probably a logistic regression, with an intersection element company*quarter and then using a post-hoc approach, such as emmeans , to compare quarters per channel. Emmeans is a pretty well documented package and have several vignettes, maybe start with this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/basics.html Regarding the compositional nature of your data, I think that by using a logistic regression you can address said issue.
