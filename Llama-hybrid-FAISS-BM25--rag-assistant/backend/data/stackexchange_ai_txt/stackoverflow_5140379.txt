AVG and ISNULL in mysql

I need to achieve some thing like this SELECT ISNULL(AVG(rating),0) FROM videorating vr WHERE vr.VideoId=11229; If average is empty/null then I should get 0 as rating. I am trying to optimize this query SELECT CASE ISNULL(AVG(rating)) WHEN 0 THEN AVG(rating) ELSE 0 END AS rating FROM videorating WHERE videoID=11229;
