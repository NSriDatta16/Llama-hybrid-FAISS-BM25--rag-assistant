Can't access website via cURL from localhost, but can from hosted server

I'm writing a script that pulls XML data from wowarmory.com, using PHP 5 and cURL: $url = "http://www.wowarmory.com"; $userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12'; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $userAgent); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$url); $str = "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\r\n"; $str .= "Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n"; $str .= "Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n"; $str .= "Keep-Alive: 300\r\n"; $str .= "Connection: keep-alive\r\n"; curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array($str)); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 3000); $xml = curl_exec($ch); When I run this from my hosted web server, I get the XML response as expected. But when running from my localhost web server, I get nothing. I can get any other website via cURL from localhost ( yahoo.com, even worldofwarcraft.com ), but not wowarmory.com. So I know cURL is functioning properly. I'm using the following versions of PHP and cURL: Hosted Server: php 5.2.6 cURL libcurl/7.16.1 OpenSSL/0.9.7e zlib/1.2.3 Localhost: php 5.2.6 cURL libcurl/7.16.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8i zlib/1.2.3 Any ideas? EDIT: Localhost is running Windows XP SP3. I can access wowarmory.com through a web browser. Tracert starts timing out at hop 13 ( from my location, obviously ): 13 458 ms 529 ms 549 ms 0.so-6-0-0.BR1.LAX15.ALTER.NET [152.63.116.21] 14 476 ms 510 ms 488 ms 192.205.34.29 15 257 ms 279 ms 261 ms cr1.la2ca.ip.att.net [12.122.128.14] 16 242 ms 259 ms 249 ms gar5.la2ca.ip.att.net [12.122.128.25] 17 252 ms * 1691 ms 12.122.255.74 18 * 2361 ms 634 ms mdf001c7613r0003-gig-10-1.lax1.attens.net [12.129.193.242] 19 * * * Request timed out. I'm not familiar with tcptraceroute, unfortunately. The windows binary version of curl doesn't return anything for http://www.wowarmory.com/ but does for http://www.yahoo.com/ I don't have wget available. EDIT 2: I can access my localhosted website just fine. It's just the response from curl I don't receive. I'm running a pretty much default XAMPP install ( apache 2 on windows xp ). All of this works fine.
