Get Active Directory connection through glassfish jndi resource

I'm trying to get an LDAP-Connection with the attributes provided by a glassfish custom-resource. My jndi settings: Resourcetype: javax.naming.directory.Directory Factory-Class: com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory Parameters: java.naming.security.credentials = myPassword java.naming.security.principal = cn=ldapUser,ou=myOrganization,dc=myDomain,dc=net URL = ldap://ldapserver/ou=myOrganization,dc=myDomain,dc=net This is how I get the connection in Java: Context initCtx = new InitialContext(); DirContext ctx = (DirContext) initCtx.lookup("CMDB2LDAP"); This works perfectly with OpenLDAP but when I try to connect to an AD 2003 I get the following Exception: javax.naming.NamingException: [LDAP: error code 1 - 00000000: LdapErr: DSID-0C090627, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, vece]; remaining name '' When I create my own DirContext and put exactly the same properties in it, the connection works flawlessly. I would prefer to get the connection settings from glassfish for the sake of easy administration.
