Personally I'd start with the ejabberd codebase and work from there -- for a headless network server agent, Erlang would be the language/platform I'd reach for first, unless there were compelling arguments for another technology. Immutable data and actor-based concurrency pushes all the normal housekeeping code down into the platform, leaving you free to concentrate on the bits that are really what your app is about.
