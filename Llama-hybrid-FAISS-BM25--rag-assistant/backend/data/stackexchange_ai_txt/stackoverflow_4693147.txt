The top answer is excellent. Here is what I had to on a regular Debian , PHP, and MySQL setup: // Storage // Debian. Apparently already UTF-8 // Retrieval // The MySQL database was stored in UTF-8, // but apparently PHP was requesting ISO 8859-1. This worked: // ***notice "utf8", without dash, this is a MySQL encoding*** mysql_set_charset('utf8'); // Delivery // File *php.ini* did not have a default charset, // (it was commented out, shared host) and // no HTTP encoding was specified in the Apache headers. // This made Apache send out a UTF-8 header // (and perhaps made PHP actually send out UTF-8) // ***notice "utf-8", with dash, this is a php encoding*** ini_set('default_charset','utf-8'); // Submission // This worked in all major browsers once Apache // was sending out the UTF-8 header. I didnâ€™t add // the accept-charset attribute. // Processing // Changed a few commands in PHP, like substr(), // to mb_substr() That was all!
