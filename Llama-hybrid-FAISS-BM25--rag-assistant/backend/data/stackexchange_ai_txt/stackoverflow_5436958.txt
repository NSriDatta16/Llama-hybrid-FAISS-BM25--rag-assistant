It seems Internet Explorer 8 may be one of those "older" user agents that doesn't support font-weight and font-style I am trying to make bold/italic/bolditalic automatic using the @font-face and font-family. My attempts so far have yielded nothing. Here is a page demonstrating the problem. http://clearimageonline.com/apps/playground/fonts/test_IE.html Anyone here encountered this and have a solution that works with IE8? I have searched and fiddled most of this week for an answer to this. It appears that IE8 wont let me do this. Here is a proposed workaround (very ugly workaround).... http://clearimageonline.com/apps/playground/fonts/proposed_IE.html These test pages are designed for Internet Explorer ONLY. This test is limited to IE. Cross Browser functionality will obviouosly be a part of a final solution.
