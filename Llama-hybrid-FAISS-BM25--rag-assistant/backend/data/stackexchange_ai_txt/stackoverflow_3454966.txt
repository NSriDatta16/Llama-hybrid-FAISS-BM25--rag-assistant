If there is a standards document in place, then simply point to the document and tell them that they need to adhere to the standard. If there is no document in place and it is sort of ad-hoc "this is de-facto how this team has been coding", then organize a meeting to create a consensus on what the team standards should be and create a standards document. I think it is fairly hard to argue with the need for a consistent style for the sake of readability and maintanence, and when there are rules in place saying "do it this way", it is much harder to diverge from it than if it is merely established practice.
