How to represent goodness of fit for multiple least squares fits

I have many sequences (~50) of time series data that I have fit to a non-linear model using a least squares fit. If I had a single sequence of time series data, and I fit a model to it using a least squares fit I would report goodness of fit as the χ² value. In this case, I would like to report a goodness of fit statistic that describes how well my model fits that data set as a whole (individual fits to each of the recorded sequences of time series data). What would be the appropiate way to do this?
