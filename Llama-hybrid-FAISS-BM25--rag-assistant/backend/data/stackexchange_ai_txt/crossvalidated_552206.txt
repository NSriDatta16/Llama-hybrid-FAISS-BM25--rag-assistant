@curiosus you are right, according to the definition of Kmeans for the Euclidean distance, the centroid whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the points of a cluster are simply a local minimum of the inertia, that is the value for which the derivatives of inertia with respect to the centroid are zero. The global minimum is another story.
