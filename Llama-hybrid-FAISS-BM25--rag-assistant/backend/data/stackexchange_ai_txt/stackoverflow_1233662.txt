It seems like you have things pretty well in hand, and all you're looking to do is create some links which do nothing in areas where graceful degradation is not possible. In these cases I suggest a link with the following format: Linktext This link should functionally do absolutely nothing with javascript enabled or disabled. Important Notes The number zero in the void is absolutely necessary. Internet Explorer will complain otherwise. The use of "javascript:void(0);" is strongly discouraged by Microsoft because odd things can happen. To avoid the majority of the bugs, do not wrap anything but text in your void(0) links. Before you make a decision make sure to carefully consider if adding "javascript:void(0);" is really a better solution than adding an onclick which returns false. On removing the href attribute: Removing the href attribute from a link is valid XHTML. Despite being valid XHTML, your link will lose its automatic link styling. No more underline, no more colors, no more hover, and no more automatic color change if the link is visited. You can't fix the lack of styles with CSS either due to the spotty support of :hover in Internet Explorer.
