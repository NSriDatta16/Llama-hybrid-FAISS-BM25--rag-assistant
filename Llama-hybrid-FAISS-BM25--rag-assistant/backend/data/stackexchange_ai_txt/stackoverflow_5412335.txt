HAML and SASS go together, HAML is a shortcut language for writing HTML, SASS (or SCSS) is a shortcut language for writing CSS you have to know how to write both HTML/CSS "longhand" in order to get the best out of the HAML/SASS shortcut versions. The shortcuts should only be used in DEV, unless you have a RUBY server - I get really annoyed when I see that both of the above languages are a "replacement" for "dumb" languages.. In particular all you have to search for is that "CSS is Dumb" to find references to SASS/SCSS - it's a vicious linkbait ploy ;) you cannot use one without knowing the other COMPASS is a Ruby Gem that aids in the compilation of HAML and SASS/SCSS (to HTML and CSS) in a local environment - in a development environment it means that changes made via those languages will be compiled to "proper" HTML and CSS serverside on an appropriate server LESS is a javascript equivalent of SASS. You can use it on the server-side (via node.js) or clientside(by just importing a js file) it takes the short cuts you write and compiles it into valid CSS (with multi browser or vendor extensions) BLUEPRINT is a Framework that can be used with plain CSS or shortcut (disclaimer: I don't like frameworks as they add unnecessary classes) If you want to use the Blueprint or Yahoo Grids Framework within Compass/SaSS/LESS then you'd better understand what they're doing first before blaming the tools which try to make their implementation easier - These tools do not make these Frameworks work, they will however make the amount of typing you have to do decrease if you really want to use them. I recently tried LESS/SaSS and SCSS.. I like them but then I know how to write the CSS in the first place I don't want them to do more than become a tool to make my life easier.. they don't "do" CSS better than CSS can do already, they can however do nesting and organization of your CSS, which I really like!
