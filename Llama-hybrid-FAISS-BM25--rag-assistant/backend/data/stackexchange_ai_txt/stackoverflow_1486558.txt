Evaluating into two or more lists

Howdy, codeboys and codegirls! I have came across a simple problem with seemingly easy solution. But being a Python neophyte I feel that there is a better approach somewhere. Say you have a list of mixed strings. There are two basic types of strings in the sack - ones with "=" in them (a=potato) and ones without (Lady Jane). What you need is to sort them into two lists. The obvious approach is to: for arg in arguments: if '=' in arg: equal.append(arg) else: plain.append(arg) Is there any other, more elegant way into it? Something like: equal = [arg for arg in arguments if '=' in arg] but to sort into multiple lists? And what if you have more than one type of data?
