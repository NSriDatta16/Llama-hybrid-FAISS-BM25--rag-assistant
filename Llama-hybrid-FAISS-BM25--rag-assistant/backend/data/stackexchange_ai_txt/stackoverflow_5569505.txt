This is how I would do it, this should do the trick. $(".draggable").draggable({ helper: 'clone' }); $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { ui.draggable.clone().appendTo($(this)).draggable(); } }); I don't know if you did, but do not use id-s on the draggable, cause those are going to be cloned too. Also, you have to append the element before applying the draggable on it.
