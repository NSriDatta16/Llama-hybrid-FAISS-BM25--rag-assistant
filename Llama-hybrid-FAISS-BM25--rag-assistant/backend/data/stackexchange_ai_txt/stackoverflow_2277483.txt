Where is add2.png ? If it's on your local filesystem (as opposed to the server that has the .jnlp file), then this is not allowed, to protect the user's privacy. Also, getting the resource from another web server is not allowed either. Remember that JWS and applet code is generally untrusted (unless it's been digitally signed, and accepted by the user). So, the default permissions applying to them have to be fairly restrictive. Edited to add: It seems from the stacktrace that your program is still trying to read the local file, rather than using the URL to the remote server. Make sure your code does not make any references to java.io.File ; this will help you pinpoint any problematic areas of code.
