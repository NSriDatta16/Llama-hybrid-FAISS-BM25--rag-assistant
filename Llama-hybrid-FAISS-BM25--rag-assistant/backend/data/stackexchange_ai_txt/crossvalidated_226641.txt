The problem here is that the distribution of the counts does not follow a Poisson. This was evidenced by the very large residuals. Fitting a negative binomial improves that aspect but as is shown by the very small value of $\theta$ the counts are still very concentrated in the low values but with a few large ones. Investigating these large counts would prove instructive. They may be (a) errors (b) values from another process which should have been excluded (c) really, really interesting values which cast light on aspects of the process hitherto unknown. Only careful examination will reveal which is which. To get a feel for how $\theta$ affects the shape try plotting using dnbinomp for a few example values of $\theta$ and see what happens. The role of the offset may need some attention too. Recall that an offset is simply a covariate whose coefficient is known to be 1. The most common example is in Poisson regression where a count is being modelled via a log link and the denominator is included as its log. So if we model number of traffic accidents in cities we use log(citysize) as an offset since we believe that if he city is twice as large it will have twice as many accidents. This is a testable assumption, we can include log(citysize) as a covariate in addition to as an offset and if its coefficent as a covariate is different from zero it means our simple assumption about the relationship is wrong.
