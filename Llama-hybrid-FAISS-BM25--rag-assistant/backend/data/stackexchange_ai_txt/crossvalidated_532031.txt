Your "models" appear to be several empirical distributions, perhaps each obtained from small data samples. Question: What do I do when one of the models [ datasets ], say M1 in the example above, is missing this probability distribution for some samples [ has zero observations for some classes ]? You could sum observations across the multiple data sets to obtain an aggregated empirical distribution: $$ \hat{p}_\text{class} = \frac {\sum\limits_{\text{dataset}=1}^K \text{#obs}_\text{class,dataset}}{\sum\limits_{\text{class}=1}^L\sum\limits_{\text{dataset}=1}^K \text{#obs}_\text{class,dataset}} $$ This aggregation could incorporate a Bayesian prior if desired.
