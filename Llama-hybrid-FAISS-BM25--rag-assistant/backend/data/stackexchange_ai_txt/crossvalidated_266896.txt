How to deal with variability in clustering. Multiple/Meta clustering?

I'm not sure what information is relevant here, so here is some background: I'm using Python 3 / sklearn, but I could probably use R if needed. I have a small sparse data-set (~1500 samples, ~1600 features). I've "normalized" the data using python's MaxAbsScaler and used PCA to reduce the number of features to about 800. I have tried k-means on the data-set, but I end up with two problems : First, although the clusters mostly seem to "make sense", many clusters are "contaminated" with samples that clearly don't belong. These "contaminants" move around to different clusters depending on the starting seed. Second, the samples that clearly "do belong" together are frequently shuffled into different clusters depending on my starting seed. I feel as though I need a way to perform multiple clusterings and then cluster based on the samples that are most frequently clustered together. Meta-clustering? Is this possible? If so, I'm not sure what tools are available. Also, does the clustering variability indicate some underlying problem w/ the data? If so, any thoughts on how to examine the problem? If what I wrote above isn't clear, here is a simple illustration of the problem: Imagine I have three categories: cars books ice cream flavors If I perform k-means with "seed x", I get these clusters cluster 1: The Bible, Catcher in The Rye, Toyota , Iliad, The Hobbit cluster 2: Ferrari, Great Expectations , BMW, Honda, Mercedes cluster 3: Vanilla, Chrysler , Chocolate, Rocky Road, Mint, Butterschotch If I use a different seed, I get these clusters cluster 1: BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Vanilla , Chrysler cluster 2: Butterscotch, Mint, Rocky Road, Iliad , Chocolate, Ferrari cluster 3: Catcher in The Rye, Toyota , The Hobbit, Great Expectations, The Bible You can see that the "contaminants" are moving around, but the other samples are moving around, too. Edit below @Anony-Mousse You asked if the data are "noisy". I'm not sure how to measure noisiness, so I can't answer that question. You also wanted to see PC1 vs PC2 (see pic below). You don't see clustering, primarily because even the 1st principal component captures only a small percentage of the variance (see 2nd figure below). I have 1380 samples and 1637 features. PCA with about 780 principal components captures about 99% of the variance Any suggestions are much appreciated.
