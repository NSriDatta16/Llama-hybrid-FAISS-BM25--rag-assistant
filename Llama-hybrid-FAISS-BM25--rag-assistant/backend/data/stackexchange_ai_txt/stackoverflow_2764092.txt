I'm afraid there is no way to make agent-side checkout more verbose. If you'd use server-side checkout, the checkout progress would be visible, because TeamCity tracks the data sent from the server to build agent and shows how much data have been transferred. Please feel free to post feature request to Teamcity tracker at http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issues/TW
