Nope, don't need math. Haven't done any since I graduated, and probably forgotten what little calculus I mastered anyway. Think of it like a car. How much math/physics do you think is behind things like traction control and ABS braking? Lots. How much math do you need to know to use those tools? None. EDIT: One thing to add. Industry is probably important here. A programmer working at a research firm, or writing embedded traction control systems for that car, is probably far more likely to need math than your average business tool programmer.
