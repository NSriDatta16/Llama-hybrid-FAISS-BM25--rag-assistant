Software The software you list (SPSS, SAS) are statistics packages. They are hardly suitable for actual data mining (kernel methods, neural nets, deep learning, ...). That said, you could easily replace both of those by R which works perfectly on any platform. In terms of data mining software, to my experience, you should be looking at things like Python, MATLAB, Mahout, ... All of these work on any software platform. Operating System I am probably biased, but in my opinion Linux is by far the best choice (OSX a distant second). It may have a steep learning curve but once you know the basics your productivity is much, much higher than on Windows due to the myriad of available tools. Linux also makes using open-source software easier, which is becoming increasingly popular in machine learning. Check out mloss.org for example. Desktop vs laptop I believe this is mainly a matter of opinion. I personally prefer to work on a desktop. The main objective criterion here is whether you will be working in different locations (maybe at costumers' offices, ...).
