Is there a known bug in Visual Studio 2008 for using drop target in C++ when running Visual Studio as administrator?

We have an application that allows a user to drag a picture to a window and that window is a drop target (using OLE). When this code is run in the debugger and the Visual Studio instance is run as administrator (right click from desktop) then the target drop is not allowed. If the exe is run on its own it works fine. If the visual studio instance is run NOT as an admin the functionality works fine in the debugger. (Same solution/project files/etc) Win7 OS. Visual Studio 2008. Unmanaged C++ I find it very odd. Not sure why it is happening. In fact I would have guessed the OPPOSITE regarding running VS as an admin. Has anyone seen this or does anyone have links to workarounds or explanations?
