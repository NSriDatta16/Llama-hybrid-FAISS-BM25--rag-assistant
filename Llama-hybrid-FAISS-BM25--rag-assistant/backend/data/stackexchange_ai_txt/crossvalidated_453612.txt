In general you can apply any model that is suitable for time series forecasting to your problem. You can hold some time window out of the training for testing your models performance and choose the best model. Also keep in mind that what you want to calculate is known in marketing as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and there is plenty of work around it. You can therefore consider looking for models of CLV. In particular, there are models of repeat purchases known as Pareto-NBD and BG-NBD which together with the Gamma-Gamma model of monetary value can predict the CLV. You can check this package for a python implementation. There are also CLV models based on Markov Chains like described in this note .
