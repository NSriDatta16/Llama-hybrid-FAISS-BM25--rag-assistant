Hex number (not ASCII hex value) to string in VB.NET

I've tried searching for this, but most people just want to convert hex values into their ASCII equivalents. That's not what I am looking to do. I'm looking to see if VB.NET has a simple built-in function to do this: Private Function NibbleToString(ByVal Nibble As Byte) As String Dim retval As String = String.Empty Select Case Nibble Case &H0 retval = "0" Case &H1 retval = "1" Case &H2 retval = "2" Case &H3 retval = "3" Case &H4 retval = "4" Case &H5 retval = "5" Case &H6 retval = "6" Case &H7 retval = "7" Case &H8 retval = "8" Case &H9 retval = "9" Case &HA retval = "A" Case &HB retval = "B" Case &HC retval = "C" Case &HD retval = "D" Case &HE retval = "E" Case &HF retval = "F" End Select Return retval End Function Is there a more elegant way to accomplish the same thing as that code?
