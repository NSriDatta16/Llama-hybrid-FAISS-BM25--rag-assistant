You can try to put them together in a KeepTogether flowable, like so: Story.append(KeepTogether([Paragraph(header_string, styleH), table]) However be aware that, last I checked, the implementation was not perfect and would still split up items too frequently. I know it does a good job of keeping a single flowable together that would otherwise split, like if you were to say: Story.append(KeepTogether(Paragraph(header_string, styleH)) then that paragraph would not get split unless it was impossible for it not to be. If KeepTogether doesn't work for you, I'd suggest creating a custom Flowable with your paragraph and table inside it and then during layout make sure your custom Flowable subclass does not allow itself to be split up.
