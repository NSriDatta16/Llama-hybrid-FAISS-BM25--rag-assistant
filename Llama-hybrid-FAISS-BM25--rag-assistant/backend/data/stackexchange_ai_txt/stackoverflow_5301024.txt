SQL Select Query with single field as formatted and remaining fields as wildcard

I'm trying to fetch records from a table in MySQL 5.5 (Community Server) which has 22 fields in total, the first field is of type DATETIME , and I want that field formatted with DATE_FORMAT() method, while I want to fetch remaining fields as they are. So basically what I'm trying to do is something like this SELECT DATE_FORMAT(fdate,'%r %d-%m-%Y'),* FROM userdetails; While I know this is invalid syntax, and currently I'm accomplishing this by selecting all the remaining fields manually which obviously makes the query longer. So is there a more elegant way to do the same? I also thought to use two different queries where 1st will fetch the formatted date and second will be usual SELECT * FROM userdetails; But since I fetch records sorted by date field itself, I guess using two different queries may lead to conflicts on order of records returned.
