The Simplest Steps to Converting TCL TK to a Stand Alone Application

After running into major compatitiblity problems with C#, ASP.NET, MS Access, Linux, and Mono, I've decided to program in a language that is cross-platform, open source, and compatible with embedded databases that are also compatible with many platforms. I narrowed my choice down to TCL. Before I began a sample application with TCL, I wanted to see how easy it was to create a stand alone application. I purchased a book entitled "Practical Programming in TCL and TK", downloaded TCLkit, and FreeWrap, yet I am having troubles finding a methodological way to convert TCL in TK (Wish) into a standalone application. Would anyone be able to provide simple steps towards converting a TCL TK script, such as a label with text on it, into an application, or a web resource that has a pretty straight forward explanation?
