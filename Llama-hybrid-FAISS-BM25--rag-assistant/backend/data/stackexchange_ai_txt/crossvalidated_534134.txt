The implementation is called SARIMAX instead of SARIMA because the “X” addition to the method name means that the implementation also supports exogenous variables. These are parallel time series variates that are not modeled directly via AR, I, or MA processes, but are made available as a weighted input to the model. Exogenous variables are optional can be specified via the “exog” argument. So they both have the same base (in essence). How to Configure SARIMA Configuring a SARIMA requires selecting hyperparameters for both the trend and seasonal elements of the series. Trend Elements There are three trend elements that require configuration. They are the same as the ARIMA model; specifically: p: Trend autoregression order. d: Trend difference order. q: Trend moving average order. Seasonal Elements There are four seasonal elements that are not part of ARIMA that must be configured; they are: P: Seasonal autoregressive order. D: Seasonal difference order. Q: Seasonal moving average order. m: The number of time steps for a single seasonal period. Knowing this in advance ... you can use the package pmdarima import numpy as np import pandas as pd from pmdarima import auto_arima datos = [21.5294, 21.5228, 21.5289, 21.5096, 21.506, 21.5119, 21.5173, 21.5308, 21.5355, 21.5181, 21.5, 21.4972, 21.5067, 21.5149, 21.4994, 21.4967, 21.4774, 21.4662, 21.4752, 21.4858, 21.4581, 21.4398, 21.4385, 21.4471, 21.4399, 21.444, 21.4555, 21.4366, 21.4402, 21.4371, 21.4317, 21.4342, 21.411, 21.4174, 21.4149, 21.4151, 21.4186, 21.4411, 21.4569, 21.4628, 21.448, 21.4468, 21.4357, 21.4329, 21.4543, 21.4429, 21.4478, 21.4423, 21.4536, 21.4416, 21.4384, 21.4378, 21.4622, 21.4413, 21.4315, 21.4419, 21.4323, 21.429, 21.4103, 21.4194, 21.4364, 21.4245, 21.4348, 21.4276, 21.4113, 21.4235, 21.407, 21.412, 21.4263, 21.431, 21.4362, 21.432, 21.4445, 21.4487, 21.4623, 21.4766, 21.4785, 21.4891, 21.4869, 21.4903, 21.4839, 21.4856, 21.4909, 21.5048, 21.5005, 21.4905, 21.4906, 21.4914, 21.5052, 21.4898, 21.5232, 21.5234, 21.5086, 21.5108, 21.5017, 21.5141, 21.5055, 21.4953, 21.4618, 21.4504, 21.4667, 21.4602, 21.453, 21.4497, 21.4446, 21.4308, 21.4347, 21.4512, 21.4675, 21.4675, 21.465, 21.4624, 21.4682, 21.472, 21.4632, 21.4644, 21.4615, 21.4604, 21.4679, 21.4672] indice = pd.date_range("2020-10-31 23:57:00", periods=len(datos), freq="T") Data = pd.Series(data=datos, index=indice) Data = datos.asfreq(freq='T') model_fit = auto_arima(Data, start_p=0, max_p=6, start_q=0, max_q=3, seasonal=False, trace=True) model_fit.summary() You will get the following result...
