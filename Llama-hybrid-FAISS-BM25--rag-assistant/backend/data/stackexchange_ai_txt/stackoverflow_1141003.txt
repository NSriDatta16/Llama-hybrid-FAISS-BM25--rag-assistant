Statistics are automatically managed and to be honest I'm not aware of any management except the "UPDATE STATISTICS", "CREATE STATISTICS" and "DROP STATISTICS" commands. In theory UPDATE should handle the addition and removal of statistical data. Additionally, I have never heard of the statistics taking up terribly large amounts of storage or memory, so I'm not sure if there is any reason for alarm. If you are seeing a potential problem, I would suggest running an update first. If that doesn't clean it up, dropping and then creating would seem to be a safe operation (as they are only for the query optimizer). I wouldn't leave them "dropped" in production however as bad optimizations would be worse than a handful of leftovers from the table's history.
