great answer by @stuart10 above. I'd like to add that if you transform your y_pred and y variables back from logspace (say, using np.exp ) you can in addition calculate RMSE where the results is the mean error in the original units. so if y was in dollars, after transforming back from logspace, RMSE would give average error in dollars
