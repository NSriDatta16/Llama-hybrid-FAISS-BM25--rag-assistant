I realize this is a year late, but I was digging for something similar and came across what I think is the answer. Hopefully this could help someone else down the line. Little Snitch appears to use Network Kernel Extensions to filter traffic coming into the system. I've validated this by discovering it installs a kernel extension on the box: [~] kextstat ... 55 0 0x687000 0x2b000 0x2a000 at.obdev.nke.LittleSnitch (2.0.46) ... If you programmatically wish to prevent network access to another application, this seems to be your best bet. If you simply want to monitor network usage by other apps, however, you have other options, like libpcap .
