If you don't have Lotus Notes installed then the only way to get access is to connect to a Domino server. There a couple of ways (if using C#). HTTP Examples. server/database.nsf/viewName?readviewentries server/database.nsf/viewName?readviewentries&OutputFormat=JSON server/database.nsf/viewName/docname?OpenDocument server/database.nsf/agentName?OpenAgent&variable=xxx docName above would be the value of column 1 in the view for that item. You can also access using the UNID of each item. More examples on the Domino wiki . Web Services Domino 7.x and later supports Web Service providers. 8.x supports Providers and consumers. Example. server/database.nsf/webService?WSDL server/database.nsf/webService?OpenWebService
