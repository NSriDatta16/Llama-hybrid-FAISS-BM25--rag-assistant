Is there a plot that can combine average, range and sample size?

Does a style of plot exist that can clearly plot a sample's average, range, and sample size together? I guess I'm thinking of a box plot in which the width might vary in relation to the sample size? This could be used for the following scenario: You want to plot the average time it takes for 5 employees to finish their tasks over a 6 month period. All employees have tasks assigned and finished within each month, and the number of tasks the employees get assigned each month isn't the same (one might get 2 while another gets 12). The tasks overlap in time and focus, so having 12 tasks will contribute to an employee's average time to finish a task taking longer - so you'd want the average time shown in relation to the number of tasks assigned that month as well as the range of finish times for the month's set of tasks.
