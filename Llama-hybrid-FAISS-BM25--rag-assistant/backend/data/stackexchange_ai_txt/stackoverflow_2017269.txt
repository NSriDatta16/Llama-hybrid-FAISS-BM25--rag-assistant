I'll say I think its too hard. These graduate assistants probably don't have a lot of industry experience. Universities tend not to spend much time on the nuances of HTML/CSS. Learning the basics of HTML/CSS does not take much, but being proficient does take a good amount of time and experience. You are hiring people who won't have the background to develop those skills. You should hire smart people who show they can learn these technologies, rather than people who already have the skills. If they already have the skills they can probably get a higher paying job working in private industry. Realistically if you find someone with a strong grasp of the difference between and a they are probably above-average for university students.
