The following line: f = checkMod nr is an equality check, not an assignment as I believe you are intending. Change it to: f and all should work fine. I'm not sure why you've used the correct syntax on the previous line and not that line... Also, the line while f = false do should really be simplified to while not f do ; equality checks on booleans are rather convoluted. As I side note, I feel a need to point out that you are effectively trying to use F# as an imperative language. Use of mutable variables and while loops are strongly discouraged in functional languages (including F#), especially when a purely functional (and simpler) solution exists, as in this situation. I recommend you read up a bit on programming in the functional style. Of course, just getting to grips with the syntax is a useful thing in itself.
