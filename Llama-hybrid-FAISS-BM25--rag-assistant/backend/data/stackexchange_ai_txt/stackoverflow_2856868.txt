c# syntax and Linq, IQueryable

This is a question about the SYNTAX of c# and NOT about how we call/use IQueryable Can someone please explain to me: We have this declaration (System.Linq): public static double Average (this IQueryable source, Expression > selector) and to call the Average double average = fruits.AsQueryable().Average(s => s.Length); I understand how to call the Average and all the similar static method of IQueryable but I donâ€™t understand the syntax of the declaration. public static double Average (this IQueryable source, Expression > selector) What does the mean in Average ( and also the this IQueryable source . since only one parameter passes when we call it and the actual lambda expression (s => s.Length); Thanks in advance.
