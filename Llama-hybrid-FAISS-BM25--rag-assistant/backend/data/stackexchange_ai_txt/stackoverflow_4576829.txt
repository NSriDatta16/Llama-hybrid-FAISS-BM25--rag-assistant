Quick MSO 2003 tip for transferring styles from the current document to another document. The Organizer UI shows the currently open document on the left and Normal.dot on the right. Hitting the dropdown on the right doesn't give you anything other than Normal.dot. Quoi?? Hit the right hand Close File button. This will then be replaced by an Open File ... command button. Select any file you want to from there. Mind the file type. MSOs defaiult is .dot. Cheers
