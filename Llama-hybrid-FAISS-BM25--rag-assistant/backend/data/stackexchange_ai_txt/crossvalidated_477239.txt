C-Index for few failure cases

I'm training a Cox model on top of a CNN to predict the overall survival of head and neck cancer patients based on CT images. In order to rate the models performance I'm using Harrel's C-Index. To get a feeling of the baseline performance I generated some random prediction for the validation data. This random prediction already yields a pretty high C-Index > 0.7. My feeling is, that this stems from the fact that the data contains only few failure cases. Because survival chances are pretty high and a lot of data points are right censored. So, my question is: is it the case that few failure cases give a high baseline C-Index what's the best/common way to measure the models performance in this case
