Theater Seat Storage in DB

I wasnt sure as to how to exctly store the seats of a reservation booking system.So far i have been thinking that ill be needing these tables.Also i was going to do this as a webpage. Show Id Theather_Id Name AgeRating Theather Id Name Show_Time Id Show_Id Time Show_Day show_time_id day Seat_Category Id Name Seat_Status Id Name Reservation id rowno seatno username (nullable) seatstatus_id show_timeid Date Users Membership Show_Seat_Price show_id seat_category_id start_row start_no end_row end_seat price My biggest problems are how to store the seat array in the db also i wish to make a seat categorization such as bronze,silver,gold which each certain section will have an allocated pricing. Empty layout: FRONT 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 BACK But since i require the categories of gold , silver and bronze this further complicates the matter
