If the view you want to forward the touches to doesn't happen to be a subview / superview, you can set up a custom property in your UIView subclass like so: @interface SomeViewSubclass : UIView { id forwardableTouchee; } @property (retain) id forwardableTouchee; Make sure to synthesize it in your .m: @synthesize forwardableTouchee; And then include the following in any of your UIResponder methods such as: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.forwardableTouchee touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } Wherever you instantiate your UIView, set the forwardableTouchee property to whatever view you'd like the events to be forwarded to: SomeViewSubclass *view = [[[SomeViewSubclass alloc] initWithFrame:someRect] autorelease]; view.forwardableTouchee = someOtherView;
