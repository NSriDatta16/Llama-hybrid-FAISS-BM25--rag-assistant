You might run into a problem not with timeout, but that the default WCF message size is not big enough. By default WCF is limited to 64K messages - maybe with 17K of rows, that's too much already - sounds like it from what you write. You can increase these messages sizes by a multitude of settings - most of them on your binding. These would be: maxBufferPoolSize maxBufferSize maxReceivedMessageSize To configure the values for e.g. the wsHttpBinding , use this fragment: And then just reference that binding in your endpoints (both client and server side!): Other settings are on the (as a subtag in your binding) - those include: maxStringContentLength maxArrayLength maxBytesPerRead maxNameTableCharCount These - as the name "reader quotas" implies, are probably more relevant to the server when it receives messages.
