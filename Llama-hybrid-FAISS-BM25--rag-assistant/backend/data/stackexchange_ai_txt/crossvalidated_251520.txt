Solve probability equation for one variable

Given: p = $a^l$ * ($\frac{c}{a^l + b^l}$ + $\frac{b}{a^l + c^l}$) Where a, b, c, p are known and are probabilities . Solve for l. (1 equation and 1 unknown) Does a closed form solution to this exist? I can't see how to solve using algebra. If there is no closed form solution, what is the best way to solve this? I have looked into using Newton's method (but the derivative of this is very ugly) and the secant method (I am concerned about using bad starting values) - these aren't very "elegant". Edit Working on this problem, I have found out the following constraints for solutions: $a$ >= $b$ >= $c$ $a$ + $b$ + $c$ = $1$ $p$ I believe that the upper and lower limits of $l$ (that I could use as inputs into the secant method) for the given $a$, $b$, $c$, $p$ are defined by: lower: $p$ >= 0 upper: $p$
