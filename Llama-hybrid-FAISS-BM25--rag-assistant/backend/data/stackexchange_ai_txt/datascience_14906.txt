A decision tree is designed to make many branches leading to any number of categorical outcomes. Logistic regression in it's simplest form, however, takes a continuous variable and decides where to apply a threshold in order to model a binary response. In your case, a decision tree makes sense because you are working with data that has no overall mathematical model, if I understand you correctly. Logistic regression is going to struggle with deciding between 100 classes with no underlying pattern. I would suggest reviewing the math behind logistic regression in depth in order to understand the limitations.
