The skill that sets one data miner apart from others is the ability to interpret machine learning models. Most build a machine, report the error and then stop. What are the mathematical relationships between the features? Are the effects additive or non-additive or both? Are any of the features irrelevant? Is the machine expected under the null hypothesis that there are only chance patterns in the data? Does the model generalize to independent data? What do these patterns mean for the problem being studied? What are the inference? What are the insights? Why should a domain expert get excited? Will the machine lead to the domain expert asking new questions and designing new experiments? Can the data miner effectively communicate the model and its implications to the world?
