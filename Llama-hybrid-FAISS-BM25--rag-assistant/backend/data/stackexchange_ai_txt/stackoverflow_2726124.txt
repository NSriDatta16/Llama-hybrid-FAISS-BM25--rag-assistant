How to Change TabPage Position in C#.NET?

I have six tabs on my Windows application. I need to put tab #6 after tab #2, how can i do it? I couldn't drag the tab to the location i want! The 5 tabs are full of controls that took long time to name and design. Any idea how to move last tab and place it after 3rd tab?
