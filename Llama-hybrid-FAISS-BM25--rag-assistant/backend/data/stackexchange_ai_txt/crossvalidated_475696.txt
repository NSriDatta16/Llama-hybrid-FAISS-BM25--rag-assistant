How to interprete Discriminator and Generator loss in WGAN

I trained GAN with learning rate 0.00002, discriminator is trained once and generator is trained twice per epoch. Wasserstein loss is used as loss function This is the loss graph for discriminator and generator with x-axis is epochs and y-axis is loss obtained. Again I have trained another GAN with learning rate 0.00002, discriminator is trained once and generator is trained once per epoch. How to interpret the loss graphs? In the first graph generator has negative loss and in second graph discriminator has negative loss. Can we have negative loss for generator?why do we get negative loss?
