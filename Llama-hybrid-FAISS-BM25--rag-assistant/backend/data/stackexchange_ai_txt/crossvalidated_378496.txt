Where is my mistake in this definition of Bayes Factor?

From " The Bayesian Choice " by Christian P. Robert. The definition of the Bayes factor is given to be the ratio of the posterior probabilities of the null and the alternative hypothesis over the ratio of the prior probabilities of the null and alternative. ie $$B_{01}^{\pi}= \frac{ \frac{P(\theta \in \Theta_{0}|x)}{P(\theta \in \Theta_{1}|x)}}{\frac{p(\theta \in \Theta_{0})}{ p(\theta \in \Theta_{1})}}$$ Which the author shortly simplifies to be $$B_{01}^{\pi}=\frac{\int_{\Theta_{0}}f(x|\theta_{0})\pi_{0}(\theta)d\theta}{\int_{\Theta_{1}}f(x|\theta_{1})\pi_{1}(\theta)d\theta}$$ But when I try to write out all the terms and use that $$\pi(\theta|x)=\frac{f(x|\theta) \pi(\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}f(x|\theta) \pi(\theta)d\theta}$$ I get $$B_{01}^{\pi}=\frac{f(x|\theta_{0})\int_{\Theta_{1}}f(x|\theta_{1})\pi_{1}(\theta)d\theta}{f(x|\theta_{1})\int_{\Theta_{0}}f(x|\theta_{0})\pi_{0}(\theta)d\theta}$$ instead. Anyone have any idea of where I went wrong? Probably some simple mistake I made or error.
