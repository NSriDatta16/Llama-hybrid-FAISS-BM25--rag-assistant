How can I evaluate a group of Z-Scores?

I have some elements in a dataframe, and for each one of them I have a z-score for some parameters that describe them. If I wanted to "sum up" all the Z-scores into one value in order to compare each element to one other into the database, how could I do that? Is there a way to sum Z-Scores or average them and take that number as a comparison value, or should I not use Z-scores at all?
