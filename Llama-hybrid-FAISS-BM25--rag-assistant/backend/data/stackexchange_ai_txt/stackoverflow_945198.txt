I see no satisfactory way to do this without implementing any code on the reseller site. Instead, I would require them to send an HTTPS request from the reseller webserver to the primary webserver, passing a unique secret key to identify themselves, as well as the username of their logged-on user. Once verified on the primary site, this key would then serve as authentication for the reseller, and by extention, their logged-on user. The response of this request would contain a html fragment string, which the reseller can inject into any page. This fragment would contain an iframe, which, in turn, would load the report for the logged-on user directly from the primary site, using their username. This report content would contain a reference to a reseller-specific stylesheet. With this approach I would say HTTPS is not required in the browser, since both the reseller and their user is authenticated, and if that process happened over HTTPS, we can assume there is no eavesdropper. In the case where the secret key or the user password got compromised, HTTPS from the browser would make no difference anyway.
