Significance of average correlation coefficients

I am using fMRI data (n=25) to predict performance on a behavioral task. At each of 12 time points, I train a linear model on data from n-1 subjects and use this model to predict the left-out subject's performance during a different period of time. For example, I use neural data at time point 1 to predict performance during time window A, and data at time point 2 to predict performance during time window B, etc. For each time point, after leaving each subject out once, I perform Spearman's rank correlation on the observed and predicted values. This gives me a correlation coefficient at each of my time points. I want to report the average prediction across all of my time points, so I Fisher transformed these r values, averaged the resulting z scores, then transformed the average back to an r value. Is this okay to do since my correlations were all computed within the same group of subjects? Based on previous questions I think this is right but please correct me if I'm wrong. My next question is about how to report the significance of this average r. Is this possible? This answer leads me to believe that reporting a confidence interval would be better, but I'm not exactly sure how to do this, or if it's okay because, again, my correlations were computed from data collected at different times from the same group of subjects.
