Simplified asserts in OCUnit

I just started jusing OCUnit and find the asserts a bit cumbersome. In JUnit I can write a test to compare numbers like below. This test will obviously fail, but this shows the nice, simple assert I can write for two numbers and the feedback I get: "expected but was " with very little code. What I tried so far i XCode is: Which works, but is not as elegant as JUnit. Do you know if it exists assertion macros al√† JUnit for XCode (OCUnit)? Also, is it possible to get the red/green bar in XCode?
