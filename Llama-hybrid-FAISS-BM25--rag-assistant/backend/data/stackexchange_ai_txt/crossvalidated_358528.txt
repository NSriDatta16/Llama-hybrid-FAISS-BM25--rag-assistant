As far as I am aware the term generative model is used only for machine learning models that match the above definition. Mainly this is to differentiate them from discriminative models , which is also only applicable to machine learning models. Can non-machine-learning models that produce data be called "generative" as well? I don't recall seeing this expression before and would refer to it differently, although I suppose it would be understood anyway. If we think of a statistical model as an idealized/simplified version of a data generating process, I'd assume it's ability to generate data is inherent and doesn't need to be explicitly expressed. Edit: I admit that my gut got the better of me on that last paragraph, which I redact after some thought on the matter.
