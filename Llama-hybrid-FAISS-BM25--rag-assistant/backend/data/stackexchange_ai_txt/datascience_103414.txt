Is there any way to remove background of an image fully with the help of post-processor techniques(like edge detector) after deep learning based model

I'm using a deep learning model (deep lab v3+ with xception as the backbone) for image segmentation and removing the background. The subject of the image is a person. And my target is to extract the person from the image. But only with the machine learning model, the output is not satisfactory. I'm thinking if somehow I can detect the edge of the person with "Canny Edge detector" and use this as post processor to get exact output. I also try the blur effect for smoothing the object's edge and getting a pleasant-looking output. I saw Adobe Photoshop's "select subject" feature. It is quite accurate. Main image -> segmented mask from ml-model -> adding blur effect on the edge Canny Edge Detector as Post Processor: I tried the following steps: Run Canny Edge on the main image. canny edge image Remove the background noise(of the canny edge image) using the image segmentation mask(I got from the ml-model). Here I use bitwise-and of the canny edge image and segmentation mask. background noise removed canny edge image In the 2nd step, some of the real edges of the person also get removed, and to restore those, I have used the breadth-first-search algorithm and run it up to some limit(suppose, up to 10 neighbors). after BFS I shrink the segmentation mask and using this, removed the interior noise of the canny edge image. removing the inside noise How could I connect the edge line of the canny edge image, so I would get a perfect segmentation?
