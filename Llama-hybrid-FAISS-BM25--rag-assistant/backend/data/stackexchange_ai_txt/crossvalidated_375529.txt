In many policy contexts, it is the ATT that is of interest. In deciding whether a policy is beneficial, it does not matter whether on average the program is beneficial for a randomly plucked person from the population (ATE), but whether it is beneficial for those who are assigned or typically assign themselves to the treatment (ATT). For example, consider a policy maker who is interested in the effect of Catholic schooling. Would that person care about the effect averaged over all the children who could potentially attend a Catholic school or in the effect for the children that typically would go to such schools? Most likely, it will be the latter. The ATE would not be the most relevant policy parameter. To generalize almost to the point of uselessness, science might require the ATE, while policy needs the ATT. However, there are many exceptions to this rule. PSM can give you ATE, ATT, and ATU (average treatment effect on the untreated).
