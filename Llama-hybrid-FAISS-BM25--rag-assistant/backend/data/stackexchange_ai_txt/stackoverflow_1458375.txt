There is the whole idea of dependency injection - which would invariably lead to the program needing to be restructured. I have been hearing some noise about GUICE being good in this regard. In deployment perspective I have had reasonable success with deploying only the .jar we built with dependency .jars being fetched from original projects via jnlp. The build system behind this involved manual tracking of new versions of dependencies and updating in the build system.
