I found emailonacid.com today (beta, currently free†) - have only played with it a little but so far so good. It simulates the following clients: AOL 9 Entourage 2004 & 2008 Gmail Hotmail Windows Live Mail Windows Mail Mac Mail Outlook 2003 & 2007 Thunderbird 2, 3 & Beta Yahoo Classic / Yahoo Mail The very helpful thing about this service is it tells you what code is not supported in which client. † Edit: Not free anymore, but provides a 7 day free trial.
