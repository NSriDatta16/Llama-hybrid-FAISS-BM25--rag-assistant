Welcome to the site! You could also ask yourself, "Is data science fit for this data?" Not all datasets require some sort of algorithmic approach. Depending on what you're going after, this may not be a data science problem. In traffic studies, a good number of problems are solved with "plain" statistics. For example, you could use the Poisson Distribution to solve any number of issues with your current dataset and that can be very effective even though it has relatively little to do with data science.
