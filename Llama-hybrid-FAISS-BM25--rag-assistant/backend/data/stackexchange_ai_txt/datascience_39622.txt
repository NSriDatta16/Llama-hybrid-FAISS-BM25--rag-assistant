Complex-Valued input to CNN

I want to train a CNN. However, my input is images of size 100*100 with complex numbers. I have runned the model, but it failed and the loss didn't decrease. Then I found out that my because my inputs are complex, they are not able to train very good. Actually, I think the activation functions and the convolutions and the optimizer, backpropagation, cost should be changed. I wonder how I can Implement my CNN with Complex-Valued input. I would be thankful if anyone could help me.
