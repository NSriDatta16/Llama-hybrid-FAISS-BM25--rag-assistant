Creating a custom metric based on diverse feature scalse

I would like to create a custom metric that takes into account multiple features and produces a certain score. However, the issue is that I have data that has many different data types, such as nominal, categorical, continuous and integers. Plus the continuous features lay on different scales. 1) How could I include all these different data types in a new metric? 2) How to solve the scale problem? I was thinking either centering and scaling continuous features or using z score on all of the features. 3) Would this be more of a composite measure, weighted average or something else?
