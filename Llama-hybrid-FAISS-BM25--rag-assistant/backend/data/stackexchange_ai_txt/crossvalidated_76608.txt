Applying kernel function to input data before giving it to algorithm

I have gene expression data, I do dimensionality reduction and clustering with self organizing maps, but self organizing maps do not perform well with my data. I want to map my data to feature space using different kernel functions and then give this data as input to self organizing maps to compare their performance. My input data is of dimension $m\times n$, and upon applying a given kernel it becomes a square matrix, which I don't want to. How can I map my data to feature space without changing dimension of my input matrix?
