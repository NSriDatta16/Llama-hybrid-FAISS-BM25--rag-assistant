Online (Internet) backups are an important part of the process. All kind of backups to external drives are doomed to failure unless they are made by an appointed personal (such as a secreatry). If you're a very small shop (or a Âµ-ISV, such as me), this is not an option. Even then, where is the external drive kept? A safe with fire protection is the only possible good answer. Storing them offsite is not good: People WILL forget to bring it back to office for the periodical back-up. Backups to NAS are IMHO a better solution than external drives. But the day the building is on fire, offsite backups are your only chance to stay alive. I personnaly use Mozy to back up the main local directories in addition to the SCC DB. Needless to say that AES-256 or similar encryption is a must have for storage of your source code on someone else's hard drives. Mozy and all its serious competitors offer it.
