Seeing as this meta tag changes the way the document is rendered, and could cause visual changes, I would apply the same rule as that for the content-type header, which is as early in the as possible . From the W3C encoding specs : The META declaration must only be used when the character encoding is organized such that ASCII-valued bytes stand for ASCII characters (at least until the META element is parsed). META declarations should appear as early as possible in the HEAD element.
