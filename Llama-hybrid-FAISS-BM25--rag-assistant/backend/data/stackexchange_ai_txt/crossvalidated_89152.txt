When using of neural networks is normal to follow good practises and rules of thumb, you can find some scientific papers (like LeCun et al. here ) and tutorials. The choice of the number of hidden neurons and layers it's not easy and it could be critical (this is one of the main drawbacks on the use of NNs), if you have N 200 features (and then 200 input neurons) you don't need 200 hidden neurons, I suggest you to read carefully a good description on how neural networks work (my best one is Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation by Simon Haykin). You can start with a small number (try with 50 neurons) and then you need to explore how the NN works with smaller and larger numbers. It's the same about the number of hidden layer, nowadays it's quite common to have only one hidden layer but you can also try with larger numbers (I've always used only one layer) You can have only one output neuron, considering number larger than zero as "true" and otherwise as "false", also this is an arbitrary choice even if it's quite common. In my experience, you need to explore the parameter space varying the number of neurons, of course you would also try to change activation functions and number of hidden layers but it's up to you. Anyway, I suggest you to read carefully some introductory works on neural networks.
