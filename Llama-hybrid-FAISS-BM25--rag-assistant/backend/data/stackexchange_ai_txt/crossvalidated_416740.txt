How to better separate the data points

I've got a particular data-set that looks like this in 2 dimensions. I have used the StandardScaler and PCA function in python to scale down the data from 50 dimensions to 2 dimensions. I was wondering what kind of manipulations can i do, to better separate the red dots from the green dots so that i can classify them as one type of data? Furthermore, i plan to use MinMaxScaler such that it will vary from [0,1] but i doubt that affects how it will appear on the graph.
