In some compilers you can use #warning to issue a warning: #warning "Do not use ABC, which is deprecated. Use XYZ instead." In Microsoft compilers, you can typically use the message pragma: #pragma message ( "text" ) You mentioned .Net, but didn't specify whether you were programming with C/C++ or C#. If you're programming in C#, than you should know that C# supports the #warning format .
