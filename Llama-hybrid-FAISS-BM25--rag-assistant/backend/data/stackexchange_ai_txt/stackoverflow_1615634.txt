Can anyone recommend a decent DSP/speech library in C++?

Google returns too much results, although SPUC caught my attention. Is there a standard recommended library like OpenCV for vision? The necessary features would be: Free Open Source filter design (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc) FFT if possible, some speech processing features, like MFCC computation, although that's secondary, as I could use SPTK (sp-tk.sourceforge.net) for that part.
