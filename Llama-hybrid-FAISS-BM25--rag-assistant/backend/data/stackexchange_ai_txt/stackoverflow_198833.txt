[CREATE [ [ GLOBAL | LOCAL ] { TEMPORARY | TEMP } ] TABLE table_name [ (column_name [, ...] ) ] [ WITH ( storage_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) | WITH OIDS | WITHOUT OIDS ] [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE ROWS | DELETE ROWS | DROP } ] [ TABLESPACE tablespace ] AS query][1] Here is an example CREATE TABLE films_recent AS SELECT * FROM films WHERE date_prod >= '2002-01-01'; The other way to create a new table from the first is to use CREATE TABLE films_recent (LIKE films INCLUDING INDEXES); INSERT INTO films_recent SELECT * FROM books WHERE date_prod >= '2002-01-01'; Note that Postgresql has a patch out to fix tablespace issues if the second method is used
