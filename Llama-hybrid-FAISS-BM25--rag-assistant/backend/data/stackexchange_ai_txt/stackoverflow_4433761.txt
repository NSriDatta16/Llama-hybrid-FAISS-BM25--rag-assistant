Have you had a look at LinBox ? It supports several sparse matrix storage formats, some of which allow you to set entries after the matrix has been created: // set m[i,j] to a m.refEntry(i, j) = a; I'm not sure whether your requirement 4. is satisfied out-of-the-box, but it can certainly be coded easily using the refEntry method.
