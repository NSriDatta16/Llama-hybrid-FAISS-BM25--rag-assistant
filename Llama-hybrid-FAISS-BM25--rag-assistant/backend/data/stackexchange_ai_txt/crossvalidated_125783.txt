Cox discrete time regression model question

Cox's 1972 publication Regression Models and Life Tables links logistic regression to an extension of the discrete time proportional hazard model. I do not understand how Equation (21) in the publication is derived. Let $T$ be a discrete random variable that takes the values $t_1 $$f(t_j) = Pr\{T = t_j\}$$ In the discrete case the hazard is a probability and not a rate, $$\lambda(t_j) = Pr\{T = t_j | T \geq t_j \} = \frac{Pr\{T = t_j , T \geq t_j \}}{Pr\{T \geq t_j \}} = \frac{f(t_j)}{S(t_j)}$$ I.e., in discrete time the hazard is just the probability of the event occurring at time $t_j$ given that the event has not occured up to, but not including, $t_j$. As per the proportional hazard model we model the hazard for a particular vector of covariates/features $\mathbf{x}$ at time $t_j$ with $$\lambda(t_j, \mathbf{x}) = \lambda_0(t_j)exp\{\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_ix_i\}$$ Since in discrete time the hazard is a probability we may be interested in looking at the odds: $$\frac{\lambda(t_j, \mathbf{x})}{1 - \lambda(t_j, \mathbf{x})} = \frac{\lambda_0(t_j)}{1 - \lambda_0(t_j)}exp\{\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_ix_i\} $$ I don't understand how the right hand side of the above equation is derived. Many thanks for any help!
