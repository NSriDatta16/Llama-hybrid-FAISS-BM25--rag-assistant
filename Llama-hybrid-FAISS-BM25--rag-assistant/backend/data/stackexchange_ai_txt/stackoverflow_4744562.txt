If you are on Linux or a Mac, you could go to the terminal at the root of the folder containing your JARs and type: # grep -ri "org.openanzo.client.jena" * It will return a recursive list of all JAR files that contain that package name. If it returns 0 results, then none of those JARS contain that package. If you wanted to do a more exhaustive search, you could unJAR the JAR files. The directory structure and .class files will be organized by packages in folders. # jar xvf filename.jar If you are on Windows, you can unJAR a JAR file using a tool such as 7Zip .
