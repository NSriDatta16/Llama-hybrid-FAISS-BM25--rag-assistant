The data can be interleaved. Just start every block (a set of history) with a header that identifies the block and contains its length. When reading you can then easily separate that. You can hold an additional index file next to this for fast access if you require, but if this is the case, I would start studying some embedded database. (TDBF, sqlite or embedded firebird). I would also head in the database direction if I expected that my querying would get more complicated in the future. If it is all about logging, the data doesn't get gigantic and the performance of the view is fine, I would keep the binary file and avoid the hassle of having users to install and maintain a databsae solution. (TDBF is maybe an exception to that, since it is completely statically linked)
