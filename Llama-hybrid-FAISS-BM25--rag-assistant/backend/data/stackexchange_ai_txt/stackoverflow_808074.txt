One idea is that you may have had two screens running on this box and dragged the window off screen. Just search for the registry keys that control where the window opens up and delete them. Alternatively, you should be able to right click on the program in the task bar and select Move. Then use your arrow keys to bring it back. Regardless, I'm voting to close.
