$3.6.2/2- "Variables with static storage duration (3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place." That explains why you get that value of 0 $3.6.2/4- "It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is done before the first statement of main. If the initialization is deferred to some point in time after the first statement of main, it shall occur before the first use of any function or variable defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized. " So what you are trying to do leads to undefined behavior as you are attempting to access a variable with static storage duration which has not yet been initialized as no code in that translation unit has been used as yet.
