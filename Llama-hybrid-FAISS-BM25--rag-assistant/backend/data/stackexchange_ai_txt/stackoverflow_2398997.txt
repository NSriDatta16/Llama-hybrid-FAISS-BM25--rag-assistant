I tend to side with a Session Object Class mainly because it gives me a proxy between the actual session date and what classes are trying to set. For instance: When I have a site live, and a user says they are having problems with X or Y, it is very easy for me to insert a Session Object with data that makes it look like I am that user, without needing to actually log in as that user, or erase any of my own Session data. The other advantage is that I don't have to worry about how I name my variables. This is especially handy if I need to make sure my application doesn't step on another app's toes. I can simply change my variable names in the Session storage, while keeping them the same name when facing my app.
