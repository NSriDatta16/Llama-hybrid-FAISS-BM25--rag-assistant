Find dips in the time series data

I need help to remove dips(trough) from the signals. The red circle in the image indicates the dip and yellow circles indicates contributing points. Means there’re multiple points in the dip. I tried couple of algorithms but it doesn’t help. Using find_peaks() from scipy package only helps to find the deepest point but it doesn’t help to find the other contributing points. Other algo I tried which only finds peaks and contributing points not the dips. One potential solution can be anomaly detection. But my final analysis is anomaly detection and this dips aren’t considered as anomaly. These are just noise. So I can’t use the anomaly detection algorithms. Can anyone please help me with ideas/algo to remove the whole downward spike-The deepest point + the its contributing points?
