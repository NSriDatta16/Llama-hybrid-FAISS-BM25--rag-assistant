From http://spark.apache.org/ : Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing system that aims to make data analytics fast — both fast to run and fast to write. To run programs faster, Spark offers a general execution model that can optimize arbitrary operator graphs, and supports in-memory computing, which lets it query data faster than disk-based engines like hadoop . Spark is not tied to the two-stage mapreduce paradigm, and promises performance up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing that allows user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, making it well suited to machine learning algorithms. To make programming faster, Spark provides clean, concise APIs in scala , java and python . You can also use Spark interactively from the scala and python shells to rapidly query big datasets. Spark runs on yarn , mesos , standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including hdfs , cassandra , hbase , and amazon-s3 .
