First of all your dynamic_cast syntax is wrong (or may be formatting issue?): dynamic_cast syntax: dynamic_cast (BaseClass*) OR dynamic_cast (BaseClassReference) This code looks very suspcious to me. What are you trying to achieve? Why do you want to dynamic_cast an iterator? That doesn't make any sense. EDIT map's begin() has two overloads, one which returns the const_iterator and the other which returns a non const_iterator. In your commented code, since your TypeToThreadIterMapStorage map's value_type is a non-const iterator the second version of begin() is used. However, the type of theData iteartor is a const_iterator and the compiler is complaining that const_iterator can not be converted into a non-const iterator. What you require is a const_cast to remove the constness of the object and not dynamic_cast . But note that this is a dangerous thing to do. The simpler way is to declare theData as a non-const iterator.
