Fast missing data imputation in R for big data that is more sophisticated than simply imputing the means?

I need a package for missing data imputation in R. But since I am dealing with big data, the number of missing data entries can also be high. The packages which impute using mean or median are of course working fast, but more complicated packages which impute using regression or PCA take too long for a high number of missing values. I tried missMDA and missForest , but as I said, they look like taking forever. There is a package named FastImputation , but I could not figure out how to use it when I have no patterns from some training data. Any suggestions of packages which would impute fast?
