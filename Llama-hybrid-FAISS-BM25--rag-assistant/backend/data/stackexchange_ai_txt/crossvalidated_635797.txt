How to make nonlinear predictions on categorical treatments in causal inferece given causal graph?

0 I was learning causal inference and discovery these days and have suffered from this question for a long time. From my understanding of the literature, It seems causal inference is quite different from traditional machine learning. For traditional machine learning, once the model is trained, and given a set of X, the model directly predicts the value of Y. However, for the causal inference, the model answers if X1 changes from 1 to 2, for example, it will return the causal effects on Y. So how can I answer the prediction question using causal inference? Here are some simulated data using this graph: import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Create a directed graph G = nx.DiGraph() # Add nodes X, Y, and Z G.add_nodes_from(['X', 'Y', 'Z']) # Add edges representing causal relationships G.add_edge('X', 'Y') G.add_edge('Z', 'Y') # Draw the graph pos = nx.spring_layout(G) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, font_size=12, edge_color='gray') plt.title('Causal Graph') plt.show() # Create the nonlinear relationships: import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Generate X values X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) # Generate Z values Z = np.linspace(10, 20, len(X)) # Generate Y values using a non-linear relationship with X Y = np.sin(X) + np.cos(Z) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, len(X)) # Combine X, Z, Y into one pandas frame # Combine X, Z, Y into one pandas DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({'X': X, 'Z': Z, 'Y': Y}) # Print the DataFrame print(df) The problem is: How to make predictions on Y when X = 10, Z = 20 pretending you only know the causal graph but not the detailed causal function? I have tried using Microsoft Causia to identify the causal graph. And also the causal inference, but they are not traditional prediction problems.
