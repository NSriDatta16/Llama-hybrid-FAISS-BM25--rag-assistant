That I want to only handle the last node for each id. Below is what I have tried based on some reading: But it does not seem to work. My output still contains all three of the elements. Any ideas on what I can do to correct my issue? The problem with this code is that even though the nodes are in a sorted node-set, their following-sibling s are still the ones in the document. In order for this code to work, one would first create an entirely new document in which the nodes are sorted in the desired way, then (in XSLT 1.0 it is necessary to use the xxx:node-set() extension on the produced RTF to make it an ordinary XML document) on this document the nodes have their siblings as desired. Solution : This transformation presents one possible XSLT 1.0 solution that does not require the use of extension functions: when applied on the provided XML fragment (wrapped in a top element to become well-formed XML document and adding a second version for id="2" ): produces the wanted result : Child 1 Version 2 Child 2 Version 2 Do note : the use of the Muenchian method for grouping.
