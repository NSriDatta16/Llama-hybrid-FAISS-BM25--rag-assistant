I think that the proper way to write the functional margin is $$ \hat{\gamma}_i = y_i(w^Tx_i + b), $$ while the geometric margin is simply $$ \gamma_i = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_i}{||w||}. $$ You can find the answer to your first question in here : [...] the functional margin would give you a number but without a reference you can't tell if the point is actually far away or close to the decision plane. The geometric margin is telling you not only if the point is properly classified or not, but the magnitude of that distance in term of units of |w|. Regarding the second question, see what happens to the Perceptron algorithm . It tries to build a hyperplane between linearly separable data the same as SVM, but it could be any hyperplane. So depending on the training data you used you could have very different hyperplanes, ergo, very different predictions in presence of new data. SVM tries to avoid that by finding the optimal hyperplane, that's why the margin has to be the widest possible, to reduce the chance of misclassification in presence of new data.
