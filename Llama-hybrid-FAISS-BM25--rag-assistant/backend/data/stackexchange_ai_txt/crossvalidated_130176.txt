One approach I've used for this problem is to define the MAPE as (A-F)/(average of A and F) instead of (A-F)/A. This measure (which I think I borrowed from Mosteller and Tukey's book, but I don't have it at hand right now) is symmetric and bounded by -200% and +200%. I know you wanted it to be 0 through 100, but I got you partway there with a measure I may be able to find a reference for. I have used this where (a) I wanted a symmetric measure, and (b) where I wanted to cap the errors ['whether they were horrible (200%) or atrocious (5000%) didn't matter]. The image below compares a standard MAPE with this calculation (AdjMAPE). Later edit: because the errors are signed, they should be a form of MPE, not MAPE. See also comments below by me and whuber.
