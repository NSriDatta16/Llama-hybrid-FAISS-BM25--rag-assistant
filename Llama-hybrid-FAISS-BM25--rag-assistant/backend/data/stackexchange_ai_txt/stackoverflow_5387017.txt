sip "100 trying" instead of "180 ringing"

I develop a software using Microsoft Unified Communications and c#. I'm using a IMVoipSample as a code base. As a voip backend i'm using asterisk. Everything fine, i can register, make calls, accept/reject incoming calls. There is a one thing that i cannot resolve. while i make a call to a 3rd party softphone there is an answer from it: SIP/2.0 180 Ringing Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.250.29:5060;branch=z9hG4bK786d156c;rport=5060 Contact: To: ;tag=9a00d038 From: "6012" ;tag=as66995cd4 Call-ID: 7cebe5d1060b11452571a22e0e2cb919@192.168.250.29 CSeq: 102 INVITE User-Agent: X-Lite release 1002tx stamp 29712 Content-Length: 0 But when i make a call to my IMVoipSample phone there is an aswer: SIP/2.0 100 Trying Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.246.203:45134;branch=z9hG4bK-d87543-71570d1c6127bc7a-1--d87543-;received=192.168.246.203;rport=45134 From: "6011" ;tag=18345648 To: "6012" Call-ID: fd7f305d6520cd53YjQ2ZDJmMDAwZDE0YmUwMjRlMGFmM2NmODg5OGM1ODQ. CSeq: 2 INVITE Server: Asterisk PBX 1.6.2.9-2 Allow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, INFO Supported: replaces, timer Contact: Content-Length: 0 I have a samsung officeserv pbx, it is connected to asterisk, i can make calls to softphones and vice verca. But the audio difference of making calls to softphone and my IMVoipSample phone is there is no normal connecting beeps, only silence. I suppose it is because of "sip 100 trying" instead of "180 rinning". So the question is: do I need setup additional signalling of ringing in client?
