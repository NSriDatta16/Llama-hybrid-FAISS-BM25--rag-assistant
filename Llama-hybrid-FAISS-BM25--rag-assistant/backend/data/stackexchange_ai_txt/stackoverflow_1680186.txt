Visual SVN Server - projects storage location

I recently installed VisualSVN Server. I put Repository on D:\Repositories and added some projects to the repository via Visual Studio 2008. D:\Repositories\reponame seems to be a little bit to small in size when comparing to my projects altogether. I need to make sure where the projects are stored in order to make a backup when reinstalling system on my server. Any help with that would be appreciated.
