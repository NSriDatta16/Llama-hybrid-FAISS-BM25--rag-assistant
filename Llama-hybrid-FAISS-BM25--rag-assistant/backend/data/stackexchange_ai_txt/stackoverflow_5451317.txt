You're right - the select query shouldn't take that long. It's not the number of rows. Likely it's the type of data you've got on that table/view, and perhaps the storage configuration (slow disk, filegroups config, etc). Some ideas to consider to remedy this performance problem: be specific in the columns that you want to retrieve. For ad-hoc queries, SELECT * is fine, but recognize that the RDBMS will work slightly harder to determine which columns are on the table/view. gathering the values any columns of datatype text , varbinary will take proportionally longer depending on the data within those fields. consider the indexes (do you have any?) on the table/view? is this a Prod database, where more/other activity might be hitting this table? If you edit your question, perhaps include the full table definition so that we can get a real look at what's happening with the datatypes.
