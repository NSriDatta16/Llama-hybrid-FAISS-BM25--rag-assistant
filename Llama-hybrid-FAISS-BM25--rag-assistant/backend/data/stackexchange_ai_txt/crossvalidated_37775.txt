Random assignment: why bother?

Random assignment is valuable because it ensures independence of treatment from potential outcomes. That is how it leads to unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. But other assignment schemes can also systematically ensure independence of treatment from potential outcomes. So why do we need random assignment? Put another way, what is the advantage of random assignment over nonrandom assignment schemes that also lead to unbiased inference? Let $\mathbf{Z}$ be a vector of treatment assignments in which each element is 0 (unit not assigned to treatment) or 1 (unit assigned to treatment). In a JASA article, Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996, 446-47) say that treatment assignment $Z_i$ is random if $\Pr(\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{c}) = \Pr(\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{c'})$ for all $\mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{c'}$ such that $\iota^T\mathbf{c} = \iota^T\mathbf{c'}$, where $\iota$ is a column vector with all elements equal to 1. In words, the claim is that assignment $Z_i$ is random if any vector of assignments that includes $m$ assignments to treatment is as likely as any other vector that includes $m$ assignments to treatment. But, to ensure independence of potential outcomes from treatment assignment, it suffices to ensure that each unit in the study has equal probability of assignment to treatment. And that can easily occur even if most treatment assignment vectors have zero probability of being selected. That is, it can occur even under nonrandom assignment. Here is an example. We want to run an experiment with four units in which exactly two are treated. There are six possible assignment vectors: 1100 1010 1001 0110 0101 0011 where the first digit in each number indicates whether the first unit was treated, the second digit indicates whether the second unit was treated, and so on. Suppose that we run an experiment in which we exclude the possibility of assignment vectors 3 and 4, but in which each of the other vectors has equal (25%) chance of being chosen. This scheme is not random assignment in the AIR sense. But in expectation, it leads to an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect. And that is no accident. Any assignment scheme that gives subjects equal probability of assignment to treatment will permit unbiased estimation of the ATE. So: why do we need random assignment in the AIR sense? My argument is rooted in randomization inference; if one thinks instead in terms of model-based inference, does the AIR definition seem more defensible?
