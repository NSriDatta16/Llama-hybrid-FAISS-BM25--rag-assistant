Checking non linear effects in LASSO regression

This might be a weird question and I understand that LASSO is mainly using as a variable selection method. But I want to know that is it possible to check non-linear effects of a LASSO logistic regression model . In GLM setting , we usually do this by fitting two uni variate models. First model with linear effects and the second model with non linear effects . Then chi square test can be used to check whether the non linear effects are significant. I tried to do the same thing using glmnet package as follows, My multiple Lasso logistic regression model : y Then i tried to check non linear effects for each predictor , by first fitting a uni variate LASSO regression model y $Direction x1 beta 2 x 1 sparse Matrix of class "dgCMatrix" s0 (Intercept) . Lag1 -0.06312753 After this , is there way to fit univariate lasso model with non linear effects ? Also after fitting that what test can we used to check the non linear effects (can we use chi square test ?) ? Thank you
