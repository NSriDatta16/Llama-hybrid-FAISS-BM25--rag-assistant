Can you leverage the IE page transition effect and then something else in Webkit and Firefox? This seems like a weird rat hole to go down for an effect. Anything you do in JavaScript for the most part will not be seen by search engines. So even if you could replace the meta tags it wouldn't do you much good. Are you asking if you can do the second block in JavaScript? If you want more info on Ajax and Google Search see: http://searchengineland.com/googles-proposal-for-crawling-ajax-may-be-live-34411
