Let's clarify one thing right off the bat: it sounds to me like you're worried about vectors in 2D. All your points are in the plane. Is it also true that it's a rectangle you're interested in (four corners, all with 90 degree angles, two pairs of opposite sides have identical lengths)? The center of your rectangle is given by the average of the four corner points: (source: equationsheet.com ) (source: equationsheet.com ) There's the starting point of your vector. Any vector is defined by two points, so you just need the second point (e.g., the midpoint of an edge) to calculate the vector in 2D space: (source: equationsheet.com ) The problem with starting from the center point and an angle is that it gives you an infinite number of vectors, not just one. (There are an infinite number of ending points along the line passing through your center point at a given angle.) You'll have to pluck the precise one that you're interested in from that infinite set. If it happens to be the one that intersects one of your sides at an arbitrary point, you'll have to calculate that first. It's a root finding problem along the vector line at that point. Maybe you can check out secant or other numerical methods to figure out how to do it.
