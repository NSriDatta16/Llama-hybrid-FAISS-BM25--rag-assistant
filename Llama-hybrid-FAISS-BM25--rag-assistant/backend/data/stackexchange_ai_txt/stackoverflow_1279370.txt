I'm working on a project which uses docbook, and has examples in PHP. The examples in PHP are using programlisting tag, like this : Note the language attribute. It is used later by another tool to add syntax-coloration, when generating the ouput (for HTML output, at least) For examples that are not specific to one programming language, like configuration files, we are using the screen tag ; for instance, for a part of an Apache-related config file, an example would be : ServerName localhost DocumentRoot /var/www ]]> Quoting their documentations : A programlisting is a verbatim environment for program source or source fragment listings. The programlistings are often placed in examples or figures so that they can be cross-referenced from the text. And : A screen is a verbatim environment for displaying text that the user might see on a computer terminal. It is often used to display the results of a command. Having less specific semantic overtones, screen is often used wherever a verbatim presentation is desired, but the semantic of programlisting is inappropriate. So, these two seem quite appropriate.
