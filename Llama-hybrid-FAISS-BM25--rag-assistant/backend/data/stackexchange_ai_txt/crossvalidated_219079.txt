While not ideal (you would prefer indeed a more balanced color variable) it is not catastrophic. It would be more of a problem if your response variable was quite unbalanced (say 5 positives vs. 295 negatives). You might want to consider Firth regression (essentially a penalized logistic regression variant - see the function logistf from the package with the same name ), if you suspect you might have complete separation within your dataset and/or you get nonsensically large standard errors (Wald estimates of standard error are commonly the first thing that fails in such situations). Yes, if it makes sense to recode your variables so there are no red levels; that would be ideal but I would suggest that only if it is reasonable and not just a trick to sweep some cumbersome observations under the rug. (You do not mention convergence issues, so I assume you model can be estimated successfully.)
