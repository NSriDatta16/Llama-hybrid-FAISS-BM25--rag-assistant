One of the greatest advantages or neural networks is their ability to extract features on their own. Thus, nearly all applications feed the networks raw (or nearly raw) data. In your case, that means the best input for a neural network would be the text you mean to classify (your 200 features can be used as well, but that would be a little more advanced). In terms of hyperparameters (like the number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, etc), in my experience it's best to start at recommended values from some tutorial, and adjust them based on bias/variance analysis. Deeplearning.ai's course on Coursera is a great introduction to neural networks. If you just need some quick results, there's a bunch of tutorials online (Medium is a good place to look) on text classification. Finally I should mention there are many types of neural networks. Text classification is best treated with Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformers (stick to the first until you know what you are doing). Best of luck!
