You should not impute the missing values to be zero. Missing values, the absence of value, is different than having no value. Zero has a numeric meaning. If you impute the missing values to be zero, the model will learn to predict that pattern. Depending on the specific goal, there are two options: Drop rows without complete data. Update weights with the partial data. To update with partial data, find the indexes that have data then calculate the loss only on those values. Most deep learning frameworks have a gather function to retrieve the elements for a set of indices in a tensor.
