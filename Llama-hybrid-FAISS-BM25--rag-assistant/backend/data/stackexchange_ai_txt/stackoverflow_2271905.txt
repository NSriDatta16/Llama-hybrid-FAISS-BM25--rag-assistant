Reading from "Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R", by Robert and Casella: "The assignment operator is = , not to be confused with == , which is the Boolean operator for equality. An older assignment operator is and, for compatibility reasons, it still remains functional, but it should be ignored to ensure cleaner programming. (As pointed out by Spector, P. (2009). 'Data Manipulation with R' - Section 8.7., an exception is when using system.time , since = is then used to identify keywords) A misleading feature of the assignment operator > if (x[1] which is supposed to test whether or not x[1] is less than -2 but ends up allocating 2 to x[1], erasing its current value! Note also that using > if (x[1]=-2) ... mistakenly instead of (x[1]==-2) has the same consequence."
