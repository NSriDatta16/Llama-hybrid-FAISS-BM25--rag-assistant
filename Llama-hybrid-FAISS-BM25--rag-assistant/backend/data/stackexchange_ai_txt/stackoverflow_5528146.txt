Saving Data that never Changes Windows Phone

I wanna create a table somehow in wondows phone that holds data that never changes and the application querys that data. Pretty simple but not sure how to do it. Example a table with Name, Description When you open the app all the theres an input box to enter a name then you press a button and the description displays. Using isolated storage seems like you are writing all the data to a file everytime the a user opens the app. Is that how it works?
