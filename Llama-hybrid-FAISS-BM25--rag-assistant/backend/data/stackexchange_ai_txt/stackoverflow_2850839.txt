What's the (memory) footprint of a Java EE servlet?

For Jetty, Tomcat, or any other servlet container of your choice, what's the average footprint (memory, and any other notable resources) of a basic servlet? This includes any other basic objects that you almost always need per servlet, such as a view resolver. I'm not looking for a quantitative number in particular, but any indicative answer that could give an idea of how "heavy" or "lightweight" a servlet is.
