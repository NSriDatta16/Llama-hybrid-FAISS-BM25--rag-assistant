How to optimize this website. Need general advices

this is my first question here, which is regarding a specific website optimization. A few moths ago, we launched [site] for one of our clients which is some kind of community website. Everything works great, but now this website is getting bigger and it shows some slowness when the pages are loading. The server specs: PHP 5.2.1 (i think we need to upgrade on 5.3 to make use of the new garbage collector) Apache 2.2 Quad Core Xeon Processor @ 2,8 Ghz and 4 GB DDR 3 RAM. XCACHE 1.3 (we added this a few months ago) Mysql 5.1 (we are using innodb as engine) Codeigniter framework Here is what we did so far and what we intend to do further : Beside xcache, we don't really use a caching mechanism because most of the content comes live and beside this, we didn't wanted to optimize prematurely because we didn't know what to expect as far as the traffic flow. On the other hand, we have installed memcached and we want to implement a cache system based on memcached. Regarding the database structure, we have reached 3NF with most of our tables, and yes we have some slow queries(which we plan to optimize) but i think because the tables that produce slow queries are the one for blog comments(~44,408 rows) / user logs tracking (~725,837 rows) / user comments (~698,964 rows) etc which are quite big tables. The entire database is 697.4 MB in size for now. Also, here are some stats for January 2011: Monthly unique visitors: - 127.124 Monthly unique views: 4.829.252 Monthly unique visits: 242.708 Daily average: Unique new visitors: 7.533 Unique new views : 179.680 Just let me know if you need more details. Any advice is highly appreciated. Thank you.
