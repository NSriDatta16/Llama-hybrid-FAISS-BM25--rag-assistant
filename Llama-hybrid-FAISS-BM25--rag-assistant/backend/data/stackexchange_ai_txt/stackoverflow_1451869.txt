Yes, as I stated the current method involves loading the system, database (assuming your sessions use the database), and finally starting the session which is a waste if you are only going to show cached content. Perhaps you could set a cookie called "logged_out" (or "logged_in") in addition to the session cookie. Then you could test for "logged_out" cookie on each page load without the need to load the session and database? Actually, since you would have bots and other non-cookie user agents you it would be better to create a "logged_in" cookie on login and then everywhere else check for a false/non-existent cookie as a sign for a guest.
