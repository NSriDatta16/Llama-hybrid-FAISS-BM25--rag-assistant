Normality of data used to estimate significance of ARIMA parameters?

Does significance testing (p-value, 95% prediction interval of a forecast, etc.) of an ARIMA model require time series data to be normally distributed? As in, according to the tests used to assess normality before linear regression (histogram, qqplot, etc.)? If not, why? Similarly, what about state-space models, such as ETS?
