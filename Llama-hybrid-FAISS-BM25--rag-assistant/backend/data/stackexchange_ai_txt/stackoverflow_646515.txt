What is an elegant way to find versions of packages on a pypi package index?

Currently I'm using a very ugly approach based on a regex for finding links and taking them apart. I'm unhappy with the code, so I'm asking for nicer solutions, preferably using only the stdlib. Edit The task at hand has 2 parts: Find all distributions that match a certain criteria (like prefix of the name). Find all versions available in each found distribution. The expected result is a mapping of distribution -> versions -> files.
