This was something i needed time to realize: Understanding the code written by someone else is not voodoo magic, it's just practice. It's not a matter of intelligence nor logic, truly this is a skill your develop while actually having to understand other's code. I really began to understand this and increase this skill while i start working, as I needed to make changes in others' code. Don't be afraid, the more code you'll read, the easier it'll be.
