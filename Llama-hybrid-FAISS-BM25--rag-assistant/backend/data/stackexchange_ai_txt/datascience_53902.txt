Feature engineering keywords for keras network

I am building a multi-label classifier, using the keras sequential API. My goal is to take an input of keywords 'cat', 'dog', 'rabbit' and apply a custom label. My first attempt was to one hot encode all of the keywords, this works fine for training, but when doing online predictions - in another system the data processing becomes tough, as there is no easy way to maintain the positions of keywords on the input to the NN. My idea is to therefore convert all the keywords to ints and feed this to the network. Is this feasible? The data structure is as follows: | label | keyword_array | | 123 | ['dog','cat', 'happy'] | | 234 | ['sad','foot', 'fast'] | New keywords are also constantly being added as the model is retrained, also an online prediction could have an unseen word. EDIT: Ideally I could use a system that given a string of words, or an list - would return some representation which I could feed into my network both for training and prediction.
