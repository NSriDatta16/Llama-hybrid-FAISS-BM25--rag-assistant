Wouldn't it be easier to compile all the shared code to a DLL and then reference that from the other projects? The problem is that you are strongly coupling the directory structure of the shared folder to all your projects - which is bound to cause you trouble, especially if it changes. As for which svn client to use - I would advise using Tortoise for any change that is not purely within a single VS solution, and the way you are orginising your code suggests to me that the changes you are talking about relate to multiple solutions. Therefore, use Tortoise. The key to easily moving things around in Tortoise is to use the right-click drag feature , which does an svn-aware move.
