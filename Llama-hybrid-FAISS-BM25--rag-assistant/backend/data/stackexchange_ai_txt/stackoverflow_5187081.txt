It's always best to put your regex in a variable. pattern=' HTTP ' while read line do if [[ $line =~ $pattern ]]; then SOURCE=${BASH_REMATCH[1]} break fi done If you quote the right hand side (the pattern), it changes the match from regex to a simple string equal ( =~ effectively becomes == ). As a side note, escaping is done with backslashes ( \ ) rather than slashes ( / ), but that would not help your situation because of the outer quotes as mentioned in my previous paragraph.
