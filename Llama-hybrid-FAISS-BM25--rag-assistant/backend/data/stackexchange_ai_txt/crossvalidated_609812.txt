There isn't one "correct" metric. Reasonable approaches might be to find the image with the smallest mean similarity, or smallest median similarity, or smallest maximum similarity, or smallest minimum similarity. The first two metrics would find images that are on average different from all others. The smallest max similarity would find the image most different from any other, while the smallest min similarity would find the image most different from one other. I might go for the image with smallest maximum similarity, as this will find an image that is different from all other images. When using average-type metrics, you might find an image that is highly different from almost all others but near-identical to another, which may or may not fit your goals. The maximum approach, however, will more highly rank images that are more distinct from every other image, even though they may be less distinct on average. I don't see how the standard deviation or IQR helps here. Those values just indicate the variability with which an image matches others, but not how well it matches. You might have one image that matches all others fairly well with some variability, and another that matches all others poorly with the same variability, and IQR/standard deviation would treat those the same. Imagine you have a set of images that all differ by just 1 pixel. No matter what image you match against that set, you'll have a nearly invariant similarity measure, it doesn't matter if your query picture is totally unique (in which case the similarity measure is uniformly low) or another 1-pixel variant of the same image (in which case the similarity measure is uniformly high).
