I messed around a bit with your code, I think the problem is that position.left returns the position of the object relative to the window and it was returning the scrollbar position. So just changing the position variable from #scrollbar to #grabber worked for me. var position = $("#grabber").position(); and because of this, you don't need to save the grabberStart position Lastly, for some reason, and this took me a while to figure out, IE doesn't like binding to window events. So I switched them to document and BAM! IE is working perfectly. Here is you script updated with the changes I mentioned.
