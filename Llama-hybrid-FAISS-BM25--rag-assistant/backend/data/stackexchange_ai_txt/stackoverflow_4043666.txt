Currently, Windos Phone 7 does not come with native database support for developers. You have 3 options for storing data: 1. Use the isolated storage of the phone 2. Store your data using a cloud service 3. user a non-native db such as Perst. If you have a small amount of data, then serialize it to xml or json file, and store it on the isolated storage of the phone. If your data is large, you will need to use a cloud service or a database such as perst.
