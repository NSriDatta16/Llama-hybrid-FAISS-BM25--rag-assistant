The problem with setPrimitive... methods is that although NSManagedObject will respond to them at runtime, the compiler has no way of knowing they exist. You can suppress the warning messages by declaring the method in your entity class's header file, using a category so the compiler doesn't yell at you for not defining it in your implementation. Another option is just using calling [self setPrimitiveValue:value forKey:@"key"]; for each of the attributes you need to access. I've used this method in the past, although I just noticed in the docs that this is discouraged on 10.5 and later.
