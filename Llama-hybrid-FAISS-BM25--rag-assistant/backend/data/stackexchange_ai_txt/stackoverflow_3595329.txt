Why implicit adding permissions

Installing a simple HelloWorld asks for permission to write to external storage, why? I have not added any request in my manifest? Looking in the logs I see "I/PackageParser(15463): Implicit adding android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to old pkg". I am compiling for Android 1.6 and installing on an Sony Ericsson X10. How do I avoid the request since my HelloWorld does not need any of those permissions and any user might be scared away due to shady permissions?
