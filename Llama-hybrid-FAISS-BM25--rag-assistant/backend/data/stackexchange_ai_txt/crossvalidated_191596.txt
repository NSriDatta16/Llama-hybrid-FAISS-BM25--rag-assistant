I think a moving window is a good approach. On the other hand Pearson's would measure just linear correlations. To check non-linear correlations between the data and your output variable (accuracy) you can measure the correlation between some function of the average of the data in the moving window and the accuracy. You can check that for some common functions (log(x), x^2, x^3, e^x, ...)
