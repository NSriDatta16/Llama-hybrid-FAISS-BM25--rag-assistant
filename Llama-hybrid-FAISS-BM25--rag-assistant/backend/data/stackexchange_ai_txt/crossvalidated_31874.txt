As a practical example: I do some Bayesian modeling using splines. A common problem with splines is knot selection. One popular possibility is to use a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) scheme where one proposes to add, delete, or move a knot during each iteration. The coefficients for the splines are the Least Square estimates. Free Knot Splines In my opinion this makes it only 'partially Bayesian' because for a 'fully Bayesian' approach priors would need to be placed on these coefficients (and new coefficients proposed during each iteration), but then the Least Squares estimates do not work for the RJMCMC scheme, and things become much more difficult.
