I cannot stress this enough, look for real data. If you are using a particular statistical method provided in an R stats package for example, often the package will contain a sample dataset which the authors will demonstrate their methods on. Similarly, if you look in R's datasets , a whole bunch of classic datasets are included. But if you are looking to practice use of statistical methods, this is only the place to start . Datasets included in an R package are not a great representation of real data analysis for two reasons: first, the data is typically organized and clean. Second, the data is typically cherry-picked to make that particular statistical method look great. While it makes sense for an author to do this (why would you demonstrate your method on data where it is unnecessary?), when using statistics to answer real questions, it's not always clear or obvious which method to use. As such, while these datasets are a good basic tutorial (just as anyone should start programming with "hello world") to get more real experience, I would suggest going to public repositories. You might be surprised how much data is freely available. Interested in climate modeling? Go to NOAA and pick what you'd like. Interested in income modeling? European Social Survey. I think it's really cool to actually be making real insights while learning a new method. I do caution that getting and cleaning the data is a considerable amount of work. But that's not an inaccurate representation of what real data analysis is like.
