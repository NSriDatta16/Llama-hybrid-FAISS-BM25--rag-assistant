Design a SMTP server for High Volume Outbound Email

We are developing an application which will require to send around 30 outbound emails per second. We have a server running SMTP but this machine in cloud hosted and I do not have any idea what kind of configuration will I require to support such a load. I do not even know if this load is considered to be average or high. Do i need to do anything special for such a load. Do i need a dedicated quad core server for this kind of load or lets say just 1/10th CPU of a quad core server is good enough
