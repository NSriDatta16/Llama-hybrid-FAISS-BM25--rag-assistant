How to setup multiple Layouts in Zend Framework. Eg. Public/Logged in/Various combinations of modules

I know & used the very basic Zend Framework's Layouts where I used 1 layout throughout the whole site. But now I need a more intermediate/organized setup. The public site layout will have the div#mainContent taking up the whole 12 columns (using 960gs) The logged in site will have div#mainContent taking up 9 columns + side bar with 3 columns In the sidebar of the logged in site, various pages may contain various modules (not Zend Framework's modules, more like "boxes/widgets") They will have different nav menus too I am thinking of using 1 base layout where the 2 sub layouts will "extend". The base layout will just contain the declarations headScripts etc till the then the sublayouts will contain definations for the wrapping divs div.grid_12, grid_9, grid_3 . How can I implement this "extending", basically, I just want to reuse code Also whats a good way to render sidebar boxes/widgets
