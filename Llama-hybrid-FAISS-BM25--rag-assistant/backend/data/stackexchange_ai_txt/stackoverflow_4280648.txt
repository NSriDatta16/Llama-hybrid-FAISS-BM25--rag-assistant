If you're using Tomcat 7, you can use the WebServlet annotation. Like this: @WebServlet(name="CalculatorServlet", urlPatterns={"/calc", "/getVal"}) public class CalculatorServlet extends HttpServlet{ public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) { ... } ... } This code is taken from http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JavaEE/JavaEE6Overview_Part3.html . If you're using Tomcat 6 or earlier, I think you're out of luck, since you'll have to declare all url paths in your web.xml . Perhaps you can use ant or some other trickery to combine a relatively empty web.xml with url paths defined somewhere else at build time.
