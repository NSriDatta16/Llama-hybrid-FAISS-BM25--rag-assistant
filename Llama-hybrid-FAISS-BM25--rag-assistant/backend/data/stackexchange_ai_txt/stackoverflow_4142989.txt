Assuming you're using the jQuery UI Draggable and Slider components, this shouldn't be a problem - the two should not conflict with each other by default. However, you can still explicitly exclude the slider with the cancel option: $('.draggable').draggable({ cancel: '.slider' }); See this jsfiddle for a simple example of this: http://www.jsfiddle.net/yijiang/KMF2v/2 Assuming you're not using jQuery UI... well, in that case I suggest you go out and get it immediately, since writing your own slider and drag-'n-drop component is seriously hard work. Still, the obvious solution would be to stop the event from bubbling down the DOM tree using stopPropagation() $('.slider').click(function(event){ event.stopPropagation(); });
