You are using the wrong operator: || means "logical OR"; what you seem to be looking for is && , that is "logical AND". The code does exactly what you told it to do ( see the documentation ); the fact that you intended something else is not relevant to the computer: if (!empty($_GET['pID']) || !empty($_GET['pName']) || !empty($_GET['pDesc']) || !empty($_GET['pPrice'])) means "if pID is not empty OR pName is not empty OR ..."; as soon as one or more of the fields are not empty, the condition evaluates to true. What you can do to get what you meant: replace OR with AND ( && ) use if (!(empty($_GET['pID']) || empty($_GET['pID'] ...)) - note that the whole expression is negated in parentheses (read on De Morgan's laws to see why these two solutions are equivalent)
