Visualising a table of proportions

I have a table like Arts Science Medicine Engineering Male 0.5476190 0.7663551 0.6436364 0.7253521 Female 0.8025478 0.9508197 0.0000000 0.0000000 were the entries are proportions survived after 50 years, i.e. 0.547... of Male Arts students survived after 50 years. No women studied Medicine and Engineering. I'm looking for a way to visualise this data. Sidenote: This is motivated by a logistic regression I ran modeling logit(survival probability) on sex and university faculty. My result was logit(p)= 0.49 + 0.49*Engineering + 0.27*Medicine + 0.61*Science - 0.72*Male. Any thoughts on visualising that?
