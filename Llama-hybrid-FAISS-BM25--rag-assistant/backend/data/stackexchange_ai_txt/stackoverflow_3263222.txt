For the moment, all the implementations Safari , WebKit, Chrome, Firefox and IE , are following the current version of the WebStorage standard, where the value of the storage items can be only a string. An option would be to use JSON parse and stringify method to serialize and deserialize the data, as I suggested some time ago in another question , for example: var value = "true"; console.log(JSON.parse(value) === true); // true
