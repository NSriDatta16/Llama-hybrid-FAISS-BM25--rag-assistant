What might be missing for high performance one-shot learning models?

CNNs need atleast hundreds if not thousands of samples before one could classify or detect things with near-human accuracy using say fine-tuning of a pre-trained network on Imagenet. What are we missing before we can have a one-shot learning system, where say something new like a fidget spinner is invented in the world and we can get it identified or detected after showing just 1 image (like children do). Does something radical other than convolutional nets needs to be created or are we just waiting for 'that magical architecture' to be discovered by trial and error on arxiv or is it something else.
