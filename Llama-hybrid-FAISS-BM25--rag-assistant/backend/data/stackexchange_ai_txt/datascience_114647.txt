Assuming the dummy model yielding constant probability for all samples, there are two possible thresholds: either everything is classified as positive or negative. So starting point will be (1, positive_class_ratio) and the ending point (0, 1) (by convention, as precision is undefined with no positives). Tutorial version is still reasonable as its AUC conforms with sklearn average precision score for this case.
