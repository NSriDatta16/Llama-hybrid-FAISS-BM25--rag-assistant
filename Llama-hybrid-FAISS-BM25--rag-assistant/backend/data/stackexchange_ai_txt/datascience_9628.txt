You have 10 data points with each data point having 365 (temperature for each day) + 365 (precipitation for each day) dimensions. Ideally, I would first reduce dimensions via machine learning methods, e.g. PCA. Then use machine learning methods to build a prediction model. However, due to the small dataset, I don't think machine learning techniques are appropriate to your problem.
