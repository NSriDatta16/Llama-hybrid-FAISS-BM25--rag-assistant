Model evaluation using Akaike's Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion and Future Prediction Error Criterion

I have come up with 5 different models for a dynamical process which has 3 parameters. In order to decide which model is the best, I am using these criterions from information theory: Akaike's Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion and Future Predction Error Criterion. I have read that the best model is the one which gives the smallest number in any of the above criteria. Suppose the BIC gives for example: $\ -100, \ -150 $ for the first and second model respectively. Can I conclude that the second model is better because it gives smaller result for BIC ? The formula I use for the calculation of the BIC is: $$ BIC = Nln(I(\theta)) + nln(N) $$ where: $\ n: $ number of parameters $\ N: $ total number of data $\ I(\theta): $ mean squared error
