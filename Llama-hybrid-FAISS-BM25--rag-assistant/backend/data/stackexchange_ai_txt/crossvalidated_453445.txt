Can neural ODEs "fit" an ODE from just measurements?

The neural ODE technique, to my knowledge, presents a neural network based way of solving ODEs efficiently, which implies it needs an ODE and an initial value in order to construct the evolution over time. Does the technique still apply if I wish to flip the problem - given a small number of measurements, predict the evolution in the future by attempting to model it as an ODE?
