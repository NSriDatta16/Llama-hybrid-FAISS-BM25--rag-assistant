Rex Griffiths and I just launched a video podcast about all this stuff this week. You can find it over at http://StatCasts.com . We should bring along the funny as well as teach something. You can follow us on twitter ( @StatCastsCom ), where we try to link to cool things we're seeing on this front in real time, or just go to the show. We'll have a lot of links for other people's stuff. Plus, Rex and I are both active developers and have quite a bit of open source software that we give away for this kind of thing. There is the Stanford Course on Machine Learning which is really interesting, but a little hard to follow without some of their offline discussion. Outside of courses, you could look at software packages or books and the communities that surround them. They tend to fill in the gaps about this sort of thing. So, here's a list of some what's out there: Mahout , a machine learning library for Hadoop . There's a Manning book out on this as well. This is a good solution if you want to learn how to do this stuff with Big Data. Modeling with Data , a great book by Ben Klemens who works at the Brookings Institute and explains a really good foundation for this kind of thing. Weka and a book called Data Mining . This is a great way to get involved without getting lost. Weka has an easy-to-use interface that isn't much harder than a spreadsheet to use. The R language is an amazing place to go for this kind of thing. You'll usually find anything analytical you want to do in this package. I have a few books kicking around here for that. The R Book is my favorite, though it's a bit expensive. Octave is the GNU response to MatLab (commercial software). They both have incredible resources behind them. I think Ben Mabey put together a pretty good pinboard full of good teaching links for this kind of thing. Finally, my stuff is Fathom , an open source framework for solving these kinds of problems and http://openmobi.us , a website that implements the Fathom library for people that want to get straight to it. With those projects, I'm trying to make it easy for people to get involved with building their own models and using them for their businesses or education.
