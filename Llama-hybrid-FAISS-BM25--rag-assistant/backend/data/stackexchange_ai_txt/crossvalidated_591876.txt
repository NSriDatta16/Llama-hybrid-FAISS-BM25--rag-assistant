Extending comments into an answer: You should start by not using deep learning. You have tabular data and for such data traditional statistical and machine learning models are successfully used both in the industry and in Kaggle competitions as noticed by Szilard Pafka . There are many empirical studies showing that traditional machine learning models outperform deep learning like this by Javier Rodriguez or the one by Ravid Shwartz-Ziv and Amitai Armon (2021) and many more. You seem to be talking about time-series data and for such data traditional models also outperform neural networks. A great example is the M-competition that started in 1982 and already had five rounds (the last ended recently) where competitors use different models for thousands of time-series. In each competition, we saw simpler, traditional models outperform neural networks, where the only exception was the last competition where a hybrid model combining a traditional approach with a neural network won. In the comment, you quoted this paper by Wohl and Kennedy (2018), as an example of a neural network giving better results than another model, but I am afraid it suffers from exactly the kind of biases we can see in much similar research: the authors use overtly simplistic model and compare it to the neural network. What this research shows is that a neural network beats a trivial benchmark, but it tells us nothing about its performance vs a more reasonable model. This of course does not say that neural networks never work for such problems. It says that with other models you have a higher chance of getting better results. You should try neural networks for tabular data only after you proved that nothing else worked. Otherwise, you are throwing an overtly complicated model at the problem, that is likely to overfit.
