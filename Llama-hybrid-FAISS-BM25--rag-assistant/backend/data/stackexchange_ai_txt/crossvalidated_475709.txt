Determining a relationship in statistical data

I have a large set of data that models the average number of days it takes for people to re-lease a house of type $i$ . I have created an example via Matlab below using random data to help illustrate this. In this example, there are five different house types, such that $i\in [1,5]$ . I am trying to determine some kind of relationship between the re-lease time and house types. For instance, does a house of type $A$ have a longer average re-lease time than a house of type $B$ . How would it be best to determine if a relationship exists between the two variables? As an idea, I have taken the mean and the mode of the average release times for each house type, but I am wondering if this will produce a skewed result given a single data point for a house of type $E$ .
