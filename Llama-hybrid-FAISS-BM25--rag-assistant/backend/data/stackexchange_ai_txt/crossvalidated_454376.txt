R alternatives to JAGS/BUGS

I've recently fit more complex hidden markov models with random effects and covariates etc. JAGS was the only program that could get the job done. Now I want to write my own functions to facilitate model specification etc. Is there an R-Package I could use for Bayesian parameter estimation as an alternative to JAGS? I found an old question regarding JAGS/BUGS alternatives in R, however, the last post is already 9 years old. So maybe there are new and flexible gibbs sampling packages available in R...?
