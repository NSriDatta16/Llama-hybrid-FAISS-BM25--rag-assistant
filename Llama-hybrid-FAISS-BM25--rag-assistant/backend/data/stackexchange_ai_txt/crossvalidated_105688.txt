What regression model to use for a binary predictor and continuous outcome

I have a binary variable, $X=\{0,1\}$ and I want to use this variable to predict a continuous outcome variable $y$ What regression model ought I use to estimate the predictive ability of $X$ of $y$? I know that switching them the other way around, would allow me to use a logistic regression model but that doesn't seem applicable in this scenario. What statistic would I use to assess the significance of this relationship? How can I do this in R?
