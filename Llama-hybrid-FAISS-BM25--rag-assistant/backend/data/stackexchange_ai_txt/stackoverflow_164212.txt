I would be very surprised if the problem were in the XmlTextReader. If you spend a few minutes to write a test program that creates an XmlTextReader and simply uses Read() to read through each node in the file until it gets to the end of the document, I bet you'll find that it zooms through your 12mb file like a hot knife through butter. That's the first thing I'd try if I were experiencing this problem. Because once you've eliminated XmlTextReader as the source of the problem, you can focus your attention on what's actually causing it - which is, very probably, the code that processes the nodes that you're reading, not the code that reads the nodes.
