Robert Bogue and Andrew Connell made a really good web cast series for Microsoft and it sure was a good primer for me. If you like pod casts I can recomment the SharePoint pod show which will keep you updated about all things SharePoint :-) I you are a true TDD believer like me then Andrew Woodward is the place to go.
