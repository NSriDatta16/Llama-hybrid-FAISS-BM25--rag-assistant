In most databases, adding and renaming columns are simple operations that just change the table metadata. You should actually verify that that's the case for the MySQL storage engine you're using, though. Dropping a column should be lightweight too. By contrast, changing the type of a column is an intensive operation, since it involves actually creating data for each row in the table. Similarly, adding a column and populating it (rather than leaving the new column's values as null).
