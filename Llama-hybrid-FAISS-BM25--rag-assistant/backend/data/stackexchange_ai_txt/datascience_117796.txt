VC-dimension of the class of hypotheses that assign label $1$ to exactly $k$ points of some finite domain $\mathcal{X}$

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a finite domain and $k$ a number such that $k\leq|\mathcal{X}|$ . Consider the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}:=\big\{h:|\{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}:h(\mathbf{x})=1\}|=k\bigr\}$ ; that is, the class of hypotheses $h:\mathcal{X}\to\{0,1\}$ that assign label $1$ to exactly $k$ elements of $\mathcal{X}$ . Question: What is the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}$ ? (Note that this is Exercise 6.2 (1) in the book "Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms" from Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David.) The claim is that $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})=\min\{k,|\mathcal{X}|-k\}$ . The solution that was provided to me proceeds as follows: Show that $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})\leq\min\{k,|\mathcal{X}|-k\}$ . Show that $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})\geq\min\{k,|\mathcal{X}|-k\}$ . I'm already struggling with the first part. Let $C\subseteq\mathcal{X}$ be a set of size $k+1$ . Then, $C$ is not shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ as there is no $h\in\mathcal{H}$ satisfying $h(\mathbf{x})=1$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in C$ $\Rightarrow\;\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})\leq k$ . On the other hand, if $C\subseteq\mathcal{X}$ is of size $|\mathcal{X}|-k+1$ , then $C$ is not shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ as there is no $h\in\mathcal{H}$ satisfying $h(\mathbf{x})=0$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in C$ . Hence, $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})\leq\min\{k,|\mathcal{X}|-k\}$ . I don't see why the second step in this line of reasoning is true. For example, consider some domain of cardinality $|\mathcal{X}|=4$ and let $k=3$ . Then, $|\mathcal{X}|-k+1=2$ . So when I pick any $2$ instances from $\mathcal{X}$ so that $C=\{\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2\}$ , why is there no $h\in\mathcal{H}$ satisfying $h(\mathbf{x}_1)=h(\mathbf{x}_2)=0$ ? In my opinion, as $2 , this is actually the only possible labeling. I am convinced the general claim is correct but I believe the proof of the upper bound in the form above is incomplete. Or did I completely misunderstand the problem setting?
