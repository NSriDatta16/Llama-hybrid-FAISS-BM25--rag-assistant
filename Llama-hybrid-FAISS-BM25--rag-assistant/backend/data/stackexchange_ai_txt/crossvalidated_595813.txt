How to perform relative importance analysis on ordinal logistic regression model?

relative importance analysis there is an package called "flipRegression" from github.com which can perform relative analysis/ relative weights to analyze the importance of each brand attribute in relation to the others. I cannot download this package from github, is there any other way to do this analysis?
