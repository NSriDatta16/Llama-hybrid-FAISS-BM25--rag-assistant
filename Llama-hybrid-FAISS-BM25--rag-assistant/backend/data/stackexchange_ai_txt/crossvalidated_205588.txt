Interaction term in logistic regression

I have a question about interaction terms in logistic regression. I have a dummy dependent variable and 2 predictors in the model. Predictor A with 2 levels and predictor B with 3 levels. In an output table in SPSS software I can't find all interaction terms, it just shows 2 interactions rather than 5 interactions. Why is that? for more descriptions: I have these data: Protein intake (High intake versus Low intake) Geno-type (AA, AG, GG) The ref are (High intake and AA) The spss outcome showed the odds ratio just for (Low intake protein,GG) and (Low intake protein,AG). I should also can find the odds ratio for (High intake, GG) and (High intake and AG). But I couldn't find the later results. Why is that?
