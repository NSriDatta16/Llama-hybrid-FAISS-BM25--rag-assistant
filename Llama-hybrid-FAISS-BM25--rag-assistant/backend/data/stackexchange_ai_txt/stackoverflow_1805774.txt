There is no intrinsic penalty to using a key name instead of an auto-generated ID, except the overhead of a (potentially) longer key on the entity and any ReferenceProperties that reference it. In certain cases, in fact, using auto-allocated IDs can have a performance penalty: If you insert new entities at a very high rate (several hundred per second), since all the new entities have IDs in the same range, they will all be written to the same Bigtable tablet, and can cause contention and increased timeouts. The vast majority of apps never have to worry about this, though. There's no performance impact to allocating as many IDs as you want - App Engine simply increases the ID counter by the number you request. (This is a simplification, but generally accurate). In answer to your concerns, App Engine doesn't randomly generate keys. It either uses an auto-allocated id, which is allocated using a counter, and thus guaranteed unique, or it uses the key you supplied. So in answer to your last 3 bullet points: No. Only in storage for the (potentially) longer keys No, and the cost is roughly O(1) regardless of how many you ask for.
