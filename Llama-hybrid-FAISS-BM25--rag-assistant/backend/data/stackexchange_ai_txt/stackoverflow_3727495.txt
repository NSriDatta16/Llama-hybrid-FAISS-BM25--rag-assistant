Are procedural variable and anonymous function equivalent when there's no outer context?

I understand that there are special actions to maintaining the lifetime of a outer variable when it was mentioned inside an anonymous procedure. But when the anonymous procedure doesn't use outer variables, will it generate the same assembly call as the good old general procedure. In other words, will the internals of the anonymous function in the Fragment 1 and NamedFunction from fragment 2 be the same Fragment 1 type TSimpleFunction = reference to function(x: string): Integer; begin y1 := function(x: string): Integer begin Result := Length(x); end; y1('test'); end. Fragment 1 type TWellKnownSimpleFunction = function(x: string): Integer; function NamedFunction(x: string): Integer; begin Result := Length(x); end; var y1: TWellKnownSimpleFunction; begin y1:=NamedFunction; y1('test'); end.
