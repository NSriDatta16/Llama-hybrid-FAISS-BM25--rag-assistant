Logistic regression is not a classifier. It is a probability estimator. Any classification that you do is completely outside the scope of logistic modeling. Some good ways to judge the quality of predictions from logistic regression include high-resolution nonparametric calibration plots, Brier score, and $c$-index (concordance probability; ROC area). The R rms package's lrm, calibrate, validate functions make these easy to do, and calibrate and validate correct for overfitting (bias/optimism) using the bootstrap (by default) or cross-validation.
