Finding correlation between 2 predictors and a response

I've created a dataset, where the response, y, is related to the predictors X1, X2, by the formula: y = 2X1 + 5X2. If we look at correlating y with X1, and then y with X2, we get the following: And then if we look at the whole 3D space, we can see that it can all be perfectly modelled by a 2D sheet: At some point, when we twist the sheet, we can see how we can look down the very edge of the sheet: If I perform PCA and try to find the first 2 principle components of the 3D space (2 x's and y), it would return a set that is looking orthogonality down this sheet, so that it can describe all the variation the best. So this is my question: I don't want to describe the variation, I want to describe the correlation. What technique should I use to return that rotated chart, where we're looking down the edge of the sheet so that we can see that there is some combination that perfectly correlates the predictors with response?
