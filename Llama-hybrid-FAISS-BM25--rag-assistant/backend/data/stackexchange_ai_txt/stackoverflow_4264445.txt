Implementing a job scheduler for ASP.NET MVC

I need to execute some activities/jobs in my Web Server, such as indexing some information, organizing some files, and calculating some statistics... I want to preserve the QoS in my Web Server (performance, memory consumption, ...). So I'm thinking of executing an external process for these activities, instead of calling in a thread. Something similar to Apache MPM processer (it launches child processes to process the requests). Do know any best solution to do this? Do you know any library that could do this for me? Thanks in advanced.
