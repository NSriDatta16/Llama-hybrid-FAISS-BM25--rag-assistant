I'm quite sure that you don't require terracotta or ehcache server if you need a distributed cache. Ehcache with one of the four replication mechanisms would do. However, based on what you've written I guess that you're looking for more than just a cache. Memcached/Ehcache are examples of what you might call a caching layer for your application - nothing more. If you find yourself using words like 'guaranteed' 'up-to-date' 'ACID' you're better off using an in-memory DB like Oracle Times Ten/MySQL Cluster/Redis with a disk-based persistent storage.
