If you face this problem and you use the Ibator Ibatis framework as DAO-layer (like we do) you can handle this case by using the -tag in the ibator.config. In general you solve this problem by doing a SELECT sequencename.nextval FROM tablename on the table named tablename using the sequence sequencename to get the next key for the values to insert. PS: There is no need to pay attention on transactionhandling here, because the next call of the nextval -function will return the next sequencevalue.
