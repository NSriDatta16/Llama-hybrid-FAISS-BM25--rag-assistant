I think cookies would probably be the best option here as it's the only way you are going to be 100% sure requests are unique. Of course, you could possibly add a mix: if cookies are disabled you might be able to try other options of identification such as the IP address method, but that could make it overly-complex. As you say, IP address is liable to change and in some organizations there may be a group of proxy servers setup which make requests originate from different IPs. Of course, you could check X_FORWARDED_FOR, but they are still liable to change. Header data is probably going to prove difficult to get good results on I think. If you've got an organization that has the same browser, OS, IP it is going to show people as being the same. Even people not in the same organization may still appear similar (i.e AOL users who get their traffic usually routed through proxy servers, the majority will probably be using the 'AOL browser' that gets shipped with it giving similar headers). Out of those two options, the IP one is going to be easy to implement but obviously there are the problems I outlined. Checking for unique data in the headers will prove to be absolute pain I think. Obviously as you say, sessions are lost on closing the browser, and it appears you want the system to behave as if they were a registered user so cookies seem a more obvious choice (especially as you want the 'favourites' to be persistent).
