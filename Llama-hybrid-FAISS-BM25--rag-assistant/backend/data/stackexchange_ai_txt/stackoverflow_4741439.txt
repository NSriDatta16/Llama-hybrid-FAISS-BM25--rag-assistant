Is it possible to create fast (in-memory, non-ACID, etc) tables/databases in SQL Server?

In Sqlite, there's an option to create an in-memory database , and another to not wait for things to be written to the filesystem , and to put the journal in memory or disable it . Are there any settings like this for SQL Server? My use case is storage for data that should persist for about a day in normal use, but wouldn't be a big deal if it was lost. I would use something like memcached for it, but I want to be able to control the cache time, not just hope I have enough memory.
