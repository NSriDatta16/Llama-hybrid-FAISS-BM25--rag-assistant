Every model for binary outcomes that I know has a multiclass analogue. Logistic regression has multinomial logistic regression. Neural networks with sigmoid activation functions for the final layer have softmax activation for multiple output neurons. Random forest handles $3+$ classes fine. SVM handles $3+$ classes fine. Depending on the software, there might be considerable differences when it comes to preprocessing data and calling functions, but it can be done.
