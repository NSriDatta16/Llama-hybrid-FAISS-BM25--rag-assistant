See also Andrew Gelman's paper literally titled "R-squared for Bayesian regression models": http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/bayes_R2.pdf In that paper, he proposes $R^2 = Var(\hat{y}) / (Var(\hat{y}) + Var(e)) $ which has a similar interpretation to traditional $R^2$. However, since this is bayesian, that value is now a r.v. and needs to be summarised, eg by posterior median. He also provides a small R function for calculating it.
