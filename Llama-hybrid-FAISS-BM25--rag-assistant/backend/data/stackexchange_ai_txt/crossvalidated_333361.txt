This shouldn't be too difficult to deal with from first principles, simply by treating the parameters for males and females separately and then combining them to give a corresponding estimate of the overall probability of a "yes" (which is a linear function of these parameters). For simplicity, I would suggest you don't worry about having correlation in your prior; you have a substantial amount of data so the value of complicating your model for a minor variant in prior is minimal. As a simple case, you could consider using the following conjugate Bayesian model: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} X_M &\sim \text{Bin}(n_M, \theta_M), \\[4pt] X_F &\sim \text{Bin}(n_F, \theta_F), \\[4pt] \theta_M &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta), \\[4pt] \theta_F &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta), \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ where the values $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are specified by your prior belief, and $n_M$ and $n_F$ are fixed by the sampling design. This yields independent posteriors: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \theta_M | x_M, x_F &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + x_M, \beta + n_M - x_M), \\[4pt] \theta_F | x_M, x_F &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + x_F, \beta + n_F - x_F). \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ For a large population with a specified proportion $\phi$ of males, the overall proportion of "yes" people is given by the parameter $\theta \equiv \phi \cdot \theta_M + (1-\phi) \cdot \theta_F $. The posterior distribution for this parameter is complicated by the fact that it involves a convolution of beta distributions, which does not have a closed-form solution. Nevertheless, it is simple to simulate values of the distribution using the beta random variables. #Set your prior parameters alpha This R code generates a vector of independent simulated values of $\theta$ from the posterior distribution. From there you can estimate the posterior distribution via kernel density methods and obtain the posterior mean/mode or credibility intervals.
