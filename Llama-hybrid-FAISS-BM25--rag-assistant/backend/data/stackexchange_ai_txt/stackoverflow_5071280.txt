Remou's answer is exactly what I needed, but since StackOverflow is a great resource, this is what I ended up tweaking it to for our particular case: In particular, the text is within the first sentence of a paragraph. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to catch all of our cases, but it grabs most of them, and gets the user most of the way there. (Some of the comments below were included on external resources I'd found, so whether they're actually necessary is questionable, but ... it works.) ' Do our bold heading replacements Dim s As Range, p As Paragraph Dim wd As Range Dim BoldHead As Boolean Dim doc As Document Set doc = ActiveDocument For Each p In doc.Paragraphs Set s = p.Range.Sentences(1) If s.Words(1).Bold = True And s.Words(1).Characters(1) = "(" Then BoldHead = True For Each wd In s.Words If Trim(wd) <> vbNullString _ And wd <> "." _ And wd.Bold = False Then BoldHead = False End If Next If BoldHead Then With s.Find ' Clear all previously set formatting for Find dialog box. .ClearFormatting .Text = "(\([0-9]@\)) (?@)." ' Clear all previously set formatting for Replace dialog box. .Replacement.ClearFormatting .Replacement.Text = "\1 \2." .Replacement.Font.SmallCaps = True .Replacement.Font.Name = "Times New Roman" .Replacement.Font.Bold = False ' The following parameters must be set as follows to find only text formatted for the specified font. .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue .Format = True .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchWildcards = True .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchAllWordForms = False .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceOne End With With s.Find ' Clear all previously set formatting for Find dialog box. .ClearFormatting .Text = "(\([0-9]@\)) " ' Clear all previously set formatting for Replace dialog box. .Replacement.ClearFormatting .Replacement.Text = "\1" & vbTab .Replacement.Font.SmallCaps = False .Replacement.Font.Name = "Arial" .Replacement.Font.Bold = True ' The following parameters must be set as follows to find only text formatted for the specified font. .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue .Format = True .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchWildcards = True .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchAllWordForms = False .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceOne End With End If End If Next
