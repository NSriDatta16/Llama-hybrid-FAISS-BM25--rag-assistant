Event prediction with quantitative Social Media Data (Time Series)

I want to use Twitter data to predict a boolean event. Let's say the Event is labeled as 1 (no event = 0). I have several twitter datasets containing at least one timeframe with the event 1. A dataset consists of about 20,000 Twitter posts with several features (such as user information, likes, retweets, sentiment score,...). Here a more clear example: The dataset x start with posts from 01-Jan-2018 to 30-Mar-2018, all posts labeled as 0 (each observation has the above stated information). On 31-Mar-2018 at 3:22pm the event starts and lasts for 3 days. Within these 3 days (from exactly 3:22pm) all posts are labeled as 1 (Event = yes). After that, I've 3 more month of observations labeled as 0. I've about 30 datasets from this kind, sometimes there are more than one event time-frame, maybe two or three. My goal is to train models to detect as early as possible if the event occurs. My idea so far: Since one observation (=one post + information) can't predict the event alone, my idea is to aggregate 10 minute-chunks containing means of the aggregated data and volume information (total number of posts within these 10 minutes) and label them as 1 or 0. After that, I'd train machine learning algorithms on that cases and hope that it is able to predict the event with the aggregated data of 10 minutes. My question(s) to you: Do you think that it as an idea that can work? Or do you have any better suggestions or methods I should try? Furthermore, do you have any suggestion for how to choose the best length of the "chunks"? 10 Minutes was just an example, do you have any idea how to choose the length? Cheers :)
