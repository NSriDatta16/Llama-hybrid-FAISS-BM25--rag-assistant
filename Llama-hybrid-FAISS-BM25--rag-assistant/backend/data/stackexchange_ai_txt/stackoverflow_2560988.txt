Things are much easier to deal with when the technology stack is homogeneous. If you want MySQL support for Linq-to-SQL, good luck. It's still very much immature. With SQL Server, it's a matter of drag and drop. Literally. You can also conduct Database queries from within Visual Studio for SQL Server. I've never tried it for any other database, but I'm not convinced you'd be able to. It's great to say 'Oh, MySQL is so much cheaper than SQL Server.' Yes, it is. But I'm not sure the integration costs are worth it; not to mention having to rely on Yet Another Vendor to provide support if something goes wrong.
