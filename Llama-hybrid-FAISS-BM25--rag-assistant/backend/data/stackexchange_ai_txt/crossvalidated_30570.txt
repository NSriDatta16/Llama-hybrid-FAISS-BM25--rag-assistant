You can think of the R-squared as a property of the factory. You should have a conceptual understanding of why there should be a relationship between your two variables in each factory and what leads to stronger or weaker relationships. You have encountered an outlier observation (i.e., the factory with low $R^2$). It's up to you to analyse the data and think about what might have caused the outlier . As @whuber notes a useful strategy is to plot the scatterplots of your two variables in each organisation, and particularly in the outlier organisation. There may be a mistyped datapoint in the outlier. Alternatively, something unique may have been occurring in the factory to prevent the relationship from holding (e.g., the factory broke down or their was industrial action, etc.).
