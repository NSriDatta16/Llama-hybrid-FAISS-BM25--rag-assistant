You would have to define exactly what you mean by "similar", either for the simpler or more complex case. A really easy measure of similar would be mean annual temperature. But you might want mean temperature for a particular month, or you might want the mean high temperature. (You have average daily maximum). Then you might want to do something about seasonal variability. Many cities (like Lagos in your example) have roughly the same temp year round. But cities outside the tropics (like London) don't. You could look at mean difference in average high temperatures by month, but that would not capture the highest temps in cities like London. There are all sorts of possibilities, but you have to decide what you want. Once you've done that, maybe someone here can help (although you might want to ask on a Python list). For help deciding on a measure of similarity, the Earth Sciences stack exchange might be better than CrossValidated.
