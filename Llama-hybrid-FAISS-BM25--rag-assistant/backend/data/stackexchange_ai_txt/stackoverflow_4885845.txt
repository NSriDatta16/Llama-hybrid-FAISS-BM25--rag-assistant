Android should correctly use the right image when you use R.drawable and your images are in drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi etc. Since that is what I think you've described as what you've done, it hints that maybe you've hardcoded a size? Are you using ImageView and set a size for them? If so, did you do it in Java code or in XML? If in Java code the values would be in pixels, so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens. If you used XML did you again set a size with px? If so, you should use dp.
