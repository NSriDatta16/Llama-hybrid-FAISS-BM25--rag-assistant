Statistics without hypothesis testing

In his blog posts, Andrew Gelman says he is not a fan of Bayesian hypothesis testing (see here: http://andrewgelman.com/2009/02/26/why_i_dont_like/ ), and if I'm not misremembering, I think he also says Frequentist hypothesis testing has also shortcomings. My question is: can you do stats without hypothesis testing even for (sorry for the repetition) hypothesis tests and to make decisions? Is the solution to rely only on estimation and make decisions based on estimated probabilities? If so, can you point out where to learn about this?
