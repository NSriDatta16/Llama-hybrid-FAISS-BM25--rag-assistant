Contradictory statistics in news source?

Here are some interesting statistics at the bottom of a news article from today: "Up to 6% of children have food allergies, ..." "Nearly nine in 10 schools nationally had one or more students with food allergies." I readily found a 15-year-old source that showed that, for public schools at least, the average population of schools was generally high enough that most schools have a very high likelihood of food allergies, being on the order of as few as 160 and probability of allergy around 0.00005. Of course that table doesn't say anything about the distribution other than the mean or anything about non-public schools, which are likely to be smaller. I find it very unlikely that there could be that many schools without allergies if the incidence rate is that high and a typical school has a few hundred students. Is there any relatively simple ways to (in)validate the plausibility of those two figures?
