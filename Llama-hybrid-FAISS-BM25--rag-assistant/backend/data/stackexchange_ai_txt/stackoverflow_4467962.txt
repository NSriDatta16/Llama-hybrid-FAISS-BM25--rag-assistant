I think with Xcode and Interface Builder (iPhone's development platform), getting this task done would be even simpler. As a brief introduction to iPhone app's UI design, to place this tab bar (as you put it, the menu) on a view, all you need to do is pick up a tab bar from the library and place it on a nib file's view. You can also connect such a tab bar with some codes responsible for internal logic by simply clicking and dragging. It's simple. btw, a nib file is just some file format Xcode and Interface Builder use to hold the UI data.
