With the information you have, you can recover all the information your are missing and then provide the RSACryptServiceProvider with all the parameters it wants. The algorithm you need to get started is here . Look at section 8.2.2(i), "Relation to Factoring". The third paragraph, which starts out "On the other hand", proceeds to outline a simple algorithm which you can use to recover the primes p and q. From these, you can recover the other values easily. You'll need a reasonable BigInteger package.
