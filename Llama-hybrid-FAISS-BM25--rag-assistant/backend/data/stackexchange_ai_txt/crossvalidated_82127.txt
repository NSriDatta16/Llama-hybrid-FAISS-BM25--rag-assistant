Odds ratio traps 1 when p value significant

I have a set of imputations on which I'm using PROC GLIMMIX to build a regression model for a binary outcome. I'm using PROC MIANALYZE to roll up the output, part of which includes upper and lower confidence limits which can be exponentiated to obtain a confidence interval for the odds ratio. GLIMMIX also yields Type III F tests of the model effects, but it's generally conceded that chi-square tests are more appropriate for these models. A good approximation can be obtained by multiplying the F value by the numerator degrees of freedom. That's tenable in my sample seeing that it's very large. I found it difficult to roll up the F tests in MIANALYZE, so I used a data step to compute the chi-square and average over the 10 imputations, and then simply tested as a chi-square at the numerator degrees of freedom. Here's the rub: A couple of my model effects are significant when I roll up the chi-square, but the odds ratios trap one. I don't know how to resolve the paradox. Is there some variance due to imputation not accounted for in the roll up of the chi-square tests? How do I get around this problem?
