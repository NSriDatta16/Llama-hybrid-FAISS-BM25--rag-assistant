Estimate the support (~ confidence interval of the output) for a linear regression

Consider a linear regression model like this: I want to draw two margins, say upper- and lower-bounds, which contains 95% of the data . Formally, given a regression model ( $\hat{y} = Ax+B$ ), I want to find the margin with $\epsilon$ length from each side of the regression line such that the absolute error of the model is less than a certain amount for 95% of the training data. In other words: $| Ax_i+B - yi| for 95% of the $x_i$ values. What is the proper term for this? How can I estimate it? PS. The literature I found so far is mostly about the confidence intervals of the oracle values for slope and the base ("A" and "B"), but that's not what I am looking for. PS. I am using Bayesian linear regression, but I guess the answer is oblivious to whether one uses Bayesian or ordinary linear regression.
