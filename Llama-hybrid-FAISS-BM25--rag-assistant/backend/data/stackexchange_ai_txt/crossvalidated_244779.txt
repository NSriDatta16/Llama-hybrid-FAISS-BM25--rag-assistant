Training a neural network on subsets of features, and then comparing it to the full neural network?

Let's say I have a neural network with many features, but the features can be grouped into roughly 4 subsets A, B, C, D . I want to train the neural network using features A, B, C and compare how correlated the output is with the full neural network. It's kind of like cross validation, but using hold-out features instead of hold-out samples. The idea is to learn which features are affecting the output the most. Is this a viable idea, and is there any literature in this direction?
