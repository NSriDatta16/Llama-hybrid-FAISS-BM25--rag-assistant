You don't need to find the minimum spanning tree. That is really for finding the "best" edges in a graph that will still keep the graph connected. In other words, you don't care how John and Robert are connected, just that they are. You say that the problem is that the graph would not be completely connected, but I think that is actually the point. If you represent graph edges by using the couples as you suggest, then the vertices that are connected form the groups that you are looking for. In your example, James is connected to Mary and also James is connected to Patricia. No other person connects to any of those three vertices (if they did, you would have another couple that included them), which is why they form a single group of (James, Mary, Patricia). Similarly all of John, Robert, Barbara, and Linda are connected to each other. Your task is really to form the graph and find all of the connected subgraphs that are disjoint from each other. While not a full algorithm, I hope that helps get you started.
