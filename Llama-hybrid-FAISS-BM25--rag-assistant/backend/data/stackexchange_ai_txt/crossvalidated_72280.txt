Yes. And actually this is the interesting invariance property: it means that two Bayesians using a different parameterization of the model but both using the Jeffreys prior, obtain the same posterior distribution (up to change-of-variables) to draw inference. Conceptually, there's no prior predictive distribution based on the Jeffreys prior. The goal of the Jeffreys prior is to provide a posterior distribution which reflects as best as possible the information brought by the data. There's no prior belief about the parameters, hence no prior predictive distribution of the data. It is not clear what you mean by invariance for a (prior or posterior) predictive distribution. But note that from 1), two Bayesians using the Jeffreys prior but different parameterizations, obtain the same posterior predictive distribution. The MAP is the mode of the posterior distribution. It is not invariant, in the sense that if you use $\theta$ as the model paramater on one hand, and $\psi=f(\theta)$ on the other hand, with $f$ one-to-one, then the mode of the posterior distribution of $\psi$ is not the image under $f$ of the mode of the posterior distribution of $\theta$. That means that our two Bayesians, both using the Jeffreys prior but using different parameterization, will get incoherent results if they consider the MAP as the parameter estimate.
