As the writer of the first logistic regression procedure in SAS I feel quite guilty about putting measures such as proportion "classified" "correctly" in the procedure, and when the procedure was re-written by SAS Institute, they carried along the measures I had programmed. Measures such as classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity should never have been applied to logistic regression. Logistic regression is all about estimating probabilities, and any measures you choose should be functions of estimated probabilities and observed outcomes, and should use no binning (categorization) of any kind.
