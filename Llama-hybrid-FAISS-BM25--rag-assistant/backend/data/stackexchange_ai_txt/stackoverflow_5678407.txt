NHibernate assumes that all database operations are done within transactions, so people use them explicitly instead of having NHibernate the RDBMS use them implicitly. Ayende explains this in more detail in his post NH Prof Alerts: Use of implicit transactions is discouraged . Edit: Learned something new today. It's not NHibernate using implicit transactions but the DB.
