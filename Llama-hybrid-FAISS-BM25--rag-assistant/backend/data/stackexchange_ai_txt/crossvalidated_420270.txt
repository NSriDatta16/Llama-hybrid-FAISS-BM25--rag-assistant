Odds ratio (g1 vs g2) = odds(Y=1|g1)/odds(Y=1|g2) = exp(log(odds(Y=1|g1))-log(odds(Y=1|g2))) = exp(a1-a2). First "=" comes from the definition of odds ratio. Second "=" comes from x/y = exp(log(a)-log(b)) Third "=" comes from the definition of logistic regression. For any 2 subjects A and B, let $X_A$ and $X_B$ are their values on covariates, then OR(A vs B) =exp( $X_A\beta - X_B\beta)$ = exp( $(X_A-X_B)\beta)$
