Well you could try unsupervised clustering. You may want to leave out the user and item label to start. Depending on how much data you have and guesses at how many "categories" you might end up with you can use K-means or Mean sift clustering. The idea would be you let the similarities be worked out so that you group the items together and give you the "Categories" and there for the similar items. Then you can use the model for any future. After you have done this you can introduce the User labels and item labels to build the similarity at the User level. A next step in exploration, depending on the item and attributes, might be reducing the attributes to the average of each item so that one user has averages of each attribute for all items and then use that data. Then you then averages to cluster in terms of types of "user" Both ways would assume the attributes for each item is very similar the attributes to the others items. eg item | sweetness | acidity | bitterness orange| 0.593 | 0.7852 | 0.484 banana| 0.18 | 0.96 | 0.05 apple | 0.423 | 0.886 | 0.156 Or you can just do direct numerical comparison between users so that you calculate something like statistical entropy between the two across all items per attribute, average for all attributes, and set a range so that if in a certain range they are considered similar or different. Hope this helps!
