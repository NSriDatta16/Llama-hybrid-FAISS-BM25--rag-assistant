Random forest - Out-of-bag estimates

I am reading the chapter on random forests by Leo Breiman (found here: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf ). In section 3.1 Using out-of-bag estimates to monitor error, strength, and correlation (page 11), it says: In each bootstrap training set, about one-third of the instances are left out. Therefore, the out-of-bag estimates are based on combining only about one-third as many classifiers as in the ongoing main combination. I am not sure I understand how the first sentence (that about one-third of cases are left out of each bootstrap sample) implies the second (that each case is OOB in about one-third of the trees)?
