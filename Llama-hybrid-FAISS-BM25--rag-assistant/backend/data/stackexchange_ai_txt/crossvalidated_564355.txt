Why not run some cross validation (or better yet, some nested cross validation) and treat this difference as a hyperparameter? As in, just include another parameter in your tuning, which is a 0/1 "expanding/sliding window" and try both to see which gives better performance? My intuition would be that for a data-hungry method like LTSM, you would want to give it all the info you can and use an expanding window, but try both and see! Personal tip: I would advise against using neural nets for financial prediction. You probably have too little data for a neural network to be properly optimized (too little data, too many parameters to optimize).
