jQuery - Perform a Calculation

I have the following 3 input fields in a form: and the following paragraph: I want to multiply the three text inputs together and fill in the grand_total with the result. I only want the result to appear when we have filled in all three text inputs with integers between 0 and 1000. Also if any of the text field values are changed to another valid integer then I want the grand_total to be re-calculated. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks.
