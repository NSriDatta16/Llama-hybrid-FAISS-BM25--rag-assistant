Either I am misinterpreting your plot or there is some problem. The fact that you have negative residuals for near 0 expected values implies that your model is predicting negative value. This should not be possible for logistic regression models which only predict in the (0, 1) interval, unless you are using the log-odds output of the model in which case residual error should be undefined. Since logistic regression is a classification method, it is more useful to look at the confusion matrix first. You should also specify if the graph is based on the train data or a separate test set.
