You may have to adjust the df parameter of your student-t distribution. You can fit a student-t distribution in R using the MASS package with fitdistr() . But make sure to check the discussion about Fitting t-distribution in R: scaling parameter . It could also be possible that you have to fit the conditional returns of your GARCH time series to the student-t rather than the raw time series to find the correct df parameter, but I am note sure on that.
