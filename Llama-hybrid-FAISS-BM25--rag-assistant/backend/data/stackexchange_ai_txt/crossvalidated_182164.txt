This is a software question, but I will answer it before I vote to move it. R takes the first level when ordered alphanumerically of a factor as the default. In the first case this is cond1 and in the second case c (corresponds to cond2!). This means that caret switches the positive and the negative class in your logistic regression. If you look at the probabilities, you can see that they add up to 1. This means the second one just gives 1 - the output of the first model.
