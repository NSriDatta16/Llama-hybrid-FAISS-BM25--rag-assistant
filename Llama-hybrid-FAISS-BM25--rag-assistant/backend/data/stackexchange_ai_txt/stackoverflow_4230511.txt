TFS Team Build Coded UI Tests using Test Agent with Windows Form App - TestInitialize - launching the application

If I want tests to run against a Windows Forms application that is built using a team build and then will pass the build process to a test agent to run coded UI tests, can anyone enlighten me as to a good way to ensure that before the Coded UI tests run, that the application that has just been built is executed on the test agent machine so that the tests can run against it?
