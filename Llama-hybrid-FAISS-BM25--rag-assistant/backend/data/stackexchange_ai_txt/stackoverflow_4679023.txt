Bug with Chrome's localStorage implementation?

Further to this question , I'm getting a curious result when binding a function to the change event of the Storage object in Chrome 8.0.552.224. The test: Chrome localStorage Test var handle_storage = function () { alert('storage event'); }; window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false); Add Clear Open up the page in two Chrome windows, one window with two tabs, Click the 'Add' button When I do this I get an alert box displayed on on the second tab and on the second window but not on the tab that invoked the event (the I clicked on). As I understand it I should see three alert boxes (one for each tab opened). Is this a bug? Is anyone else getting this behaviour? If not what version are you running? Or have I just got this all completely wrong?
