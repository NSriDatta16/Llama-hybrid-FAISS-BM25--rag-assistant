The Appropriate CMS and extensions for a dynamic tagging with social features

I am seeking to create a dynamic tagging site with social features. The closest comparative is GDGT.com, which is a social network around gadgets. My site will be organized around a different topic altogether, but I like how GDGT does their dynamic tagging, discussions, and wiki. I also love Stack Overflow's dynamic tagging and badges. The framers of this concept are not deeply technical. In other words, we know enough PHP and C# to be dangerous, but will have to hire out the complicated stuff. So, the main question is, which CMS is the most out-of-the-gate capable for this type of site. A combination CMS and CMS Extensions would be fine, too. We have evaluated ELGG, and find that the developer base is too small. We have also evaluated Wordpress, and find it's heritage as a blogging-only tool limiting. Drupal is still a contender, but looking for guidance on the appropriate extensions.
