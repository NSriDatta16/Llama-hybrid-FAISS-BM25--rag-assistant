The importance of the features for a logistic regression model

I have a traditional logistic regression model. I want to know how I can use coef_ parameter to evaluate which features are important for positive and negative classes. Some of the values are negative while others are positive. Does it mean the lowest negative is important for making decision of an example as a negative class? I don't know about it. One more thing, how can I convert those values to standardized regression coefficients? I will appreciate for any help.
