ASP .net current physical location

Hi I am developing an ASP.net web application. I need to find the current location (physical) of the web site (or the bin directory containing the assemblies). I have tried using Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() and that returns me the ASP .net temporary directory. I really don't like the idea of include an application setting for the absolute path in my config file (eww!) Any help would be much appreciated! :) Conclusion: I should have given some context as to Why I would like the physical file path. Thanks guys for your prompt responses to the question :) I am using XSL-FO for .net (the FO.net library) to generate a PDF. Embedding images in FO requires an absolute path to be given: What I needed to do was set the current directory to the web site (or bin directory), which would allow the XSL FO renderer to know where to find the image.
