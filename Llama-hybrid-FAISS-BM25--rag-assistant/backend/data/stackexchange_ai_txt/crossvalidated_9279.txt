If I understood you correctly, you have a list of scores for subsets, and you want to identify the items that contribute most to a high score, but you cannot score arbitrary subsets. This corresponds to a high-dimensional binary regression problem with features $item\in Subset$. You can run a linear or logistic regression on the dataset. If you want a multiset or partition instead of an itemwise regression, you'll have to specify the goal and scoring model further.
