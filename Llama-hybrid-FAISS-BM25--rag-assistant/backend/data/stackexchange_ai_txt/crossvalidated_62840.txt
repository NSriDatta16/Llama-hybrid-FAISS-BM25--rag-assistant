Random Forest and cluster-level bootstrapping

I'm working with cluster-correlated data (individuals nested into households). I would like to modify the bootstrap sampling process to make a household-level bootstrap instead of the subject-level bootstrap. My aim is to ensure that the entire household is included in the sample used to grow each tree of the forest. I'm working with R package 'randomForest'.
