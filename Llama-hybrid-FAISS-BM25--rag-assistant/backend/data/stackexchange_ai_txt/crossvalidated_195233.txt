I think Bitwise covers most of my answer but I am gonna add my 2c. No, I am sorry but a statistician is not a data scientist, at least based on how most companies define the role today. Note that the definition has changed over time, and one challenge of the practitioners is to make sure they remain relevant. I will share some common reasons on why we reject candidates for "Data Scientist" roles: Expectations about the scope of the job. Typically the DS needs to be able to work independently. That means there's nobody else to create the dataset for him in order to solve the problem he was assigned. So, he needs to be able to find the data sources, query them, model a solution and then, often, also create a prototype that solves the problem. Many times that is simply the creation of a dashboard, an alarm, or a live report that constantly updates. Communication . It seems, that many statisticians have a hard time "simplifying" and "selling" their ideas to business people. Can you show just one graph and tell a story from the data in a way that everybody in the room can get it? Note, that this is after you secure that you can defend every bit of the analysis if challenged. Coding skills . We don't need production level coding skills, since we have developers for that, however, we need her to be able to write a prototype and deploy it as a web service in an AWS EC2 instance. So, coding skills doesn't mean ability to write R scripts. I can add fluency in Linux somewhere here probably. So, the bar is simply higher to what most statisticians tend to believe. SQL and databases . No, he can't pick up that on the job, since we actually need him to adapt the basic SQL he already knows and learn how to query the multiple different DB systems we use across the org including Redshift, HIVE and Presto - each of which uses its own flavour of SQL. Plus, learning SQL on the job means the candidate will create problems in every other analyst until they learn how to write efficient queries. Machine Learning . Typically they have used Logistic Regression or few other techniques to solve a problem based on a given dataset (Kaggle style). However, even that the interview starts from algorithms and methods, it soon focus on topics such as feature generation (remember you need to create the dataset, there's nobody else to create it for you), maintainability, scalability and performance as well as the related trade offs. For some context you can check out a relevant paper from Google published in NIPS 2015. Text Analysis . Not a must have, but some experience in Natural Language Processing is good to have. After all, a big portion of the data is in textual format. As discussed there's nobody else to make the transformations and clean up the text for you in order to make it consumable by a ML or other statistical approach. Also, note that today even CS grads already have done some project that ticks this box. Of course for a junior role you can't have all the above. But, how many of these skills can you afford missing and pick up on the job? Finally, to clarify, the most common reason for rejecting non-statisticians is exactly the lack of even basic knowledge of stats. And somewhere there is the difference between a data engineer and a data scientist. Nevertheless, data engineers tend to apply for these roles, since many times they believe that "statistics" is just the average, the variance and the normal distribution. So, we may add a few relevant but scary statistical buzzwords in job descriptions in order to clarify what we mean by "statistics" and prevent the confusion.
