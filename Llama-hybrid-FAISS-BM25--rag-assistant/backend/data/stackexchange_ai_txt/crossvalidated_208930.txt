Difference between rulefit and random forest

I'm trying to understand the difference between these a bit better. I understand pretty well how random forests work but I guess I'm more hazy on rulefit and how exactly it's different. I know rulefit will incorporate linear components and so can fit linear trends better. What other ways do they differ?
