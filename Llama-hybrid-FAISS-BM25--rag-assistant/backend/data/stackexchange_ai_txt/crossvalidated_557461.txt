How to handle high multicollinearity for logistic regression and neural nets

I am looking to fit multiple models (Random Forest (RF), Classification Trees (CT), Logistic Regression (LR) and Neural Networks (NN)) in order to predict if there will be avalanches during a day (0 or 1 dependant variable) based on meteorological variables (independent variables). I however create 100+ secondary features (e.g Tmax_24h, Tmax_48h, Tmin_24h, Tmax_48h, Rain_24h-48h-72h, Snow 24h-48h-72h, etc.) from 3 raw meteo variables (Air Temperature, precipitations and wind speed). Doing so introduce a lot of collinearity between my features. According to what I understand, having many collinear features doesn’t seems to be a problem for RF and CT, but it seems to be one for NN and LR (cannot converge when high collinearity exists between features). So I have a few questions: Does RF and CT are really not affected by collinearity so I can give them the totality of my 100+ featuresand they will do great? If answer to question 1 is YES, should I still run a feature elimination on my 100+ features before fitting a RF or CT even though they can manage collinearity by themselves? Are LR and NN really affected by collinearity so I need to perform a feature selection on the 100+ variables before running them? If answer to question 3 is NO, why do I get a convergence error whenI do so? If answer to question 3 is YES, what is the best feature selection method for these 2 models (NN and LR)? What I tried for the moment is to run a LR backward elimination But LR being affected by collinearity, the computer isn’t able to converge because many features are collinear. I than tought about running a recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) on my 100+ features to reduce my dataset size based on a metric performance (let’s say I pass from 100+ to 20 features). But if I run the RFECV with LR, I still get a converging error (because it starts with the 100+ features). So, considering that RF aren’t affected by collinearity, I am now thinking of running the feature selection with random forest (RFECV-RF) before fitting my NN or LR models. I am however not sure it is legit to apply a feature selection based on RF in order to than fit the model with a NN or LR? I am using the sklearn library in python. So any references to programming library would be appreciated in python as well. Thank you in advance!
