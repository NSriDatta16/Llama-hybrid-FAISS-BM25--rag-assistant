There are a number of options here, depending on what kind of data you wish to store in the set. If it's regular integers, CommaSeparatedIntegerField might work fine, although it often feels like a clumsy storage method to me. If it's other kinds of Python objects, you can try pickling it before saving it to the database, and unpickling it when you load it again. That seems like a good approach. If you want something human-readable in your database though, you could even JSON-encode it into a TextField, as long as the data you're storing doesn't include Python objects.
