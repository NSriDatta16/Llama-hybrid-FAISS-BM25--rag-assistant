This is possible. Two examples: Discrete example Throw two coins independently, but code the outcomes as 0 or 1. Then define: $$ \begin{align} X&=\text{outcome on first coin}\\ Y&=\text{sum of both outcomes}\\ Z&=\text{outcome on second coin} \end{align} $$ Continuous variable example Let $(x,Y,Z)$ have the multivariate normal distribution $$ (X,Y,Z) \sim \mathcal{MN}(\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}1&1/2&0\\1/2&1&1/2\\0&1/2&1\end{pmatrix} $$ Your arguments in your last paragraph can be formulated as a question? Is independence transitive ? which leads to the analogous question Non-transitivity of correlation: correlations between gender and brain size and between brain size and IQ, but no correlation between gender and IQ
