There is no exact equivalent of $R^2$ for logistic regression; there is no statistic that will tell you what you are asking for. There are a number of pseudo- $R^2$ measures. Paul Allison has a very good summary of these in Statistical Horizons (What's the Best R-Squared for Logistic Regression?) But he does not come to strong conclusions. I'm not sure if he has updated this article. There are lots of other articles about this, just Google "pseudo r squared logistic regression".
