Eclipse Java project folder organization

I am coming to Java and Eclipse from a C#/Visual Studio background. In the latter, I would normally organize a solution like so: \MyProjects\MyApp\MyAppsUtilities\LowerLevelStuff where MyApp would contain a project to build a .exe, MyAppsUtilities would make an assembly DLL called by the .exe, and LowerLevelStuff would probably build an assembly containing classes used by the higher-level utilities DLL. In Eclipse (Ganymede, but could be convinced to switch to Galileo) I have: \MyProjects\workspace\MyApp When I create my initial project. There is an option to put source and build files in same folder, but I have .java files created on a path that is reflective of my package hierarchy: \MyProjects\workspace\MyApp\src\com\mycompany\myapp\MyApp.java My question is this: when I create subprojects (is that the right Java/Eclipse term?) for .jar files that will be analogous to the above MyAppsUtilities and LowerLevelStuff assembly DLLs in .NET, can (should) I organize the folders equivalently? E.g.: \MyProjects\workspace\MyApp\src\com\mycompany\myapp\myapputilities\MyAppsUtilities.java What is the standard/right way to organize this stuff, and how is it specifcally done in the IDE?
