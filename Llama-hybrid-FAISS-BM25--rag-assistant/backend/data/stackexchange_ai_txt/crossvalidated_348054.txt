How did you compute your intervals? A common method estimates the standard error then adds and subtracts a multiple of the s.e. to the coefficient. This is called the Wald method and in logistic regression can suffer from what is called the Hauk-Donner effect where because of the shape of the binomial likelihood far from the maximum, the standard error is grossly over estimated and the confidence intervals are way too wide. If you can create confidence intervals based on the likelihood ratio test instead of the Wald test, then you don't need to worry about this effect. The LR approach usually uses profiling which is more computationally intensive, but reasonable with modern computers. So the first step is to figure out how your software computed the intervals and see if you can compute new LR based intervals. That may solve your problem, and if not, it will at least give some more insight.
