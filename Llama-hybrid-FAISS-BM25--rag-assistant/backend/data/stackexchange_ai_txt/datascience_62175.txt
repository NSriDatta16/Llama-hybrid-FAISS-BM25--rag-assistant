A Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Each decision tree will reach a "conclusion" (i.e., a prediction ) about each observation. All trees are then combined together. What does it mean? if you are training a Random Forest regressor , this combination is an average of each tree's prediction. if you are training a Random Forest classifier , each tree's classification is combined into a final classification through a "majority vote" mechanism.
