If both are not going to be modified (no adding/deleting items - modifying existing ones is fine as long as you pay heed to threading issues), you can simply pass around data.begin() + 100000 and data.begin() + 101000 , and pretend that they are the begin() and end() of a smaller vector. Or, since vector storage is guaranteed to be contiguous, you can simply pass around a 1000 item array: T *arrayOfT = &data[0] + 100000; size_t arrayOfTLength = 1000; Both these techniques take constant time, but require that the length of data doesn't increase, triggering a reallocation.
