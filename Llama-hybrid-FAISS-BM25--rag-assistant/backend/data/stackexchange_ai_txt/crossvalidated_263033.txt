A huge concern is whether data is missing in some systematic way which would corrupt your analysis. Your data may be missing not at random. This was brought up in previous answers, but I thought I'd contribute an example. Finance example: missing returns may be poor returns Unlike mutual funds, private equity funds (and other private funds) are not required by law to report their returns to some central database. Hence a major concern is that reporting is endogenous, more specifically, that some firms won't report bad returns. If so, your average of reported fund returns $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i R_i$ will overestimate the true mean because low $R_i$ tend to be missing. All is not necessarily lost in these situations (there are things you can do), but naively running a regression (or computing correlations) on the non-missing data may lead to seriously biased, inconsistent estimates of the true parameters in the population.
