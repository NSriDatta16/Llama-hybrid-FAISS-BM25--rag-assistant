Your time series doesn’t need to be on a conventional schedule, like seven days a week or 12 months a year, in order to be considered evenly spaced. As you already suggested you just need to set the frequency according to the ferry schedule for both. Update: You will need to make it a msts object not ts in order to specify multiple seasonal frequencies (both # of weeks in the year/season and number of ferry days in the week). For the canceled trips you should put either the number of tickets sold in advance of the cancellation or zero but utilize some kind of regressor to indicate the event (a column that is 1 when cancelled, 0 when not). That data is not truly missing, there’s just a a different kind of outcome.
