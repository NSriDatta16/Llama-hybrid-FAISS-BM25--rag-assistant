I would highly recommend taking a look at the positioniseverything.net site and its coverage of IE issues and workarounds. Take a look at the holly hack section - I believe you will find the answer there. [edit - added] take a look here for the 3px issue, explanation and fix For box settings and browser difference, sitepoints box model article offers some good insight as well.
