How to find the probalities of a,b,c (mutually exclusive events) when i turn the problem into three binary classification problems?

I am using scikits linear logisitc regression to classify three events a,b and c. it works better (score) when i convert them into a binary classification model. such as: 1. M1 classifies a or b 2. M2 classifies b or c 3. M3 classifies a or c when i predict the probabilities using the apropiate function i get from the models: M1->P1(a), P1(b) M2->P2(b), P2(c) M3->P3(a), P3(c) How do i compute the probability of each of the three events? do i average them? such as: P(a) = (P1(a) + P3(a))/2 ? is this the correct thing to do? if not any suggestions? thank you in advance.
