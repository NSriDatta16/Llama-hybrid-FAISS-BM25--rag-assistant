Machine learning testing data

I am new to machine learning and it might be a bit of a stupid question. I have implemented my model and its working. I have a question about running it on the testing data. Its a binary classification problem. If I know the proportions of classes in test data how could I use it to improve the performance of my model or prediction made by the model. So lets say 75% belong to class 1 and 25% to class 0 Any help is greatly appreciated
