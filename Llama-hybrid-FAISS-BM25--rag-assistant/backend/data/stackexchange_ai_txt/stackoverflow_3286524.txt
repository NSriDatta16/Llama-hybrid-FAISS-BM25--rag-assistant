Help understanding class example code for C++, templates, operator()

I'm not sure exactly what the following class does that we have for a class example. In the following code, what does the operator() do in this case? I don't quite get the *(begin + first) and pretty much the whole return expression as what is being evaluated. Any help would be great. Thanks! // IndexCompare.h - interface for IndexCompare class template #ifndef _INDEXCOMPARE_H_ #define _INDEXCOMPARE_H_ #pragma once template class IndexCompare { public: IndexCompare(random_iterator begin, random_iterator end) : begin(begin), end(end) {} ~IndexCompare() {} bool operator() (unsigned int first, unsigned int second) { return (*(begin + first)
