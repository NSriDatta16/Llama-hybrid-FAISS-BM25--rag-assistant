Any way to run JS after swf is finished playing?

I'm working on a project where a SWF will play (as sort of a splash), followed by JS. After the video plays, the navigation and content will appear, and the video will fade out. I'm just wondering what would be the best way to accomplish this? Play the video first and then load everything via ajax behind the scenes? The goal is to be as seamless as possible and I am having a flash asset provided to me by the client. I have zero experience with flash outside of simply embedding.
