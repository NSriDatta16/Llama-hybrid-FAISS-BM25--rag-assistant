If it was for practical purposes and not homework, I would use the Iterator interface instead of the old Enumeration . For iterators you have some nice utilities in the apache collections project. Secondly, your solution seems to have a bug. The method nextElement() should return the elements themselves, but the line return temporaryList.get(i).getEnumeration() returns an Enumeration object instead. --EDIT-- polygenelubricants suggested a nice, elegant solution. I thought of something else. You can implement a generic ChainEnumeration class (implements Enumeration), that receives a list of Enumerations and allows enumerating the underlying items. In your tree structure, return a simple enumeration with one item for leafs, and a chain enumeration of inner nodes. The implementation of ChainEnumeration is simple: it manages a list of iterators, plus a reference to the current active iterator, where items are taken from.
