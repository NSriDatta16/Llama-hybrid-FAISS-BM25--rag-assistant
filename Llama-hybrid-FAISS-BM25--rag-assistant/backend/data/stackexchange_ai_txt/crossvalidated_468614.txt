There is interesting review paper by Van Erp et all (2019), who compare different shrinkage priors (a.k.a. sparse ) and their effect on the estimated parameters. One of their conclusions was that for $p > n$ scenarios there are better alternatives then Ridge (Gaussian) or Lasso (Laplace) priors when it comes to variable selection. In some cases those priors are not enough for variable selection, or sparsity. So yes, it is possible that using Laplace would be "not enough" to achieve sparsity. Van Erp, S., Oberski, D. L., & Mulder, J. (2019). Shrinkage Priors for Bayesian Penalized Regression. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 89 , 31-50. doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2018.12.004 ( preprint )
