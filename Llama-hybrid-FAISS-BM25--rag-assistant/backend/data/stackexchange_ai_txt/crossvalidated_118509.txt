Can factor analysis improve the fit of a predictive regression model?

My company is working with a client who have built a logistic regression model to predict whether kids with psychiatric disorders will successfully complete a State intervention program (Yes or No). The regression revealed several significant demographic & medical diagnosis predictors, and a principal components analysis showed that several groups of variables were highly correlated with each other. However, overall predictive fit of the model is fairly low (Nagelkerke R-square=.069), leading us to believe we could be missing important variables from the model (although we realize in the social sciences an R-square > 40% is rare). Without actually collecting more data and variables, would an exploratory factor analysis improve the model's goodness-of-fit (i.e., increase the Nagelkerke R-square) by identifying latent variables more predictive of successful completion? Or is factor analysis more of an explanatory tool that doesn't improve goodness of fit?
