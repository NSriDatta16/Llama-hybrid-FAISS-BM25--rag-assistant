Should Training,test and validation data sets should be independent of each other in neural networks?

I have a dataset of n items and i draw three samples of equal size. These three samples are training set,test set and validation set. I want to use this data for training ,testing and to check overfitting(that i don't traing my model too much). All these samples are drawn from same population. Now my question is that should these samples be independent of each other? What are the requirements for data to be good enough for training purpose? What i undestood so far if they are not independent then i am implicitly training my model also on training set and validation set. Any help would be great.
