What you want to do sound impossible. If you want to access data of another java program and can't implement som interface in the program in question (such as some RMI interface,or somsocket) the closest thing I can come to think of is to go through a debugger or the JVMTI The JVM TM Tool Interface (JVM TI) is a new native programming interface for use by tools. It provides both a way to inspect the state and to control the execution of applications running in the Java virtual machine (JVM). JVM applications running in the TI supports the full breadth of tools that need access to JVM state, including but not limited to: profiling, debugging, monitoring, thread analysis, and coverage analysis tools.
