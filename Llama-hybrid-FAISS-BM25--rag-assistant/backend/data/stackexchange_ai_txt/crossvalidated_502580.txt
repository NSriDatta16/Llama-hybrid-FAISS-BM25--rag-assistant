Distribution of Moving Average of Bernoulli distributed Variables

Given a series of n i.i.d. Bernoulli experiments with probability p for success each, I'd like to know the probability of crossing a threshold of somewhere having k successes over m consecutive experiments. For specific p, m and n I could try a Monte Carlo simulation, but I'd rather know a distribution for the moving average or at least a good approximation. The upper bound of the probability of crossing the threshold by first calculating the probability "prob1" of k or more successes in m experiments, and then calculating the probability of at least 1 occurrence in (n-m+1) tries with probability prob1 is too high.
