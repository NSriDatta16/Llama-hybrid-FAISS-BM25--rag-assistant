Heroku makes setup and launching of an app super-simple. You will be dependent to some degree on versions that Heroku supports (for instance, I heard today of a bundler versioning issue). One thing to take into account with any "managed full-stack" solution like Heroku or EY is cost. You don't have to hire an ops person or have ops expertise, but you're still paying. Storage is where things get really expensive. Crank up your DB to a more than a few GB and watch the price go up. We have in-house ops (was me doing it while coding, now a dedicated person) and run on Joyent. A big cost savings was having a few master-slave DBs and sharing them among a few dozen applications. We essentially have 100 Facebook apps running on Joyent at the same cost as 10 apps on Heroku. But this doesn't take into account the ops salary/time.
