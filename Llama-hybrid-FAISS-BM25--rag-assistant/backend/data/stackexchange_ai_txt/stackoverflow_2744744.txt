Java Spam Filter

I'm trying to create a spam filter in Java using the Bayesian algorithm. I use a text file that contains email messages and split the tokens using regex, storing these values into a hashmap. My problem is, with regex, the email addresses are split so instead of: johnsmith@example.com regex causes the token to be: john smith example The same holds true for ip addresses, so for example, instead of: 192.55.34.322 regex splits the tokens to be: 192 55 34 322 So does anybody know of a way that I could read the email messages and store their contents as is? AMENDMENT: I am using a regex that does not keep ip addresses or email addresses. It splits these up. I was wondering if regex was not the way to go and if I could be suggested any alternatives for me to be able to filter emails to pick out characteristics I desire.
