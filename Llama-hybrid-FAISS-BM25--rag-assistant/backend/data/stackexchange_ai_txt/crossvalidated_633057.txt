An extremely simple classification problem leads to intractable SVM program

In the popular textbook Mathematics for Machine Learning, creating a SVM requires solving: $\text{min}_{w,b} \dfrac{1}{2}\|w\|^2$ subject to $y_n (w^T x_n + b) \geq 1$ , for all $n = 1, \ldots, N$ Ok, then let $(x_n, y_n) = ((1, 0), +1), ((0, -1), -1)$ This is an extremely simple dataset to classify. The classifier is: $\text{sign}(x_{[1]} + x_{[2]})$ , where $x_{[i]}$ is the $i$ th coordinate of $x$ Yet, the SVM program reduces to, $\text{min}_{w,b} \dfrac{1}{2}\|w\|^2$ subject to $w_1 + b \geq 1$ and $w_2 - b \geq 1$ . We have two equations but three unknowns. We cannot solve this question. Why is this?
