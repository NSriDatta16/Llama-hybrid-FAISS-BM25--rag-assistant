where is GL_MULTISAMPLE defined?

Although I have been discouraged from reading the OpenGL redbook, I am still doing it, because it is the only book designed for beginners, and tutorials and/or documentation don't quite substitute for a book although very important. So much for justifying myself :) Now, there's an example for antialiasing using multisampling, which involved glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE); I am using Qt, and I get a compile error, because GL_MULTISAMPLE is an undeclared identifier. I currently see the following reasons: For some implementations, including the one that comes with Qt, GL_MULTISAMPLE is not defined. It is not in GL/gl.h or GL/glu.h but rather in some other header which is not included in or does not come with Qt It is obsolete/deprecated Is one of the above reasons correct? If not, which is the reason I don't have it and how can I obtain? Thanks in advance
