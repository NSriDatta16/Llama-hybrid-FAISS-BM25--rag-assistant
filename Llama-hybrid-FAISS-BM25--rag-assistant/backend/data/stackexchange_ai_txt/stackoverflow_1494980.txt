I'd be inclined to lean towards LDAP due to the structure of your data, and although, I'm of the opinion that there need to be more people out there who deal with hierarchical databases and get away from the "RDBMS is the only database" mentality, I don't know of an easily portable LDAP server that you could embed into a larger application. You could use SQLite if you wanted to go the DRBMS route, but I'd actually go for a third option -- XML databases. As you're already using XML, it should hopefully be an easy switch to move to something like Berkeley DB XML for the storage. You can also check Wikipedia for a list of other alternatives (and a disclaimer -- I've never used any XML databases; I have used OpenLDAP, iDS, and eDirectory on the LDAP side and Oracle, SQL Server, mySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and others on the RDBMS side)
