Here is an easier way to do it. Find out first the ID of the category. Then you go to "System > Configuration > Web > Default Pages" and enter the following for the "Default web url" option: catalog/category/view/id/50 (where 50 is the id of the category). Note, in version 1.3.2.4 there is a bug in one of the core files. So if you use that see this fix first: http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=6168
