I did not encounter this issue so far, but I see two possible reasons that you do not seem to have covered yet: You could check the setExpire() method of the auth class in addition to setIdle(). There might be other php based apps/scripts running on the same server, using the same session storage directory with a lower timeout. According to the session.gc_maxlifetime docs: If different scripts have different values of session.gc_maxlifetime but share the same place for storing the session data then the script with the minimum value will be cleaning the data. In this case, use this directive together with session.save_path.
