Agree with @mincorp about RODBC, and that we don't use Workbenches and csvs most of the time in production. Additionally though, 'production' data science also tends to exist in a separate box to the database. This can be for performance reasons; some models are big, and most DBA's rightly don't like you taking up resource in a process they don't really control. It can also be for maintenance reasons; by 'owning you own hardware' (even if it's an AWS EC2), you can tear down, redeploy, and rearchitect as you want, without impacting the DB at all. Doing the plumbing between these has been both my biggest learning curve in recent years and the part of data science that I totally didn't expect until even after I'd been doing it a little while. Learning how to make interfaces and maintain your own work for your own models is the secret key skill for a data scientist.
