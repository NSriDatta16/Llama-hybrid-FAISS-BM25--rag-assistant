CNN : Is the learning on Kernels in CNN done pixel by pixel or after each image

i work with neural network but i am new in the field of CNN. I have difficulties to understand the learning process at the Kernel level. I understand that each kernel give each Layers and that this is the result of the convolution on the input image. But how the learning work in this context ? For example : during a backpropagation the learning reach a kernel with, let's say, a positive feedback, if the learning use here a notion of activation of the inputs, at the level of a kernel, it needs to apply on one of the inputs that have been convolved by the kernel. But at this point i imagine that the convolution have already been processed on the global image, so what are the input used ? Thanks for the answers ;) Edit : The link to « Convolutional Neural Network nonlinearity understanding » send by Dave answer only partially to the question because it illustrate the fact that there is weight sharing, and so, it illustrate one aspect of the question (the kernel which learn with the same weights but for different input/output couple) without explaining HOW the weights sharing is done in practice. Which is the question.
