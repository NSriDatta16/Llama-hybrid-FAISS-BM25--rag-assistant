If I understand your experiment and your manipulation of data so far, then in your second table you have two fractions for each questionnaire that add to 1.00 (as for Q2: 0.67 + 0.33 = 1.00). In that case you may not treat the two columns X and Y (each with 60 fractions) as independent variables for a two sample t test (pooled or Welch). Once you know the proportion in X, the proportion in Y is determined and so provides no additional information. So it makes sense to focus just on the X column. From the fragment shown, it seems that the X proportions tend to be greater than the Y proportions, and the crux of your question is whether X's do tend to be above 0.50. Now, let binomial random variable $G$ be the the number of X's (out of 60) that exceed 0.50. Because I don't have the whole of the second table, I can't find $G$ for your experiment. But let me show results if $G = 45.$ In R, we use the exact binomial test binom.test as follows: binom.test(45, 60, 1/2, alt="gr") Exact binomial test data: 45 and 60 number of successes = 45, number of trials = 60, p-value = 6.726e-05 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.6414602 1.0000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.75 It turns out that any $G \ge 37$ is enough larger than 30 to give a P-value below $0.05 = 5\%,$ and hence a significantly larger proportions in column X at the 5% level. binom.test(37, 60, 1/2, alt="gr")$p.val [1] 0.04623049 The figure below shows the binomial distribution of $G.$ One rejects the null hypothesis that X and Y are equal against the alternative that X proportions are larger for $G \ge 37.$ R code for figure: x = 0:60; PDF = dbinom(x, 60, .5) hdr="PDF of BINOM(60,.5)" plot(x, PDF, xlab="G", type="h", lwd=2, main=hdr) abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v=36.5, lwd=2, lty="dotted", col="red")
