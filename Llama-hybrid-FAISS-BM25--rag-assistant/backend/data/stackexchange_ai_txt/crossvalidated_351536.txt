Is Undersampling or oversampling for unbalanced classification data?

I am trying to train a Random Forest classifier on a binary classification problem but with a highly imbalanced dataset where the positive class is much smaller than the negative class . I have undersampled my dataset so that both classes have equal proportions and did 10 fold cross validation over this dataset. However I am having bad results (averaged over the 10 folds): recall : 46% precision : 54% accuracy : 53% I was wondering if oversampling the positive class would yield better results. What would be the benefits of undersamling versus oversampling?
