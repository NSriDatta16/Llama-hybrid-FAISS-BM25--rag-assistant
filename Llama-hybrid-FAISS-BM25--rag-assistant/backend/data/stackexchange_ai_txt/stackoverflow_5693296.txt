HowTo: Custom Field in Lift-Record-Squeryl

I'm trying to make a EnumListField in Lift/Record/Squeryl, similar to MappedEnumList in LiftMapper . The storage type should be Long/BIGINT. I understand that if I define: def classOfPersistentField = classOf[Long] Then Squeryl will know it should create a BIGINT column. And I know it uses setFromAny() to set the value, passing in the Long. The one piece I don't get is: How will it read the field's value? If it uses valueBox , it will get a Seq[Enum#Value] , and it won't know how to turn that into a Long. How do I tell Squeryl to convert my Seq[Enum#Value] to a Long, or define a "getter" that returns a Long, and that doesn't conflict with the "normal" getter(s)?
