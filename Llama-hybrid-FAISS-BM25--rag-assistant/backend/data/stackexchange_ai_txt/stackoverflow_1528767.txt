Using a IList, how to populate it via a comma separated list of ID's

I have a property IList CategoryIDs, and a private string variable that contains a comma separated list, how to elegantly populate the IList collection? I asked earler and I learn a neat way of populating the List with .AddRange(...), but now I realized I have to have the property return IList which doesn't seem to support the .AddRange method.
