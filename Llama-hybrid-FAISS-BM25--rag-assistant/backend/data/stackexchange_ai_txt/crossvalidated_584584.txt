Likelihood function is not the same thing with probability. By definition the likelihood function is equal to, if the distribution is continuous, the product of the probability density functions calculated at the data points. In some machine learning books, instead of using the likelihood function which is generally denoted by "L", they use probability which is actually not correct. If you look at the probability and statistics books, they explain this better. In conclusion, you shouldn't use probability density function to calculate a probability of a point because by definiton the probability of a continuous distribution is the integral of the probability density function. For example, if you want to calculate the probability of a point "a" in a continuous distribution, you can integrate the function between "a + 0.5" and "a - 0.5". When you do this, the result will be similar to the value that you will get if you calculate the probability density function at that point. This is because when you integrate the function over 1 unit difference [+0.5, -0.5], you actually calculate the area under the curve with a base length of 1 which doesn't change the value of the function. Only change between the values may stem from the fact that function's value changes over the interval [+0.5, -0.5]. But this change is generally relatively low.
