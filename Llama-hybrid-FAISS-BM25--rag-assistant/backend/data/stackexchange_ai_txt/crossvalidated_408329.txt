It is discrete, but then any output in the form of a floating point number with fixed number of bits will be discrete. If a tree has 100 leaves, then it can give 100 different numbers. If you have 100 different trees with 100 leaves each, then your random forest can theoretically have 100^100 different values, which can give 200 (decimal) digits of precision, or ~600 bits. Of course, there is going to be some overlap, so you're not actually going to see 100^100 different values. The distribution tends to get more discrete the more you get to the extremes; each tree is going to have some minimum leaf (a leaf that gives an output that's less than or equal to all the other leaves), and once you get the minimum leaf from each tree, you can't get any lower. So there's going to be some minimum overall value for the forest, and as you deviate from that value, you're going to start out with all but a few trees being at their minimum leaf, making small deviations from the minimum value increase in discrete jumps. But decreased reliability at the extremes is a property of regressions in general, not just random forests.
