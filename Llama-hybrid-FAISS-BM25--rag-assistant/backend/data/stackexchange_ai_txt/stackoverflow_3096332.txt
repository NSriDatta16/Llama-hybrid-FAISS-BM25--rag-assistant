Style EditText content 'on the fly'?

I'm working on a rich text editor in Android. Basically it has bold, italics and link buttons that are tied to an EditText to change the style of the content. I have it working great if you select the text you want to style first, and then select the button using this method: http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/faq/commontasks.html#selectingtext . What I'm trying to do is have it work like a rich text editor, where you can use the buttons as a toggle to style the text for as long as you'd like, then click the toggle again to stop using the style. So if I wanted to type ' Pay attention to this! ' in bold, I would click the 'B' button, then start typing the text and everything I type would be bold until I click the 'B' button again. Any ideas on how to pull this off? I hope I've been clear enough :)
