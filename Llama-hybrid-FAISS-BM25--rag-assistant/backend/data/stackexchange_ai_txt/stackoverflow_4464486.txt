Netbeans - Dreamweaver Integration

Greetings, I am coding a JavaEE project. But I am having a hard time deploying my pages from Dreamweaver CS4 to Netbeans 6.9.1. Is there a way to integrate Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 to Netbeans 6.9.1 so that either way around the pages will synchronize upon update between the two IDEs. Thanks, Cyril H.
