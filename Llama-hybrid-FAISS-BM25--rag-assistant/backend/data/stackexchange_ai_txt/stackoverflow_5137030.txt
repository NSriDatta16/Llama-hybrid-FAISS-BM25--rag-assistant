You have to specify specific flags to your compiler/linker in order to use libnet . In your case, you see linker errors because it cannot find definitions for functions you are using in your program. Obviously, this is because you need to link with libnet and libpcap . To get it right, try something like: gcc -Wall `libnet-config --defines` mitmc.c -o mitmc `libnet-config --libs` -lpcap
