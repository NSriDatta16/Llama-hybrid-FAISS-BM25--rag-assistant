If you know that your data is not quite good, it is always good to check for outliers as well. Most of the time there are anomalies. If you have a lot of features, dimensionality reduction is a must. PCA is quite efficient for that. If you have missing data, you can use imputation or interpolation, but if your needs allows it, the winning case is to use collaborative filtering.
