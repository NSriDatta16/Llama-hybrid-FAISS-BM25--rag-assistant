Use the Session variable as you say plus... As MyGGAN said use a value set in a cookie (CVAL1) before rendering the submit forms. If this cookie is available (JS Code Check will verify) then submit. On the server side: If this cookie value exists and the session variable exist then the HTTP Request came from your website. Note: If the script (form) is to presented under another domain DO NOT allow the cookie value (CVAL1) to be set. Do not allow HTTP Requests on the Server Side Scripts if extra Http Headers Are not available (like x-requested-with: jquery). JQuery sends a request with an X-* header to the server. Read more on Croos-Site Request Forgery as MyGGAN suggests.
