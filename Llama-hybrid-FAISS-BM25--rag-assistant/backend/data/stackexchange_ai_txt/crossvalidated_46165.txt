I take it you want to do variable selection with a dichotomous outcome variable. Using L1-regularized (LASSO) logistic regression would be an option. You can read about it in this book , and use the R packages penalized (allowing unpenalized covariables) or glmnet for doing it. Some of your explanatory variables are polytomous, if I understand correctly. For these, the LASSO will select individual levels ("options") and not variables. For information on how to use your Postgres database with R, as already mentioned, stack overflow is the more appropriate place to ask, and I'd be astonished if there wasn't already an explanation of how to do it there.
