phing versus phpunit codecoverage results

I have created a build.xml file for phing to create code coverage reports. It uses phpunit codecoverage="true" and is pointed to the same file(s) as done with phpunit --coverage-html. The result differ, however. With phing I have 100% code coverage for all files, which I have not. There is probably something I don't know about running code coverage with phing that explains this 100%. What am I doing wrong to get differing results?
