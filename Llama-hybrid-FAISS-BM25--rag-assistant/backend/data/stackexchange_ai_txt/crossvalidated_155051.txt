Machine learning tutorials / examples on data sets larger than a terabyte

I am trying to gather a list of practical ML examples / tutorials on more than a terabyte of data. I'm particularly interested in feature extraction from large data sets that involves aggregation (the actual ML algorithm could ultimately be run on a much smaller set of data). Does anyone know of any blog posts / ebooks / etc. that walk through an example on a public data set greater than a terabyte?
