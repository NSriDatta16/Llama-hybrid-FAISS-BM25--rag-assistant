The process of looking for non-normality, besides assuming you have a fairly large sample size, has a problem with distortion of statistical inference at the end (optimistically narrow confidence intervals, etc.). The entire process was never well founded in statistical theory, and semiparametrics and Bayesian methods are superior in almost every way. Start with John Krushke's BEST method and look at semiparametric ordinal regression, which is transformation-invariant with respect to $Y$ . The latter is contained in a case study in my RMS book and course notes . Tests of normality are essentially misleading because (1) they don't have a power of 1.0 so you'll get false negatives and (2) they tempt one to not pre-specify the analysis, which leads to problems mentioned above. Think about the Bayesian t-test for example: it can always allow for unequal variance and always allow for non-normality. Kruschke does the latter by using a t-distribution rather than a normal distribution for the raw data.
