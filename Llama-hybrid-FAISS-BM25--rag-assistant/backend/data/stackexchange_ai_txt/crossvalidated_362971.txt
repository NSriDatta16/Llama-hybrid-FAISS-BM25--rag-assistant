If I understand correctly, I believe you should not do this. Suppose you did something similar, with demand measured in 4 regions quarterly. Region A has 100 units in Q1, Region B 100 units in Q2, etc. and this is the case each year-- all orders are received in only one quarter for each region. If you aggregate, you will get a time series, and then a forecast, that appears to not have seasonality. From a production standpoint (if you produced everything in one place) that would be okay but from an inventory standpoint (assuming each region had its own warehoues) it would not be-- you should forecast them separately to pick up the seasonality of each. In this case I think there could be a similar issue. If you need a separate forecast for each location then by aggregating you may get to a non-intermittent time series, leading you to use an exponential smoothing model, but then when you go back down to the location level you need an intermittent model like Croston's. It would be better to use the appropriate model at both aggregation levels and then do a reconciliation across (like top-down or bottom-up) if you need to have forecasts that are equal at each level in the hierarchy.
