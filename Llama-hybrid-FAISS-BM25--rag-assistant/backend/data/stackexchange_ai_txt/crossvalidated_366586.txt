If you go for neural network then I can suggest deep Auto Encoder because it's non-linear function. Rather than auto encoder you con try t-SNE , Genetic Algorithm or LDA . Regarding LDA some author says it's a classifier and someone says it can be used as feature reduction. PCA Auto Encoder Genetic Algorithm Ensembler t-SNE(Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) LDA* *LDA => Linear Classifier / Dimension reduction technology
