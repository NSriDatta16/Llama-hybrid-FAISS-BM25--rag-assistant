It sounds like the uncertainty in your ground truth stems primarily from uncertainty about the true duration and intensity of the phenomena's presence: when the sensors show positive, it's not clear whether that means the phenomena has been present at lower intensities for a longer spans or at higher intensities for shorter spans. Given that uncertainty, one option would be to systematically evaluate the model's accuracy over a broad range of scenarios, including some where the ground truth reflects short bursts of high intensity and others where the ground truth reflects longer periods of lower intensity. These alternatives could be captured by smoothing the observed binary sensor values over shorter or longer windows of time. Rolling averages provide one simple way to accomplish such smoothing. If the temporal window over which one averages remains small (zero smoothing being the smallest), then one effectively assumes high intensity inputs over the entire [T+2, T+17] interval. If, on the other hand, the window over which one averages becomes as long or longer than the interval itself, then one is assuming that the phenomena operated at lower intensity but over a longer period of time. I don't know how much information you have about the "external factors" influencing the intensity of the phenomena and its likely durations, so I can't say what might constitute a reasonable range of window sizes to try. But examining the minimum and maximum durations during which the sensors showed positives might help. In any event, I think you might be able to account for your uncertainty about the true inputs by evaluating your model's accuracy under a variety of plausible duration/intensity scenarios, which could, in turn, provide you with a reasonable range of possible accuracies.
