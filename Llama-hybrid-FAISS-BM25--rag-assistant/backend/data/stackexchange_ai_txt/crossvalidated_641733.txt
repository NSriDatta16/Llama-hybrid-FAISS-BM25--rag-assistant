blank, unacceptable, below average, above average, outstanding It is not clear to me that blank really is part of an order ... so maybe that response need special treatment, but apart of that problem, I would tend to try an ordinal regression model with a factor predictor with the three levels male, female and undisclosed . Then, if the real interest is in the male, female comparison, using a contrast for that comparison.
