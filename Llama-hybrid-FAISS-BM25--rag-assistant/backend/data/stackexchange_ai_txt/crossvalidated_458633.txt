"...I took the 12th difference to account for the high yearly average in the summer months..." Therein lies your problem. You're over-differencing stationary data. The first difference operator (seasonal or not seasonal) is only appropriate when data series is $I(1)$ ---in particular, not stationary. In your case, applying the seasonal difference $\Delta_{12}$ presumes your data consists of 12 non-stationary sub-series, one for each month. Clearly this assumption is not reasonable for your data. For example, applying $\Delta_{12}$ would be appropriate for an SARIMA $(0,0,0)\times(0,1,0)_{12}$ series, which consists of 12 random walks, one for each month. Your data looks nothing like that. It's not surprising that seasonality remains in your series after 12th difference. For example, applying $\Delta_{12}$ erroneously to a stationary SARIMA $(0,0,0)\times(0,0,0)_{12}$ series gives a SARIMA $(0,0,0)\times(0,0,1)_{12}$ series. The seasonality is not removed. (The point of ARIMA modeling is to incorporate, not remove, multiplicative seasonality.)
