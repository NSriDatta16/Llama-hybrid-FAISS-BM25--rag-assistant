The only advantage I know of offhand is that when vendors of enterprise software have "portal integration" on their feature checklist, it usually means they've written portlets according to the JSR-168 or JSR-286 standards. SAP, Banner, and Magnolia are some of the systems that we use here that work this way, and some organizations find value in the portal approach. However, as you correctly point out, this imposes some frustrating limitations on the application author. We've also found the value of portals to be somewhat dubious when put up next to a Single Sign On system that saves the user the hassle of signing into multiple applications, but which still allows each application the full benefits of the browser environment. FWIW, if you do decide to distribute your work as a collection of portlets, there are existing portal systems that are free/open source which you could provide for folks who didn't already have a portlet container: http://java-source.net/open-source/portals Hope all of that helps a bit.
