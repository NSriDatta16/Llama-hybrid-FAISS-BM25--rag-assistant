I resolved this by using a disposable request context to create the request, and then using my more-permanent request context to edit the object: temporaryRequestContext.findOrganization(id).fire(new Receiver () { public void onSuccess(OrganizationProxy response) { database.put(permanentRequestContext.edit(response)); //succeeds because it has not been fired, even though edit() has been called many times } });
