The problem is that each TransformerHandler has a separate Transformer associated with it. There's a problem with your 2nd template, but as this is an example I guess that doesn't matter. You want: //SETTING PARAMETERS HERE th1.getTransformer().setParameter("foo","this is from param 1"); th2.getTransformer().setParameter("bar","this is from param 2"); Note that you also don't need to create a 3rd transformer you can just start the transform chain on th1.getTransformer()
