There is no decision theory that isn’t Bayesian... or is there?

David Manheim says in a comment under a blog post : If you’re not making decisions, there’s no need for Bayes. If you are, you’re Bayesian whether you like it or not – there is no decision theory that isn’t Bayesian. Let us ignore the first couple of statements here; they have been challenged by other commenters, and they are beyond the focus of this post. I am curious about the last statement: there is no decision theory that isn’t Bayesian . I am no expert in decision theory, but this sounds too general to be even approximately true. How crude a generalization is this? Are there no noteworthy decision theories that are nonbayesian?
