1 . Here is where the difference between the Bayesian and the Classical paradigm becomes more evident. A power analysis is not strictly necessary in a Bayesian context since the goal is to update your prior beliefs about the null hypothesis with the data. Moreover, there are other ingredients in a Bayesian hypothesis test that play an important role, such as the prior distribution and the type of decision criterion used as a test (e.g. Bayes factors). However, a power analysis is still useful in order to understand the influence of the data and the prior on the chosen criterion. For example, there are recent studies about priors that improve the "power" of the test induced by the use of Bayes factors: Johnson & Rossell, 2010, On the use of non-local prior densities in Bayesian hypothesis tests 2 . Please, take a look at the paper mentioned above and the references therein. If you want to use BNP, then you have another kind of difference since the dimensionality of the parameter space is infinite in this context, which has other philosophical implications. Then, you have to specify the sort of hypotheses of interest. The following paper provides an example of a basic BNP test: Holmes et al., 2012, Two-sample Bayesian nonparametric hypothesis testing They conduct a "power" analysis in page 7.
