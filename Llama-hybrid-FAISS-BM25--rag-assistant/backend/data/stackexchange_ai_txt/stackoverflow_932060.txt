ASP .NET c# retrieve total non-paged memory usage remotely

I'm working on a simple ASP .NET health checker and I've run into a few obstacles. 1) I need to be able to get the full non-paged memory usage from a remote machine (on same network). I've tried using System.Diganostics.Process.NonpagedSystemMemorySize64 however I've come to realize that the kernel's nonpaged usage is going to be missing from that total. Here is a quick sample of what I was doing: Process[] myprocess = Process.GetProcesses("computername"); foreach (Process p in myprocess) { nonpaged += p.NonpagedSystemMemorySize64; } 2) I can overcome that locally by using System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter however you can only access the API for that class locally. Is there another class that would suit my needs? Any help would be appreciated.
