I've been playing around a lot with EJB and web modules in an JavaEE project using IntelliJ IDEA 10 UE. I got it working and I've tried to write down the steps I was taking: http://codelevain.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/javaee-project/ A sample project can be downloaded from the blog or: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7012354/javaee-sample.zip Even when everything looks fine, Glassfish still spits out error messages (something about not being able to open a zip file). It also says that the app could not be deployed (which it apparently is).
