How Do Search Engines See A Localized Django Site?

I have a Django site that uses the localization middleware in combination with gettext and the trans/blocktrans template tags to show visitors different pages depending on the preferred language in their user agent string (which seems to be the standard way of doing things in Django). This works great for supported languages (currently only Spanish, English, and German with more coming). If I set the preferred language in my browser to a different language, I get the pages for that translation. However, I have no idea how it appears for search engines. When a search engine crawls a site, does it typically have a preferred language in its agent string? Will German spiders get the German site and will Spanish ones get the Spanish site, or will they just get the default English site that's displayed when a user has no language set? Does this vary by search engines and is there a "standard way" of doing things that individual crawlers may or may not stick to?
