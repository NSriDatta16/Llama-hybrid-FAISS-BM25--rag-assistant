JQuery change inner text but preserve html

I would like to change the text of a HTML element but preserve the rest of the inner html with jQuery. For instance: Some text replace "Some text" with "Other text", and the result should look like: Other text EDIT: My current solution is following: var aElem = $('a'); var children = aElem.children(); aElem.text("NEW TEXT"); aElem.append(children); But there must be some more elegant way of doing this.
