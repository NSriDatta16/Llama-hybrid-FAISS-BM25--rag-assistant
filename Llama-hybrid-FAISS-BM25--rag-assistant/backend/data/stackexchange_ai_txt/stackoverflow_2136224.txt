It doesn't make sense to ask for an instance when you're using a manager. Managers are class-level attributes - if you try and do foo.objects.all() where foo is an instance of Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, you will explicitly get an error: AttributeError: Manager isn't accessible via Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious instances
