I think the hardest part of software engineering (not programming per se) is finding the right balance between pragmatism in getting it done NOW and getting it done RIgHT. There is a tendency among (good) programmers to always want to pull things apart and put them back together is a neater/cooler/cleaner/... way. This is a good thing ... except when it means everything ends up continually in pieces and the elusive goal of a working (and really neat) system drifts further away. For myself, I have to force myself to accept that something are not perfect and settle for getting some results in a short time period. The best way of doing this I find is to set a series of short term milestones that lead to the eventual goal. The stick to meeting the milestones even if some other part of the project looks more tempting for a while.
