How to classify univariate time series data in real-time?

I have a robotic arm doing three different tasks, each task is colored differently as seen below. Data correspond to a Z-axis of the gyroscope sensor. The idea is to detect anomalies. However, I need to know where the anomaly occurred as well, so I need to keep track of the tasks. I believe spotting the starting point of each task would ease this process. So, I am trying to determine the ongoing task solely based on the Z-axis of the gyroscope sensor. Edit: There is no guarantee that the tasks will be in the same order. Edit 2: The detection should be done as soon as possible. The graph shows an angular velocity. The earlier we recognize the new phase is better, there is no specific time limit.
