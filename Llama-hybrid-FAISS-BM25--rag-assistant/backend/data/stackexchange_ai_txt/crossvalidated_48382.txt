Time series prediction when data is not i.i.d

I have time series data $y_t$ with covariates $x_{1,t}, x_{2,t}, ...$. The covariates represent budgets for different programs. I can create an ARIMAX model that fits the data very well so far. In the future, the budget for $x_{1,t}$ is going to be cut. Can I still make predictions based on my ARIMAX model? For current data, $y_t$ is predicted well because it is greatly driven by $x_{1,t}$. In the prediction set, my values for $x_{1,t}$ will be nothing like what they were in the training set where my model was created. How can I resolve this problem of not i.i.d data? Is there a different model or technique that will handle this better?
