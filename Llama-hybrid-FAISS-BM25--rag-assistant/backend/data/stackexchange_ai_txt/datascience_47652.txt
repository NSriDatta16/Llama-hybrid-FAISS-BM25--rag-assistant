Algorithm suggestion for anomaly detection in multivariate time series data

I have time series data containing user actions at certain time intervals eg Date UserId Directory operation Result 01/01/2017 99:00 user1 dir1 created_file success 01/01/2017 99:00 user3 dir10 deleted_file permission_denied unique userIds > 10K 10 distinct operations and 4 distinct Results I need to perform anomaly detection on user behavior in real time. Any suggestions on which method I should use? The anomaly needs to flag whether some user operations are outliers A very small subset of input data will be labelled. But most of the data will be unlabelled.
