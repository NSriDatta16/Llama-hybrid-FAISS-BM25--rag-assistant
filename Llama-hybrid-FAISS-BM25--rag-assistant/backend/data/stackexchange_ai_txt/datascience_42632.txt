What does Machine Learning Paradigms means, and what are they?

Please, help me to properly answer the following (main) question : What does machine learning paradigms means? And, what are they? I tried to answer this questions myself, but two completely different answers come up when searching for it, they are represented by the following links: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/learning-paradigms-in-machine-learning-146ebf8b5943 https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-five-major-paradigms-of-machine-learning I understand that in order to answer the question above, we would also need to answer this additional question : Which of these two links is the proper answer for the question above? Also, I was wondering how come those two very close terms, on those links, could have what seems to be different meanings. Hence, I also have this second additional question : Is the term "machine learning paradigms" actually different from "learning paradigms in machine learning"?
