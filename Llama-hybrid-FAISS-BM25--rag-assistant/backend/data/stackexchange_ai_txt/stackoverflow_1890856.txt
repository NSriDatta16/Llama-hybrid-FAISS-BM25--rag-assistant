For getting familiar with Ruby I'd recommend working on a problem or two from the Ruby Quiz website . This will get you familiar with the basics of the language, and there's a lot of sample answers that will help you learn some Ruby idioms. For Rails specific stuff the best way I've seen to get up to speed with a sample app is in the beginning of the Pragmatic Programmers Rails book . If you don't have that book you can quickly get an electronic version for the weekend. I find following along and actually building something in a language or framework is the best way for me to learn.
