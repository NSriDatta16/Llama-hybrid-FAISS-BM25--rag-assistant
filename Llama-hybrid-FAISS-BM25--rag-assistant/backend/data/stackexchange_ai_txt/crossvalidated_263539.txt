Clustering on the output of t-SNE

I've got an application where it'd be handy to cluster a noisy dataset before looking for subgroup effects within the clusters. I first looked at PCA, but it takes ~30 components to get to 90% of the variability, so clustering on just a couple of PC's will throw away a lot of information. I then tried t-SNE (for the first time), which gives me an odd shape in two dimensions that is very amenable to clustering via k-means. What's more, running a random forest on the data with the cluster assignment as the outcome shows that the clusters have a fairly sensible interpretation given the context of the problem, in terms of the variables that make up the raw data. But if I'm going to report on these clusters, how do I describe them? K-means clusters on principal components reveal individuals who are nearby to one another in terms of the derived variables that comprise X% of the variance in the dataset. What equivalent statement can be made about t-SNE clusters? Perhaps something to the effect of: t-SNE reveals approximate contiguity in an underlying high-dimensional manifold, so clusters on the low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional space maximize the "likelihood" that contiguous individuals will not be in the same cluster Can anyone propose a better blurb than that?
