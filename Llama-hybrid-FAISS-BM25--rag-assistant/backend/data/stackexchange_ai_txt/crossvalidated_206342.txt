Do you have sufficient data points? How many rows are you taking to build this model? If you have sufficient data points (10*variables* cardinality within categorical variable), take HAI as dependent variable. No statistical model is junk. If you have result like this, it clearly states that different independent variable do not have significant impact on dependent variable.( Based on data provided). model if HAI is taken as dependent variable- summary(model) Call: glm(formula = a$HAI ~ a$Patient + a$Env + a$Air + a$Han + a$HAIcat + a$BedOccupancy, family = binomial) Deviance Residuals: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6.547e-06 -6.547e-06 -6.547e-06 6.547e-06 6.547e-06 6.547e-06 6.547e-06 6.547e-06 9 10 6.547e-06 6.547e-06 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
