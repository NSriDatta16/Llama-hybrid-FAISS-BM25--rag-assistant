This seems like a sensible approach and has been used in other areas of changepoint detection to pick the penalty. See Lavielle (2005) for an intuitive approach (for changepoints rather than random forests) and the recent pre-print which uses the broken stick model. Romano et. al (2020+) https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01379 Lavielle (2005) https://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/outgoing/threshold_articles/Lavielle2005.pdf I'm not sure if this has been used with Random Forests before as that isn't my area of research. But hopefully the knowledge that this approach is used, with success, in other areas with similar problems, is helpful.
