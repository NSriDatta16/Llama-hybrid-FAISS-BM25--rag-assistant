The official licensing guide says: A limitation of the legacy copy-protection mechanism on Android Market is that applications using it can be installed only on compatible devices that provide a secure internal storage environment. For example, a copy-protected application cannot be downloaded from Market to a device that provides root access, and the application cannot be installed to a device's SD card. It seems that you would benefit from using that legacy cop-protection to prevent your application from being installed on rooted devices. You might release a separate version that can be installed on rooted devices with an encrypted database.
