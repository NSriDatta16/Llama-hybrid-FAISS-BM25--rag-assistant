As per my comment, your best bet is to run a profiler over the script with a smaller data set to see where the time is going in relative terms. However, there are a couple of easy optimisations you may look into as possible low hanging fruit. Firstly, move the main processing loop inside a function in order to take advantage of optimised local variable access. This can make a surprisingly big difference. Secondly, I would avoid the string formatting call and use a string join instead: def infix2g(line): fragments = [] for i in range(5): fragments.extend([ 'i ', inFix(line[1], i), ' ', inFix(line[2], i), ' ', inFix(line[3], i), '\t', line[0], '\n']) return ''.join(fragments)
