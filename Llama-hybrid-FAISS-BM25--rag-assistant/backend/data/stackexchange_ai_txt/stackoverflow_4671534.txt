What Javascript library encourages nice UI patterns and is appropriate for Silverlight/WPF developer?

I have some experience in SL/WPF. I always wanted to learn how to create nice looking JavaScript web apps that would be relatively easy to implement. Are there any JavaScript libraries that would offer nice view/viewlogic separation (MVVM?) as well as potentially a decent set of controls? Could you recommend anything?
