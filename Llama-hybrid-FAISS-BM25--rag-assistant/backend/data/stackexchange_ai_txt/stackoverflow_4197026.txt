WPF Application - Ways to store a word list?

I'm attempting to develop an application in C#/WPF to aid in studying Spanish vocabulary. Right now I'm simply reading in the vocabulary from a .txt file (the data is simple - a Spanish word and it's corresponding English word separated by a : ) and loading it into a Dictionary. This works fine for a limited amount of data, but I have a feeling once I begin to include a larger scope of data (different verbs, vocabulary from specific chapters etc.) this could begin to get really ugly - I am wondering if anyone could lead me in the direction of a more elegant or efficient way to load and manage this data. Thanks.
