My pick would be jQuery UI . The learning curve is short. A newbie to javascript frameworks myself, I found it to be very easy to learn. Get your head around selectors and you're sorted. The current version of jQuery UI has specific functionality for dragging and dropping . jQuery UI lets you customize your package so you only include the components you're using (as well as the core). Of course it's minimized so the total size for what you want could be as low as the 135kb mark. You probably won't find much difference between frameworks here. According to the jQuery website, it's been tested for "compatibility in IE 6.0+, FF 2+, Safari 3.1+, Opera 9.0+, and Google Chrome." Good luck!
