predictions in regression

I have simple linear model - assume height and weight in humans are linearly related. height I would like to make some predictions. What would be weight when height is 68.5. newdata = data.frame(height=68.5) predict(mod1, newdata) 1 150.8333 I want to test (with test static) whether average weight is less than 155 when the height is 68.5. How can I do this ?
