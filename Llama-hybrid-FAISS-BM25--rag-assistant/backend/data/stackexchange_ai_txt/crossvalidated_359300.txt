SARIMAX(1,0,0)(0,0,0,0): Regression with ARMA errors or ARMAX?

I'm trying to unravel the influences of various exogenous regressors on a time series dataset. I'm getting good results with a sarimax(1,0,0)(0,0,0,0) specification, but I'm confused about the mathematical specification behind this model. With this, I'm also questioning the interpretability of the coefficients. I'm using the statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX package in python. Literature gives me two options (see here ): The model is specified as a regression model with ARMA errors: The model is specified as an ARMAX model: Which model am I actually using?
