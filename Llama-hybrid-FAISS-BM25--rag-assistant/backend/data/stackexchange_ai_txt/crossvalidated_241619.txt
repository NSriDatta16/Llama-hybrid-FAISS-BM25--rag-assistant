Manually writing code for a Simple CNN using Backpropagation?

Are there any resources online that offer examples of how to write a CNN from scratch? Specifically, I am looking to understand the inner-workings of the backpropagation steps within a 1-D or 2-D CNN. I can find the equations for backpropagation online, but I am having trouble translating that into code within a CNN. Thanks
