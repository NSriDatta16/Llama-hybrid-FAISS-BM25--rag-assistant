The first way to model the value $p_1(x)$ is via the sigmoid function; the second way to model it, namely $p_2(x)$ , is via the probit function. They are not intimately related per se, i.e., one cannot naturally get from the sigmoid to the probit or vice-versa. However, the probit function can be used as an approximation to the sigmoid function. In fact, the two functions are closest, around $x=0$ , when $p_1(x)$ is approximated by $p_2$ as $p_2\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}}x\right)$ . This is useful, for instance, in the context of bayesian logistic regresion, where we are required to solve an integral of the form $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} p_1(x) \mathcal{N}(x\vert\mu_x, \sigma_x) dx $$ Using the sigmoid function $p_1(x)$ makes the integral intractable, but we can make a variational approximation to the integral considering $p_2\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}}x\right)$ , which turns the problem into a convolution of Gaussians, hence, it has a closed-form solution.
