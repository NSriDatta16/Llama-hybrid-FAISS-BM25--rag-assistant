Keep in mind that code coverage is not a measure of how correct your program is, nor does 100% coverage mean you've executed every code path. For example, the ternary operator a ? b : c and compound boolean expressions if (a 6) are counted as single statements even though you may execute only a portion of them due to short-circuiting. Also, omitting the braces around single-statement if , while , etc. blocks turns the whole thing into a single statement. The following will appear as a single statement in the code coverage report so you can't tell if you've executed both cases ( true and false ). if (...) foo(); I feel that private final function __clone() { } is too simple to fail. Testing that the method throws an exception (using reflection no less which your clients won't do) is testing the PHP interpreter--out of scope in my book. [For the record, I too get a little OC when it comes to reaching 100% code coverage, but keeping the above facts in mind helps to alleviate it so I can move on to writing better code.]
