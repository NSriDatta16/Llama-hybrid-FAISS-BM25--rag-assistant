Resources for Non-Bayesian Online Change-point Detection

I am interested in learning about the fundamentals of on-line change point detection. I am specifically not interested in the Bayesian methods. The only solid resource / review / survey I could find for on-line methods was the book Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection by Tartakovsky, Nikiforov, and Basseville but it is very advanced. Are there any other resources out there for someone getting into this line of research at an early grad level? An example for what I am looking for, this paper that surveys offline methods is amazingly clear and beginner friendly .
