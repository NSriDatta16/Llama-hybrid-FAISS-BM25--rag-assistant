Does the accuracy of an autoencoder matter when used to detect anomaly

Let me first explain what I'm trying to do: An autoencoder is first trained on regular data (no anomalies), then the decoder is discarded. Outputs from the encoder using overall data (data with and without anomalies) is clustered (using HDBSCAN) and the clusters are manually examined. The hypothesis is that anomalies will not become a part of the core clusters or become outliers. There's a few papers citing good results from this (just search "autoencoder anomaly detection clustering" ). However, my autoencoder yields very low accuracy (
