For the very first steps, I would recommend command line applications. For everything else, follow up with WinForm apps. They have a broad web coverage in turorials etc, and offer a wide range of problems and solutions that cover basic and advanced C# features. ASP.NET, Silverlight and WPF are further extensions of those basics (Console and Winforms), which actually add another set of framework libraries. Those are the icing of the cake that you can address once you managed the basics. Don't get me wrong, you can also learn the basics with Silverlight or WPF apps. But WinForm is known to almost anyone who ever developed in C#, so you are much more likely to find good answers to difficult problems you might encounter on the web (on SO or elsewhere). There are a lot of people here much more knowledgeable than me, who can help you explore the depth of the .NET framework Once you have mastered these parts, feel free to explore new territory - and soon you will be the one to answer my questions on WPF, which I know nothing about ;-)
