Rails routing with roles, how do I set it up?

This is more of a conceptual question... I'm starting on an app that will have a few roles (e.g. employee, manager, store_manager). Each role will view/edit/destroy in different ways from each other. When a manager is editing an employee the view will be very different than when a store_manager is editing. My thinking was to namespace many of the models with the role. Like: namespace :store_manger do resources :users resources :widgets end namespace :manager do resources :users resources :widgets end This seems to be a much cleaner method than creating all the if can? :update, @article all over the controllers and views. So, is my thinking on track? Are there any pitfalls to using this method that I need to be aware of? Or, is there a better way to organize this?
