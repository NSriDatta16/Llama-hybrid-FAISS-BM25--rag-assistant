The "procedure" outlined below is fully analogous to the one you suggest. I have chosen a simpler estimation procedure, with only one parameter, to make the computations easier. Real experiment, actual data. An urn contains 1000 red balls and 1100 green balls. The true proportion of red balls in the urn is $\theta = 10/21 = 0.4761905.$ Sampling with replacement $n = 40$ times from the urn, I see 15 red balls in 40, so my estimate of $\theta$ is $\hat \theta = 15/40 = 0.375.$ (I'm asking you to pretend I have a real urn from which I drew actual balls.) urn = c(rep(1,1000),rep(0,1100)) x = sample(urn, 40, rep=T) sum(x) [1] 15 One kind of 95% confidence interval for $\theta$ based on the 40 observations is the Jeffreys interval $(0.238, 0.529).$ It does happen to include the true $\theta =0.4761905.$ [But in an actual experiment, I wouldn't know that.] qbeta(c(.025,.975), 15.5, 25.5) [1] 0.2379065 0.5294649 Simulated data. Rightly realizing that sampling from the urn is like observing independent Bernoulli trials, I (foolishly) decide to 'augment' my sample with 160 simulated Bernoulli trials having "red-ball" probability $\hat\theta = 0.375.$ [All simulations and computations from R.] set.seed(2020) r.a = sum(rbinom(160, 1, 0.375)); r.a [1] 55 So now, I pretend to have observed $15 + 55 = 70$ red balls in $200.$ My re-estimated value of $\theta$ is the 'improved' $\tilde\theta = 70/200 = 0.35.$ The Jeffreys 95% CI based on this 'improved' estimate is $(0.286, 0.418).$ I am delighted by my new interval because, based on 200 fake 'observations' it is shorter than my original CI. [Of course, in an actual experiment, I wouldn't know that it no longer includes the true value of $\theta.]$ qbeta(c(.025, .975), 70.5, 130.5) [1] 0.2864262 0.4178799 However, drawing from an urn requires having an urn with balls in it and messing around with drawing and counting and replacing. And simulation is quick and easy. So, elated by my (dilusional) 'success' with fake data, I decide to simulate another 1000 fake draws. Now based on my new estimate $\tilde\theta = 70/200.$ The result of this extended simulation is the updated estimate $\tilde{\tilde\theta} = 0.3508$ and the even shorter CI $(0.3242, 0.3782),$ which by now is based mainly on my pseudo-random number generator and has very little to do with an actual urn and balls. set.seed(1066) r.aa = sum(rbinom(1000, 1, 70/200)); r.aa [1] 351 (70 + 351)/(200+1000) [1] 0.3508333 qbeta(c(.025,.975), 70+351+.5, 1200-70-351+.5) [1] 0.3242170 0.3781682 Note: I have used Jeffreys CIs here because they have very good coverage properties and are very easy to compute using R. Although Jeffreys intervals are based on a Bayesian argument, they have excellent frequentist properties and are not used in a Bayesian context here. Their endpoints are often similar to those of Agresti CIs: the Agresti version the final CI above is $(0.3246, 0.3786).$
