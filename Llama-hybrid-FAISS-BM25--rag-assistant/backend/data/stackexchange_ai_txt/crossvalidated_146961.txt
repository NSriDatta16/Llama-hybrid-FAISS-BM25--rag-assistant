This answer is offered because I don't really know what model ezANOVA is trying to fit. I do know that the ez package uses routines from lme4 and others, so I'm suggesting using those directly rather than via whatever "ez" approaches are actually not so "ez" (for me) to understand... So here is some code to try, for starters. First, create a variable in your data frame named ntrials , or some such, that has the number of trials underlying each value in correct . library(lme4) mod1 = glmer(correct ~ Visual1 + AudioAll + (1| subject_nr), weights = ntrials, family = binomial, data = AGGFRAMED.ANOVA.Collapsed.means) plot(mod1) summary(mod1) library(car) Anova(mod1) This model fits a mixed model to the logit of the observed proportions, with random subjects. The plot will be the most basic diagnostic plot, and it should look like a random scatter. The summary will show the regression coefficients and tests thereof. The Anova will give a type II-style ANOVA, but with $\chi^2$ tests instead of $F$ tests because of the binomial model. If the diagnostics look OK, you could do followup comparisons something like this: library(lsmeans) lsmeans(mod1, pairwise ~ Visual1, type = "r") lsmeans(mod1, pairwise ~ AudioAll, type = "r") These commands obtain marginal averages of the predictions from this model, then transform the results to the original (fraction of successes) scale (the comparisons come out as odds ratios).
