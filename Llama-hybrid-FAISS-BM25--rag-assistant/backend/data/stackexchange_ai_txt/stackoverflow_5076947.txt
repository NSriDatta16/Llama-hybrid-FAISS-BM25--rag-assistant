I like answers gven by @Suesh and @nanda and would like to summarize. First, optimize your code. I think that at least half of the time of the operation you are spending on copying of the sub array. You have to work in place: find the first and last index of the array and calculate average of the elements. The best solution requires just one run on the array. If it is impossible (I do not know what is your logic to find the indexes) in the worse case you have to iterate the array twice. But do not copy its content. If this optimization does not help enough think about thread pool or actors model using Akka (as was suggested by nanda)
