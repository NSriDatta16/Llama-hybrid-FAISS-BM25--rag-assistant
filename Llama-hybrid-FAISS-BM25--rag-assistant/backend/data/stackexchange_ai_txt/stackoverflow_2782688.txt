NHibernate CreateSQLQuery data conversion from bit to boolean error

Im being a bit lazy in NHibernate and using Session.CreateSqlQuery(...) instead of doing the whole thing with Lambda's. Anyway what struct me is that there seems to be a problem converting some of the types returned from (in this case the MySQL) DB into native .Net tyes. The query in question looks like this.... IList allocatableClients = Session.CreateSQLQuery( "select clients.id as Id, clients.name as Name, clients.customercode as CustomerCode, clients.superclient as SuperClient, clients.clienttypeid as ClientType " + ... ... .SetResultTransformer(new NHibernate.Transform.AliasToBeanResultTransformer(typeof(Client))).List (); The type in the database of SuperClient is a bit(1) and in the Client object the type is a bool. The error received is: System.ArgumentException: Object of type 'System.UInt64' cannot be converted to type 'System.Boolean'. It seems strange that this conversion cannot be completed. Would be greatful for any ideas. Thanks.
