Efficiency is a slippery term. It can mean different things to different people. However in most cases it means "performance", so I will assume that is what you mean for now. I suspect the reality is that this is the most efficient (performant) way. Other methods may appear more elegant, as they will preserve existing data, and only add missing data, but they will (potentially) require more database accesses and (definitely) more complicated SQL. One database call to delete and one to add should fix you up. The only exception may be where there are large numbers of entries and the changes are small (or negligible). In this case you may need to reconsider.
