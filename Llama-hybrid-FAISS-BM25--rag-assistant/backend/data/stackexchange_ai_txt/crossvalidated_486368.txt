No such formula exists for the optimal sample size of machine learning models. The general answer is - it depends. There is the Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis dimension , which gives a very general expression of separability of two classes, given the number of degrees of freedom of a machine learning model. The VC-dimension is mainly of theoretical interest. The best advice is to study generalization performance as a function of training set size on an independent test set. Specifically for linear and quadratic discriminant analysis the variance of the error rate has been derived (by approximation). The size of the training set is a parameter in these variance calculations. [G.J. McLachlan, Discriminant analysis and statistical pattern recognition (Chap. 4), Wiley].
