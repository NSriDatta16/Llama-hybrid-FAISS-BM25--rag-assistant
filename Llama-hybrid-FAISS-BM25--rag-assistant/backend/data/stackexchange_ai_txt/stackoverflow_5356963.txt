Is it bad practice to use temporary tables in SQL?

That is, using temporary tables with some initial unique data and then populating it one or several fields at a time. Sometimes it makes code seem more readable but it also leads to procedural type thinking. And it's also slower than using derived tables or other methods. Is it discouraged in industry?
