Support vector regression maximizes the margin containing the points, up to slack. The objective function is thus not a probabilistic one, and anything tailored on top will not give you optimal results. SVMs are not meant to provide this. The already mentioned Gaussian processes excel at this. Neural networks can be used if a special loss function is chosen.
