I don't know about the syntax problem, the usual access rules should apply - but there is another problem here if that would work as these member functions have no linkage. To accept local types at all, setupCallback() would have to be a template function - but template type arguments with no linkage are not allowed. ยง3.5/8 says: Names not covered by these rules have no linkage. Moreover, except as noted, a name declared in a local scope (3.3.2) has no linkage. Members of local classes are not covered there. ยง9.3/3 clarifies that: Member functions of a local class (9.8) have no linkage. Long story cut short: don't use member functions of a local class as callbacks, use a non-local class instead.
