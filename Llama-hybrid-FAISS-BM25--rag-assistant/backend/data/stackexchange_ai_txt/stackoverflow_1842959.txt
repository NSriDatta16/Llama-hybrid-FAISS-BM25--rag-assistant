How can I get Maven to generate a jnlp for my project?

I'd like to have Maven2 generate a .jnlp (webstart profile) for my application. There is a maven-jnlp-plugin, but it's deprecated as of somewhere around Maven 1.1-beta2. Is there a more preferred way to do this, or do I need to build out this capability myself?
