What could be possible reason for accuracy in convnets being constant while training error keeps decreasing?

Just for sanity checks, I am checking that, can my network overfit over some 50 examples of cifar-10. But every time I see that my training accuracy is not going above 40% but training error decreases with every iteration. I am using lasagne and vgg type network. Any help for choosing hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, regularization parameter could be bonus for me. Thanks for your attention.
