How to override a package in android source code at boot-time?

I want the android source to check at boot time if sdcard is inserted and if yes then override the default crypto package in the android source code with the one in sd card, else it does nothing. Now I have 2 questions: 1. How can i override a default package? 2. How to check the status of sdcard at boot time? I know how to check the status of sdcard in an application, which i got from one of the posts here, but how to utilize this boot time if(android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(android.os.Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)) Regards, Yogesh
