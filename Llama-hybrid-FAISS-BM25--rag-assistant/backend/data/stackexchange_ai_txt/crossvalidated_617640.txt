By adding a random intercept per nest (and possibly also per loction), you are adding a lot of flexibility in the model and potential to overfit. With logistic regression this may cause full separation (even when the effect is random instead of fixed) and large parameter estimates. See for the explanation of overfitting and high dimensionality here Why is logistic regression particularly prone to overfitting in high dimensions? A case of overfitting with random effects is here Perfect separation, perhaps? In binary outcome and repeated measure (random effect) with multiple independent variables (using R) You have measured both nest types on the same location. Then, you can use a proportional odds model which eliminates the variable risk between locations. Also useful can be to make a plot of the survival curves (eg use the emperical distribution) to get a visual inspectation of the difference between the two next types and risk treatments. This helps to see whether the output of your function makes sense or not.
