I'm a big fan of your more granular leaves, but at the top level I perform much better having the filesystem organized by project. I'm much more likely to be in a code directory and think, "Hey, what was the spec for this?" than be in the spec directory and think, "Which project did I want the spec for?" To rearrange your diagram: | |___webs____ | | | |_blog.com_ | | | | | |_docs_ | | | | | | | |_mockups | | | |_user stories | | | |_... | | | | | |_code_ | | | | | | | |_dev_ | | | | | | | | | |_app | | | | |_cfg | | | | |_... | | | | | | | |_prod_ | | | |_qa_ | | | |_uat_ | | | |_blah.com_ | | | | | |_... | |_desktop___ | | | |_noteapp__ | | | | | |_... | |_... KEY dev - development prod - production qe - quality engineering uat - user acceptance testing That said, the organization at my office follows your methods, and seems to support a largish development environment. Personally, I find it really frustrating to have to search for mockups and other cases in directories other than the one my project is in (specifically, as an analyst, having specs separate from Marketing models, but I digress), but from a process-delegation standpoint separating these concepts probably makes a good deal of sense. Just my two cents.
