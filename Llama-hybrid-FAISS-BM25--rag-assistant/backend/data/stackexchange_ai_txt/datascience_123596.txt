Think simple, do you have a dataset with driving scores? If you do you can use supervised learning algorithms. If you don't, and there is no good way to create a dataset for such a large input-output space, maybe think out of the box. You can create a simulation environment and go with reinforcement learning algorithms, then you can train both models with the reward functions from the environment.
