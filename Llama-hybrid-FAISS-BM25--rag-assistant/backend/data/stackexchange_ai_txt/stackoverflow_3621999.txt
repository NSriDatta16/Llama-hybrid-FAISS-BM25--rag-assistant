It's quite a lot of work, and there are already a lot of solutions out there - but that shouldn't deter you! Your three points cover almost everything in general terms... the fact it's coming through POP3 isn't all that relevant, IMAP, or even OWS (Outlook Web Services for Exchange) all require attention to the following points: Attachments can be referred to inline in an email (combo of your 1,2,3) - as in an email can include an IMAGE which is itself an attachment. There are many MIME types you have to support. Emails can be a single part, multi-part different, multi-part alternative, and combinations thereof. A good newsletter will send you a text & HTML version of the same data leaving the client the choice to choose which way to consume the data. That email could have one or more attachments... and that attachment can be another text/html email with another attachment... and this goes on ad nauseam. HTML As you've already pointed out, rendering email HTML inside your page without intersects in style etc is tricky, plus you'll want to filter for bad content - JavaScript includes potentially, embedded images which might have privacy implications. There are several character encodings that can be used - this ties into MIME types, but is worth independently noting (for headache-worthiness alone). Basically you have to be jack of a number of trades to generate and decode emails.
