I'm not sure what the point would be of preventing access to the $_GET or $_POST arrays. There's nothing harmful in them. If you're creating a framework for preventing SQL injection or cross-site-scripting, you should escape the data when creating an SQL query or HTML document. Escaping GET/POST data at the beginning is too early; you don't know how the data will be used, so you can't escape or encode it properly. Having said that, you still may have some valid reasons to want people to access GET/POST data through your code. In that case, I still wouldn't unset them. You may end up incorporating third-party code which relies on them. Instead, just encourage your users to avoid them (like they should avoid global variables in general).
