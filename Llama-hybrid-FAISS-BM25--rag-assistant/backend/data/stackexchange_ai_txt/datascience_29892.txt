This would actually be more suitable as a comment, but I am lacking the reputation to do so. Given your background, I recommend this page https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php It's a good introduction to Python and it also contains a part about NumPy (and I would highly recommend to get more familiar with those before doing the ML part). I would not recommend the part about machine learning because it teaches you how to program the models, but usually your job in industry is to use whatever is there, not to write things yourself. For the "normal" machine learning the scikit-learn homepage gives good examples. This leaves deep-learning, for which I cannot recommend anything.
