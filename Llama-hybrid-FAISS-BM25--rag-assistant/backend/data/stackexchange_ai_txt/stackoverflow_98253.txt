One option I would recommend for its simplicty is to have your UI just call a helper class or method on the firing of the event and unit test that. Make sure it (your event handler in the UI) has as little logic as possible and then from there I'm sure you'll know what to do. It can be pretty difficult to reach 100% coverage in your unit tests. By difficult I mean of course inefficient. Even once you get good at something like that it will, in my opinion, probably add more complexity to your code base than your unit test would merit. If you're not sure how to get your logic segmented into a separate class or method, that's another question I would love to help with. I'll be interested to see what other techniques people have to work with this kind of issue.
