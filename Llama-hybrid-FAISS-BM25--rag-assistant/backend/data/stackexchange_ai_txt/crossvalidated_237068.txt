What I did is calculate the usage at mid month needed to balance the end month kw usage calculation using linear interpolation. This works out to be a simple formula: $kw_{m-1/2}=\frac{3}{2}kw_m-\frac{1}{2}kw_{m-1}$. That is, the mid month consumption is 3/2 of the end month consumption minus 1/2 of the prior month's utilization. Why? Simple geometry. Note that the area of each trapezoid under the curve is the average height times the base. Note that the area of the two half- month trapezoids culminating in the end of month usage is thus $\frac{1}{2}\frac{kw_{m-1}+\frac{3}{2}kw_m-\frac{1}{2}kw_{m-1}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\frac{3}{2}kw_m-\frac{1}{2}kw_{m-1}+kw_m}{2}=kw_m.$ To show this, I made up pseudo data because I didn't have any. Here are the step by step calculations. Pseudo-data and calculations: month end kw days kw/day mid month mid month usage 01/10/2017 546 3/2*kw(m)-1/2*kw(m-1) 01/11/2017 294 31 17.61290323 16/10/2017 12:00 168 01/12/2017 493 30 9.8 16/11/2017 0:00 592.5 01/01/2018 593 31 15.90322581 16/12/2017 12:00 643 Putting together the true usages and mid month usages in a single table give us a table of all values: dates kw 01/10/2017 546 16/10/2017 12:00 168 01/11/2017 294 16/11/2017 0:00 592.5 01/12/2017 493 16/12/2017 12:00 643 01/01/2018 593 We then proceed to plot that table: Note, we could further require that the slope for each month and mid month be the same approached from the left or right, or we could solve the same problem a bazillion other ways. No matter how it is solved, there will be "slumps" or "bumps" in between the months to account, respectively, for the greater or lesser utilization during the prior month. For real life utilization, the actual curve is closer to a step function with many mostly tiny steps and some big ones too, so there is no way we can emulate it exactly.
