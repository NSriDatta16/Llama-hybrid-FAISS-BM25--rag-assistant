Determining which NSView instance initiated a mouseDown:

I have a gameboard with 25 tiles of myGameTile, a subclass of NSView. In mouseDown: I want to determine which tile I clicked on and set an ivar to a representative value. e.g. If I click on tile 12, set clickedTile to "12" or some value that uniquely represents that particular instance. I'm open anything from the integer value 12 all the way to some sort of introspection/reflection, though built-in features and elegance are preferable to hacks, runtime wrappers, and modification. Still, I'm aware that I may have no choice but to rely on those solutions, so please to answer with those as well. I'd like to know all my options. Thanks!
