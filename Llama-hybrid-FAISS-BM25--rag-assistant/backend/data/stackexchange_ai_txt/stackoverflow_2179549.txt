Should users see their own performance stats in real time

I know this questions seems extremely open ended. I will try to narrow scope. I have been struggling for some time as to include or exclude real time user performance stats in an application gui. Does anyone have any info on the harm vs gain in including these stats in an app? i.e. number of emails answered, number of customer calls taken, average time per customer etc. The users are begging for more info on their stats, as it is how they are rated. However there is concern that given access to see their performance real time or near real time it will negatively affect their work. I can kind of equate it to being measured on how many lines of code I churned out in one day. Would this help me to be more productive or just teach me write code as fast as possible and most likely make a lot of mistakes. In my application I can think of these scenario's i.e. BAD: "I see I have spent 10 minutes on this issue already, I need to finish this up asap" vs i.e. GOOD: "I was able to help that customer quickly, My productivity is good today"
