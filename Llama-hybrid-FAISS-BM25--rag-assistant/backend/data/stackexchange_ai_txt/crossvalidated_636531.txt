If there are missing data, you are using missing data methodology. You have to be explicit about what you're doing even if just ignoring them. Clearly option B is completely biased. You have imputed 0 for the unobserved letters (bad) then taken a frequency weighted average of the a-e sum (good). Instead, the average for first day is 27.5, and 5 times that is 137.5. Similarly for second day: 150. (4*137.4 + 2*150 )/6 = 141.6 much closer to option A. Option A is mean imputation which is fine for estimation. However, you do not use any frequency weighting here. In fact if you did, you'd get the same answer as B. (2*20 + 1*20 + 1* 30 + 1*50 + 1*30)/6 *5 = 141.6 again. So they are not options at all, just row-wise vs column-wise approaches to calculating the sum.
