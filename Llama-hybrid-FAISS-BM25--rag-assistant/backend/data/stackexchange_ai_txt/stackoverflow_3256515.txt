Advices to manage my own code toolbox

On every new professional project I tend to (re)-create the same helpers and utils classes. It is not wheel re-invention, but rather some small tools that can fit in any project. I wish I can keep them in a 'code toolbox' that I can re-use on each time. But I'm facing some problems (Legal question, version problem, dependencies, ...). edit: here is a more detailed list of encountered problem: legal: this code is not mine, it's owned by my company even if I wrote it. So it is not very legal to use utils part of my code in other projects (see: link text version: if I create an OSS project the code will hosted on a remote source control system. But my current company project code is hosted in house source control system. How to keep both in sync ? version bis: my own OSS package will be something like org.myself.greatestcodeever.utils, but the one of my company will be com.bigcorpo.dept.utils. How to keep it sync ? version ter: my company have some restrictive rules about internet access. So my OSS source repository may not be available. version --> the more annoying problem: accumulation of small problems are discouraging me. If you have such a toolbox, how do you maintain it ?
