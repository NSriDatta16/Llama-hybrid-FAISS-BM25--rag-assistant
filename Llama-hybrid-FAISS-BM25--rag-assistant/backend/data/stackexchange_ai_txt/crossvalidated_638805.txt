This is a bit of a rabbit hole. It seems that the $357$ is the answer to a completely different question. Its calculation comes from the sample size for an infinite population of $$\dfrac{1.96^2 \times \tfrac12 \times \tfrac12}{0.05^2} \approx 384.16$$ and a finite population correction $$\dfrac{384.16}{1+\tfrac{384.16-1}{5000}}\approx 356.82$$ This represents the sample size required for a $95\%$ confidence interval which is $\pm 0.05$ from the sample proportion, when sampling without replacement from a population of $5000$ . It might be a reasonable approach to get a sample size producing a very rough estimate, for example if you wanted some idea of what proportion of lines had lead, and would be satisfied if seeing an answer of $50\%$ meant it should be interpreted as $45\%-55\%$ . It is completely inappropriate for trying to reach the conclusion that absolutely no lines have lead with some degree of confidence. If you really wanted an $x\%$ confidence figure for no lines having lead, you would need to test $x\%$ of the lines, so with $5000$ lines then testing $4750$ and seeing no lead would give $95\%$ confidence. This is intuitively sensible: if there was just one line with lead then the probability it would appear in your $x\%$ sample is $x\%$ . Or use the hypergeometric distribution and R: dhyper(0, 1, 5000-1, 4750) # 0.05 Aiming for "absolutely no lines having lead" is a very high standard. Saying " $40$ or fewer lines out of $5000$ have lead" (i.e. $0.8\%$ or less) could be said with $95\%$ confidence on a sample size of $357$ and no positive tests: dhyper(0, 41, 5000-41, 357) gives 0.047 . That is close to the " rule of three " for sampling without replacement, since $\frac3{357}(5000âˆ’357)\approx 39.02$ . This stems from the Flint lead-in-water crisis , leading to work done in the State of Michigan, later circulated nationwide in Annex E of an EPA report including the quoted numbers. One of the links is to a white paper prepared for the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA) by BlueConduit. That then points to an online confidence-interval calculator which my browser objects to for having issues with its security certificate . You can then get it to reproduce the $357$ figure with a particular choice of numbers, as shown in this screen shot: Another page on the same site says it gives the formula. Another screenshot:
