gym car racing v0 using DQN

I am currently learning reinforcement learning and wanted to use it on the car racing-v0 environment. I have successfully made it using PPO algorithm and now I want to use a DQN algorithm but when I want to train the model it gives me this error: AssertionError: The algorithm only supports ( ,) as action spaces but Box([-1. 0. 0.], [1. 1. 1.], (3,), float32) was provided Here is my code: import os import gym from stable_baselines3 import DQN from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv from stable_baselines3.common.evaluation import evaluate_policy environment_name = 'CarRacing-v0' env = gym.make(environment_name) #Test Environment episodes = 5 for episode in range(1, episodes+1): obs = env.reset() done = False score = 0 while not done: env.render() action = env.action_space.sample() obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action) score += reward print('Episode:{} Score:{}'.format(episode, score)) env.close() env = gym.make(environment_name) env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: env]) log_path = os.path.join('Training', 'Logs') model = DQN('CnnPolicy', env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log = log_path) I am using jupyter notebook for this project
