Prevent Resharper "Possible Null Reference Exception" warnings

Let's say I have an interface with a read-only property and and a concrete class where the property is instantiated in the constructor and marked as read-only. internal interface IExample { ObservableCollection Items { get; } } internal class Example : IExample { private readonly ObservableCollection _items; public Example() { _items = new ObservableCollection (); } public ObservableCollection Items { get { return _items; } } } When I use the interface Resharper warns me that I might have a possible null reference in calling code. public class ExampleWithWarnings { public void Show() { IExample example = new Example(); // resharper warns about null reference example.Items.Add( "test" ); } } I realize that by definition the interface doesn't guarantee that the property will have a value. (I also recognize that properties on interfaces aren't ideal). But I know this property will always have a value. Is there any magic attribute that I can put on the interface that would prevent Resharper from showing a warning? I'd rather not have to decorate all usages of the class with a disable pragma warning.
