URLs have a finite maximum length. AES-encrypted strings do not. URLs are not an appropriate vector for passing arbitrary information. Using an HTTP POST is a much better way, if you must communicate over HTTP. About why you are having problems: quoting from the PHP manual page on urlencode : Note: Be careful about variables that may match HTML entities. Things like &amp, &copy and &pound are parsed by the browser and the actual entity is used instead of the desired variable name. This is an obvious hassle that the W3C has been telling people about for years. The reference is here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2 . PHP supports changing the argument separator to the W3C-suggested semi-colon through the arg_separator .ini directive. Unfortunately most user agents do not send form data in this semi-colon separated format. A more portable way around this is to use &amp; instead of & as the separator. You don't need to change PHP's arg_separator for this. Leave it as &, but simply encode your URLs using htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars().
