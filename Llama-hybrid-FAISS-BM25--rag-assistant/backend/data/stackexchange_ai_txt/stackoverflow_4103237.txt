The only argument that can be made for a single stylesheet is the reduction of one HTTP request. Given that on average, 60% of web traffic will be made out of IE users, that's not an insignificant impact. However, hacks like the Holly Hack are just plain ugly and are not guaranteed to work, and that since stylesheets are cached, the impact should not be as significant as it would be. Conditional comments are an acceptable practice and should be used to work around IE problems. There's no reason to load two entirely separate stylesheets just for standard compliant and non-standard complaint browsers - overriding the few problematic properties should be enough. Alternatively, a Javascript solution, such as IE7.js, can also be used for the same effect.
