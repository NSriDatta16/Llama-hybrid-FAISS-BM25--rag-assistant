Instantiate UITextField delegate programmatically?

I have a UITextField that has been added to my view in Interface Builder. My question is: is there a way I can programatically set its delegate from within Xcode? I know that I can connect up the delegate in IB by dragging a connection from UITextField>Delegate to my viewController which implements textFieldShouldReturn: Just curious as the control "UITextField" is obviously instantiated in IB and not directly through code.
