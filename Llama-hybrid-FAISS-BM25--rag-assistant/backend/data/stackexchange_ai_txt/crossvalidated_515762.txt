As whuber said in his comment, the two equations are equivalent, as long as the considered population is finite ( $N$ being its size). If a population is not finite, we cannot compute its parameters without some estimation error, but if the population is finite, we can compute any statistic we may want from the totality of data, without any uncertainty (if you do have all data), because expected values are just population averages.
