Statically, you can declare it to be called. You don't necessarily have to implement the interface inside the calling class. For example: public class HulkHogan { private IPerson person; public HulkHogan(IPerson person){ this.person = person; } public void doSomething(Contant contact){ //call your method here person.savePerson(contact); } } But in order to execute it, you will need to implement it somewhere, because interface just describes how something behaves but does not provide the actual behaviour (i.e. does not implement it).
