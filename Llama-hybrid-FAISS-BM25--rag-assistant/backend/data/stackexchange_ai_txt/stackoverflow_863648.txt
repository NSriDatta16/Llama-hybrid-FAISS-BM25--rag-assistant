JavaServer Faces (JSF) I've heard is similar to the microsoft MVC framework. (I use JSF but have never used .NET MVC). And I believe JSF 1.1 works fine on Google App Engine, and I suspect that the newer versions of JSF will work if you stick to using XHTML instead of JSPs as the templates. There are also some nice libraries which let you leverage an AJAX interface on the JSF framework, RichFaces is a popular one. Check out JavaServer Faces on sun.com and also JBoss RichFaces
