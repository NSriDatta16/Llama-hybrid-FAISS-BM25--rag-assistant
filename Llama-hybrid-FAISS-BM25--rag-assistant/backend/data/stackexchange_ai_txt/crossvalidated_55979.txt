BoxCox Transformation for time series with multiple instances

I have time series data with multiple instances. For example, instances like ( 0.36,0.35,0.32,0.31,0.31,0.30,0.30,0.28,0.30 ) occur 20 times ($20\times 9$ array). I am wondering how to do variance stabilization with boxcox transformation. Is connecting all instances to form one long series so boxcox is applied to this long series acceptable?
