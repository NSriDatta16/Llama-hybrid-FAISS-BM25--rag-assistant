OSCommerce alternatives

I'm looking to evaluate a few opensource e-commerce solutions. Are there any good alternatives to OSCommerce out there ? I've looked at Thelia and Magento so far, are there any others that are worth looking at ? They should be : Free as in freedom Easy to maintain / extend Coded in PHP or Python (ideally, but I'm open-minded)
