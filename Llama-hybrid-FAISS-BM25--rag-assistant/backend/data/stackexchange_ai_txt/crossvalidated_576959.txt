Simple linear regression exercise

I'm trying to do an exercise but I can't figure out how to proceed. OLS is run for this model, with 100 observations. $$ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i+\epsilon_i $$ The results are $$ \hat\beta =\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\1 \end{pmatrix} $$ $$ V(\hat\beta)=\hat\sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix} 3 &0.12 \\ 0.12 &0.064 \end{pmatrix} $$ It asks me to calculate $$ e'e$$ aka the sum of squared residuals. I don't know what to do. I know in simple regressione the coefficients and variances have formulas that have to do with averages and variances of y and x. But I don't have any info on the individual observations. Could anyone tell me what I'm missing or how to solve this?
