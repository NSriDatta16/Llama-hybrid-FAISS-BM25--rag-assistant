To view this post and the respective links, please head over to my forums to read it. Includes 10+ WebGL library links I would suggest C3DL, which I am currently using to develop a hobbyist game. It is early in development but so is WebGL and is also the leading WebGL library in my opinion. There are a few bugs and such because, well this technology is still considered "beta" and not a standard yet. There is just so much you can do with it and the fact that it cuts your development time WAY down. Also to "pqnb" IE does not hold the market share for browsers. Firefox does, then IE, with chrome a CLOSE third and rising, I expect by next year chrome to surpass both FF and IE. Also note that DirectX is exclusively on Windows. So if you want to hit the most people, and make a browser game I would use WebGL and test it on FF and Chrome. Mainly because by the time you get to finish the game it will be a standard and fully functional. Given development time lines and such of the average game. That is also one thing no one has really looked at. He is asking which engine to go with, being how its a browser based game he should already have some experience in HTML CSS JS and maybe XML. WebGL is about the only language most web developers can pick up and run with because it is Javascript based. Flash you would have a learning curve for Actionscript and of course the others have their languages and I have no experience in them so I wont go into any language discussion on them. WebGL Pros Javascript based, Fast learning curve Not plugin based, and runs natively in browser. Faster over all since a third party plugin is not required Its OpenGL, there are hundres of tutorials already out there for it that would be simple to convert over like the NeHe tutorials, which already have been Plenty of Libraries to choose from: C3DL(recommended), Copperlicht, EnergizeGL, GLGE, SceneJS, SpiderGL, and more WebGL Cons It is still beta and everything is in early development.
