As per the Wikipedia page on online algorithms , a number of synonyms exist, e.g.: "sequential" algorithms "streaming" algorithms "dynamic" algorithms Thus, if no information can be found on an "online" algorithm for a specific problem, it may be useful to search for a "sequential", "streaming" or "dynamic" algorithm. See also this posts: Wikipedia on Online machine learning What is the difference between Online Learning Algorithms and Streaming Learning Algorithms? Is there a difference between on-line learning, incremental learning and sequential learning?
