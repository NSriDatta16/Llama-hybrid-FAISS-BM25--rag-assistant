You need to pass it through a cookie , the quesrystring , or localStorage . Something like this using localStorage or cookies (localStorage is available in IE8+ and most other browsers): on the current page: if('localStorage' in window) localStorage.setItem('message', response.Message); else // use cookie On the new page: $(function(){ if('localStorage' in window && !!localStorage['message']) { ShowMessageBar(localStorage['message']); localStorage.removeItem('message'); } else // use cookie }); If you are uncomfortable with these techniques there are jquery plugins that wrap this functionality. I would recommend jstorage .
