The problem can be solved using a slightly modified paired $t$ -test in which, the null is $H_0:\mu_1 -2\mu_2 = 0$ and the alternative is $H_1:\mu_1 -2\mu_2 \neq 0$ . The procedure is thus to apply a $t$ to the difference data $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ , where $Y_i = X_{1i}-2X_{2i}$ , as noted by @whuber. The test statistic is $$\frac{\sqrt{n}\bar Y}{\sqrt{s_Y^2}}\sim t_{n-1}.$$ For this test thus you only require $s_Y^2$ , the sample variance of $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ , and of course, its sample average $\bar Y = \bar{X_1}-2\bar{X_2}$ .
