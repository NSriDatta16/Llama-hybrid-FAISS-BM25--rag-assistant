I'm designing a thick UI diagnostic tool, should it have a direct integration to PowerShell

My team and I are designing a diagnostic test tool as part of our next product. The test tool will exercise a request/response API and display asynchronous events. As part of the diagnostic tool suite, we will also be providing cmdlets for the entire product API. Is it worth embedding PowerShell execution into the tool UI ? What are other development teams doing ? The scripts can still run stand alone in any PowerShell window or tool. From a user's perspective, they would gain the ability to launch scripts from our UI. And, since the UI can be monitoring the same devices that the scripts act on, it brings some unity to the execution of a script and monitoring of the results. Embedding script execution brings more work to the project and I'm not sure how we want to handle displaying the results of the scripts. Do most PowerShell users expect to run their scripts from their own shell environments or within tools that come from their product vendors ? Note, our diagnostic tool will not be automatically generating scripts for the users as some Microsoft tools do (it might be valuable for inexperienced PowerShell users, but we are expecting most scripts to be fairly simple, like executing a command on a series of devices).
