Your problem is one of "sequence classification" for which Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) e.g. Long short-term memory (LSTM) are generally used. See here for a good example. and here for a technical paper. Here is a specialized package for sequence classification which uses convolutional neural networks (CNN). CPT algorithm, an accurate method for sequence prediction, can also be used here . A continuous output can easily be rounded to 0 or 1 to get binary result.
