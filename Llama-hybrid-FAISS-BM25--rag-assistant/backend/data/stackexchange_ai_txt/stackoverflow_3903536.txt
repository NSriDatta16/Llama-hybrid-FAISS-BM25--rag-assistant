Delphi: Organize RCData into hierarchy way

The following print screen shows list of resources file embedded into the package. Is it possible to organize the highlighted resources (SE_BUG...SY_VIEW) into hierarchy way ? What i mean here is that can I create a folder call Metadata under the folder RCData and move all the highlighted resources (SE_BUG...SY_VIEW) into the Metadata folder ? In other words, I want to achieve the highlighted resources in well organized such as the way of MainIcon folder .
