As badcat indicates in his comments, the Resources folder was merely a group within the project template. To create your own Resources group, either right-click on the project explorer view and choose New Group , or go to the menu option File | New | New Group . If you want to make sure that items which should be resources are copied into the correct location in your application bundle, you can click on the name of your project in the project explorer on the left of the screen and go to the Build Phases tab. You can expand the Copy Bundle Resources build phase (or whatever it's called in your project) and see the files that will be copied over. If something is missing, you can drag it into that list from the project explorer.
