Do you know the count of the file you are reading, or does it change each time you would run the program? There is no simple way to do it without knowing the count. Otherwise you have to read the file twice, once for the count, the 2nd for storing the new updated records. If space and memory aren't a major issue, table the entire file in working storage, then write the file back from the table, minus your last 3 records. That results in 1 time through the file and no extra reads or writes.
