Good statistical tests for mutual exclusivity

Let's say I really want the ability to distinguish two datasets. The first set $A$ has data has $N$ "mutually exclusive" data points defined as: $(x,y,z) = (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1),\dots$ The second set $B$ just has $N$ copies of the average of the first dataset: $(x,y,z) = (0.33,0.33,0.33), (0.33,0.33,0.33) \dots$ Obviously I can't distinguish these two datasets by taking the average. I can, however, distinguish these two datasets by the variance. In fact, the higher powers I sum, the better discrimination I seem to get: $$ \frac{\sum A_i^{n+1}}{\sum B_i^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{0.33^{n+1} } > \frac{1}{0.33^n}$$ Is there a standard way of thinking about problems like this? I am a little rusty on my data analysis.
