I would like to add that apart from ML libs being robust to (can handle rather) Nan values, such as XGBoost , kNN implementations, there are also missing data imputation techniques. Which once you implement them you can try any ML algorithm. However, there are a few of them and you have to see what works best. For reference, you can look at hot deck imputation .
