If you're willing to hard-code the list of Jar files, this Emacs Lisp form should suffice: (let ((base-path "/Users/smcho/.swank-clojure")) (setq swank-clojure-classpath (append swank-clojure-classpath (mapcar (lambda (d) (expand-file-name d base-path)) '("clojure-1.1.0-master-20091202.150145-1.jar" "clojure-contrib-1.1.0-master-20091212.205045-1.jar" "swank-clojure/swank-clojure-1.1.0.jar"))))) That takes your list of Jar files and adds them to the variable swank-clojure-classpath . Note that this form must be evaluated by Emacs , not SLIME's Swank. It's used by Emacs to start up the Java process that will run Clojure and Swank within it. There are more elaborate ways to set up the class path for a project, such as including Maven-style paths below a designated project root directory.
