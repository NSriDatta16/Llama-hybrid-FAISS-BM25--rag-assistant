Why OnStartDrag is called immediately? Because BeginDrag almost does nothing with Immediate and Threshold parameters (Except checking if Threshold is a negative number), and just passes them to DragInitControl in Controls unit. DragInitControl procedure first checks if DragKind is dkDrag, if it is; then it calls DoStartDrag method which invokes OnStartDrag event. Later, at the end of DragInitControl code, DragInit is called which does the actual dragging job. I don't know if this is by design, or a bug in implementing dragging in VCL. In Delphi documentation it says : If Immediate is false, the mouse pointer does not change to the value of the DragCursor property and dragging does not begin until the user moves the mouse pointer the number of pixels specified by the Threshold parameter. Also for OnStartDrag the documentation says : Occurs when the user begins to drag the control or an object it contains by left-clicking the control and holding the mouse button down. To me it means, if Immediate is False, and mouse is not moved, dragging is not started; therefore, OnStartDrag shouldn't be invoked.
