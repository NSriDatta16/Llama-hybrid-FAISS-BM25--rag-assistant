Using KNN to categorise inventory (physical stock items) - is it the best way?

I'm working on a machine learning problem involving inventory (i.e. physical retail stock), however through the cleaning (outlier removal) process some of the items (via their corresponding transactions) will be removed. Therefore, I thought of using KNN to group similar items into respective categories. There are 1245 items The info for each item is Average Weighted Price Total Quantity Sold Total Revenue Achieved Min Sold per Transaction Max Sold per Transaction Min Sell Price Max Sell Price Number of Unique Transactions Am I right in thinking that KNN is a good option - and if so, how do I decide on the number of clusters?
