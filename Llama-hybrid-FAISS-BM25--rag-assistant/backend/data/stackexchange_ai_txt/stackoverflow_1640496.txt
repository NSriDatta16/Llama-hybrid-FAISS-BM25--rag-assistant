foreach(..) { if(!myDic.ContainsKey(car.ID) || !myDic[car.ID].Contains(car.MfgID)) { continue; } // do something } If car.ID is not a key of myDic then first condition is true and there is no evaluation of 2nd condition. If car.ID is a key of myDic then the 2nd condition will be evaluated and it won't crash since the myDic[car.ID] has valid value. If you have some logic in "do something" this way is useful since it uses the good access complexity of the dictionary. If "do something" is just selecting values so the whole loop is just a filter it's more elegant to use a LINQ query.
