What color financial time series are there?

There is a folklore white noise hypothesis related to (and equivalent to some forms of) the efficient market hypothesis in finance -see references below. But are there some asset pairs whose return time series (or perhaps some "natural" transforms of those time series) are approximately noises of another color than white ? -I ask as a nonspecialist, obviously.
