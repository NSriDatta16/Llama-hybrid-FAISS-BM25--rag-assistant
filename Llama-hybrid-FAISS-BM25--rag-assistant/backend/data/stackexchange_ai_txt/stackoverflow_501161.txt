Dynamic content in windows forms

I'm working on an application that gets content from feeds in C#. This content should then be displayed on the form. My question is what control should I use to hold this data? Should I be creating a new label (dynamically) for each item? Someone suggested to me that I should use a RichTextBox but this content shouldn't be editable. If it helps, I'm a web developer. I'd normally output my content in HTML and would use headings, paragraphs etc. for my content. Am I looking at this the wrong way? If this seems like a very basic question, it probably is. I'm very new to Windows Forms. Thanks, Ross
