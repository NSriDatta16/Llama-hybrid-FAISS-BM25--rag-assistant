Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification Paper

I am trying to reproduce the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2745 that is using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture for image classification. Convolutional layer L2 (all 20 maps) is fully connected to L3 (to all 40 maps) via 800 filters. Do you know how to model this in Keras or TensorFlow?
