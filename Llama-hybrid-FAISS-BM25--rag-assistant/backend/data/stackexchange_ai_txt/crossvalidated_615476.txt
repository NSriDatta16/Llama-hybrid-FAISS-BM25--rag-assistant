Is every coordinate-wise marginal of a proper joint distribution also proper?

Suppose that we have a probability density function $\pi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ which is the density of a vector-valued random variable $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Here the density is proper, i.e., $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \pi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) dx_1 \ldots dx_n = 1 . Without any additional restrictions on the joint density, does this imply that any coordinate-wise marginal density of the form $$ \pi(x_i) = \int \pi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) dx_1 \ldots dx_{i-1} dx_{i+1} \ldots dx_n $$ is also proper, i.e., that $\int_{\mathbb{R}} \pi(x_i) dx_i = 1 for any $1 \leq i \leq n$ ? The motivation for this question is that I am considering a hierarchical Bayesian model involving an improper prior, and although I know that the posterior density over all model parameters is proper, I have seemingly found a marginal that is not proper (although this may be an error in my analytic computation). Intuitively, I would expect that any marginal of a proper joint should also be proper?
