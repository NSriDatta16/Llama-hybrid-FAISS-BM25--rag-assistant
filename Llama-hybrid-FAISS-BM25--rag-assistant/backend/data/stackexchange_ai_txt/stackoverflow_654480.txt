Is there a Java Collection (or similar) that behaves like an auto-id SQL table?

Note that I'm not actually doing anything with a database here, so ORM tools are probably not what I'm looking for. I want to have some containers that each hold a number of objects, with all objects in one container being of the same class. The container should show some of the behaviour of a database table, namely: allow one of the object's fields to be used as a unique key, i. e. other objects that have the same value in that field are not added to the container. upon accepting a new object, the container should issue a numeric id that is returned to the caller of the insertion method. Instead of throwing an error when a "duplicate entry" is being requested, the container should just skip insertion and return the key of the already existing object. Now, I would write a generic container class that accepts objects which implement an interface to get the value of the key field and use a HashMap keyed with those values as the actual storage class. Is there a better approach using existing built-in classes? I was looking through HashSet and the like, but they didn't seem to fit.
