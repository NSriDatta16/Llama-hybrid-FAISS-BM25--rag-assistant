Encoding a time series with varying time differences as an image

There are methods to encode a time series into an 'image' i.e a matrix of scalar values. Some methods include recurrence plots , gramian angular field and markov transition field . Most methods assume some correlation / similarity between past values and future values for discernible patterns in the image. I have only seen these image encoding methods applied to time series with constant time difference between samples e.g. $\Delta t = $ 1 second, 1 minute, 1 day. My question is, is it possible to apply these methods to time series that have varying time difference between samples? For example, if we have a process sampled at times 18:52:07, 18:53:18, 18:53:19, 19:05:04 etc. the difference between sampled times varies.
