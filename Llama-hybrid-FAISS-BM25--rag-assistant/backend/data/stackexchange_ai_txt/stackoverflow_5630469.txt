Compiling From Source vs. Pre-compiled Windows Binaries

So in the past I've always used the pre-compiled Windows PHP binaries but then this guide caught my attention. That brings me to this: Why would someone want to compile PHP from the sources when the binaries are available for them? Is there a performance bonus I should be aware of? If so, is it a significant enough amount that I should take notice? For reference, I use PHP for mostly CLI applications mainly for bulk data processing and some website info collection. My system specs: Windows 7 x64, 6gb RAM, Intel Q6600 (2.4gHz x 4).
