How to implement mouse dragging in Visual Basic?

I need to create a quick-n-dirty knob control in Visual Basic 2005 Express, the value of which is incremented/decremented by "grabbing" it with the mouse and moving the cursor up/down. Because the knob itself doesn't move, I need to keep tracking the mouse movement outside of the rectangle of the control. I use a Label with an ImageList to implement this (I have a list of 127 bitmaps representing the knob in various positions). Which events should I react to?
