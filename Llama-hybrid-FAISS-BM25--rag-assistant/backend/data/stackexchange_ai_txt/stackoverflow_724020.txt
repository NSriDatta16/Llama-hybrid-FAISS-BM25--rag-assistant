It depends on the complexity of what you want to do. PHP, as mentioned by almost every poster, is just great for server side web development, the simple stuff is simple the complex is handled reasonably well. PHP syntax is C like and logically consistant -- you will hardly ever need to refer to the syntax section of the excellent documentation. However php just serves up pages, you will need to learn HTML, CSS and probably some Javascript to put in those pages. I personally made the mistake of thinking Javascript was just another basic scripting language and missed out on the power, elegance and possibilties that JavaScript can bring for several years. Almost all the interactive good stuff you see in sites like gmail and stackoverflow is down to Javascript. Likewise almost all the "cool" visual presentation on these sites is down to CSS. For extremly complex back end stuff (especially if you need to keep state between pages) you may be better off with Java and assorted frameworks (Tomcat or Jetty, plus Spring with Freemarker templates, and IBATIS is my personal winning combo!). The problem here is there is a steep learning curve to this and you only want to go there if you really need the power of a Java back end.
