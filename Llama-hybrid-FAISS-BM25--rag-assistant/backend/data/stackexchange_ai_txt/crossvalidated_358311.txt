Is it possible to do Fizz Buzz in deep learning?

After reading a joke Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow , I am curious to know if it is possible to do such simple task correctly with deep learning. Any theoretical explanation for the reason we can or we cannot? It is modulo operation, if we can do Fizz Buzz, maybe deep learning also can be used in number theory, such as finding prime numbers?
