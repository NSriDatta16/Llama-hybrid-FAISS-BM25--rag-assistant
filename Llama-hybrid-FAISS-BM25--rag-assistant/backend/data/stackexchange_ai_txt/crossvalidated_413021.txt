Interpretation of Eigenvalue vs. Singular Value plot

I'm doing some preliminary analysis on the feature matrix for a certain dataset (rows are observations, columns are feature dimensions). I have computed the SVD and PCA decompositions for this matrix using the below python code; # SVD decomposition u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(mdl.feature_mat, full_matrices=False) # PCA decomposition covmat = mdl.feature_mat.T.dot(mdl.feature_mat) evs, evmat = np.linalg.eig(covmat) I then plotted the (sorted descending) relative magnitudes of the singular/eigen values. This gives me the following plot; Clearly, many of the features in this matrix are redundant, and the signal (if any) is being carried by only a few orthogonal dimensions. My question is this; How am I to interpret the fact that the relative singular value magnitudes have a wider tail than the relative eigenvalue magnitudes? What is the physical interpretation / difference between singular and eigen-values?
