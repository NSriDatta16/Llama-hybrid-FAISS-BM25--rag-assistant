I had a similar problem with scrolling a GridView and after refreshing the underlying data, noticing that the scoll was not reset to the beginning. I solved it with the following code fragment gvKeys.setSelection(0); I'm guessing that if you know the number of items in your grid, N , that the following will work: gvKeys.setSelection(N);
