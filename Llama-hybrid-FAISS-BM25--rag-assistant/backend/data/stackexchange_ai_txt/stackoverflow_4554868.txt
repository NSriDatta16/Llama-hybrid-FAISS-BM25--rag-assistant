Your controller can add objects to the Model and Spring will add them to the HTTPRequest as attributes, is that what you mean? Including a jsp fragment doesn't affect that, your jsp fragment can access the request attributes. Otherwise it's unclear to me what you mean by "passing some logic to the page".
