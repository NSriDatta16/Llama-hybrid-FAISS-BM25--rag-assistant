check lingpipe implementation http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/docs/api/com/aliasi/sentences/IndoEuropeanSentenceModel.html Their model quite powerful, and easy to implement - check few pre/post rules(aka regexps) at any possible sentence split and thats all. I found it working better then one in GATE and OpenNLP. There are another open source project which support this heuristic model as example, http://code.google.com/p/graph-expression/wiki/SentenceSplitting
