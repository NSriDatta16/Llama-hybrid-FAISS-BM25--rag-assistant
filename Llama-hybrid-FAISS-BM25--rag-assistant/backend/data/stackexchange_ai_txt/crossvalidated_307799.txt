Is it required to split the data into train and test set in Artificial Neural Networks?

I'm new to deep learning and missed some intuition while learning Artificial Neural Network model building. When I consider some Supervised ML's like linear regression, Naive Bayes or SVM etc, we split the dataset into training and test data set (lets keep the validation set concept aside for a while). Model is built from patterns learnt from training dataset and then model is applied to test dataset to check the accuracy of the model. But when we consider ANNs, the output layer will compare the predicted value (y-hat) of every observation (every row) with the actual value (y) and calculates the cost function and adjusts the weights accordingly. So is it required to split the data into training set and test set and check the accuracy of the model performance in Deep learning? Please correct me if i'm wrong. Went through this link . But didn't help.
