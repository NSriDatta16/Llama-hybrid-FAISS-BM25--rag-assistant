Distribution for average of multiple binomial proportions

Assume we have a population $N$ and a proportion $p$ of that population with a characteristic of interest. Both $N$ and $p$ are unknown. Furthermore, assume that we have $k$ random samples $(n_i, x_i)$ of $N$ from which we can estimate the proportion of interest $\hat{p}_i = x_i/n_i$ for each sample, with $i=1,\ldots,k$ . Additionally, $n_i$ and $x_i$ are large enough so that the CLT kicks in and we can say that, with $\mathbb{E}[\hat{p}_i]=p$ and $\mathbb{V}[\hat{p}_i]=\frac{p(1-p)}{n_i}$ , then $\hat{p}_i\sim\mathcal{N}\left(p,\frac{p(1-p)}{n_i}\right)$ . I am interested in the behavior (especially towards the right tail) of $\bar{p}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k \hat{p}_i$ . So far, the approach I have thought of is the following: since each $\hat{p}_i$ is normally distributed, then their average $\bar{p}$ also follows a normal distribution since the arithmetic average is just a weighted sum where the weight is constant. More specifically, $$\bar{p}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k \hat{p}_i \sim\mathcal{N}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^kp,\frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{p(1-p)}{n_i}\right) \equiv \mathcal{N}\left(p,\frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{p(1-p)}{n_i}\right)$$ My questions are: Is my line of reasoning correct regarding the distributions, both of individual $\hat{p}_i$ and the resulting $\bar{p}$ ? Since we do not know the true value $p$ , is it reasonable to substitute it with corresponding $\hat{p}_i$ in the calculations? For the last step, this would result to $$ \bar{p} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k\hat{p}_i, \frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\hat{p}_i (1-\hat{p}_i)}{n_i} \right) \equiv \mathcal{N}\left(\bar{p}, \frac{1}{k^2}\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\hat{p}_i (1-\hat{p}_i)}{n_i} \right) $$ This approach seemed reasonable to me because we "know" (under some assumptions) the distribution of each component $\hat{p}_i$ , and therefore of $\bar{p}$ itself, but if someone has a different proposal on quantifying the (right) tail behavior of $\bar{p}$ , please feel free to share it. EDIT : some background and clarifications This is an important topic for banks when modeling credit risk. In this context, we have a sample of obligors, size $n_i$ , of which $x_i$ have defaulted, and $i$ here represents one year. So if we have $k$ years of data $\{(x_i,n_i)\}_{i=1}^k$ , we can calculate the observed (or estimated) probabilities of default experienced each year, $\hat{p}_i = x_i/n_i$ , $i=1,\ldots,k$ . We consider the $n_i$ to be a random sample each time it is chosen. If the standard constraints about the relationship between $n_i$ and $p_i$ are fulfilled (i.e. $p_i$ is not too close to either $0$ or $1$ , $n_i$ is above some threshold for CLT to apply, etc.), then we can approximate the distribution of each $p_i$ through the normal approximation as mentioned above. From a regulatory point of view, the behavior of $\bar{p} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k \hat{p}_i$ is of particular interest.
