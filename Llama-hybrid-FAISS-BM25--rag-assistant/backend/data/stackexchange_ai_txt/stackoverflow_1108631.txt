A library such as this must be able to parse an arbitrary language fragment , and then compute the complexity metrics over the parsed fragment. Most metrics tools have at best a parser for the entire language, not just a fragment, so you are likely to be hard pressed to find many solutions. There is one system that can provide you what you need: our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit. It provides parsers for many languages (such as Java and C#; it is unclear what language you want to analyze). DMS has been used already to implement these kinds of metrics for several langauges (Java, C#, JavaScript, COBOL) and the process of doing this is straigtforward. And DMS does parse langauge fragments , and amazingly, the metrics implementation actually operate on such fragments. You could customize DMS to implement exactly what you want.
