Steve Scott here. I wrote the bsts package. I have a few suggestions for you. First, your seasonal components aren't doing what you think they are. I think you have daily data, because you're trying to add a 7 season component, which should be working correctly. But you've told your annual seasonal component to repeat every 12 days. Getting a monthly seasonal component with daily data is kind of hard to do, but you can do a 52 week seasonal by AddSeasonal(..., nseasons = 52, season.duration = 7) . The seasonal.duration argument tells the model how many time points each season should last for. The nseasons argument tells it how many seasons are in a cycle. The total number of time points in a cycle is season.duration * nseasons . The second suggestion is that you might want to think about a different model for trend. The LocalLinearTrend model is very flexible, but this flexibility can show up as undesired variance in long term forecasts. There are some other trend models that contain a bit more structure. GeneralizedLocalLinearTrend (sorry about the nondescriptive name) assumes the "slope" component of trend is an AR1 process instead of a random walk. It is my default option if I want to forecast far into the future. Most of your time series variation seems to come from seasonality, so you might try AddLocalLevel or even AddAr instead of AddLocalLinearTrend . Finally, in general if you're getting strange forecasts, and you want to figure out which part of the model is to blame, try plot(model, "components") to see the model decomposed into the individual pieces you've requested.
