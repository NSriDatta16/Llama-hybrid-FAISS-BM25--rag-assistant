Because Subversion's repository format is entirely internal, they are free to change the representation from one revision to the next. I believe the current revision generally stores reverse deltas (your option 2), but also stores complete snapshots periodically so it doesn't have to resolve 1000 diffs before returning a result. The Subversion 1.6 release notes has a section on Filesystem storage improvements that has some notes on this, and links to other sources. Suffice to say that the details of Subversion data storage are complex and subject to change. There is also a design document in the Subversion source tree that describes the use of skip deltas in Subversion . Generally, the /notes/ directory contains several useful documents regarding Subversion internals.
