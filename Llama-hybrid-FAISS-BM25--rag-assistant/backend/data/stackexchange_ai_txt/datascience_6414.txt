Scalable open source machine learning library written in python

I believe sci kit learn is written in python,however that not scalable.Spark mlib or ml is scalabale but written in scala.I am looking for an ongoing effort where a machine learning library is being built in python (available in github or so) so that I can contribute to that.Is anyone aware of such effort.
