Well, fun and easy would presumably go together. By reputation, Symbian OS C++ is the hardest platform to develop for but most people who spread this are not up to date on the latest initiatives to fix the issue. It will probably still be true for a little while. I would say Android has a huge advantage over iPhone in terms of fun, at the very least because of openness and linux core. J2ME and blackberry are not supported well enough and too fragmented to be either fun or easy. PalmOs is dead and WebOS is not there just yet. I would still suggest using a very recent Symbian phone mostly because of the sheer diversity of development runtimes available : nsbasic, .net, ruby, python, j2me, c++, c, webkit, opera widgets... It will be even better soon when the whole platform is open sourced.
