can cross-validation solve the issue of confidence interval interpretation?

I want to approach a true parameter value, and my chances of obtaining it, but I struggle to accept the subjectivity of bayesian credible intervals just as much as I can't see the value of a normal interpretation of confidence intervals. does cross-validation aid me in the endeavor? I have also read that the parameter is fixed and the confidence interval random, what does this mean? I know that the sample estimate approaches population values given CLT, but not much more.
