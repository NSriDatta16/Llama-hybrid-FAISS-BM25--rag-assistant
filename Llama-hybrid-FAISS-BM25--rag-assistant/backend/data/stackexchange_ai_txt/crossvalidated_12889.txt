Data mining can be descriptive or predictive. On the one hand, if you are interested in descriptive data mining, then machine learning won't help. On the other hand, if you are interested in predictive data mining, then machine learning will help you understand that you try to minimize the unknown risk (expectation of the loss function) when minimizing the empirical risk: you will keep in mind overfitting, generalization error and cross-validation. For instance, for a matter of consistency, the $k$-NN for a training sample of size $n$ should be such that: $k$ goes to infinity when $n$ goes to infinity, $\frac{k}{n}$ goes to 0 when $n$ goes to infinity.
