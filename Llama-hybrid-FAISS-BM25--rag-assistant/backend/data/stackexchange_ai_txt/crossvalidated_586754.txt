Bayesian or Frequentist goodnes of fit: depends on the data?

I'm working with the data of the real masses of exoplanets published in the catalogues (NASA, exoplanet.eu). Those catalogues update almost everyday by adding new exoplanet data or correcting some of data already published (because of the precision or anything else). I need to set the probability density function (PDF) of the masses of the planets. In Frequentist statistics I must make use the data for estimating (using maximun likelihood estimation, for example) the parameters of the proposed PDF, make an histogram and use the frequencies for a fitting test like chi-square test for fitting data. Considering that every week the catalogues have more exoplanet data, the PDF of the masses may change... or remain the same. So, must I use Bayesian methods for fitting the data? In that case, how do I have to do it? As I understand, in Bayesian Statistics I have to suppose something about the sample (a priori PDF) and use the Bayesian methods for finding what I'm looking for (a posteriori PDF). How can I set the a priori PDF?
