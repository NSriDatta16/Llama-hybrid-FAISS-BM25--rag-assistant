How to perform feature selection on dataset with categorical and numerical features?

I am working on a dataset with 30 columns (29 numerical, 1 non-ordinal categorical). I hot-encoded the categorical feature and reached at 35 columns. To improve training efficiency, I want to perform feature selection on my dataset. However , I am confused with how to handle a dataset with categorical and numerical features combined. I read that it is not reasonable to apply PCA on dummies given they are discrete. Is it reasonable to apply PCA first on numerical features then concatenate them with dummies? I tried to implement recursive feature elemination with cross-validation (RFECV) to the entire feature space. But I don't think it is reasonable to remove some but not all dummy features given they are generated out of one category. Any suggestions? Any help is appreciated. python pandas scikit-learn feature-selection
