many people do if(0 == var) for literal numbers, because 0 = x; is a compiler error. For if(a = b) , I don't know any general solution. Edit: take GMan's advice and please don't actually adopt this style; it's ugly, hard to read, and totally unnecessarily if you just compile with warnings. Another example of ways to avoid typos is putting braces in for/while/if blocks. I have seen: if(x) doSomething(); somethingElse(); cause problems for example if the dev wasnt paying attention, had tabs/spaces screwed up so indentation was wrong or whatever. Removing the doSomething() line, or adding stuff to the if() block requires changes on other lines. Safer is: if(x) { doSomething(); } somethingElse();
