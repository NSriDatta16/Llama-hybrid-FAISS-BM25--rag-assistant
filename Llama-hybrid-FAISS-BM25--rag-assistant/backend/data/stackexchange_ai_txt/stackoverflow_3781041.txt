This isn't really a class you want, it's data. Why not use a hashmap? I really dislike "Bean" style classes--they encourage bad coding (there is no place in a generated class to put actual code, so everything ends up being manipulated by external code anyway). You can just load a hashmap from your XML and inject it into a real object--that way you don't have to worry about actually passing a hash around, you are passing a real object with real business methods and real type safety--it just HAPPENS to use a hashmap internally to store data instead of member variables. I've done a lot more than this, but at some point you realize Hibernate does everything you want for you.
