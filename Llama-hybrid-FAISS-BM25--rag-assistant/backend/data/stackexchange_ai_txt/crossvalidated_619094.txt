I think it should first be noted that ISS is essentially an engineered feature, and one that has been engineered by someone else, for someone else's purposes. If you don't have access to the data it is engineered from, then you are stuck with it, but if you do, then you should consider whether the underlying data is more useful. Second, there is in some sense no such thing as a continuous variable, unless you're doing data science on an analog computer. Any digital device has a finite number of outputs. The discrete/continuous distinction really comes down to the number of possible states: if you have a handful of states, it's discrete, if you have millions of states, it's continuous. 44 states is a judgment call. I would lean towards treating it as discrete. As for whether it's ordinal, the connection between intervals and the underlying measured is so indirect that there isn't a clear reason to think it's cardinal, so you should default to ordinal. But really, these labels are about what helps your model the most, not any transcendent ontological reality. If you're doing hypothesis testing, then what type of variable it is is part of the null hypothesis and thus can play a part in calculating p-values. But for prediction models, if treating it as discrete results in a better model, you should treat it as discrete, and if treating it as continuous results in a better model, you should treat it as continuous. The same goes for ordinal versus cardinal.
