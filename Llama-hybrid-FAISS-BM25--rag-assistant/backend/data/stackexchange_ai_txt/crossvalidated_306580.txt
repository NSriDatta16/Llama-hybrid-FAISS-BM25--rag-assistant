A residual generally measures the distance between your observed data and what you expect, given your fitted model. Distance can be measured in a number of ways, and thus there are different residual definitions. For the linear regression, the most common way is to simply plot the distance between the mean expectation and the observation. This makes sense because the adequacy of the residuals is easily checked visually, as the assumptions of the linear regression imply normal, symmetric, homogenous residuals with constant variance. For other (discrete) distributions (including the ZINB case), a visual check of raw residuals is less useful, as variance and shape of the distributions usually change with the mean, plus there is the problem of assessing the distribution of discrete values. For such models, better suitable than raw residuals are Pearson and deviance residuals, which can also be used for zero-inflated models. However, with strong zero-inflation, they will not appear homogenous either. The "gold standard" imo are are (simulated) quantile residuals, which are also called Bayesian p-values in Bayesian statistics. See an example with a Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson here . I think this would be the best for your ZINB regression, although this would probably require a bit of coding by hand. Regarding your specific questions: I guess what you are asking is if you can make zero-inflation dependent on a predictor? The answer is yes. Yes, you can look at residuals to check for that, but if you want to see an effect of school, it would be much more straightforward to simply include school as a fixed or random effect and look at the estimates.
