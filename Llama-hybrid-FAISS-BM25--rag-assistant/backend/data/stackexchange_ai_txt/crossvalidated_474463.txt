The regression coeffecient of SES in the multinomial logistic regression is 1.0324, but which category of 'mathach' does the coefficient refer to? how to interpret it? Both, because your model has SES as both a random and fixed effect. If I want to make predictions with individual having SES=0.5 and come from School 1224, how do to do that? You would call the predict() function, passing the fitted model object and a data frame with SES of 0.5 and SchoolID of 1224
