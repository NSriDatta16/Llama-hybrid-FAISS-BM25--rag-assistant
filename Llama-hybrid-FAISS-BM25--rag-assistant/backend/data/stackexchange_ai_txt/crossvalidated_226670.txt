How to report neural network training results

I'm writing on my first scientific paper and I'm a little bit lost how to report my results: I have trained a neural network to identify a disease risk group from genetic data. In a monte-carlo simulation the results of my training processes are a little bit unstable over different training \ test samples: Accuracy: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.47 0.69 0.77 0.76 0.83 0.94 ROC-AUC: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.29 0.57 0.79 0.72 0.88 0.96 Overall I'm very happy with the results but how should I report those results? Should I discuss a single model \ test \ training sample combination more closely? If so, which? Do you have tips, what to avoid in any case? Thanks in advance!
