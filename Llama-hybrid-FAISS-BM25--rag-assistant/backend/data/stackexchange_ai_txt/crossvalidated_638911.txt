The method mentioned by Stephan Kolassa is called Additive Log-Ratio Transformation (alr). For an overview of compositional data analysis, see my answer to R - multinomial logistic regression with relative frequencies as response variable . There are a few other transformation, such as Centered Log-Ratio Transformation (clr) and Isometric Log-Ratio Transformation (ilr). Since your objective is to forecast time series, common methods for cross-sectional compositional data, such as fractional multinomial logit models and Dirichlet regression, may not be a good choice. Since your proportions come from integer values with their total known, you can conduct hierarchical forecast of the raw values by allocating a total to three components, which is also featured in the forecast package, instead of the derived proportions. See https://otexts.com/fpp3/hierarchical.html . From the forecast raw values, you can derive forecast proportions.
