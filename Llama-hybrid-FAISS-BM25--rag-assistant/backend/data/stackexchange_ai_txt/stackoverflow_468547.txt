Ok, couple of things. Firstly, you don't need to say "== true" for booleans. Secondly, in general don't use "==false" use "!" (the NOT symbol), but in your case just use an "else" if(pickedUp){ trace("released and picked up" + pickedUpNum); this.storedClick = false; this.onMouseMove = null; this.onMouseDown = null; this.onMouseUp = null; this.onEnterFrame = this.refresh; pickedUpNum++; if( pickedUpNum > 60) pickedUp = false; } else { trace("released and not picked up"); this.storedClick = false; this.onEnterFrame = this.refresh; this.onMouseDown = this.onStoreDrag; this.onMouseUp = this.onClearStoreDrag; this.onMouseMove = null; }
