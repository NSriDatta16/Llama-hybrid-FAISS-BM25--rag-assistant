Considering your data (The sample you show above) I would suggest tbats() function from forecast package in R. Because your data might have hourly as well as daily seasonality which suggests us to use "TBATS model (Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components)" References: De Livera, A.M., Hyndman, R.J., & Snyder, R. D. (2011), Forecasting time series with complex seasonal patterns using exponential smoothing, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 106(496) Or you could use Dynamic harmonic regression.
