How to enable HTML client-side SQL database in embedded webkit app (test app on github)

I've got a super simple little OS X app with a minimal embedded webkit view that needs client-side SQL database support enabled. I've put the test app up on github but just can't get the client-side storage working. I'm using Xcode v3.2.3 with the WebKit framework it provides, but have also tried using the webkit nightly without luck. I'm setting the preferences via a 'web' outlet: WebPreferences *prefs = [web preferences]; [prefs _setLocalStorageDatabasePath:@"/tmp"]; [prefs _setLocalStorageDatabasePath:@"/tmp"]; [prefs setDatabasesEnabled:YES]; [prefs setLocalStorageEnabled:YES]; [prefs setDeveloperExtrasEnabled:YES]; If anyone could fork the app on github or point out what else I need to be doing, it'd be very much appreciated :)
