MAP is mode of the posterior distribution, as noticed in the comments, it does not have to be a reasonable estimate to consider. Likely, you can see MAP in the tutorials, because they want to show different possible functionalities of their software, rather then the most methodologically sound solution. In some cases it may be reasonable to use MAP as a starting point for sampling, since this enables sampler to start at a reasonable starting point, what should give you the reasonable samples faster, then if started from completely random initialization. Notice however that this does not have to work, for example PyMC3 documentation discourages using MAP as an initialization for NUTS sampler and uses different form of initialization as a default. So definitely this is not a one-size-fit-all solution.
