My Intuipic application allows users to delete images, too. I had to write this converter to achieve it. Relevant code: //create new stream and create bitmap frame BitmapImage bitmapImage = new BitmapImage(); bitmapImage.BeginInit(); bitmapImage.StreamSource = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); bitmapImage.DecodePixelWidth = (int) _decodePixelWidth; bitmapImage.DecodePixelHeight = (int) _decodePixelHeight; //load the image now so we can immediately dispose of the stream bitmapImage.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; bitmapImage.EndInit(); //clean up the stream to avoid file access exceptions when attempting to delete images bitmapImage.StreamSource.Dispose();
