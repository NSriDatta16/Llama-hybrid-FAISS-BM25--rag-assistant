We did a reading group on the paper Total Variation Regularization for fMRI-Based Prediction of Behavior . The Total Variation (TV) norm is just the $L_1$ norm of the gradient, so it looks for sparse subsets (in this case brain regions) of features. Looking at it deeper, the actual implementation required a complicated form of the regulariser, as it required that the edges of the brain were respected etc. More generally I think this is a) very common and b) the right way to approach problems, assuming that you are using optimisation methods. When you're designing a regulariser, you're effectively defining the equivalent of a Bayesian Prior. Hence you are putting domain knowledge into the problem, which allows you to infer more from your data.
