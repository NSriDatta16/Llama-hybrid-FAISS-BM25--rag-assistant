In my opinion, when you are still learning, you should allow yourself to be exposed to many topics but focus more detailed effort (i.e. course selection, projects) on something that really interests you. Don't be overly influenced by the flavour-of-the-month. If you really master and dive deep into one specialized branch of analysis, you'll find learning the next one much easier as you'll be able to anchor yourself in that initial area you found personally interesting. The same principles will come up over and over, even if the terminology might be different from one branch to another. In practice, I have found the data dictates the approach. No, you can't master everything, but if you know the existence of different approaches, and have that initial strong foundation in something , you'll be well equipped to "master" other approaches in the future and choose them appropriately. Graduate school will generally proceed such that you'll come out the other side with this ability. "Cancer analytics", and "machine learning" for that matter, are pretty broad terms but, yes, different variations of those two things come together in many different ways and is an extremely active area with more than enough room for keen initiates.
