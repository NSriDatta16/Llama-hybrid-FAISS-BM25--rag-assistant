Algorithm for piecing together a sequence from multiple fragments

I am working on a real-time embedded system. I am trying to create a detailed timing analysis. I have collected runtime data, recording the start and stop time of each interrupt. Each burst of data looks something like this ISR# time ----- ---- 1 34 end 44 4 74 3 80 end 93 end 97 ... My output channel has limited bandwidth, and my high precision timer overflows a word very quickly, so I am collecting data in ~150 microsecond bursts, then trickling it out over time. From this data I have been able to collect the time spent in each interupt, and the number of calls and pre-emptions. What I would like to do is put together the complete execution sequence for a typical frame, which is ~2 ms long. It occurs to me that this is almost like a gene-sequencing problem. I have a few thousand fragments, each covering 7% of the total frame. I should be able to line them up - match the portions which cover the same part of the frame - in such a way that I can construct a single sequence of events for the whole period. There will be some frame-to-frame variations, but I am hoping that these can be accounted for in a best-match type of algorithm. So my question is: What algorithms exist to do this kind of sequencing? Are there any existing tools not targeted to DNA or Protiens?
