Why can't I download a whole image file with urllib2.urlopen()

When I run the following code, it only seems to be downloading the first little bit of the file and then exiting. Occassionally, I will get a 10054 error, but usually it just exits without getting the whole file. My internet connection is crappy wireless, and I often get broken downloads on larger files in firefox, but my browser has no problem getting a 200k image file. I'm new to python, and programming in general, so I'm wondering what nuance I'm missing. import urllib2 xkcdpic=urllib2.urlopen("http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/literally.png") xkcdpicfile=open("C:\\Documents and Settings\\John Gann\\Desktop\\xkcd.png","w") while 1: chunk=xkcdpic.read(4028) if chunk: print chunk xkcdpicfile.write(chunk) else: break
