Choice of prior and combination with likelihood, sample from exp distribution

I am taking a course in Statistical Theory of Science. We have an exercise where we are comparing "Classical" and Bayesian parameter estimation. We have a sample $(x_1,...,x_5) = (0.28,0.30,0.94,0.42,1.76)$ from an exponential distribution with parameter $\theta$ , the pdf is given as $$f(x|\theta) =\theta e^{-\theta x}, \quad \theta, x > 0$$ We need to estimate $\theta$ by choosing an appropriate prior, combining it with the likelihood and estimating it from the posterior distribution. My question is about the prior, what would be appropriate ? My guess is that it should be a Gamma distribution based on the fact that our parameter exists in $\mathbb{R}^+$ . Is this correct? If the above is correct, am I supposed to add a guess for the parameters in the Gamma? Or should they stay as variables? How do I interpret "combine with the likelihood", is this the calculation of the posterior?
