Depending on the router you use, chances are pretty good that you could get it directly from the router. Most of them have a web interface, so it would be a matter of navigating to the correct web page (e.g., "192.168.0.1/whatever") and "scraping" the external IP address from that page. The problem with this is, of course, that it's pretty fragile -- if you change (or even re-configure) your router, chances are pretty good that it'll break.
