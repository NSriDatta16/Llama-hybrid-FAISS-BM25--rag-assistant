What is the programming paradigm of Dtrace?

I've been using Dtrace for a while, and as time goes by I've began to wonder what's the programming paradigm of the D language used in Dtrace. It's not an imperative language, I guess, so that means it's some sort of declarative functional language, but I'm no expert in language taxonomy, so what should the D language officially (or semi-officially) be classified as?
