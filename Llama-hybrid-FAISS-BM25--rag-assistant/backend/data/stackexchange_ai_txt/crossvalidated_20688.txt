It is not clear what you exactly calculated. The time series is clearly trending down. Logging the data and then taking the differences gives a good approximation to the percentage changes. We would find from your numbers that the average rate of change in infant mortality is -3.41%. Variance of these rate numbers is not close to what you report. It doesn't seem that the 60449.1376 number is the variance of the original series. If it was, then it would be a meaningless number. Any descriptive statistic (mean or variance) is fairly meaningless in the presence of a nonstationary process in the sense the statistics have no predictive value.
