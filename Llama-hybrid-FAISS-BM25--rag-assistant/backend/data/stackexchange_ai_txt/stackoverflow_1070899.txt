I wrote a blog post on just this a few months ago: http://elegantcode.com/2009/04/29/unit-testingmocking-on-net-cf/ Anyway, RhinoMocks, Moq, and TypeMock do not work on .netcf. Stubs from PEX (a Microsoft Research project) can work in theory, but is not there yet. The key is to make stub classes instead of Mock classes (google search "Mocks are not Stubs")
