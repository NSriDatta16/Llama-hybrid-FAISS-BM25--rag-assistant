Get list of new/changed java methods

I've reworded the question to make it more generic; the original wording is below. How would I get a list of the new/changed methods, either from two java source snapshots, or from a diff of them? Update 1 I found this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javadiff/ . Unfortunatelly it only tracks changes in the interface - I want to know if the implementation has changed. Update 2 The Eclipse "Java Structure Compare" is good, but it does not have a option to export this information to a file. Original Title: Check all new/changed methods are covered Original Details: We are using an svn branch per functional change, and EMMA to get coverage. I hope to filter this coverage, in order to check all the new/changed methods are covered before we merge it into the trunk. How do I get a list of the new/changed methods in the branch, in a similar format to EMMA? (It's not good enough just to do an svn diff, as I want to automate filtering). N.B. We use an xslt to transform the EMMA xml output to csv. Here's an example showing one method covered and another not covered: #package,class,method,coverage "company.project.helloworld","Car","getModel (): String","0% (0/1)" "company.project.helloworld","Car","setModel (String): void","100% (1/1)"
