Python code for Earth mover's Distance

I am looking for an Earth Mover's distance(or Fast EMD) implementation in python. Any clues on where to find it, I have looked enough on the web. I want to use it in an image retrieval project that I am doing. Thanks. EDIT: I found a very nice solution using the pulp libararies . This page also has the instruction required to set it up.
