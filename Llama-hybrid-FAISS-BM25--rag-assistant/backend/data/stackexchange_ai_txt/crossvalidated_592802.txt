Do Bayesian Network perfect maps need to be chordal?

In Probabilistic Graphical Models by Koller and Friedman , there is a proposition - The PDAG $\mathcal K$ returned by Build-PDAG is necessarily chordal. Build-PDAG is an algorithm that builds the equivalence-class-PDAG for the perfect map, if one exists. My confusion is with the definition of chordal graph. If a PDAG is chordal, when its undirected version is chordal (which is the definition the text also gives), it implies that a perfect map of below type is not possible. Whence my question - do BN perfect maps need to be chordal. However, if chordal graph is only for undirected graphs, then the above theorem is appropriate. The loop $A-B-X-C-A$ will definitely contain an immorality and hence the edges for the immorality will become oriented by Build-PDAG.
