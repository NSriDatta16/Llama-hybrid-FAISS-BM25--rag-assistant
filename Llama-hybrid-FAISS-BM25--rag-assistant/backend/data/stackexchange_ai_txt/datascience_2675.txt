Sheldon is correct, this sounds like a fairly typical use case for supervised classification. If all of your customer complaints are either software or hardware (i.e., zero individual complaints cover both categories, and zero are outside these two classes), then all you need is a binary classifier, which makes things simpler than they otherwise could be. If you're looking for a Java-based NLP toolkit that supports something like this, you should check out the Stanford Classifier -- it's licensed as open source software under the GPL. Their wiki page should help you get started using the classifier -- keep in mind that you'll need to manually annotate a large sample of your data as a training set, as Sheldon mentioned.
