I think I know where you are coming from, and so I will recommend Statistical Rethinking , by Richard McElreath, since it helped me so much. It only assumes you are decently familiar with linear regression and at least some math. It explains theories very clearly, elaborating on them as needed with pedagogical (read: excellent ) examples, that also demonstrate the limits of all statistical models (which I think is crucial), and is decently thorough. Toward the middle you'll learn about the exponential family of distributions and the models they each define, and why to use them. The only drawback to this book is that it does not go into time series models, since they are not its focus.
