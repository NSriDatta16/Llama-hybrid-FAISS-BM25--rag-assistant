jQuery - draggable images on iPad / iPhone - how to integrate event.preventDefault();?

I use jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery mobile to build a web application for iPhone / iPad. Now I create images and they should be draggable, so I did this: Drag - Test $(document).ready(function() { $(".draggable").draggable(); }); Here you can see the live example: http://jsbin.com/igena4/ The problem is, that the whole page want to scroll. I searched in Apple's HTML5 examples and found this to prevent the scrolling of the page, so that the image is draggable: ... onDragStart: function(event) { // stop page from panning on iPhone/iPad - we're moving a note, not the page event.preventDefault(); ... } But the problem is for me, how can I include this into my jQuery? Where do I get event ? Best Regards.
