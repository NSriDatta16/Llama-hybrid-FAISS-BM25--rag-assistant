How to Catch an exception in a using block with .NET 2.0?

I'm trying to leverage the using block more and more these days when I have an object that implements IDisposable but one thing I have not figured out is how to catch an exception as I would in a normal try/catch/finally ... any code samples to point me in the right direction? Edit: The question was modified after reading through the replies. It was "How to Throw an exception in a using block with .NET 2.0?" but I was actually looking for a way to catch these exceptions inside a using block. I'm looking for more detail on rolling my own catching block inside a using block. Edit: What I wanted to avoid is having to use a try/catch/finally inside my using block like @Blair showed. But maybe this is a non issue... Edit: @Blair, this is exactly what I was looking for, thanks for the detailed reply!
