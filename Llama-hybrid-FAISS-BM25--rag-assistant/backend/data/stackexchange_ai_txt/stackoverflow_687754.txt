Can not add rows to WPF DataGrid in PowerShell

I am using DataGrid from "WPF Toolkit" from PowerShell. The problem is that I can't add new rows using GUI. dialog.xaml test dialog.ps1 # Includes Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom("C:\Program Files\WPF Toolkit\v3.5.40320.1\WPFToolkit.dll") # Helper methods function LoadXaml { param($fileName) [xml]$xaml = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($fileName) $reader = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlNodeReader $xaml) [Windows.Markup.XamlReader]::Load( $reader ) } # Load XAML $form = LoadXaml('.\dialog.xaml') # $john = new-object PsObject $john | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "First" -Value ("John") $john | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Last" -Value ("Smith") $people = @( $john ) $form.Resources["people"] = $people # $form.ShowDialog() run.bat powershell -sta -file dialog.ps1 The problem seems to be in $people collection. I have tryed same code in C# and it worked, but the collection was defined this way: List people = new List (); people.Add(new Person { First = "John", Last = "Smith" }); this.Resources["people"] = people; Also tryed the Clr collection - did not work at all: $people = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List``1[System.Object]" $people.add($john) Any ideas?
