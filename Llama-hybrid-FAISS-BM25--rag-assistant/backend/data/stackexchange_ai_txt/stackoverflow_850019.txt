The following worked for me: export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8787 -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE" then start my mvn tests: mvn install (maven now hangs waiting for the debugger to connect) Then start Eclipse in a remote debug session, pointing at local host, port 8787 (as above), with appropriate breakpoints set.
