This is more of a programming question than a data science question and would therefore be better suited for stackoverflow stackexchange, but the following code should do what you're looking for: df[["A", "C"]] = ( df # create groups .groupby(["B", "D"]) # transform the groups by filling na values with the group mean .transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean())) ) A B C D 50 2 20 4 3 1 15 1 3 1 15 1 3 1 15 1 10 1 30 4 50 2 35 4 10 1 37 4 40 2 30 1
