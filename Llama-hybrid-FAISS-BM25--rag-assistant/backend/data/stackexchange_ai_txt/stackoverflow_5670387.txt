You may want to do some more research into cookies. Your users should not be able to use multiple instances of the same browser (for example, 4 Internet Explorer windows) to log in. Your users SHOULD be able to use different browsers (ie 1 x IE, 1 x Firefox, 1 x Chrome or any of the above browsers + 1 with Private Browsing/Incognito/etc enabled). The reason for this is because the cookie storage is different. You could technically use different Firefox profiles, too, I think... ... but to get back to your question - you might want to learn more about Cookies and their function in sessions.
