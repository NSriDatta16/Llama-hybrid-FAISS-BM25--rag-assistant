Very rarely do I change technologies on an existing project as it's very hard to justify the cost to a customer. I could only imagine saying to a customer, at the end of this 2-3 week/month process, if you're very, very lucky you'll have exactly what you have now but law of averages you'll be further behind as it will have new bugs. If a new module is being written then this may use new technology but the existing stuff is almost left as is.
