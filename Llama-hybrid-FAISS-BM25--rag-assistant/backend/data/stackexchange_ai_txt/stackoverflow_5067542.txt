IE9 supports .WOFF; IE8 does not, and supports only .EOT fonts. Open the IE9 F12 Developer Tools and you see the following messages: CSS3117: @font-face failed cross-origin request. Resource access is restricted. Neuton-webfont.woff CSS3117: @font-face failed cross-origin request. Resource access is restricted. YanoneKaffeesatz-Regular-webfont.woff CSS3114: @font-face failed OpenType embedding permission check. Permission must be Installable. Neuton-webfont.ttf CSS3114: @font-face failed OpenType embedding permission check. Permission must be Installable. YanoneKaffeesatz-Regular-webfont.ttf Examining your HTTP headers, it's clear that your cross-domain access is not configured properly, as there is no Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header on your WOFF files. They're also delivered with the wrong MIME type ( text/plain ) although that's not causing your problem. However, failure to map woff to the correct MIME type can cause problems as some servers will not serve files with "undefined" extensions and will instead return a HTTP/404 error.
