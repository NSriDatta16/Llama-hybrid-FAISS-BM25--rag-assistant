expected value of sample from a skewed distribution

Let us say a market's prices are distributed with a skew. Given a sample of 10000 products, I can estimate the median, arithmetic mean and weighted average or any other statistic. Let us say I draw 100 products from this distribution, what would be their total expected/average value? I cannot use arithmetic mean * 100 or can I? Should I use median * 100? Or should one use 100 * weighted average? I am sorry I am still confused about this, despite reading lots of related posts here and elsewhere. Any clarification would be very much appreciated please. Thanks! PS: Given Dave's answer and code below, I tried to simulate my situation. Basically I assumed a lognormal distribution to get a skew. I obtain some averages from a larger sample. I want to see which average to use to best estimate the total of N randomly sampled items. It turn out that, according to this (correct?) simulation the arithmetic mean is the better average in my situation. I guess this is some empirical evidence against my gut feeling that the median is the better/more representative average in my situation ... p1
