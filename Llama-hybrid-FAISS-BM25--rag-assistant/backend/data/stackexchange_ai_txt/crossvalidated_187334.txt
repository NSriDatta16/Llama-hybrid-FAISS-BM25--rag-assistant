Restricted Boltzmann machines - Free Energy

I am reading a deep learning introduction on RBMs . It mentions that the formula below (screenshot copied in) has two terms, which are referred to as the positive and negative phase. The first term is desribed as that it increases the probability of training data (by reducing the corresponding free energy), while the second term decreases the probability of samples generated by the model. Can someone share the intuition on why the first term increases the probability of the training data (because a higher free energy is linked to a higher likelihood of the training data?) and why the second term is linked to the probability of the samples?
