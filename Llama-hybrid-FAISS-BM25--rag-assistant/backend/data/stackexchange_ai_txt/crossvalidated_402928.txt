Random Forest uses Decision Trees under the hood and existing commonly known algorithms (e.g. ID3, C4.5, CART) doesn't compare features with other features. Specifically, scikit-learn uses CART algorithm which doesn't do what you want. The only available option is to compare the numeric feature with a real number. Moreover, it would be computationally hard to add this capability if we wanted to do so, since we then need to consider all the possible feature combinations to compare (which is quadratic in number of features) in addition to all possible thresholds.
