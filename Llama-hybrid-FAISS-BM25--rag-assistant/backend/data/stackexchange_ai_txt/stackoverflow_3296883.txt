In a OS like Windows where each process gets a 4GB (assuming 32 bit OS) virtual address space, it doesn't matter how much RAM you are having. In such a case malloc(2.4GB) will surely fail as the user address space is limited to 2GB only. Even allocating 2GB will most probably fail as the system has to allocate 2GB of continuos virtual address space for malloc. This much continous free memory is nearly impossible due to fragmentation.
