Do you mean that you have only one value for each country (i.e., each country's GDP) and want to check if there is a significant difference between those two values? If yes, then you can't do a significance test based on that data. And if you think about it - why should you? If you are asking whether the GDPs are different at a specific timepoint, and you already have the exact answer, then you can conclude whether that is true or not simply based on the actual GDP values. If you instead have a sample of observations (for example GDP-values for the same country over several years, or GDP-values for groups of countries, .e.g., is the average GDP in Asia different from that of South America), and these observations are normally distributed, then you could use a two sided t-test.
