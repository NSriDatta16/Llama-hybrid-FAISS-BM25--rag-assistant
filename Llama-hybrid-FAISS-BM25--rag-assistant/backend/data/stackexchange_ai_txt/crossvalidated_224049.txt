Definition of Conditional Entropy in Paper

I was reading this paper: InfoGAN . On page 4, in the first 2 lines of equations, I was wondering why the conditional entropy $$H(c|G(z,c) ) = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim G(z,c)} [\mathbb{E}_{c' \sim P(c|x)} [\log P(c'|x]]$$ Is this nested expectation a standard definition for conditional entropy? I could not find a reference for this anywhere. Perhaps the fact that $G(z,c)$ is a distribution makes this definition necessary. Reference of the paper linked above: Chen, Xi, et al. "InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.03657 (2016).
