You can store data in other places than cookies (e.g. Flash cookies, localStorage ) but all use same origin policy, which is the standard security model of the web: data stored by a domain can only be accessed by that domain and its subdomains. The standard workaround is to embed an iframe from the foreign domain into the page. That iframe will have access to the cookies of the foreign domain, and its url will be controlled by the local domain, which allows for communication. A simple solution based on that is to have a table of (domainA sessionid, domainB sessionid) pairs. When a new user arrives to domainA, (new sessionid, NULL) is added to the table; the page shown to him includes an invisible iframe with source = http://domainB/mergeSessions.php?sessionA=1234 . mergeSessions.php will then receive sessionA as an URL parameter and sessionB as a cookie, and update the session link table accordingly.
