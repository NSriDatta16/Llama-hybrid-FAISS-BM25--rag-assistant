If you want to make strings safe for SQL, use mysql_real_escape_string() . If you want to limit a string to certain chars, use a regex. For example, if you want only a-z, 0-9 and exclamation mark you can use. $string = preg_replace('^[^a-z0-9!]+$', '', $string); This will strip out anything that doesn't match the regex. If you want to check for the string matches that pattern, use preg_match() . For readability you may want to take out the ^ and proceed the expression with the bang / not / ! operator instead. If you are talking about stripping out things to make echo ing to your page safe, use htmlspecialchars() . Depending on context, you may need to sanitize further. Remember : If you are limiting characters in passwords, it only makes sense from a theoretical point of view that they will be easier to remember by the end user. Limiting chars makes password brute forcers easier (smaller pool of chars to check), and it shouldn't affect their storage (as they should be salted and hashed).
