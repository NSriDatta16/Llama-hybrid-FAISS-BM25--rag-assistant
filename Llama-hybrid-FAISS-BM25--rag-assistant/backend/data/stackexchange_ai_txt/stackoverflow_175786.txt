The CDT version of Ganymede apparently shipped improperly configured. After playing around for a while, I have come up with the following steps that fix the problem. Export your Eclipse preferences (File > Export > General > Preferences). Open the exported file in a text editor. Find the line that says /instance/org.eclipse.ui.editors/spellingEngine=org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.spelling.DefaultSpellingEngine Change it to /instance/org.eclipse.ui.editors/spellingEngine=org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.text.spelling.CSpellingEngine Save the preferences file. Import the preferences back into Eclipse (File > Import > General > Preferences). You should now be able to access the Spelling configuration page as seen above. Note: if you want to add a custom dictionary, Eclipse must be able to access and open the file (i.e. it must exist - an empty file will work)
