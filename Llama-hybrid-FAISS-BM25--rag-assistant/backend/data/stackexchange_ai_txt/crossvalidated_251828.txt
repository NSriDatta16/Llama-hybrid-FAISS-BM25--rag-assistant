I think that You might use simply a discrete binomial GLMM rather than continuous, which is just slightly different from the model You described. By the way, the warning message You've mentioned is no error: it simply notifies You, that the binomial response variable was continuous (having non-integer, i.e. non-zero and non-one values). If the non-integer values are between zero and one, there should be no problem. If I understand correctly, You are interested in whether the structural vegetation coverage influences the presence of P. malvae eggs, correct? In that case, Occupancy should be the response variable, because You expect change in the presence of eggs in response to other environmental variables. Having the cause and causation in the right order helps to make sense of the results of such ecological models. In my opinion, the model You might want to use would look something like this: glmer(Occupancy~VS_G+HP_spp+(1|VS_Date)+(1|Pair_nr), family="binomial", data=PM_data106) In this model, You can add all 3 variables representing vegetation-coverages, although You should keep an eye out for the possible interactions between the three coverage variables. Also, i think it would make more ecological sense, to specify the hostplant species as fixed effect, because it has relevance to see, whether one plant species or another is preferred by the animal for laying eggs.
