What I'd do is export the csv to the server disk Sounds like the right idea. But are you creating the complete string first? If you write line by line you shouldn't get OOM Edit, after seeing the code You are only using StringBuilder.Append(x) , so you can restructure your code a little to replace that with _context.Response.Output.Write(x) . That might sacrifice a little bit of your separation but it's for a good cause. And if you want to keep using a StringBuilder, it would help a lot if you could estimate the resulting size. Add a generous margin and use StringBuilder stringbuilder = new StringBuilder(estimate); This saves on growing (copying) of the StringBuilder and reduces both memory use and fragmentation on the LOH.
