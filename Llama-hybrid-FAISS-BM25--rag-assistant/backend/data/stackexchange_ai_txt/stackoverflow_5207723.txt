Making text unselectable

So, while playing with scrollbars and stuff in HTML5, I'm starting to notice an annoying trend. If I have text near my element that's being dragged (say, a scrub bar for a video, scroll bar, anything a user would click and drag), nearby text will get selected, as if I'm not using a control, just dragging over the page. This is terribly annoying, and I can't seem to find the right string to search for on google to figure out if it's possible to make certain elements "unselectable". Anyone know how to do this?
