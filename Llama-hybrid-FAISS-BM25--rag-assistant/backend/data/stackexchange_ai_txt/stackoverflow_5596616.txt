I would say that the best way would be to store the video in BLOB storage on Azure Storage Services (note that this is different from SQLAzure). It is cheaper to host than SQLAzure and you don't have to create any infrastructure to display them as they are URL accessible. If you need to control access to the video, you'll want to look into Shared Access Signatures.
