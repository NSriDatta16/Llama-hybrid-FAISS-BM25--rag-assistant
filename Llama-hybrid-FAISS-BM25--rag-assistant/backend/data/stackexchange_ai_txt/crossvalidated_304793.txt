ACF and differencing order of operations

When calculating ACF and PACF, what is the rule regarding differencing? For example, I have an increasing time series- looking at instrument drift. Differencing returns what looks like white noise. When I do ACF and PACF, do I use the raw values or the differenced values? I've done both, just playing around. The raw values return positive ACF values for many lags. The differenced values return a negative value and the rest negative and insignificant. What is the correct procedure? Since the mean increases over time. Do I difference before ACF? Or ACF on the raw data?
