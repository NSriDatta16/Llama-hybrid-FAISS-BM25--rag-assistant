Presuming your dataframe is called "Data", I'd use xts package . They're a whole lot easier to work with : #Conversion of dates Data$time Then TimeSeries can be used subsequently. You can't use a normal ts, because you don't have a regular time series. No way on earth you can defend that the time intervals between your observations are equal. EDIT : In regard of your remarks in the comments, you can try the following : #Calculate the period they're into #This is based on GMT and the fact that POSIXct gives the number of seconds #passed since the origin. 5400 is 1/16 of 86400 seconds in a day Data$mdyhms
