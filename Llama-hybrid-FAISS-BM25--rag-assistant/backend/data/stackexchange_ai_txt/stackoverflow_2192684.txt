If you are using C++, I wouldn't bother trying to predict it. The nice thing that encapsulation gives you is that you can at a later date change the memory allocation strategy without breaking all existing code. So I would do nothing and see if fragmentation does actually occur in real-life circumstances - it very probably won't.
