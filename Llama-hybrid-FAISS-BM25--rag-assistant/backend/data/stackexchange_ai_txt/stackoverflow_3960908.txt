You should be able to check under the Windows updates to see what updates were recently applied. Hopefully, you could roll them back until you find the culprit. Paul's right. Deploying a solution using MSOffice apps on a server can be a +very+ dicey proposition. Be prepared, and make use of watchdog timers and code to enumerate and kill errant WINWORD.EXE processes when you think it might have dropped off the deep end. it's not elegant stuff, but it can be made to work. As for 3'rd party tools, I've looked at A LOT of them. If you're building a doc from scratch, most are ok, though they have varying levels of implemented functionality. If you can work with DOCX files exclusively, the OpenDoc XML SDK works quite nicely and is free. But it sucks to actually manipulate existing documents. If you're planning on using existing documents as templates, you're options become much more narrow. You can do it with the OpenXML SDK, but it's VERY difficult. Windward reports works, but can be $$$. Most of the "Word Compatible" libraries for sale don't implement all the functionality you're likely to need. You'll most likely find that using the Word Object Model API is the only route to give you the capability you'll need. But, as always YMMV.
