How should I begin to help projects in Github?

I'm new to github and I like to help other people with their projects that I find interesting. I know there are a lot of guides in the github place, but I think it could be nice to gather a bunch of real people's experiences. So, I invite you to post about your first experiences in github. Whether you are a not-so-newbie or you are a heavy rock in github comunnity, I think your lines could encourage real newbies like me about entering this great open source community.
