Tests should be simpler, preferably much simpler, than the thing tested. Otherwise the error is more likely to be in your test. So it's much better to have a lot of small simple test methods that execute small parts of your method than one big clunky one. (You can use a code coverage tool like Cobertura to verify that you're covering all paths in your method.)
