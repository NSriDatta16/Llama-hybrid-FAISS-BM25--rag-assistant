For anyone else facing this issue I've found the solution that worked was by creating 3 directories on disk Common Blackberry Android The vast majority goes into Common however the classes that have platform specific calls go into the Blackberry/Android counterparts respectively and extend a common base class in the common directory. E.g. a class called MyClass that needed platform specific versions would have a MyClassCommon in the common directory and in the Blackberry directory it has MyClass extends MyClassCommon definition and the same for Android. In Eclipse the Common,Blackberry,Android src paths are individually added via a common variable (trunk) which is extened to the Common,Blackberry,Android paths for the 3 src root imports. This seemed to be the only mechanism to ensure that the package name was consistent across platforms so not having a knock on effect that other dependent classes needed new package names. I'm sure there is a more elegant/correct way of doing this but this appears to work well for now.
