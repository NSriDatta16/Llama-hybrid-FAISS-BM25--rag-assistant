I would guess that this visualisation does not have a name. And there's a good reason for that - this is just not a good way to visualise data and should be avoided. It breaks some basic principles of visualisation. If you use time and location as your X- and Y- axes in a 2D plot, readers will reasonably conclude that any line you draw indicates the relationship between time and location. Using a line to indicate some property of an implicit third dimension (colour) is unintuitive. 'Locations' isn't continuous but is shown as though it is. Even if there is some natural ordering to the locations, this depiction (both the colour variation and the continuous line) paints a misleading picture unless these are evenly spaced sampling locations (in which case location = distance). There are much better ways to visualise this data. It's possible to indicate both the time series and the overall means on one plot but I would recommend splitting these into two. First, the time series. I would recommend a joy plot to depict them if there aren't too many locations. Small multiples line plots are another option. Second, use a Cleveland dot plot to indicate the means.
