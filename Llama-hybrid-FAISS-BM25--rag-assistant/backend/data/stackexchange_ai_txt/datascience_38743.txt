Sensitivity analysis of a machine learning model

Letâ€™s say I have a set of input variables ( A , B , C and D ) and I predict a target ( y ) using a machine learning model ( XGBRegressor in my case) with a reasonable performance (5% relative error on test set). from sklearn.datasets import make_regression import pandas as pd from xgboost import XGBRegressor X, y = make_regression(n_samples=500, n_features=4, n_informative=2, noise=0.3) X = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']) model = XGBRegressor() model.fit(X, y) Now, I want to do some kind of sensitivity analysis on this model by answering two questions: What is the impact of a 5% independent increase in variables A , B and C (not D ) on the target variable? From variables A , B , C and D ; which combination of values of A , B and C (without touching D ) increases the target y value by 10, minimizing the sum of A , B and C . I have already answered question one (see this gist ). However, how can question 2 be coded? I imagine that this implies an optimization problem.
