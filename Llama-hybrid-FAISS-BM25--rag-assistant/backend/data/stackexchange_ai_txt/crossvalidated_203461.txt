1 Yes boosted trees would more easily fit unknown non-linear effects or interactions than regularized linear regression. However, as soon as you are aware of some specific non-linearity you could simply transform data to linearity and continue to use a linaer learner. 2 That depends on how you train the models. If you're new to boosted trees, check out some tutorials on how to avoid overfitting. I cannot see from your plots what kind of cross-validation was used. Use a thorough outer cross-validation and perhaps compare the results to a random forest model. RF models are much easier to handle, and default settings are often near optimal. A crude thumb rule; if your RF performs better than boosted trees(measured by outer cross validation), you either have chosen sub optimal training paramters for your boosted trees model or your data is quite noisy.
