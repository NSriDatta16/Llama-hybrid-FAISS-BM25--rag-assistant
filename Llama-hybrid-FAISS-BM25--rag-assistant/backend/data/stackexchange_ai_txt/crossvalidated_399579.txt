If I understand your data and setup correctly, you have what is called a bipartite graph (or bipartite network). This kind of network is defined by the following properties: There are two types of nodes. Here, the types are health workers and organisations. Every edge connects a node of one type with a node of the other type. Here, all edges connect a heath worker to an organisation. There are not edges connecting one health worker to another or one organisation to another.
