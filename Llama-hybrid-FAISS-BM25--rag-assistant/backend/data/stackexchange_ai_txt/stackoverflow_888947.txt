Assuming you are talking about a library that uses the Cocoa frameworks and not just one written in the plain old Objective-C language, a library (or framework) is a collection of classes that work together to perform a specific task. I would not organize an ObjC framework as a collection of functions since that totally goes against the paradigm of the language. As for the difference between a library and framework, that's probably a bit subjective. To me, a library (in the context of your question) is something written in C that probably more closely resembles a non-OO collection of functions. A framework would be a full package of classes as I described above. So the Messaging framework on CocoaDev would be a framework, whereas the sqlite3 APIs you can access on the iPhone would be a library. Again, that's just me. Other people may interpret the terms differently.
