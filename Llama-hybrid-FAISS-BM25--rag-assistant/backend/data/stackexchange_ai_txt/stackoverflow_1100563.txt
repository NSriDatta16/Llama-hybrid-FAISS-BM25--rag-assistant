Xcode 3.1.3 - Organizer The device is not activated. Please activate it using iTunes

I recently upgraded my XCode SDK to version 3.1.3 and my iPhone OS to 3.0. It is important to note that everything was working fine when I had OS version 2.2.1 in my iPhone. My iPhone Touch device is not jailbroken and I have a valid provisioning profile in the organizer which is linked to my iPhone Touch however it has a yellow circle next to it. This is because in the organizer under devices it displays the ipod with version 3.0 (7A341) and then it Reads (in the section where the provisioning profiles should go): This device is not activated. Please activate it using iTunes. When I go in xcode and build the application it does so just fine, and the code signing is in fact assigned to the correct provisioning profile. But whenever I try to run it in the device I get "No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected.". This is because the organizer keeps telling me to activate the device using iTunes. I have iTunes version 8.2 and the device is there and i can sync it just fine, however it keeps displaying that message in XCode. I have tried restoring my ipod about 10 times but I always get the same result, I have also tried powering off the iphone Touch and the computer but nothing seems to help. Does anyone else have this problem?
