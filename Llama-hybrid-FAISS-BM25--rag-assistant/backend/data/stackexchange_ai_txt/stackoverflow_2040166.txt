Include all files under a folder

i have a folder of javascript files, is it possible to include all of the files under that folder automatically? something like OK to make it clear i have an ajax application, with lots of js fragments, but i want to aggregate all of them into one big js file so to speed up application loading now what i am doing is using to manually include all the js files every time i change a js file name or add / remove js file, i have to come back the aggregation jsp file to edit it
