How to insert text with XSLT v1.0 instead of using an XSLT v2.0 regex?

I have an xml file which describes (among other things) elements with attribute values that describe fully qualified java class names. I am trying to write an XSLT transformation to modify the class names described in this file, such that (for example) ocurrances of com.example.MyClass will become com.example.MockMyClass . Here's that example again in the context of a fragment of the original file: templates/MyTemplate.vm I want the result to be: templates/MyTemplate.vm I'm doing this transformation using the Java JAXP API, and had written a lovely XSLT 2.0 compliant regex routine to get the results I want, only to discover that Java 5 doesn't support XSLT 2.0, which is required for regex support. So my question is, what is the best way to achieve this using the archaic JAXP XSLT 1.0 API? That is, without the use of regular expressions. I looked for similar problems, but the requirement for backreferencing regex groups seems to make this a tricky one. This question is a start, but I need to insert text, within a matching string, rather than just replacing . For reference, here is my regex (XSLT 2.0) attempt: Mock
