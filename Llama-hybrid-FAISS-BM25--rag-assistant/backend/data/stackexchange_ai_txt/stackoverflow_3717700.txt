ASP.NET Global/Static storage?

I have a thread-safe object which is part of an API previously used in windows service/client scenarios. This thread-safe object is essentially a singleton and stored in a static variable so that all callers can access the same state. This API has recently started being used in an ASP.NET application, and I suspect that some funky behavior we're seeing may be due to unexpected AppDomain/lifecycle behavior. So I was wondering if I could get some verification: Is a static variable reliably available for all requests , or does ASP.NET do any trickery with having multiple AppDomains for multiple requests? I understand this would be the case for a web garden ... but our IIS is configured to use only 1 process, and is configured to only recycle once a day
