This is a well studied problem in geospatial science--you can find discussions of it on GIS forums. First, note that the wiggles do not necessarily increase the route's length, because many of them actually cut inside curves. (I have evaluated this by having an entire classroom of students digitize the same path and then I compared the paths.) There really is a lot of cancellation. Also, we can expect that readings taken just a few seconds apart will have strongly, positively, correlated errors. Thus the measured path should wiggle only gradually around the true path. Even large departures don't affect the length much. For example, if you deviate by (say) 5 meters laterally in the middle of a 100 m straight stretch, your estimate of the length only goes up to $2 \sqrt{50^2 + 5^2} = 100.5$, a 0.5% error. It is difficult to compare two arbitrary paths in an objective way. One of the better methods, I believe, is a form of bootstrapping: subsample (or otherwise generalize) the most detailed path you have. Plot its length as a function of the amount of subsampling. If you express the subsampling as a typical vertex-to-vertex distance, you can extrapolate a fit to a zero distance, which can provide an excellent estimate of the path length. With multiple recordings, you can create a 2D kernel smooth of each, sum the smooths, and subject that to a topographic analysis to look for a "ridgeline." You won't get a single connected line, usually, but you can often patch the ridges together into a continuous path. People have used this method to average hurricane tracks, for example.
