Rails 3 single table inheritence w/ has_many question

I've been trying to setup a Single Table Inheritance model in Rails 3 in which the parent class also contains a has_many relationship. Unfortunately I can't get it to work. Here are three classes as an example: class Article :destroy, :autosave => true end class Paragraph And here's the migration that would be used to set this up: class AddTables false # for STI t.string :title, :null => false t.timestamps end create_table :paragraphs do |t| t.references :article, :null => false t.timestamps end end def self.down drop_table :articles drop_table :paragraphs end end When I set it up this way and I try to create a new SportsArticle, say by doing the following: SportsArticle.create(:title => "Go Giants") I always get the following error: "TypeError: can't convert String into Integer" I have no idea how to fix this issue and have tried finding a solution online to no avail. Does anybody who has experience with STI models see anything wrong? Here's the link to the documentation on the create method if it will help in diagnosing the problem: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#method-c-create
