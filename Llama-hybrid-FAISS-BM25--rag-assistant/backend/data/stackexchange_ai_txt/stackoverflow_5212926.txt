Okay, this is far too late, but I hope someone will find this useful. I don't know how your system works and which version of Magento you are using, but in 1.5 (the one that I am using) in the module GoogleCheckout, look for Model/Api/Xml/Abstract.php, this is base Model for the others models in the GoogleCheckout XML API and it has a method called getCurrency(); public function getCurrency() { if (!$this->hasData('currency')) { $this->setData('currency', Mage::app()->getStore()->getBaseCurrencyCode()); //$this->setData('currency', $this->getLocale()=='en_US' ? 'USD' : 'GBP'); } return $this->getData('currency'); } Since it is not good idea to override Abstract class in PHP according to this you will need to copy this class to the local folder and change the method getCurrency() so it transforms the currency to GBP.
