Firstly, as delnan noticed, you seem to have got a little confused in your addStuff function. I'm guessing you want it to add an item v to the list in the dictionary with key i . However, what your function actually does is add item v to every list in the dictionary regardless of what key it has. The value i you pass to the function is completely ignored because it is immediately overwritten by the loop variable. Suppose dicc contains {'index': [1, 8], 'someOtherIndex': [4, 11]} . If we were to call addStuff('index', 23) , or addStuff('someOtherIndex', 23) , or even addStuff('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', 23) , we would end up with dicc containing {'index': [1, 8, 23], 'someOtherIndex': [4, 11, 23]} in all three cases . I'm not sure why you don't just write your addStuff function like this: def addStuff(i = '', v = ''): dicc[i].append(v) I'm guessing that your next problem is that this approach doesn't work if the value of i isn't a key in the dictionary. In that case you'd want the function to automatically create an empty list for that key : def addStuff(i = '', v = ''): if i not in dicc: dicc[i] = [] dicc[i].append(v)
