Embedding app.config: working only in release, not in debug

In order to have neater app distribution I have made app.config file to be embedded resource, since it only contains default values. However, the app now cannot be debugged, it throws an exception ( ConfigurationErrorException ). But when released, the app runs fine. Is there any way how to get it working in the debug time too? Thanks
