numpy array mapping and take average

I have three arrays import numpy as np value = np.array ([1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 3]) index = np.array ([1, 1, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6]) data = np.array ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) Arrays "index" & "value" have same size and I want to group the items in "value" by taking average. For example: For the first two items [1, 3, ... in "value", have the same key 1 in "index", so for the final array the value is the mean of the 1st & 2rd items in value : (1 + 3 )/2 which is equal 2 The final array is: [2, nan, 4, nan, nan, 5] first value is the average of 1st and 2nd of "value" second value is nan because there is not any key in "index" (no "2" in array index) third value is the average of 3rd and 4th of "value" ... Thanks for your help!!! Regards, Roy
