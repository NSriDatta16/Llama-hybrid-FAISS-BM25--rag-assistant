How to build simple reviewing and 5-star rating system?

I'm very new to web technologies and this is basically for a term project that my team is working on. We are working on a food review site. As of now, I'm not quite sure how to implement a simple 5-star rating system. Am I supposed to use a server-side language like PHP or a client-side one like Javascript (w/ JQuery). Looking around it seems that JQuery is more suitable for this? Or would it be a combination of both? What I'm looking for as far as functionality goes is: Stars light up when mouse hovers Page doesn't have to be reloaded when a star is clicked (not really needed) Some sort of average shown beside the stars Rating has to be stored somewhere in a MySQL database (Is this a good idea?) I really apologize if the question sounds vague and stupid, I don't have much of a clue on how to implement this and I've tried googling around. If you have any questions about it please let me know. Thank you very much.
