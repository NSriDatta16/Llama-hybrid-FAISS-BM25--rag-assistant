WPF and Silverlight controls and layouts pan and zoom capabilities

I would like to understand the general requirements for WPF/Silverlight layout for making it possible to implement pan&zoom (drag and zoom) features. I don't mean pan&zoom for an image but for a total page (window) layout (or part of it) with some controls. What features of the layout and what features of used custom controls make layout fixed and pan&zoom impossible?
