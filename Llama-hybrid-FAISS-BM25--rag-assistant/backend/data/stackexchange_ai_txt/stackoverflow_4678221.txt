Character escaping in C

I need to pass some commands to terminal throw C program and get it's input after that. As a part of it, I have a line where Expect script must be placed. FILE *command = popen("script here","r"); Script I need to execute is: expect -c 'spawn ssh user@host cat /proc/stat expect { -re ".*yes/no.*" { send "yes\r" exp_continue } "password:" { send -- "password\r" } } interact' So, I need to escape several characters so script worked as it need to work. I tried different sequences of escaping, but all of them are not right. And thank you for your attention. UPD: Without escaping I get error while compiling ( "syntax error before `*'" , "stray '\' in program" and others). I think that problem caused by new lines, but script don't work if I simply write it in one line. I tried to use \n , but this did not helped me. So, I cannot simply copy and paste script to C file, it need some processing
