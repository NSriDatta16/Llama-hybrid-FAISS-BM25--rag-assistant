In 1PL model, zero ability equals average ability, or change accuracy?

In a test evaluation scenario, latent variable analyses are used to represent the ability of the test-taker and the difficulty of the question. A 1PL model uses a latent, random log-odds threshold, $\alpha$ to gauge the likelihood of correct response by a test taker. This is called a 1PL model. In this 1PL dichotomous model, where $\alpha = 1$ , the zero ability people are the people who only have chance accuracy, or the average ability people (who could have very high accuracy)?
