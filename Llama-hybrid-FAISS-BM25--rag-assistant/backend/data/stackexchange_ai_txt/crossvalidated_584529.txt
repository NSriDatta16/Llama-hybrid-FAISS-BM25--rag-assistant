Is it OK to re-sample the same patients at multiple points in time and then use the data for classification?

I'm trying to predict which patients will have a bad outcome (BO) within the next 2 weeks based on medical readings (plus some behavioral data) from the last 6 weeks. Total data timespan is 8 weeks, i.e. each patient has 6 full weeks of data in the feature space, and I'm trying to predict BO (yes/no) within the next 2 weeks. Re-sample at different times-- To prevent the model from being biased to a specific point in time, and to increase the number of BO cases for predictive modeling (there's only ~40 BO cases a week), I'm thinking taking many points in time as "as-of dates", and for each patient at each as-of date I create features looking 6 weeks back and BO(yes/no) looking 2 weeks ahead. For eg. John Doe was sampled at 10 as-of dates and he becomes 10 rows in the data set. My question is this -- I understand that the 10 John Doe rows are not independent from one another, so I'll avoid using models that require independent assumption such as logistic regression. Can I use ensemble tree models to predict BO (such as Gradient-boosted tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)? Additional detail (if that helps)-- Samples from one as-of date to the next as-of date only have ~85% overlapping patients. There's new patients entering each sample, and there's patient rolling out (released or BO). Any advice will be much appreciated!
