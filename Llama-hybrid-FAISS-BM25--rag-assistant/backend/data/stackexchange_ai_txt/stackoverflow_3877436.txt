Location of head.phtml in Magento

I am working with Magento and need to remove a Javascript that is being included in the section by default. I am using a modified theme called modern. I am looking for head.phtml in: app/design/frontend/default/modern/template/page/html/head.phtml It does not exist. I do have header.phtml and footer.phtml. The code from header.phtml starts well after the of the document. Where in the world would the head.phtml file be? Thanks in advance.
