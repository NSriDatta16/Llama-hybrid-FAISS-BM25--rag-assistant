jQuery Droppable, get the element dropped

A small question hopefully with a simple answer, I am using jQuery draggable and droppable to place items into a dock. Using the below code for the drop. $("#dock").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { //Do something to the element dropped?!? } }); However I couldn't find a way to get what element was actually dropped, so I can do something do it. Is this possible?
