Windows Live ID login via HttpRequest

I want interact with one web via HttpRequest/HttpResponse. But the web requires login via Windows Live ID. I go to the live login page, but I can't get any usable response from login page. The code used to access the login page: var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("http://login.live.com/"); request.Timeout = 30000; request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100202 Firefox/3.5.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)"; request.Accept = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"; request.Headers.Add("Accept-Language", "en-us,en;q=0.5"); request.Headers.Add("Accept-Charset", "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7"); request.Headers.Add("Keep-Alive", "300"); request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; request.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Http.Get; var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); And the response: Cookies must be allowed Your browser is currently set to block cookies. Your browser must allow cookies before you can use Windows Live ID. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer that tell Windows Live ID sites and services when you're signed in. To learn how to allow cookies, see online help in your web browser. I have no problem with cookies on another web pages and I can't found any way, how to get over this message. Do you anybody have an idea, how to solve it? Thanks!
