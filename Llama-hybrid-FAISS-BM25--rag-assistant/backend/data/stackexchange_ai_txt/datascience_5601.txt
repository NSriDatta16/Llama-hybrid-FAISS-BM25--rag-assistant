How to classify whether text answer is relevant to an initial text question

I have a text classification problem in which i need to classify an answer to a message as either relevant or not. In the first phase of my calculations, I have already used a SVM to determine if the original message was relevant or not, deciding whether a message contains a hint or question if somebody's twitter account has been hacked. example: "Hey @foobar, have you been hacked?" However, when I want to classify whether the answer is relevant, I would want to have both the original message and the answer as input, right? An answer is relevant in my case if it, in any way, responds to the original message. Is this approach possible using a SVM or any other machine learning tool? I'm using python with the scikit-learn library. example: "Hey @foobar, have you been hacked?" "@barfoo it seems so, thx for suggesting" I'm not very experienced in this field, so any input would be very appreciated.
