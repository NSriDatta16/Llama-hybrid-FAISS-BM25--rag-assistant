Formatting sentences in a string using C#

I have a string with multiple sentences. How do I Capitalize the first letter of first word in every sentence. Something like paragraph formatting in word. eg ."this is some code. the code is in C#. " The ouput must be "This is some code. The code is in C#". one way would be to split the string based on '.' and then capitalize the first letter and then rejoin. Is there a better solution?
