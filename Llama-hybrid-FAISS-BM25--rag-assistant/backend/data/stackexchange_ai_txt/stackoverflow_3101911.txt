Good security is hard. As Bruce Schneier says, "Security is a tradeoff." You have to decide how secure you want this information, and how much time you want to spend securing said information. And you definitely don't want to leave passwords just sitting out there in plain text, that's a no-no. If you're in a situation where that's OK you're in a situation where you shouldn't have user authentication. Even though security is hard, there are a few things you can do. 1) Use some type of compiled program to do the encryption/decryption. You don't want someone to open up a Python/perl script and say "aha, this is just a simple XYZ encryption", though ideally you don't want a simple encryption. 2) Security through obscurity is not real security, but it can help against the casual snoop. For instance, naming your file "passwords.txt" is not a terribly good idea, but encrypting your passwords and then using steganography to hide the user/pass in some image file is better. 3) Look up strong encryption/decryption algorithms. Some of them are already implemented in most languages and you can just import a library. This can either be bad or good, depending on how secure you think you want this stuff. But honestly, this system is really bad - security wise. Ideally you have a two-party authentication and then the trusted middleman does all the wheeling and dealing. For instance, when you log onto your computer you're telling the computer that you're an authorized user. From there you get to run all of your programs and they don't ask or care about your user/pass combination - just that you're an authorized user. They get this information from the OS (the middle-man). Heck, even SO uses openID to decide that you're a trusted user - they don't care what your credentials are on the other sites, only that the other sites say "Yes yes, this is a valid user." If you have the option, I would seriously consider switching your authentication model. If not, good luck.
