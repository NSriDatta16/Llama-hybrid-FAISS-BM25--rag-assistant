A simple database for an HTA

I have been tasked with creating a couple of databases for local use in our office, one for logging sickness calls and another for logging staff taxis. I do not have the ability to install new software on the machines that will be used to develop the app nor on the machines that will use the app, so no xAMP based application, unfortunately. Excel is available, but I'd rather not go down that route as I want to provide a clean UI. So I'm looking at putting together an HTA based application. The question is: I cannot seem to find a simple, easy to use database-type storage solution for an HTA application. Do I need to write something from scratch, or can anyone recommend something I can use?
