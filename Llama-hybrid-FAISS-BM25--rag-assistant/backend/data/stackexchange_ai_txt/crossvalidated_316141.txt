Over-arching advice (perhaps vacuous) is to use terminology that people in your sub-field will understand because they use it routinely. That said, and working backwards: detrending has a strong default meaning of taking out a time trend (or in some fields a spatial trend ). That doesn't rule out broader uses, but you need to flag your own use so that it is clearly decoded. The use of trend as a very general synonym for pattern or relationship is not outrageous, but my personal view is that it weakens a good word. normalise means so many different things, even in statistical sciences, that my advice is to avoid the term. Other uses include various kinds of scaling or standardization and transformations to be closer to normal or Gaussian distribution. residual is a good statistical term with a long pedigree, including John Herschel and J.S. Mill, that fits what you're doing.
