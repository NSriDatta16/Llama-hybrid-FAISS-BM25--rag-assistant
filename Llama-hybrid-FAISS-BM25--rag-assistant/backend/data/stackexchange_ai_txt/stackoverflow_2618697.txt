Beginner questions on Java Regular Expression

I began studying Java Regular Expression recently and I found some really intersting task.For example,I now need to dig out "Product Name","Product Description" and "Sellers for this product" out of the following HTML code.(I am sorry for the big chunck of code,but it is very straightforward) &nbsp; Nikon D300S 12.3 MP Digital SLR Camera Body - Black SLR - 13.1MP, 12.3MP - 1x Optical Zoom - CompactFlash, SD/MMC Memory Card - 3in. (92 user ratings) + Add to Shopping List &nbsp;|&nbsp; See More Like This Thundercameras :$1,289 &nbsp; PhotoVideoSuperStore :$1,269 &nbsp; Digitalelect :$1,279 &nbsp; I would think of : (1) digging out the product name from tag,and using regular expression exp =" ]*>" + ".*? ]*>" + "([^ .*? "; (2) digging out the product info from the tag. exp = " [^>]*>" (3) digging out the Sellers' names from tag. exp = " ]*>" + ".*? ]*>" + "([^ .*? "; I am just beginning learing using Java Regular Expression,I would be grateful if you could correct me if I am in the wrong track or my regular expressiona are wrong. Thanks a lot,guys.
