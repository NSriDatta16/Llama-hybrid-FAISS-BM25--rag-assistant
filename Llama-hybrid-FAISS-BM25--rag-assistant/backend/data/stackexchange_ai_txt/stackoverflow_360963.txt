I am impressed and humbled that my peers in this field of computer programming (you lot) are not daunted by the prospect of potential bugs when you skip the braces on single line blocks. I suppose it means I'm not smart. I have made mistakes around this multiple times. I have debugged others' mistakes around this. I have watched software ship with bugs because of this (RDP to a machine running VS2002 and your watch window font will go wonky). If I look at all the mistakes I've made that could have been avoided with a change in coding style, the list is very long. If I hadn't changed my approach in each of these cases, I probably would never have made it as a programmer. Again, I guess I'm not smart. To compensate, I have been a staunch user of braces on single-line blocks for a long time. That said, some things have changed in the world that make the "thou shalt use braces on single-line blocks" rule less relevant today than when Moses brought it down to us: Some popular languages make the issue go away by making the computer read the indentation, just like the programmer does (e.g. Python). My editor automatically formats for me, so the chances of me getting mislead by indentation is much reduced. TDD means that if I introduce a bug because I get confused by a single-line block, I'm much more likely to discover the bug quickly. Refactoring and language expressiveness mean that my blocks are much shorter, and single-line blocks happen much more often than the used to. Hypothetically, with a ruthless application of ExtractMethod, I could possibly have only single-line blocks in my whole program. (I wonder what that would look like?) In fact, there's a distinct benefit can come of refactoring ruthlessly & omitting braces on single-line blocks: when you see braces, a little alarm can go off in your head that says "complexity here! beware!". Imagine if this was the norm: if (condition) Foo(); // normal, everyday code if (condition) { // something non-trivial hapening; pay attention! Foo(); Bar(); } I'm opening myself to the idea of changing my coding convention to something like "single-line blocks may never have braces" or "if you can put the block on the same line as the condition, and it all fits within 80 characters, omit the braces". We'll see.
