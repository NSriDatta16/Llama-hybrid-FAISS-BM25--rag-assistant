What makes MCMC converge?

Here is what I have learned about MCMC recently 1) We first propose a likelihood function that describes our problem (Binomial) 2) We define a conjugate prior (Beta) and posterior distribution (Beta-Binomial) 3) We define a proposal distribution (Normal) that makes random sampling (Monte Carlo part) 4) We fetch the randomly generated parameter by proposal distribution into the Bayesian function and calculate posterior 5) We calculate ratio of posterior probability of current and previous parameter. We then choose to either accept or ignore this step (Metropolis-Hastings) 6) We iterate this process for thousands of time until posterior distribution converge This is my rough understanding of MCMC precedure. My main questions are: 1) What exactly are we sampling using proposal distribution? is it the parameter we aim to find through MCMC? 2) Why can MCMC converge eventually? More specifically, How can randomly choosen parameter through proposal distribution fetched into Bayesian formula give us the posterior density probability of that parameter (this is the step that, through iterations, converges the posterior distribution of parameter, right?)
