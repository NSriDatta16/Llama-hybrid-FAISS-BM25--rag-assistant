I recommend that you re-examine your model to make certain that you actually have to kill the process from somewhere else. Your code will get increasingly difficult to debug and maintain in all but the most trivial circumstances. To keep it encapsulated, you can signal the process you wish to terminate and gracefully exit in the process you want to kill. Otherwise, you can use normal IPC to send a message that says: "hey, buddy. shut down, please." edit: for the 2nd paragraph, you may still end up launching a script to do this. that's fine. what you want to avoid is a kill -9 type of thing. instead, let the process exit gracefully.
