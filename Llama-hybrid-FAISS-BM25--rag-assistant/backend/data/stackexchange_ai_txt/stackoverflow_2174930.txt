I just asked a relevant question today on SO regarding to generating slug, aka/ slugify a title. When fetch a URL with slug, you can either create an action that takes both ID (and other required arguments) and slug in and simply ignore the slug. public ActionResult Foobar(int id, string slug) { //-- Do Something } Or more elegant, Use map route to ignore trialing string behind your URL and map to Foobar(int id) .
