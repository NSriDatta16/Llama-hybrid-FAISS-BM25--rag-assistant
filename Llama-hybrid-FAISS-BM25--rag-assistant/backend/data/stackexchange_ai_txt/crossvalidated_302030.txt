Supervised Approach for Longitudinal Data

Data: I have about 1,000 Longitudinal Datasets from 1000 schools, similar to the sample table shown below, which I am trying to classify. Instead of yearly scores, I have detailed monthly scores. Problem Each School (Entire Dataset) has a corresponding label representing whether or not it was effected by a natural disaster during this period . There is no information pertaining to when (which year or month) exactly the disaster occurred, but rather the objective is to seek trends that distinguish the two classes. Question What algorithms can I leverage to solve such a problem? I have used a Convolutional Neural Network but the results are very disappointing.
