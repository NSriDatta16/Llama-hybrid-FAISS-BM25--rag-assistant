In GWT, how do you click and drag a large image to change the portion that is being viewed?

In my GWT application I am using Border Layout to display a large image within a Panel that is added to the Centre location. I would like to click and drag on the image to change the portion of the image that is displayed. This would be equivalent of using the scroll bars to move the portion of the image displayed on screen. This is similar to the way Adobe Reader allows you to navigate around a PDF. How do I do this with GWT?
