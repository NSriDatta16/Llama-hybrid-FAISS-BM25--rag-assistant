Flash Textfield embedFonts false positive

I'm working on font embedding in Flash (flas are compiled using CS5 made previously in CS3). The project is split into a number of separate flas, and I'm having trouble with one particular one. I'm dynamically embedding the fonts using a class I wrote that sit's on top of the stage listening for Event.ADDED then searching for textfields that have dynamic text and embedding the font needed dynamically (No efficiency requirements here :). I have a check so that I don't bother processing textfields that are already embedded. No textfields in any of the flas (to my knowledge) have fonts embedded. But some textfields are saying that they are, as in textfield.embedFonts == true. In the fla global font embedding, that no fonts are embedded. If I click on the actual textfields embed button, I see that the font of the textfield is in the font list, but no character ranges are embedded. This is leaving me confused, as I want absolutely no fonts embedded in any flas. But the font for the individual textfield is always in the font embed list, no matter how many times I remove it. If i click on the embed button for the textfield to check it there is no embedding then the font is added to the list without any character ranges. Can someone explain to me what's going on here?
