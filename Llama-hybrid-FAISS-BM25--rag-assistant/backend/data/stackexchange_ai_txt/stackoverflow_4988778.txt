What is the difference between mousePressed and mouseDragged in my program?

In a drawing program like Microsoft’s PaintTM, one of the features available is drawing straight lines. You can draw a straight line by pressing down on the mouse to indicate where the line should start. Then, with the mouse still pressed down, you may move the mouse (a mouse drag), and the end point of the line is created as you move. When you release the mouse, the line remains. You may repeat this process many times, creating many different lines in your PaintTM document. If you wish to emulate this effect in a java program, you may use MouseListener (the mousePressed method), and MouseMotionListener (the mouseDragged method), to create a line segment. In addition, we would like to be able to clear the paint area with a “clear button” at the top. Also, we would like to change the colors of all of the lines by placing some “color buttons” at the top. In order to accomplish all of this, you will need to use arrays of coordinates, because each time you call repaint, you will need to redraw all of the lines stored. */ import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; //brings in the ability to read loops by 'event' of something import javax.swing.*; //interface that extends both the MouseMotionListener and MouseListener interfaces public class Draw extends JApplet implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener { private int [] x; private int [] y; private boolean changed = true; Display draw; public void init() { draw = new Display(); //use Display not draw setContentPane(draw); //lets you draw the stuff draw.setBackground(Color.green); //sets the background color to whatever you want draw.setFont (new Font("SansSerif", Font.BOLD, 24)); //this sets the font size and type draw.addMouseListener(this); draw.addMouseMotionListener(this); //adds the MouseMotionListener } //to read in actions of the mouse class Display extends JPanel { public void paintComponent(Graphics g) //Graphics __ 2 && y 2 && x
