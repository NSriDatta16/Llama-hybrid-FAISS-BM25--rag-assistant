New to Data Science - What to use when looking for a pattern/relationship between items and an outcome

I am new to data science and I am hoping I can start applying it to my job. I have watched some videos on places like Udemy for Machine Learning and Python etc. Anyway, I have a task but I am not sure what I need to look into to solve it. I have a PCB/Circuit board which has 80 components on it. I also have a piece of test equipment that measures each component and logs the results with a reading of what was measured and then a simple 1 or 0 for the result I.E. Pass/Fail Lately we have notice a component has started to fail a lot on the tester. One of the tasks I have been give is has any of the other components changed in their readings and could this have an effect? So my question is, what would I use if I wanted to see if another component potentially has influence? An example may help if my explanation is poor. Lets says I have these components and the general readings I expect Component Reading Outcome C1 1.5 nf Pass C2 1.0 uf Pass C25 10 nf Pass R22 100 kohms Pass R53 150 kohms Pass Now lets say C25 is failing because the reading has gone up. Component Reading Outcome C1 1.5 nf Pass C2 1.0 uf Pass C25 12 nf Fail R22 80 kohms Pass R53 150 kohms Pass If you notice, R22 has dropped. Now say that this is the pattern. If R22 reads low then C25 can read high and potentially fail. What can I use to find this link/pattern/relationship?
