Hibernate, Persistence and @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations problems

I have some problem with @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations. I have two class Suite and SuiteVersion. A SuiteVersion is dependent of a suite. So i have implemented this in my code: Class Suite : @OneToMany(mappedBy = "suite") @Cascade(CascadeType.DELETE_ORPHAN) private List listSuiteVersion = new ArrayList (); Class SuiteVersion : @ManyToOne() @Cascade({org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE}) private Suite suite; But i have some problem when i delete a Suite whose have SuiteVersion associated. Hibernate don't delete SuiteVersion before Suite.I don't know why because i have mentioned this in my code : @Cascade(CascadeType.DELETE_ORPHAN) This the log i obtained when i delete suite : Hibernate: delete from SUITE where ID_SUITE=? 13 août 2010 09:40:50 org.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter logExceptions ATTENTION: SQL Error: -8, SQLState: 23504 13 août 2010 09:40:50 org.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter logExceptions GRAVE: integrity constraint violation: foreign key no action; FK42895651EA304E6 table: SUITE_VERSION Thank you in advance for your help.
