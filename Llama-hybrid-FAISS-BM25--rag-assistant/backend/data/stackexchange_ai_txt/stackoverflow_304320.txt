Good question... theoretically the answer is no, but practically it's vendor dependent. My solution would be to have the server check the user-agent and dynamically tag the page accordingly to what you find out when testing cross-browser implementation. Unfortunately this is one of those things you can't do dynamically on the client (change doc type) as you would with Javascript implementation fixes.
