Using both programmable and fixed pipeline functionality in OpenGL

I have a vertex shader that transforms vertices to create a fisheye affect. Is is possible to just use just the vertex shader and use fixed pipeline for the fragment portion. So basically i have an application that doesnt use shaders. I want to apply a fisheye affect using a vertex shader to transform all vertices, and then leave it to the application to take care to lighting, texturing, etc? If this is not possible, is it possible to get a fisheye affect by messing with the contents of the gl back buffer? Thanks
