Writing/Reading arrays of Data in Open Office using Python. Anyone have any example code?

So I have written a class that makes it extremely easy to interface with either Excel or Gnumeric using Python, and would like to extend the class to include Open Office as well. I could do this in 30 minutes if I just had the ability to do the following: Set a single value on an arbitrary sheet and workbook Get a single value on an arbitrary sheet and workbook If these are slow/there is a way to do the following, I also need to be able to: set/get an array ''' set/get a matrix ''' ALSO, the ability to create and rename sheets would be great. This is a shoutout if anyone has worked on this before. If they give me the information, I will reference them at the top of the file My project can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyworkbooks/ and I encourage you to check it out.
