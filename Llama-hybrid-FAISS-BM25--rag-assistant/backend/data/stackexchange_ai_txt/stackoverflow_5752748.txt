Implementing restful servers with Django for Dojo's JsonRestStore - Which tools for the job?

I'm writing some restful serverside resources which talk with dojo's JsonRestStore (JRS) on the client-side: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojox/data/JsonRestStore.html I notice that there are a couple of projects that I may be able to leverage to help create restful resources (i.e. to expose simple CRUD operations on Django models): http://code.google.com/p/django-rest-interface/ and http://django-rest-framework.org/ I'm confident that I could write the restful serverside interface for Dojo's JRS from scratch, but I don't want to reinvent any wheels, so, my questions are: What's the difference between the above projects? Will either help me with the stated goal? Are there any others projects I might want to look at for this task? Note that there are some specific details of the way that JRS makes requests and expects responses that I will need to implement. Here's a couple of (incomplete) examples so that you know what I'm talking about. Creation: respond with status of 201 and a Location: /path/id header for the newly created resource. Collections: parse the Range: items=x-y header and use this to paginate a response. Respond with the Content-Range: items x-z header. Serialise models in JSON as a list of dictionaries for collections, or a simple dictionary for single items.
