Say, you have $N$ total possibilities ( $10^6$ in your case). Probability of guessing the correct number at $x$ -th guess means $x-1$ wrong guesses followed by a correct guess, that is ( $x>1$ ): $$p_x=\frac{N-1}{N}\frac{N-2}{N-1}...\frac{N-x+1}{N-x+2}\frac{1}{N-x+1}=\frac{1}{N}$$ Probability of guessing the correct number upto (and including) $x$ -th guess is $$\sum_{k=1}^x p_k=\frac{x}{N}$$ One intuitive way to think the latter is the coverage of your guesses. You cover $x$ out of $N$ guesses in total, which means $x/N$ is the probability that you'll guess the correct number in at most $x$ guesses. Edit , assumptions to recall: Guesser guesses numbers without replacement (i.e. won't guess the same number again if wrong) and equiprobable The selection of the random 6-digit number is equiprobable among all possibililities
