Convolution and Cross Correlation in CNN

What would be the intuition behind using the convolution and cross correlation operation inside Convolutional Neural Networks? I am interested in putting together the theory from Digital Image Processing where these 2x operations are defined, and CNNs. Could anyone help me connect the dots?
