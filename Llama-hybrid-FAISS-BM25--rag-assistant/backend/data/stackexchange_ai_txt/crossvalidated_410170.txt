What are the main approaches to the foundation of statistics without probability

The frequentist, likelihood and, to an even greater extent, Bayesian approaches to statistics are all based on probability. Without probability, it seems difficult to use a data sample ("seen" cases), to infer results about a more general population ("unseen" cases), and estimate the uncertainty inherent in such a process. Thus it would appear that all we can do is descriptive statistics, as well as some trivial inequalities (such as, if we observe a person of height 2.0 mt, we know that the maximum height in the population of all living persons is $\geq$ 2.0 mt). Or is it? Are there mathematically rigorous approaches to the foundation of statistics, which do not rely on the theory of probability, and can you point me to references on the subject?
