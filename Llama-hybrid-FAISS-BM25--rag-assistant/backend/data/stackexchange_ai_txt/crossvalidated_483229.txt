Can I move the variables of a neural network from output to input?

Supposed I try to train an artificial neural network (ANN) function f1(x1,x2) = y1,y2, which uses 2 inputs and give 2 outputs. Then is it logical / correct / workable to change the objective fn to f2(x1,x2,y1) = y2? Can I use this to get the correct prediction? The reason why I am doing this is because I am trying to do some constraint optimization. The optimization library Hyperopt, allows input constraint e.g. 10 20. If I change my objective fn to that of f2, I will be able to get max y2 which satisfies my x1, x2 and y1 constraints.
