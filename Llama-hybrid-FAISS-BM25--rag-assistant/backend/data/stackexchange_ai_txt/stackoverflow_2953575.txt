How to sniff local outgoing network traffic in .NET without using PCap?

I'd like to somehow hook into the local system's network stack to capture outgoing network packets without using Winpcap. Unfortunately it tends to crash my system every now and then. Is there a way to "sniff" outgoing traffic of the local system from a user space process written in a .NET language?
