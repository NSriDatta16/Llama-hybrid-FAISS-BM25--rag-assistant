Tell ipython to keep temp files

There have been a few occasions in which I've got some code in some temp files thanks to ipython's %edit feature, and through some tragic sequence of events or other I end up exiting the shell before saving the code permanently. Is there any setting anywhere that makes the temporary files, how should I say this ... not so temporary?
