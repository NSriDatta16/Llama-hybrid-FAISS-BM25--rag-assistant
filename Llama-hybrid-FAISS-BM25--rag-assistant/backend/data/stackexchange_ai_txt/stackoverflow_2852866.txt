What you could do to get the users attention without being annoying is to change the windows text this is protable with a simple: shellName.setText("task 20% complete") this would allow the user to get an update while having the window minimized and then add a focus listener to return the window to its normal text when focus is regained. This would allow for minimal intrusiveness while informing the user.
