If you set your project dependencies correctly then you don't need to add any additional dependencies in the linker tab. What's more, dependencies set correctly ensure that the matching build configuration is linked rather than you having to make sure you set the correct additional directories in the linker. In general it's best to use the project dependencies to organise your linkage where possible and only add truly 'additional' libraries directly to the linker tab.
