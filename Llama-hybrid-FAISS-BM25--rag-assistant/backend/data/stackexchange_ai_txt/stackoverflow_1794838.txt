Perl 142 char (not counting reading args on command line and final print. Well, most of code is the beaver program, the engine itself is only 46 char. I changed input format to put the state at it's position in the string. I don't feel guilty at all as otherwise most of code was going to be border management when head was out of string. Even in this version string border management cost 17 chars... The trick is just to remember you can express turing machines as Markov chains... what I did with regexes. perl -e '$b=shift;%p=qw(A0|A$ 1B ^A1|0A1 C01 1A1 C11 0B0|^B0 A01 1B0|1B$ A11 B1 1B 0C0|^C0 B01 1C0|1C$ B11 C1 1H);while($b!~/H/){$b=~s/$_/$p{$_}/for keys%p}print"$b\n"' 00A1011 111H1111 Note: as a matter of fact this is not really golfed yet but just a naive first attempt. I may come back with something real short.
