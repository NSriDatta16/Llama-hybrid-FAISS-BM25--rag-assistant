The controls collection is empty because when script tags are present, literal controls are not added to the control tree. However, server controls will still get added. So: Content2: will return Content 2: 1 Rick Strahl has a great article that explains this behavior : To make code like this work, ASP.NET needs to override the rendering of the particular container in which any script code is hosted. It does this by using SetRenderMethodDelegate on the container and creating a custom rendering method ... Rather than building up the control tree literal controls, ASP.NET only adds server controls to the control tree when tags are present for a container. To handle the literal content and the script markup, ASP.NET generates a custom rendering method. This method then explicitly writes out any static HTML content and any script expressions using an HTML TextWriter. Any script code ( ) is generated as raw code of the method itself. Unfortunately I can't think of any elegant solution to this conundrum.
