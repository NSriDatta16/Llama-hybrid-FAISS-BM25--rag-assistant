Welcome to the site AndresD. I would suggest you instead use the vegan package using the rda function to build your PCA, as this package has the ordihull function that can produce your group centroids - here is a tutorial . The documentation for ordihull is a little clearer than the factoextra package from what I can see and details that the ellipsoid is defined by a 95% confidence interval and you can manually change this if desired. The second reason I point you to vegan is the adonis2 function (don't use adonis , it is deprecated). This allows you to carry out a permutational multivariate analysis of variance ( PERMANOVA ) that will allow you to test if the two group centroids are statistically different from one another. Essentially this test will take your PCA object and then allow you to test whether the two groups are statistically different in n-dimensional space (i.e. do their traits differ). It does carry with it the assumption of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions , which is analogous to the equality of variance assumption that (univariate) linear models holds; you can test this using the vegan::betadisper function. The data you showed likely violates this assumption though and probably aren't different as you pointed out... Let me know if anything is unclear.
