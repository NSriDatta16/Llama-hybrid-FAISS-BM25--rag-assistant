Why is Internet Explorer 6 still a corporate favorite in some organizations?

... or How can I convince my organization to ditch Internet Explorer 6? Having to maintain Internet Explorer 6 compatibility when developing web applications is a nightmare - but until my client decides to ditch it as the official browser, I am stuck with it. I am trying to convince our system administrators to change. I've seen a long list of arguments against using Internet Explorer 6 in any environment, and I am trying to anticipate their arguments rebuttals. So far, the only perceived advantages I can see in Internet Explorer 6 are: Central management through group policies Legacy application compatibility Both of these are addressed by Internet Explorer 7 or later (AFAIK). Are there any advantages that Internet Explorer 6 has that are not already addressed by Internet Explorer 7 or later?
