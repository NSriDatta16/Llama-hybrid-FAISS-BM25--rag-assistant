I've seen this code around to do this. But it's from a 2003 mailing list post that also promises a more elegant (and supported) way of doing it. Might not be the best, but it could work, give it a try. REXML::Attribute.class_eval( %q^ def to_string %Q[#@expanded_name="#{to_s().gsub(/"/, '&quot;')}"] end ^ )
