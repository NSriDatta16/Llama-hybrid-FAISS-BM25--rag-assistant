Partly loaded javascript file

we have a FreeBSD OS system, an nginx webserver and php-fpm as PHP CGI. Sometimes .js and .css files are loaded only partly, about 5-7 words in the end of the file are missing, so we have a problem with visual part of our site as it becomes ugly cause of partly loaded javascript or css file. We tried to disable gzip, but it did not help us. Usually this happens after we upload modified css or javascript file. Nginx version: 0.7.65 Nginx configuration: worker_processes 100; worker_priority -5; worker_rlimit_nofile 51200; events { worker_connections 51200; use kqueue; } http { include mime.types; default_type application/octet-stream; log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] ' '"$request_filename" $status $body_bytes_sent ' '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"'; server_names_hash_bucket_size 512; sendfile on; tcp_nopush on; keepalive_timeout 70 30; send_timeout 30s; reset_timedout_connection on; resolver 127.0.0.1; resolver_timeout 10s; server_tokens off; client_max_body_size 5m; open_file_cache max=100000 inactive=40s; open_file_cache_valid 60s; open_file_cache_min_uses 2; open_file_cache_errors on; #gzip on; .................. .................. I hope this part of configuration will be enough to help us.
