Web application Development - Subdomain

I'm currently at the very early design stage of building a web app that will be used by companies. Each company will have many departments and each department many staff. Each department will manage its own application with staff logging onto the application. There is the possibility that staff across different organisations will have the same staff id. For that reason, I'm thinking of going with subdomains. Each company will have its own subdomain. I've googled a bit about using subdomains and have seen a number of positives, however not too many negatives except for the SEO implications (which do not interest me really.. this app will require direct contact with each organisation.. it's very specialised) Can anybody think of any other disadvantages to going with subdomains? Can anyone think of a better way of doing things? Regards, Fiona
