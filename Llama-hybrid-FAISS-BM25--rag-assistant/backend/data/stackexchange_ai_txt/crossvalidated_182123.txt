I wrote a simulation, to test this. With a small effect size (difference of 0.1, population SD of 1 in both groups), a maximum sample size of 5000, and 1000 simulations it gets a significant result 99% of the time. In 93% of cases, the result is in the correct direction. Interestingly, the effect is massively overestimated - the average absolute difference is 0.3., as can be seen in the histogram below. d I reran it, with an effect size of 0. This took about 16 hours to run. Only slightly more than half of the simulations got a significant value, the histogram of effect sizes looked like this: And the mean absolute difference was 0.40. In short, everything @Glen_b said.
