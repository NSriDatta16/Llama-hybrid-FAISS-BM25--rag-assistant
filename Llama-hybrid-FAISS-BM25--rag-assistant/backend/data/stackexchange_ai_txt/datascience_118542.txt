A sample/example refers to an individual sentence or piece of text. The training dataset is the list of examples you have. Doubling the data size means doubling the number of examples. The 2048 token limit applies to each of the examples used to fine-tune the model. This is the maximum sequence length that GPT-3 can process (see this Twitter thread ). Note that the equivalence of 2048 tokens to 1500 words is an estimation for English. For other languages, especially those with different scripts (e.g. Chinese), the number of tokens needed to represent one word/character may be much higher.
