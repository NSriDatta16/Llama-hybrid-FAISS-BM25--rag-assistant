I'm not sure my answer, but as far as i know in languages like C# or Java, where memory is managed my Garbage Collector the memory region is not linear. The GC is freeing the memory that can free and when the memory is low it compacts the memory doing some kind of defragmentation. It moves blocks of memory that program uses to make some space in "the end". Why you need this answer? Do you want to make some low-level memory management?
