ASP.NET session state provider in Azure

As far as I know, the current situation is this: Use SQL session state provider is possible (as I've read somewhere) but it's not supported by Microsoft. So it could stop working in the future. Also it needs a WorkerRole to delete the outdated data. Azure AppFabric Caching Service is still in CTP. TableStorageSessionProvider is a piece of code in the Azure training kit that is not recommended for production code. What would you choose?
