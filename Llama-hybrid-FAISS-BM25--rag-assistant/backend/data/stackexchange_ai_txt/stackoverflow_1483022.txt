I would recommend you to encourage your developers to use JSLint to improve the overall quality of your code. This tool will look for problems in your code based on a set of rules, and of course, it will detect missing semicolons . And since you are using Aptana, is fairly easy to install the JSLint Eclipse Plugin .
