R_How to select hyperprior distribution for Beta distribution parameter in R?

I have 2-mixture weibull distrubution. And this distribution haver the portion parameter θ whose value should lie between (0,1). Therefore, I am assuming the prior distribution of θθ to be a beta distribution with hyper-priors α and β ie. P(θ|α,β)=Beta(α,β)P(θ|α,β)=Beta(α,β). Is there a way that I can assign some hyper prior distruibution to α and β ? Is there are any there's a closed-form solution ? I attached my code. I need to assign value of prior[9], prior[10]. And i should have the find parameters of 2-mixture weibull distribution with bayesian method. Any recomendation would be very thank you. # Mix_LF : loglikelyhood fn of 2-mixture distribution # ga : parameter of 2-mixture distribution Posterior
