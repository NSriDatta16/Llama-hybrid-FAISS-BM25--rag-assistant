Rationale of using AUC?

Especially in the computer-science oriented side of the machine learning literature, AUC (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve) is a popular criterion for evaluating classifiers. What are the justifications for using the AUC? E.g. is there a particular loss function for which the optimal decision is the classifier with the best AUC?
