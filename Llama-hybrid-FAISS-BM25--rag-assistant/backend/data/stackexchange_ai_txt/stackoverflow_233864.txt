The short answer is: no. The longer answer is: it depends on implementation of ViewState storage. You can provide custom implementation of ViewState which could expire after given amount of time. For example, you could store ViewState in database or on disk and send only some reference to the stored value in a hidden field. Then you can use batch processing to remove outdated ViewState data or perform expiration upon request.
