def isbound(method): return method.im_self is not None def instance(bounded_method): return bounded_method.im_self User-defined methods: When a user-defined method object is created by retrieving a user-defined function object from a class, its im_self attribute is None and the method object is said to be unbound. When one is created by retrieving a user-defined function object from a class via one of its instances, its im_self attribute is the instance, and the method object is said to be bound. In either case, the new method's im_class attribute is the class from which the retrieval takes place, and its im_func attribute is the original function object. In Python 2.6 and 3.0 : Instance method objects have new attributes for the object and function comprising the method; the new synonym for im_self is __self__ , and im_func is also available as __func__ . The old names are still supported in Python 2.6, but are gone in 3.0.
