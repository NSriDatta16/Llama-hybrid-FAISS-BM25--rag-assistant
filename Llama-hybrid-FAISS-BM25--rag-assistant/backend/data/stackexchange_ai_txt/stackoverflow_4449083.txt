Programming to Read and Send email

I would like to create a program that does the following: 1. Monitor all emails received at an address that I own, e.g. subscribe@mydomain.com 2. Read the From and Cc fields and insert those email addresses to my database 3. Parse the body of the email to find a certain text, such as a 6-digit registration code (assume I already have the logic to do the parsing) 4. Reply the emails from a template that includes the registration code and some other data retrieved from my database To make my job easier, I would like to leverage any relevant services out there (maybe SendGrid, apinbox.com, etc.). Ideally all the servers are hosted somewhere in the cloud. My question: Can you recommend the best way to do the above? You can consider me a total newbie in developing such programs, so please be gentle :-)
