The coregion is a notational/sytanx choice for representing parallel CombinedFragments the UML 2.2 Superstructure spec (14.3.3) says: Parallel The interactionOperator par designates that the CombinedFragment represents a parallel merge between the behaviors of the operands. The OccurrenceSpecifications of the different operands can be interleaved in any way as long as the ordering imposed by each operand as such is preserved.
