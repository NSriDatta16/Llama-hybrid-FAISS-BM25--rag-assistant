Subversion, best practice for small team of 5 developers?

we have svn setup through Assembla with CI Team City. I understand source control, my team is new to it? How should we proceed with work? Right now our environment, is not organized as it should be. I am also trying to get Trac working for our group. What should we do each person work on there own branch? Merge the changes back to the trunk when they are done? Or allow them to work off the Trunk and hopefully Teamcity would catch bad stuff?
