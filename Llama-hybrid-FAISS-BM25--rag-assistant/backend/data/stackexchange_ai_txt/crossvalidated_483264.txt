Question text Mining using Random Forest and PCA

I'm currently using the Reuters 50-50 dataset ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Reuter_50_50 ) to predict authorship. I've tried to first use PCA on both the test and training dataset to get a loading summary of all 50 documents by Author then ran a random tree document. I've also removed the words from the test dataset that are different than the test dataset. I know this hurts my performance a bit, but I don't think it would hurt my performance so much. My accuracy is less than 2%. Is my procedure incorrect? I feel like I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Could someone assist me please?
