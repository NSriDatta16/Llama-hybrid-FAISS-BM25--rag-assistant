Yes. It is quite nice in that it saves time right when you need it most (i.e., training takes longer because of more rows). It is especially fine if you are using algorithms that avoid overfitting (like random forest, lasso, etc). You should always validate model accuracy in production anyhow (whether using train/test or CV).
