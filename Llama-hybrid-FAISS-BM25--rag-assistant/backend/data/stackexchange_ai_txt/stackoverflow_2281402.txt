The reason for the page executing doesn't affect the page cycle, the Load event always fires when the page is executed. So, if the Page_Load doesn't run sometimes, it's because the page is cached and doesn't execute on the server. The page can be cached in the browser, in a router somewhere along the way, or on the server using server side page caching. If you haven't enabled server side page caching for the page, it's cached in the browser or in the network. You can use cache settings to try to elliminate this: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); This will keep the page from being cached in normal circumstances. (Check also that your browser isn't in offline mode, then it will use anything in the cache regardless of it's cacheability settings.)
