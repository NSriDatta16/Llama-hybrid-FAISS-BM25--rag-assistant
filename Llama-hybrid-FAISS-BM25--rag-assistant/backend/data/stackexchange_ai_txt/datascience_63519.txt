Not sure to understand what you are asking. Your purpose is to find the only one best group ? From the picture you provided, two things are unclear to me: A and B areas don't have the same width, how are you defining your width ? A and B are covering areas where the signal looks exactly the same. Is it that for the sake of the example you copy-pasted some fake data or does it have to do with what you are finally trying to do ? If your width is fixed then you should be able to compute a series of local averages and pick out the best one.
