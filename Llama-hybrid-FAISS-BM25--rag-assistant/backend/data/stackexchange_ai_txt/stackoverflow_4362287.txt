I don't think there is a simple way to do this. Basically you need to iterate over the request's query parameter names and look for the parameter or parameters that don't have a value. I suspect that you will need to resort to embedding a Java scriptlet, or writing your own Tag (in Java). A better idea is to stick to "name=value" syntax in your URL query.
