Document management, SCM?

This might not be a hard core programming question, but it's related to some of the tools used by programmers I suspect. So we're a bunch of people each with a bunch of documents and a bunch of different computers on a bunch of operating systems (well, only 2, linux and windows). The best way these documents can be stored/managed is if they were available offline (the laptop might not always be online) but also synchronized between all the machines. Having a server with extra reliable storage be a "base repository" seems like a good idea to me. Using a SCM comes to my mind and I've tried Subversion, and it seems to be a good thing that it uses a centralized repository - but: When checking out the total size of the checkout is roughly double the original size. Big files or big repositories seem to slow it down. Also I've tried rsync, which might work - but it's a bit rough when it comes to the potential conflict. Finally I've tried Unison (which is a wrapping of rsync, I think) and while it works it becomes horribly slow for the big directories we have here since it has to scan everything. So the question is - is there a SCM tool out there that is actually practial to use for a big bunch of both small and big files? If thats a NO - does anyone know other tools that do this job? Thanks for reading :)
