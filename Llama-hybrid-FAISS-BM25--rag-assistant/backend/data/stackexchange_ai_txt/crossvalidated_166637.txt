How do frequentists guess a distribution?

With competing hypotheses such as testing if a coin is fair , frequentists and Bayesians have their own approaches. What about for coming up with a distribution? In An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances , Bayes guesses a posterior distribution through choosing a particular distribution (prior) and then flipping a few times. What about for frequentists? What is their approach to that particular problem if they do not choose a distribution? Part of a series in trying to understand Bayesian inference 1 2 3 .
