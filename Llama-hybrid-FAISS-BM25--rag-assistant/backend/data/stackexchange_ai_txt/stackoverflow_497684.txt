Microsoft Outlook 2002 and above removes "extra line breaks" from text messages by default (kb308319) . That is, Outlook seems to simply ignore line feed and/or carriage return sequences in text messages, running all of the lines together. This can cause problems if you're trying to write code that will automatically generate an email message to be read by someone using Outlook. For example, suppose you want to supply separate pieces of information each on separate lines for clarity, like this: Transaction needs attention! PostedDate: 1/30/2009 Amount: $12,222.06 TransID: 8gk288g229g2kg89 PostalCode: 91543 Your Outlook recipient will see the information all smashed together, as follows: Transaction needs attention! PostedDate: 1/30/2009 Amount: $12,222.06 TransID: 8gk288g229g2kg89 ZipCode: 91543 There doesn't seem to be an easy solution. Alternatives are: You can supply two sets of line breaks between each line. That does stop Outlook from combining the lines onto one line, but it then displays an extra blank line between each line (creating the opposite problem). By "supply two sets of line breaks" I mean you should use "\r\n\r\n" or "\r\r" or "\n\n" but not "\r\n" or "\n\r". You can supply two spaces at the beginning of every line in the body of your email message. That avoids introducing an extra blank line between each line. But this works best if each line in your message is fairly short, because the user may be previewing the text in a very narrow Outlook window that wraps the end of each line around to the first position on the next line, where it won't line up with your two-space-indented lines. This strategy has been used for some newsletters . You can give up on using a plain text format, and use an html format.
