Don't use an accumulator unless it's absolutely unavoidable. It introduces unnecessary statefulness and branching into your procedures, which you then have to track manually. By returning early, you can reduce the state and branch count of your code. Specifically in the past I've heard that structured programming in C avoids having multiple exit points for a function. Precisely the opposite -- structured programming discourages multiple points of entry , but multiple points of exit are acceptable and even encouraged (eg "guard clauses").
