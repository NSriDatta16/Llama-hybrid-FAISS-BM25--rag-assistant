Encoding Problem

I want to export the data from a DaraGrid into an Excel file. Having these data in a french language Here you are my method: public static void ExportGridView( DataGrid dataGrid, string fileName) { HttpResponse m_Response = HttpContext.Current.Response; m_Response.Clear(); m_Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", string.Format("attachment;filename={0}", fileName)); m_Response.Charset = ""; m_Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream"; //"application/vnd.xls"; m_Response.ContentEncoding = Encoding.UTF32; StringWriter stringWrite = new StringWriter(); HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new HtmlTextWriter(stringWrite); dataGrid.RenderControl(htmlWrite); m_Response.Write(stringWrite.ToString()); m_Response.End(); } Otherwise the output isn't in a the good French format Ex ) Engagé => engagÃ© Société => SociÃ©tÃ©
