How is loss calculated in truncated BPTT, for a many to one problem?

In many resources I refered to such as Justin Johnson's Lecture 12 on RNN, truncated BPTT is explained as the process of feedforward and backpropagate for smaller chunks of the sequence. These explanations says loss is calculated for each chunk and the last hidden state from the previous chunk is used as the initial hidden state for the next chunk. But in a many to one problem when there is a target available only at the last time step, how is loss calculated for the chunks? Or how truncated BPTT works in such cases
