I've tried dragging an dropping and image their editor. It will pick up the path if the file is on a web page, but if it's on your local drive, the path will be "file://c:....", which will not be uploaded with the message and will end up as a broken image. Browser don't have access to the local file system, for security reasons, so I doubt this would ever work the way you describe.
