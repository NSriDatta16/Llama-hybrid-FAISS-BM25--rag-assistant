How do I embed images from database into web pages

One possible way of storing images in a database is as a stream of bits. This works as a storage mechanism, but I can't figure out how to embed this data into a webpage as an image once I extract it to fulfill a client request. I'm working with Servlets in Java. Can anyone give me some guidance?
