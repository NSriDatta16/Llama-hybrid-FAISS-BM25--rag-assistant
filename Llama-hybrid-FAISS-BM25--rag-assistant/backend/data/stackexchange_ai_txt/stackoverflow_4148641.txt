I have the very same need - migrate 9 years old project with about 300K+ lines of code from D2010 to QT 4.6. I decided to do the following: Port the ADO dependencies to SQLite driver in Delphi using DISql3. Migrate my MS database to SQLite Remove the data modules by putting db controls in wrapper data access classes and the other UI-dependent controls like ImageLists in the forms. Separate clearly the Models (Db access), Views (Forms) and controllers. Begin this way I can start porting the Models and Controllers and gradually perform unit tests Finally migrate the Views (Forms) to QT dialogs. This is the hardest part since an average app depends on at least 3-4 third party controls. For example I heavily use DevExpress for VCL and I am planning to replace it with QTitan (http://www.devmachines.com/qtitan_grid_overview.php) Currently I am at stage 2 but pretty confident that the incremental approach will work.
