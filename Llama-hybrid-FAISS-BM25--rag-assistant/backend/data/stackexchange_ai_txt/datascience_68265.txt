Using Tensorflow object detection API vs Keras

I am new to machine learning. I am curious to know what is the difference between using Keras instead of TensorFlow object detection API. We need to manually configure hidden layers and input layer in Keras so what is the advantage to use Keras and how to know how many layers should configure to achieve object detection using Keras. Please check two different types of implementation 1) Using Keras 2) Using Tensorflow Object detection API without Keras Thanks !!!
