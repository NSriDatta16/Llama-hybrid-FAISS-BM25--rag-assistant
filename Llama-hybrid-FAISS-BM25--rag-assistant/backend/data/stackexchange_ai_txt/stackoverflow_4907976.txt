The correct format for referencing remote EJB with WebSphere Application Server 6.1 in this case would be like: corbaloc:iiop:mums00100251.in.net.intra:2810/ejb/com/bnpparibas/tradefinance/ejb/facade/EjbFacadeHome,iiop:mums00100392.in.net.intra:2810/ejb/com/bnpparibas/tradefinance/ejb/facade/EjbFacadeHome 2810 suggests you attempted to use either the bootstrap port of node agents or deployment manager. I would check the ports (you can find the BOOTSTRAP port from the management console under Ports section of the server preferences), and if they still fail use the actual application servers' bootstrap ports. There could also be a scoping issue which would mandate that. If you deployed your application to the Cluster scope it is possible that the naming service only in the cluster members can actually resolve the EJB.
