Here's an idea: Since ASP.net MVC can spit out HTML from the controller you don't even need to build the .ASPX page, just the Controllers for your application. Two ways to do it: public ActionResult myAction() { Return Content(" Hello World! "); } And, more elegant with better performance (depending on the size of the HTML), but more work: Creating custom ActionResult for your pages: public class MyActionResult : ActionResult { public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context) { context.HttpContext.Response.Write(" Hello World! "); } }
