What happens to Azure diagnostic information when a role stops?

When an Azure worker role stops (either because of an unhandled exception or because Run() finishes), what happens to local diagnostic information that has not yet been transferred? Microsoft documentation says diagnostics are transferred to storage at scheduled intervals or on demand, neither of which can cover an unhandled exception. Does this mean diagnostic information is always lost in this case? This seems particularly odd because crash dumps are part of the diagnostic data (set up by default in DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration.Directories). How then can you ever get a crash dump back (related to this question )? To me it would be logical if diagnostics were also transferred when a role terminates, but this is not my experience.
