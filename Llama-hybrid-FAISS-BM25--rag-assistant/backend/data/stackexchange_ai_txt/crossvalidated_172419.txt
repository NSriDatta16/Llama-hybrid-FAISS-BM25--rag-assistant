I agree with EdM. Your overarching question reads like survival analysis. CRAN has a whole Task View associated with the various flavors and packages for survival analysis. Alternative, you might look into a mixed effects logistoc regression model . Logistic, because you have a dichotomous outcome (retired, not retired); mixed, because you likely have both fixed and random effects. There are repeated observations for the same individual. I do not use this technique myself, but I know of colleagues who use it for estimating probability of a student dropping out from school. Seems pretty analagous. A random forest seems like an odd choice, to me; it'll build out, no doubt, but you're not really exploiting the repeated observations, and the time element.
