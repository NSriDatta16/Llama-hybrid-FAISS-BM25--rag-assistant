How to account for spatial auto-correlation when testing for differences in community composition

I am looking to test whether several continuous environmental environmental might influence bacterial community composition in soil samples. A total of 50 soil samples were collected, but in a blocked manner (10 blocks of 5), such that the samples within a block were all fairly close together. e.g. the first 15 are drawn below. I've labelled the blocks A, B, C etc. I have a table showing site, by abundance of bacterial species, and have used this to produce a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. My environmental measurements were taken from all of the 50 soil samples. As stated, my aim is to test whether changes in the community composition are related to changes in these environmental variables. So far, I've used the adonis function from the R package vegan to try and test this - adonis is essentially permanova. adonis(bray_curtis_dissmilarity ~ env1 + env2 + env3) My concern is that both the bacterial communities and environmental variables might be spatially auto-correlated (i.e. samples close together might be more similar than samples further apart, irrespective of the effects of the environmental variables). This might be exacerbated by the blocked sampling design. I do know the distance (in cm) between each sample, so could potentially partial out the spatial distance, but I'm not sure if this is possible. Is there a better way to analyse this data, or a way to modify the adonis analysis? I've seen various types of ordination method (cca, rda, envfit etc), but am not sure which if any of these deal with spatial autocorrelation.
