MYSQL myisam Repair with keycache

I'm disabling keys; bulk load data; and then re build the index on a myisam table. however, the last part takes forever because it is Repair with keycache instead of repair by sort here are my variables, I have about 100 million records in the table, each row has one integer primary key, one smallint column, and one varchar(256) column. my myisam_max_sort_file_size is 500G, I doubt that the thereotical max size of the indices will be anywhere close to that. mysql> show variables where variable_name like '%myisam%'; +---------------------------+----------------------+ | Variable_name | Value | +---------------------------+----------------------+ | myisam_data_pointer_size | 6 | | myisam_max_sort_file_size | 536870912000 | | myisam_mmap_size | 18446744073709551615 | | myisam_recover_options | OFF | | myisam_repair_threads | 1 | | myisam_sort_buffer_size | 4294967296 | | myisam_stats_method | nulls_unequal | | myisam_use_mmap | OFF | +---------------------------+----------------------+ my box has 8 GB of RAM and 250GB of storage, why doesn't MYSQL use repair with sort?
