regression using two datasets, I am confused

I am currently working on a group project about how the proportion of staff who are vaccinated in nursing home affect the flu risk of the elderly who stays in nursing home. It looks simple at first, but we are given two separate datasets: Dataset 1 (Elderly patients) | ID | Age | Sex|Nursing Home | Flu Status (0/1)| | -------- | -------------- | --| --| --| | 1| 66| M| A| 0| | 2| 79| F| B| 1| | 3| 88| M| C| 1| | 4| 72| F| B| 1| ... Dataset 2 (Nursing Home Staff) | ID | Age | Sex|Nursing Home | Vaccination(Yes/No)| | -------- | -------------- | --| --| --| | 1| 35| M| C| Yes| | 2| 43| F| D| No| | 3| 46| M| A| No| | 4| 39| F| B| Yes| ... So far my group agrees on that we use logistic regression with flu status as the response variable for the analysis. But how exact do we account for the proportion of staff who are vaccinated in nursing home when the information is from a separate dataset? Edit: Hi Dave Jonathan, thank you for your comments. Just now we did calculate the ”proportion of staff who are vaccinated” by each nursing home from dataset 2, and then merge to dataset 1 to be the following: | ID | Age | Sex|Nursing Home | Vaccination(Yes/No)| Vac Proportion| | -------- | -------------- | --| --| --| --| | 1| 35| M| C| Yes| 80%| | 2| 43| F| D| No| 72%| | 3| 46| M| A| No| 36%| | 4| 39| F| B| Yes| 55%| | 5| 39| F| A| Yes| 36%| | 6| 39| F| C| Yes| 80%| ... We can see that the proportion of vaccination is a one-to-one function of nursing due to how we calculate it. Does this affect the validity or assumption for logistic regression analysis? I mean, are we on the right track or should we calculate the proportion in other ways? If you have other suggestion, might you be also willing to share? Arigatou
