CRLF is not a single character. They are CR (carriage return) and LF (line feed) characters that together represent a newline in the Windows world (most other systems use just LF). They don't have any "official" graphical representation, because they are control characters. You might be referring to the Pilcrow (Â¶, U+00B6), which is sometimes used to represent a newline (even though it actually indicates the end of a paragraph). Whether or not this character is available depends entirely on the font, but it is fairly widely available.
