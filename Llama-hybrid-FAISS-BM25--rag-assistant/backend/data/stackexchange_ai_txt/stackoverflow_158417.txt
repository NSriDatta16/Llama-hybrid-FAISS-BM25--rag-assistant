What exactly does the customer mean by "supported". Surely it means that the phone in question supports the web application and it's inner functionality - wouldn't it be better then to forget device detection and simply focus on detecting those capabilities required for the app to function properly? For example, if my mobile website requires Ajax to work then instead of listing all the devices which are said to "support Ajax" I could do some simple object detection to find out for myself. Device detection, just like browser detection is unreliable. Yes, it's possible but I wouldn't recomend it... on a project I've done we used the User Agent string to detect various devices. The indexOf javaScript method came in handy! :)
