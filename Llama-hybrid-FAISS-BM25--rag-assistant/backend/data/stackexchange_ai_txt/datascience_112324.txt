PCA followed by UMAP then go into Random Forest

Is it a valid procedure to apply PCA to your dataset and then apply UMAP clustering on the PCA data, before sending the embedded cluster data to a Random Forest classifier? Summary of process: X_train --> x_PCA --> UMAP -->Random Forest Is this a valid procedure to generate a predictive model??
