As far as I know, SSMS doesn't allow you to group schema objects in folders. Your best bet would be to use SQL Server Schema's to organize your objects. Each schema would represent an area of functionality such as 'Customer', 'Security', 'Master' etc. This is a great way to organize your objects, and implement security. Take a look at this SO thread on Schema's: What good are SQL Server schemas?
