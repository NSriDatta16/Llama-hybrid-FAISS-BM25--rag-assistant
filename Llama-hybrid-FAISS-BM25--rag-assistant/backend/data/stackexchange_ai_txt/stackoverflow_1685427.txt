The best way to do it would be as RageZ suggested, using json_encode and json_decode, however JSON doesn't allow you to have the same key name, does it? The best you can get would be this: { "felines": { "cats": [ { "age": 7, "name": "frank" }, { "age": 4, "name": "popeye" }, { "age": 6, "name": "sam" }, { "age": 4, "name": "kelly" } ] } }
