It depends what you mean by 'known' and what your data set represents. If you mean known absolutely and with no uncertainty, then -- philosophically -- there is not much in science (hence, data science) that is 'known' in this way. However, in every data set, there are parameters that can be assumed to be true with respect to the model underpinning the analysis that you're going to carry out. So here what matters is what your data set represents. If it contains physical measurements, then philosophically, every measurement is an estimate up to some degree of precision. If it contains samples of a population, then it is an estimate of some population parameter.
