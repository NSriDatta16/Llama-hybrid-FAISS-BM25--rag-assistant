"PCA" based on distance metric other than $L_2$

PCA is based on $L_2$ distance and is maximizing variance along the PC axes. What if we try a different distance measure (something else than $L_2$ )? Do any methods corresponding to PCA but with different distance measures exist? Can they be more useful than the vanilla PCA under some settings?
