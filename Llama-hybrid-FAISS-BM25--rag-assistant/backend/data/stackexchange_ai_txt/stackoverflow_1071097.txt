Clone MovieClip in realtime

I have a MovieClip with and image inside that I can drag, resize and rotate. I'm creating a little thumbview, so the user can se how it will look. This is essentially a small version of the main MovieClip. How can I clone the MovieClip into a smaller one, so that when I drag, rotate or resize the image in the main MovieClip the small one will be updated with the changes. I have tried BitmapData draw(), but it is too slow. Any other solution? Update Here's the code I'm currently using: import flash.display.Bitmap; import flash.display.BitmapData; function createThumbnail() { var bmd:BitmapData = new BitmapData(mcBig.width, mcBig.height, false, 0xFFBC1C); bmd.draw(mcBig); var b:Bitmap = new Bitmap(bmd); b.smoothing = true; b.scaleX = 0.2; b.scaleY = b.scaleX; mcSmall.addChild(b); } the createThumbnail function is called on every drag,resize,rotate. If someone has a better/faster way, let me know ;)
