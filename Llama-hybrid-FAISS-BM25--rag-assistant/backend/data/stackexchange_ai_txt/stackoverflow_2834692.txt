Not very elegant, but of the top off my head - just use binary search to find the pivot of the rotated array, and then perform binary search again, compensating for the offset of the pivot. Kind of silly to perform two full searches, but it does fulfill the condition, since O(log n) + O(log n) == O(log n). Keep it simple and stupid(tm)!
