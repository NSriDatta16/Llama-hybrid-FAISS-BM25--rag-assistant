If the use of Windows is not crucial, I have successfully used tcpreplay on a Linux machine, run as root, to read arbitrary packets from a pcap file and send them out on a network interface. http://tcpreplay.synfin.net The tcpreplay web page says that it is available for Cygwin running on Windows as well, although I have not tried that version before. http://www.cygwin.com
