Did you split your datasets respecting the base rates? If you did not, you could introduce some bias, as logistic regression intercept reflects base rates. If that's the case, it is possible to simply correct the intercept term (the other parameters need not change). There is a paper describing this approach by King and Zeng , I think in 2001.
