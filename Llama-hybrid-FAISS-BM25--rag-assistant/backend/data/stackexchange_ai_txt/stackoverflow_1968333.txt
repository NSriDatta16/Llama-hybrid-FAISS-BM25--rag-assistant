You should try to set the OnClientClick property in the code side. You try to concatenate strings while defining a server tag, which is unusual. You can add that line to your Page_OnLoad method: btn1.OnClientClick = "return clear('" + txtValue.ClientID + "');"; ...and pay extra attention to quotation marks, they were wrong in the code you supplied, they should be written like the one above.
