Stack overflow in c# app using c++ dll

I've got a c# program which is using a c++/cli managed dll. The dll contains a lot of legacy code, consisting of quite a few win32 windows. Problem is, the windows in the dll need a bit more stackspace than average cough . Since these are not background processes but win32 api I need to enlarge the stack size of the GUI thread (at least I think the win32 api in the dll will use the main gui process). So I need a way to enlarge the size of the GUI thread in a c# process. Since I found no settings to achieve this I tried editbin /STACK from the command line, which works. Problem is, it only works in the command line, if I try to enter it as post-build-step for some reason the stack size of the binary does not change, even though the postbuild step is properly executed and throws no error :( editbin.exe /STACK:2097152 $(TargetPath) (Editbin.exe is in the path, and there is no error in the output window) So how do I get more stack size for my c++ dll? [Update] I noticed a problem using editbin.exe. This does not work, neither in command line nor as post build step: editbin.exe /STACK:2097152 c:\some\path\bin\release\app.exe This does work in command line, but not as build step: editbin.exe /STACK:2097152 app.exe But I need it to work as post build step. I tried to put it into a batch file, echo'd to make sure call and working dir are ok, but still it does not work. Strange.
