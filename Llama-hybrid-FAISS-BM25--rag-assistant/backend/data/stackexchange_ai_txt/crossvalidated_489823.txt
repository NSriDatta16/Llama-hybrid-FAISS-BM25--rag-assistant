How to define covariates for reliability - Cox regression

Hope you are all doing great and staying safe during this pandemic. Here is my question about defining covariates for Cox regression. There are structures where I would like to model their reliability using the Cox regression. The data for the structures is the time (number of years) the structures stayed in a given condition rating (CR) (condition rating 5, 6, 7, ...). Each CR definition and damage severity is different. For example, a structure stayed 10 years in CR 8 then dropped to CR 7, and then to CR 6, and so on. In each of the years for a given CR, salt is used as a deicing agent and the amount of salt in each year is different. How should I define the covariate "Salt_Usage" for each structure CRs? Do I average the salt used during the years the structure is in a given CR? Do I lose any information when I use the average "Salt_Usage"? Is there any better alternative for defining the "Salt_Usage" covariate?
