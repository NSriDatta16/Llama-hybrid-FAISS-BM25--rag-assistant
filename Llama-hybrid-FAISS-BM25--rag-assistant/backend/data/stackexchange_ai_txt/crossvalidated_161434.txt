Kriging will work, since at it's core it is similar to IDW in that it uses surrounding measured values to predict values at an unknown location, with a few perks of being a geostatistical interpolator (including producing semivariograms to help the user understand spatial auto-correlation). I'd also recommend looking into IDW and other interpolation methods to see what suits your needs best. The better spatial coverage your sample points have the better your result will be. If you have access to a GIS package like ArcGIS, through your university this process is straightforward. If not, QGIS is a very capable open source solution. As pointed out below, achieving greater accuracy in your Lat/Long fields would be highly beneficial despite your interpolation method of choice.
