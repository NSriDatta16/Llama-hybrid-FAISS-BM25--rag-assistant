Diebold-Mariano test for one-step forecasts using Mean Absolute Scaled Error

This is my first time doing time series forecasting, so I am sorry for any inconsistencies in my question. But I have two different models that I want to compare. On Wikipedia, I read about Mean Absolute Scaled Error and that it can be used for the Diebold-Mariano test for a one-step forecast to test the statistical significance of the difference between two sets of forecasts. I have calculated MASE for two different forecasts and I want to compare them, but I can not find information on how to compute the test statistic.
