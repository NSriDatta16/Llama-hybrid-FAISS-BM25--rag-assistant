Your question doesn't really make sense. The "element" that "fired" your touch event was your finger. The first element to respond to the touch event is either 1) the one that has the IBAction that was triggered (in which case the sender parameter of the method is the element that fired the action), or 2) the object in which you've implemented the touches(Began|Moved|Ended): method.
