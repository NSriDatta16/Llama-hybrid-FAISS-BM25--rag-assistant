Problem with Verdana when embedding as resource in Actionscript

I'm usually creating 1 .as file per font and exports these .as files to swf's that I load in to my flash projects. This way I can choose what characters to embed. Now I tested copying my verdana ttf fontfiles from my Windows font folder and embedded this to create a Verdana swf fontfile. When I tested running this I tried with some swedish characters with dots (åäö ÅÄÖ). The dots above the characters from some of these charcters was positioned slightly offset (like a few pixels to the right or left). Anyone had the same problem? Example code: [Embed(source = 'fontfiles/verdana.ttf', fontName = 'Verdana', mimeType="application/x-font-truetype", unicodeRange = 'U+00-U+FF')] public static var font:Class; public function Verdana() { Font.registerFont(font); var tf:TextField = new TextField(); tf.embedFonts = true; tf.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT; tf.defaultTextFormat = new TextFormat("Verdana", 30); tf.text = "abc åäö ÅÄÖ"; addChild(tf); }
