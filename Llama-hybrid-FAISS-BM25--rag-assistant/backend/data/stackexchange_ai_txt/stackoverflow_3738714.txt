From looking at that code, their functionality will be mostly the same - the only difference is that pmap uses Futures running on the Agent threadpool as it's underlying primitive, while pvmap uses fork-join. I'm not in a position to say for sure, but I'd expect that whichever one performs better in the general case would become the standard implementation for pmap , unless there are significant enough tradeoffs to make having both worthwhile. It also looks like (for now at least) the fork-join framework only supports vectors, so it's not semi-lazy like pmap .
