Accessing PCA components from caret object in R

I know how to build a model using PCA components in caret package, however I don't know which variables explain which PCA components. I need some help on it. When I perfom the preProcessing separately, like this: trans I can check the PCA components of the data, like this: trans$rotation However, when a perfome the PCA components using the caret package: I don't know which variables explain which PCA components(don't know how to access the $rotation). I don't get the same amount of PCA variables when compared with the code above(even when I define the same threshold). example code using the caret: fitControl How can I know which variables explain which PCA components when I use the caret package?
