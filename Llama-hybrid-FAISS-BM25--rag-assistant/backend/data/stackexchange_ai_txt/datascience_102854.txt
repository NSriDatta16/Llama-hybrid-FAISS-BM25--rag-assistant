My Models giving negative scores

I am new to Data Science. I am trying to use following dataset in order to predict prices for some reason my models except for decision tree is giving negative score. Please help me to build this model. I've tried multiple ways but still not able to succeed. Below is my code: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns data = pd.read_csv("train_data.csv") X = data.iloc[:,2:].values Y = data.iloc[:,0].values from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder',OneHotEncoder(sparse = False),[0,1])],remainder = 'passthrough') X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X)) X = np.delete(X,[0,16],1) from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.svm import SVR svr = SVR() random = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=40) reg = LinearRegression() dec_tress = DecisionTreeClassifier() def get_score(model,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test): model.fit(x_train,y_train) return model.score(x_test,y_test) from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler sc = StandardScaler() from sklearn.model_selection import KFold kf = KFold(n_splits = 3) for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X,Y): x_train,x_test, y_train,y_test = X[train_index],X[test_index],Y[train_index],Y[test_index] x_train[:,:] = sc.fit_transform(x_train[:,:]) x_test[:,:] = sc.transform(x_test[:,:]) linear.append(get_score(reg,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)) decision_tree.append(get_score(dec_tress,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)) random_forest.append(get_score(reg,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)) svm_score.append(get_score(svr,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)) print(linear) print(decision_tree) print(svm_score) Printed Scores : [-5.001783664305169e+21, -2.433328033798912e+25, -3.9981849795247057e+23] [0.12684989429175475, 0.1673728813559322, 0.1016949152542373] [-0.009105278318407573, -0.08897103667576811, -0.028828939964688157] I have tried K-fold with 10 splits as well. Please if anyone could help to solve this. I have tried almost all the models not getting good accuracy. You can see the graphs . There is no linear relation between the independent and dependent variable.Hence I tried logistic regression the max score I get is 0.22.
