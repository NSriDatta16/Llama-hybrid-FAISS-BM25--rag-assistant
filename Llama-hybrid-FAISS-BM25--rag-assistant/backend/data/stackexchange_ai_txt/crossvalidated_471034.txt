Finding the target distribution for the Metropolis algorithm

Let's consider the Markov chain $X_n$ defined on $\mathbf{X} = \{0,1,2...,n \}$ , generated according to Metropolis algorithm. Let $X_0 := 0$ be a starting state. The accepting rule is as follows: if $X_n = x$ , then: $\text{ }$ let $y := \min(x+1, n)$ with probability $1/2$ or $y := \max(x-1, 0)$ with probability $1/2$ $\text{ }$ if $y \le x$ then: $X_{n+1} := y$ $\text{ }$ if $y > x$ then: $X_{n+1} := y$ with probability $q$ and $X_{n+1} := x$ with probability $1-q$ where $0 . We want to find the limiting probability distribution $$ \pi(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} P(X_n = x). $$ Therefore, as far as I understand we have to find the target distribution of this algorithm. Let's denote it $\pi(x)$ . Here are my attemps. Given proposal value $y$ and the previous value $x$ , we accept $y$ with probability $$P(y \le x) + P(y> x) \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}q$$ and reject with probability $$\frac{1}{2}(1-q) $$ . In general acceptance ratio is equal to: $$ \min(1, \frac{\pi(y)}{\pi(x)}). $$ Therefore we know that $$ \frac{\pi(y)}{\pi(x)} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}q. $$ I got stuck and I do not know how to proceed. Any help much appreciated. I implemented the algorithm in R for n=10. But I have no idea what probability distribution it is. N
