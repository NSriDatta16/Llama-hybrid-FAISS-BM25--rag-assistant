The Hauck-Donner effect , sometimes called "perfect separation," describes a phenomenon which causes the MLE of coefficients in logistic regression to diverge. Suppose we are regressing a dichotomous outcome on a single variable using logistic regression. When all outcomes taking the value 1 are greater (less) than some value C for the feature, and all outcomes taking the value 0 are less (greater) than that same value C, the maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient for the feature does not exist. This is because the MLE of that parameter tends towards infinity, and MLEs do not exist for asymptotic results.
