Simple way of moving root web application to child application of another site?

We have an IIS 7 site that is really very complicated, and also undocumented (lots of virtual directories, child applications etc). We want to move it from its current position (www.xyz.com) to be a child folder of another site (www.abc.com), effectively making something like www.abc.com/xyz/ site files > Obviously you cant drag and drop it to another site so i was wondering if there was an 'easier' way to copy this web application to another folder, rather than going through each folder/iis 7 setting.
