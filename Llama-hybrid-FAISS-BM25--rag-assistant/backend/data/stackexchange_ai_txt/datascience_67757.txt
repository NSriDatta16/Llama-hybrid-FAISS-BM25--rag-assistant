Some things in the field you describe are patentable and some are not. Unfortunately, above novelty and non-obviousness, the current huge hurdle is abstractness. The law on this in the U.S. has changed in the last few years in the direction of making it much easier to shoot down something as abstract. The broader range of processes you intend to cover the more likely that will trip you up. It takes a very skilled patent attorney or agent to draft a specification and claims to avoid the abstractness black hole. You mention attorneys as not understanding your technical field. All USPTO registered practitioners (and those in other locations) need to have at least an undergraduate scientific or engineering background, unlike generic attorneys. I have met several PhD patent attorneys. You can find a practitioner who is expert in your field who has successfully prosecuted other's patents. Your initial costs to answer your question will be a patentablity search and opinion on the abstractness issue. While it is not required that you proactively do a literature/patentablity search to "prove" your idea is novel, a search will save you money if it turns out not to be and can sharpen the focus of your claims to avoid prior work. The initial burden is on the patent examiner to show that it is not novel - then you refute. In the U.S. and other places one does not necessarily need to be a lawyer to be a registered practitioner. Note: Stack exchange has a site dedicated to patent questions.
