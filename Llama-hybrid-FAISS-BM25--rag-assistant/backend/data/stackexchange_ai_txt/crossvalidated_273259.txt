The answer is we don't really apply SVD in recommender systems. Let's check the classical paper (you should read it, it's a good read): Matrix Factorization Techniques For Recommender Systems Quote: Such a model is closely related to singular value decomposition (SVD), a well-established technique for identifying latent semantic factors in information retrieval. Applying SVD in the collaborative filtering domain requires factoring the user-item rating matrix. This often raises difficulties due to the high portion of missing values caused by sparseness in the user-item ratings matrix. Conventional SVD is undefined when knowledge about the matrix is incomplete. So SVD wouldn't be able to do it. It exists only in text-books. The authors suggest an alternative approach known as alternative least squares . I have to be honest I read this paper a while ago, and don't remember exactly what ALS is. I'm not able to provide a description about ALS without reading the paper again. Maybe someone else can guide you if you need further help?
