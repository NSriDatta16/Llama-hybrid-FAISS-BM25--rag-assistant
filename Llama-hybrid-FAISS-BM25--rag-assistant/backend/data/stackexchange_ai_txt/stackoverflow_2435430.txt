You need to create a public resolver that does what you want (more details @ Ivy docs ) Basically save the following snippet under $USERHOME/.ivy2/ivysettings-public.xml. This should do the trick. The unmodified standard installation has 'nexus' in the URL! If you need to deploy artifacts, I think the solution is to do something similar to the shared resolver (see link to docs above), but I haven't tried. I changed your local URL to resolve to the standard 'content/groups/public' which is better since in the maven settings fragment above you're passing all calls through the mirror, not just the ones to central. Just add any additional repositories to that group in the Nexus UI as they come up and you should be fine. If your project loads it's own ivysettings which doesn't honor the defaults, then these settings will not get loaded and you're again back at zero :(
