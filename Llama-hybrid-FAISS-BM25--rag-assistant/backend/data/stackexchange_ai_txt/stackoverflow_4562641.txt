"Log In" and "My Account" have vanished from Magento top-links

I created a new store in magento and made some design changes. Somehow, the "Log In" / "Log Out" and "My Account" top-links are not showing in THAT store... they're showing fine in the other store. "My Wishlist", "My Cart" and "Checkout" are showing fine in all stores. Does anyone know what's going on?
