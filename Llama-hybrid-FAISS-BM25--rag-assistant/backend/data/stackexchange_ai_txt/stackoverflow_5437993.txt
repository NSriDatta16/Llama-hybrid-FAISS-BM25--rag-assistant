Edited Answer This is probably not a good idea. Just divide it into 2 separate queries to avoid unnecessary sort operations from a one size fits all query. You could put the bulk of the query that is doing the joins on tables o , jd , ol (without a GROUP BY ) into a View to avoid having to repeat this. Original Answer (Assuming the 2 columns are of compatible datatypes) select o.organization_name, ol.org_level_name, work_date, code_or_dept FROM ... CROSS APPLY (SELECT CASE WHEN @org_level_type = 'Department' THEN jd.job_code ELSE jd.job_department_id END AS code_or_dept) c GROUP BY o.organization_name, ol.org_level_name, work_date, code_or_dept
