If using Maven is an option, then Maven overlays would be perfect here and it should theoretically be supported by the m2eclipse plugin. But I don't have any experience with that and there might be some issues (see MNGECLIPSE-599 ) so this would require some testing. Nevertheless, the comments of MNGECLIPSE-599 are pretty interesting, especially this one: Any love for this issue? Our entire team has moved to Netbeans for WAR development because of this. We are basically waiting for Servlet 3.0 to solve this issue for us (Servlet 3.0 would effectively negate our need to do overlays in Maven) Our company is big on reducing copy-paste so we use overlays to manage WAR media that must be common in our apps. The way Java EE 6 would make overlays obsolete is not crystal clear for me (through Web Fragments?) but the fact is that Eclipse's WTP release with Java EE 6 support has been delayed to June 2010 . So, until then, you'll need extra tooling (e.g. maven overlays) or should maybe consider switching to NetBeans.
