VSTS Team Build Mail notification should include the "associateChangeSets"

Team Build Guru's I am looking for "Associated ChangeSets" list included in the build mail notifications say, by default we get a build notification like this, Team Project: Content Server Build Number: MerchantPortal_1.0.0707.69 Build Agent: \Content Server\MerchantPortalBuildBox Build Definition: \Content Server\MerchantPortal QA Build started by: ENETDOM\jrichter Build Start Time: 7/7/2009 8:25:30 AM Build Finish Time: 7/7/2009 8:30:49 AM Notes: - All dates and times are shown in GMT -05:00:00 Central Daylight Time - You are receiving this notification because of a subscription created by ENETDOM\enbuild Provided by Microsoft Visual Studio® Team System 2008 What I really would like is an email containing the changes. So the user does NOT have to click an URL to retrieve the list of changes. So...
