Is your input data standardised? What happens when you run it with only one hidden layer? What happens when you set learning rate to 1e-6 or 1e-5? What's your result when you run this through a logistic regression? What does the confusion matrix look like? When you are using class_weights= you should also use weighted_metrics= for your convenience.
