Should I create a JQuery server control for ASP.net to best use it in my apps?

I have been rather successful in promoting JQuery within my organization. No small feat on it's own. However, one of the ideas being kicked around here to make it part of our app is to create an ASP.net server side control. (We are going to be sticking with WebForms for the foreseeable future.) I'm not too wild about this approach as it seems like overkill when a couple of script tags will do the job. We found an article on the web, and the amount of code involved really doesn't seem to justify itself. However, I do hear that there is some benefit in the script caching or generating that happens with the server controls. My questions: Has anyone else written an ASP.net server control to serve up the JQuery js code? Does anyone else think that this is a crazy idea to just avoid writing JQuery or Javascript code?
