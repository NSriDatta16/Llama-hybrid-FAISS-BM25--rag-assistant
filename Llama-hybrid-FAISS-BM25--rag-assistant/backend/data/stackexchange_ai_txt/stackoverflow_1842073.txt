This create a DOM fragment which is pretty quick, creating a lot of them will be slower. var html = $(' .....several more divs, anchors and inputs all with IDs...... '); you can speed up the selectors by giving it the limited context that you know that the elements are in. this.container = html; //since #container is the top div in html, html = #container this.search = html.find('#search'); And then finally add to the DOM This is the append that is slow because it causes the browser to redraw. .append(html); This will get you want you want without having to create multiple DOM fragments which will be slower.
