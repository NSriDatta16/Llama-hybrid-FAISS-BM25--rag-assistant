Econometrics advice needed on unpaired t-test

There are responses of my school's alumni on the skills they perceive they acquired during the studies and are required from their job now. 18 skills evaluated from 1 to 5 (ordinal values, right?). Also they are 18 classes of graduation (around 30 responses from each year). There are also such attributes of the respondents as a master's degree, current status, so on. There is no regression model I could construct up to this moment, but I'm at least interested if the difference in averages of the skills between different groups are significant. I try R over and over. I managed only to tabulate the means for the groups. But then I'm lost. Are there tests I should run the data through first? How to know what distribution my data follows? And what are the ways to see if the means differ significantly across the groups? Is it possible without a regression model at all?
