Multivariate statistics vs machine learning?

Are multivariate statistics and machine learning solving the same problems? I saw that their books are about the same topics, so I have the impression that they are solving the same problems and probably using the same methods. What are their relations and differences? Can machine learning solve the same problems in univariate statistics? Thanks!
