I would consider this a form of data access, although it's not clear to me that you need to put it in the same project as the rest of your data access classes. Remember that the layers are mainly conceptual -- to help you keep your design clean. Separating them into different projects helps organizationally, but is not mandatory. If it's an actual stub class, then the data access project is probably the natural home for it, but if it's only used in the UI layer, then keeping it there would probably be ok.
