sqlite : downloading a db

I'm new android developer, first thank's for all the answers which helps me every day. My question is: I'm want to use a sqlite to have a db with many thousand rows but inserting this takes in average one second per line : it's too slow; my db must be updated every day so I want to zip this db, downloading in a folder of my application(assets ou raws). Android sdk allows this? I look in many answers but i found nothing. Thank's for all. (excuse my English)
