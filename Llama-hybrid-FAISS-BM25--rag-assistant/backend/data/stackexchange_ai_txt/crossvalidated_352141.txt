References Instrumental Variables

is anyone an well-informed about instrumental variable in economics ? I'd like to have a list of good papers or books (i don't know how to identify them) such that f i read and understand completely all of them i'd be an expert of instrumental variables. I already read (in deep) some papers : Angrist and Imbens (1994) : «Idenfification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects » Angrist and Imbens (1995) : « Two-stage Least Squares Estimation of Average Causal Effects in Models with Variable Treatment Intensity » Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996) : « Identification of Causal Effects Using Instrumental Variables » Alet et al. (2013) : « Repetition : Medicine for a Short-run remission » Thanks, i'm available for further details if needed
