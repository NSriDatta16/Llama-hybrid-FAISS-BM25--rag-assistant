This exercise is illustrating that the 'average class size' as calculated by the Dean is not the same as the average class size as experienced by a student. The difference can be viewed this way: the Dean's average is the expected class size when picking a class at random, while the student's average is the expected class size when picking a student at random and asking the size of that student's class. To create a student-centric distribution of class sizes, you need to replicate each class size x as many times as the number of students in the class (again, x ). In other words: for x, p in pmf.Items(): new_pmf.Mult(x, x) This is the sense in which we are 'biasing' class sizes: to give a student's-eye view of the class distribution. It's a legitimate approach, not anything artificial. Both versions of the average class size are correctly calculated; the difference is in the sampling scheme. (Note this exercise is a little muddled: what if a student takes more than one class? The code for creating the biased distribution is making the simplifying assumption that each student takes just one class.)
