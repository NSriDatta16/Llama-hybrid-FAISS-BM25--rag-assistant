How does tree-based algorithms handle linearly combined features?

While I am aware that tree-based algorithms (e.g., DT, RF, XGBoost) are 'immune' to multi-collinearity, how do they handle linearly combined features? For example, is there is any additional value or harm in including the three feature: a, b and a+b in the model?
