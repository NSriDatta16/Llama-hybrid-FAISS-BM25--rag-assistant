Before you start on Rails, I would start with the pick axe book (Programming Ruby by Dave Thomas http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9 ) since you have previous programming exprience and make sure you have a solid grounding in Ruby. Then I would go through the Ruby Koans and do some of the ruby quiz's. Both are fun and great practice. Then I would start with either Michael Hartl's http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book or Agile Web Development with Rails (http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails) make sure you are getting the latest edition. I would suggest Michael Hartl's tutorial first. Don't worry if you feel led by the nose a bit. I found Agile Web Development with Rails, as with a lot of the PragProg books, to expect me to go out and do a lot of research on my own along the way, like in the guides, because the topic is so big. Then, if you don't know Javascript, you are going to want get a solid grounding in that as well. The Crockford book is highly recommended, but i found that I had to go through something basic first before I could understand a lot of the points that Crockford was making. Just remember, despite the fact that everybody talks about how powerful/beautiful Ruby is (it is!) and how wonderful rails is (it is!), normal developers aren't going to tell you that it is easy to learn, at least, not the ones that understand the complexity and depth of both. With both you have to work pretty hard to understand them. With Rails, it takes a while to remember all the conventions.
