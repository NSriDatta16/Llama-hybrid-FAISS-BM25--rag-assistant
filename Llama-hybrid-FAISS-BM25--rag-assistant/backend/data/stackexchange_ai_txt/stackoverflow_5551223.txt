how to zoom sprites when pinching in cocos2d?

I am working on an application where i have to display 50 to 70 images(sprites).I have make a scroll which will scroll all these images but i also want to zoom these images as well I have been following " http://ganbarugames.com/2010/12/detecting-touch-events-in-cocos2d-iphone/ " this tutorial.I want exactly the same thing but that tutorial has make that zoom thing for only a single sprite but i want that on every sprite what should i do? please help me out? -(void)ccTouchMoved:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:[touch view]]; touchPoint = [[CCDirector sharedDirector]convertToGL:touchPoint]; self.position = ccp((-(currentScreen-1)*scrollWidth)+(touchPoint.x-startSwipe),0); --> NSArray *touchArray = [touches allObjects]; if([touchArray count] > 1) { UITouch *fingerOne = [touchArray objectAtIndex:0]; UITouch *fingerTwo = [touchArray objectAtIndex:1]; CGPoint pointOne = [fingerOne locationInView:[fingerOne view]]; CGPoint pointTwo = [fingerTwo locationInView:[fingerTwo view]]; pointOne = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:pointOne]; pointTwo = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:pointTwo]; float distance = sqrt(pow(pointOne.x - pointTwo.x, 2.0) + pow(pointOne.y - pointTwo.y, 2.0)); float scale = distance / [CCDirector sharedDirector].winSize.width * 5; [backgroundScroll setScale:scale]; } } here's the code i am using but it gives me warning at the arrow mentioned in the code that 'UITouch' may not respond to -allObjects' please help me out........
