That compiler doesn't support OpenMP. This is the first mention of OpenMP and GCC March 9, 2006 ... so starting with GCC 4.2 the compiler supports the OpenMP v2.5 specification. The tip off here is that quite clearly the value is defined, yet the #pragma ... line can't find the definition, according to the pre-processor error. Once you realize that the code is using a non-standard #pragma compiler directive, the compiler becomes the prime suspect.
