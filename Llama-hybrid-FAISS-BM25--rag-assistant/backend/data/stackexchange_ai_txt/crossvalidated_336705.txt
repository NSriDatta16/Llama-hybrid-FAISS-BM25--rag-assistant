Regression to the mean doesn't really have anything to do with the normal distribution, it has to do with imperfectly correlated variables. The classic example is that the very tallest parents will have children who, while above average, are not as tall as the parents. Height is normally distributed (or close enough) but that's not the real issue. The very highest income parents will have kids who are above average in income, but not the very top. Income is not normally distributed. The parents with the most friends will have kids who have more friends than average, but not as many as their parents. Number of friends is a count variable and far from normal. Whenever you have two variables that are imperfectly correlated, the top on one will be less than the top on the other.
