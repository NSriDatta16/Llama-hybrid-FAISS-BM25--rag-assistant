This is the way to track traffic if you don't want drivers. If you accept drivers, WinPCap is the way to go. With some more constraints, you could look at established tcp connections (like netstat), but with your requirements I'd definitely go for the raw socket approach you're using. Using your method, data is copied, not stolen. The only explicit documentation I can find stating this is on MSDN : "Received datagrams are copied into all SOCK_RAW sockets ..."
