jQuery resizable(), accessing the original object

This may seem like an obvious thing, but I can't find it. When using resizable, I want to save the new width of the image, but how do I access the ID attribute of the image that I have just resized? This is my code: $('img.article_image').resizable({ aspectRatio: true, handles: "se", stop: function(event, ui){ // Here I want to access the ID attribute // of the img.article_image I am resizing }}); So, the ui object has ui.helper, which I can't use. I.e. ui.helper.attr("id") or $(ui.helper).attr("id") are both undefined. I can't use $(this).attr("id") either, but I CAN use $(this).width() to see the new width, so it's very odd. What am I doing wrong? When using draggable() I seem to be able to access $(this) the correct way, but not with resizable... Any suggestions?
