Restricted permutations

I have some multivariate data and want to investigate the effect of some environmental gradient. I want to use capscale but I donÂ´t know how to deal with the permutation scheme. I have made up some artificial data, with 20 sites along a gradient ("env"): ######### create some species data along a gradient df If I sampled only once I would do something like this: # db-RDA sampled at one time require(vegan) mod Now imagine I sampled the same data trice, but in three different months: # now we replate exactly the same data 2 more times repdf If I would use unrestricted permutations, then this won't capture the repeated measures and the p-values would be to low. I could restrict the permutations within each sites (using strata = site in vegan), but this destroys only the temporal effect and yields to a p of 1 (because every permuation is the same): repmod My question: How should I restrict the permutations assessing the effect of the gradient taking this temporal correlation into account? What permutationscheme should I use? Some ideas: a) Permute the strata ( = sites), but not within the strata. This will destroy the env gradient, so the p-value is only determined by this. b) Include "time" into the model (with interactions) and the run for time-effect a different permutation-scheme (permute within sites) than for env (permute sites, but not within sites). I know about the permute-package and can incorporate it into permutest.cca, so my question is more theoretical.
