How to Normalise data on a Likert scale 1-7

I'm looking to create environmental and social sustainability values for countries, similar to what is carried out here. http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/appendix-a/#view/fn-a In the first step, the individual indicators in each area are normalized on a 1-to-7 scale and aggregated by averaging the normalized scores, such that a social sustainability score and an environmental sustainability score are calculated for each country. In the second step, these scores are normalized again on a 0.8-to-1.2 scale,a which is based on the distribution of each of the two sustainability components. The purpose of this methodology is to reward the countries attaining a relatively good performance on the two sustainability components while penalizing those that register a poor performance. Applying this methodology corresponds to transforming actual averages into coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 1.2. For example, the worst performer on the social sustainability pillar obtains a score of 0.8 and the best performer a 1.2. The same calculation is conducted for the environmental sustainability pillar. $$X_{i,\text{0 to 1}} = \frac{X_i-X_\min}{X_\max-X_\min}$$ I believe the above represents the formula to normalise data? Let us just take for example the following. Income inequality amongst a sample of countries in 2012 ranged from a min of 20.5 to 88.2. In France the GINI score was 40.6. Therefore normalising this data would produce a score for France of 0.2968. However, how would I then transform this into a 1-7 Likert scale, with 1 being the best and 7 the worst?
