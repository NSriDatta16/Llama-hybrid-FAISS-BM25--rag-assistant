I know this is coming a bit late, but I have been using Flash Builder's profiler frequently and one thing I found is that the TimerEvent generated by the timer class uses up quite a bit of memory individually and seems to not get released properly during garbage collection (even if you stopped the timer and removed all references to it). A new event is generated for each Timer tick. I use setInterval instead, even though a few AS3 evangelists seem to recommend against that. I don't know why. setInterval still generates timer events, but they appear to be garbage-collected properly over time. So one strategy may be that you replace the Timer with a call to setInterval() ... which is arguably more robust code anyway and (CAUTION) force garbage collection on each slide scrub (but not on each poll). See this question for more details on the pros and cons. The second suggestion is only a stop-gap measure. I really encourage you to use the profiling tools to find the leak. Flash Builder Pro has a 60-day trial that might help. Finally, when moving to a completely new slide SWF (not a new timeline position in the current slide), how are you making sure that the previous slide SWF got unloaded properly? Or am I misunderstanding your setup and there is only one actual slide SWF?
