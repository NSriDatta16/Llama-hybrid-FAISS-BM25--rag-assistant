How to approximate expectation and variance of an integral from a discrete Time series financial dataset?

I have discrete time series financial data, with time( $u$ ), price( $S$ ) and someVariable( $q$ ) which looks something like this. Time(u) | Price(S) | someVariable(q) 12:00:00.021 | 21.75 | 0.987 12:00:00.373 | 21.85 | 0.952 12:00:00.579 | 21.60 | 0.92 12:00:00.930 | 21.15 | 0.84 12:00:01.126 | 20.25 | 0.81 12:00:01.841 | 20.85 | 0.79 ... Let's say there is some $X_{[0,T]}$ st., $X_{[0,T]} = \int_{0}^{T}(1-q_u)dS_u$ , where $u \in [0,T]$ Now, I can compute $E[X_{[0.T]}]$ and $V[X_{[0.T]}]$ from this data with the above equation by Simpson's rule. Alternatively, lets say I compute $E[q],E[dS],V[q],V[dS]$ from data in $u \in [0,T]$ . Now I'm very much interested in finding $E[X_{[0.T]}]$ and $V[X_{[0.T]}]$ as a function of $E[q],E[dS],V[q],V[dS]$ . Can the latter be approximated to give similar results as former?
