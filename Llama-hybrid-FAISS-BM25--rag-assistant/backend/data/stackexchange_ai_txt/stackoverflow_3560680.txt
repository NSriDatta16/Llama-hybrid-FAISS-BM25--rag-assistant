Using a central git server is not necessary and should be viewed as optional. You would do that if you have some centrlised workflow which must be followed or it is too hard to track your team mates. We use some central github repo because some teammembers are foten on the road and we have traditionally a centralised workflow which is integrated with our hudson CI server. But we started out in a peer-to-peer model at first when deciding we were too frustrated with CVS. For the additional directory : clone the projects from EGit in eclipse or from the workspace directory. Actually i find this rather normal behavior, I think subversion and CVS work similar? 1 project - 1 repo is the norm AFAICT. There are submodules fo rshared components, but I have not figured out yet how to work with them. With the current crop of dependency management build tools, this has become less of an issue in my opinion. Since the git repos are distributed they can be ordered, stored categorized however fits best for the repo in question. Each git repo is freestanding and complete and combined with the dependency managing build tools of the previous paragraph, their actual location is unimportant, which makes for easier integration with IDE's, CI-tools, artifact repos, not because there is special support for them, but rather of not have things sticking out of it which are in the way of smooth integration. There is q free resource which goes in detail : the ful text of the Pro Git book is available here . This also discusses some typical usage patterns.
