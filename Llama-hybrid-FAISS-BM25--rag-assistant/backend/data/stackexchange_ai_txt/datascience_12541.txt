Real-time classification of audio - thousands of classes

There is a need to classify an audio stream in real-time - using one from thousands of the defined classes. Up to 5000 classes potentially. What's the best machine learning algorithm for this task? DTW? HMM? SVM? Some specific DSP algorithms?
