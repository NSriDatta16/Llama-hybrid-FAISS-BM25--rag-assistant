The difficulty of the problem is highly dependent on how erroneous the uncertain labels can be. If the the uncertain labels are right, say, 90% of the time, you can probably get away with just using logistic regression. On the other hand, if the labels are wrong almost half the time, you may need to resort to some special techniques. Here 's one stab I took at a very similar problem. (We had multiple observations per label, but otherwise the setup is quite similar.)
