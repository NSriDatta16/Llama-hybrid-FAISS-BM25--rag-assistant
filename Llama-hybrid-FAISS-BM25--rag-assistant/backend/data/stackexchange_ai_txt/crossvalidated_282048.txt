Can you name some techniques for feature construction that are better than ngram in text analysis?

I have seen in several papers related to text analysis such as : Predicting Vulnerable Software Components through N-gram Analysis and Statistical Feature Selection 2015 The Effect of Dimensionality Reduction on Software Vulnerability Prediction Models 2017 that they used ngram for feature construction. What other choices do we have instead of using ngram that would be a better choice for feature construction in this regard ? Any help is greatly appreciated.
