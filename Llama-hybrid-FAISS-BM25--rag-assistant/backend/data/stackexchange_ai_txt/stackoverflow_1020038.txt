Practice practice practice. As you probably know from learning Vim, Vim and Emacs fluency comes only with tons of practice until the commands become second-nature. I am a long-time Vimmer and learning Emacs was extremely painful and took months, but nowadays I get by in both just fine. It is worth learning both because Emacs is better than Vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks, and vice versa; it's good to have the option of using either. After a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won't have much difficulty (though I still occasionally :wq Emacs and C-/ Vim, it doesn't happen often enough to be a problem). Read the Emacs documentation thoroughly. A lot of the terminology and functionality of Vim and Emacs is similar but just different enough to make it all confusing. The tutorial is a good start but the Emacs manual is a treasure trove of best-practices and configuration tips. The Emacs wiki is your friend. When you come across an Emacs feature that you absolutely can't accept, there is usually a way to configure the problem away. C-h a is also your friend. Much like :h is indispensable in Vim, the Emacs help system is a great boon in navigating Emacs' enormous set of builtin commands. There are many ways to search the documentation to find what you want; this page has a good summary. Don't use viper or vimpulse, at least not at first. Emacs will never be as good a Vim as Vim. Immerse yourself in Emacs until you get used to it. The Emacs way of doing things is very different but it has strengths (and weaknesses) of its own compared to the Vim set of keybindings. Learn them both so you can see those strengths and weaknesses and make an informed decision. Nowadays I have borrowed a bunch of Emacs shortcuts and mapped them in Vim, and vice versa. Take it slow. When (not if) Emacs starts to make you foam at the mouth in rage, take a break, hop into Vim and come back later. It's going to take a while. Keep in mind that you don't need to "switch". You aren't going to forget Vim and replace it in your brain with Emacs. If you know Vim and you learn Emacs, then you will know both. This is a good thing.
