I favour $P$ for P-value partly because that usage goes back a long way and I like history of ideas, but perhaps more because $p$ is already overloaded: I often want $p$ to mean probability in general a particular probability (e.g. in notation for binomial distributions) the number of predictors or covariates. Contrary to that, a reminder or two in text that we are discussing p-values might reduce the ambiguity or puzzlement about what $p$ means. I've not picked up any hint that being frequentist or Bayesian makes any difference to preferred notation, but that's just an uninformative prior speaking. Evidence and argument on that detail is especially welcome. Notation in statistics (as generally in any subject with mathematical content) is a messy mixture of tradition, accident and logic. We have some guidelines, such as Greek for parameters and roman for statistics, but consistency is elusive. In directional statistics, for example, trigonometric conventions dominate and $\theta$ and $\phi$ are routinely names for variables. We would all benefit by agreeing on some better and more consistent notations: there is just the small detail of what those might be. Here is a case of two common notations. It would usually be futile to try to change anybody else's choice. At most we can carp if authors aren't consistent within publications we review or don't follow an arbitrary style standard for a journal.
