How to tell if two time based data series collected from sensors are different or not?

here I am doing scientific research. My background is informatic, so in that manner, I need some clarification and help. We developed a group of sensors that measure the drainage of the battery during operation time. This data are stored in time time-based database which we can query and extract for a specific period. Not to go into specific details here is what I am struggling with. I would like to know if battery drainage is the same or different for the two cases: First case: collected data on the same sensor in two different periods Second case: two different sensors, two different rooms in the same period. From the collected data and the first case I can see that mean values have a difference but not so much Measurement 1 - Sensor 4 = 94,12864583% Measurement 2 - Sensor 4 = 93,97044271% From the collected data and the second case I can that mean values have a bigger difference than the first case Measurement 2 - Sensor 4 = 93,97044271% Measurement 2 - Sensor 2 = 95,03300867% When I plot the graphs they look like this. First case First case - scatterplot (added as suggested by @whuber) Second case Visually I can see the difference, but somehow it does not seem complete. My question is, can I somehow compare values between sensor readings and do a statistical analysis that will say these two time series are statistically different or not statistically different? As I said I don't have any background in statistical analysis so please be gentle with me. I was trying to do a z-test but apparently, I have no sufficient data for it. Actually, the z-test proves that the difference between the first case set of data is not statistically different, and the second that they are. By the way, all sensor measurements start with almost the same batteries charged. Solution - first draft: Based on a reduced amount of data shown in this picture Inserted Scatterplot (Case one) for Node 1 (G118:G132) and Node 1 (B118:B132). After that, I added a trendline and included an Equation on the chart Calculated p-value using this formula =T.TEST(G118:G132;B118:B132;2;1) and tested everything using t-test: Paired Two Samples for Means that looks like this: Repeated the same thing for Case Two where I got a p-value equal to 0,0000000000022239 Edit: Added a scatterplot as suggested by @whuber Edit2: Added a solution for check
