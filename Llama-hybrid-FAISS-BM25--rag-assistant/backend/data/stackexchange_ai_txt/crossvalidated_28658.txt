Probability of a relation on the uniform distribution of points over 2D space

Assume a set of nodes is scattered over a 2D surface $\mathcal{S}$ so that for any given $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{S}$, the number of nodes inside $\mathcal{A}$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $|\mathcal{A}| \rho$, where $|\mathcal{A}|$ shows the area of the subset $\mathcal{A}$ and $\rho$ is the intensity of the points (average number of points per unit area). We are only interested in the points inside a given circle with radius $r$. The number of nodes inside the circle is a Poisson variable with parameter $\rho \pi r^2$. We pick two nodes from inside the circle at random. Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ show the distance of the first and the second node from the center of the circle. How can I compute the probability of the event: $$ {d_1}^2 Edit: Assume $A > 0$ and $B > 0$. I am interested in the process itself, not the points generated by the process (as whuber described in his answer below). How about the case that ${d_1}^2$ and ${d_2}^2$ is replaced with ${d_1}^\alpha$ and ${d_2}^\alpha$ for $\alpha > 2$ (I guess, this modifies the problem since ${d_1}^\alpha$ and ${d_2}^\alpha$ are not uniformly distributed anymore).
