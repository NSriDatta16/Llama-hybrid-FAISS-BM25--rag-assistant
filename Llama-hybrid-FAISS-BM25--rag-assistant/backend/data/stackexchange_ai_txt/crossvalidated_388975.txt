Number of hidden units - function approximation

I have read this thread on how to select the appropriate number of hidden units and according to Introduction to Neural Networks for Java (second edition) by Jeff Heaton, one of the possibilities is - The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer. However, I am trying to approximate some basic functions with neural networks in 3D space, having 2 inputs and 1 output, but if I choose only 2 hidden units, the approximation is not satisfaying at all. Only with more hidden neurons I get better results. Is there something I am missing?
