jQuery autocomplete and back button behaviour?

I'm using the awesome jQuery autocomplete plugin . However I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to understanding browser behaviour and Ajax, so I have a question. This is the sequence of events: User types 'fish' into text box User chooses book title from list of autocomplete options - Fish Farming, Fish Frying, etc HTML loads on page (as ajax) - 'click here for Fish Farming' User clicks on link and loads Fish Farming page User decides Fish Farming isn't for them, clicks on 'back' button - and returns to an empty page! How can I change this so that when the user returns to the home page, they see the Fish Farming html - the page they were just looking at? This is my autocomplete code: // Autocomplete listener. $("#q").catcomplete({ source: "/book_results", select: function(event,ui) { $('#book_results').html(load_img); if (ui.item.category=="Books") { $.bbq.removeState(); var paramsObj = { 'b' : ui.item.id }; $.bbq.pushState( paramsObj ); get_books(null, null, null, ui.item.id); } else { $.bbq.removeState(); var paramsObj = { 's' : ui.item.id }; $.bbq.pushState( paramsObj ); get_books(null, ui.item.id, null); } } }); As you can see, I'm already using the BBQ plugin to update the URL fragment when the user chooses something from autocomplete, just because it seemed like a good idea. So I have my book_id set in the hash - but how can I ensure that the relevant HTML loads when the user clicks Back? Thanks!
