Can someone give a better example of fragile base class issues?

Fragile base class is one of the most common point that gets popped up in every discussion where reusability through implementation inheritance is discussed. Has anyone faced any real issue with these apart from the common square, rectangle examples. Everytime I need to explain this to someone I am stuck with some real world cases where these problems aroused and how this was solved. If anyone would like to share their experience regarding this it would be really helpful. Here's a wikipedia link to understand this problem Fragile base class on wikipedia EDIT: My inputs with respect to this... The problem mostly happens when the base class version changes as the developers using this may not be aware of the extensions happening to the base class implementation and the base class implementor may not have all the necessary details about all the derived classes. And the seemingly innocuous change may break all the derived class functionality. And in any case this is a bad design practice as it will break the OCP principle. Got a nice quote from Joel on Software old forum. Thought of putting it down. "Our inability to sometimes deal with the complexities of modern life is actually an example of the fragile base class problem occurring in nature, the reason being that we're still inheriting many characteristics from our ancestors who led very different lives."
