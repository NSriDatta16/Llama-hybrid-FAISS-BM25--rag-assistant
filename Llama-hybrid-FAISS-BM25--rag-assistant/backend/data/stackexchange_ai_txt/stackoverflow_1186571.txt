Background Color and Italics sets off Internet Explorer 7 bug

The following code demonstrates the issue I'm encountering: p { background-color:#FFF; } This is an italic sentence. This is a bold sentence. This is a normal sentence. When this code is viewed in IE7, the Google logo will be displayed to the left with 'white horizontal bars' running through it lined up with each paragraph, displayed on the right. Removing the first line with the tags causes the lines to disappear. Try it yourself. Remove each of the three lines and see how the bug changes. What in the world is going on with this? -- Resolution: hasLayout issue. Adding zoom: 1 attribute to em corrects the issue.
