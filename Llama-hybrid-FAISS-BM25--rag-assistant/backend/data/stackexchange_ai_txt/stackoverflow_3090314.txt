A really excellent resource is the "Compatibility Master Table" at quirksmode.org. Be sure to dive into the detail tables, linked in the left column. . Half the time I write something now, I'm never certain that the methods my code relies on have the coverage I expect and I don't have the resources to test in every version of every browser out there. This is why, increasingly, if I can't do it in jQuery, I don't do it or the boss/client pays mucho extra. ;-)
