Can a method find out the "this" of its parent object?

Let's say I've come up with a particular sort function that I want to put in the prototype of some Array based object (I'll use Array itself here). I can do Array.prototype.specialSort = function... but what I'd really like to do is Array.prototype.sort.special = function... the problem, of course, is that when it's called, the latter won't know about the Array object, it will only know about the sort, so it can't sort. Is there any magical incantation to pass a "this" down the tree? Secondary question (since the answer to the primary question is likely "no"): What would you do to implement the notion of "sub-methods" with maximum elegance?
