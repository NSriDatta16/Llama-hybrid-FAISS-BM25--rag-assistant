HTML5 has the option to be XML-compliant or not, as far as requiring strict entities, closing tags, etc. So if a strict XHTML format is important to you (as it is to me), HTML5 allows for that. But the flip side of this is that when consuming HTML5 documents from other services, you cannot necessarily rely on them to be strict like you could with XHTML. The best we can do is encourage others to follow the stricter format by adhering to it ourselves and evangelizing it. IMO it helps far more than it hurts.
