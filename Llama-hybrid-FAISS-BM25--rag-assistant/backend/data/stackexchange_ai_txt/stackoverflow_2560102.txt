Lua API for TokyoTyrant

I didn't managed to find an Lua client/api for TokyoTyrant. Such Api exists for TokyoCabinet, but not for TT. And Perl and Ruby API exists for TT. TT provides a native binary protocol, a memcached-compatible protocol, and an HTTP-oriented protocol. So my questions are : 1/ Do you think using the memcached (using luamemcached) or the HTTP protocol (using luaSocket) is "enough" for most / simple usage, and so a native Lua api is not necessary ? (the app is a simple uuid storage/distributor) ? 2/ Does it make sense to not use TokyoTyrant, but only TokyoCabinet, and use Lua at the application level to provide network and concurrent access to TC, using, say, Copas (Copas is , from their website, "a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers." ? Thanks.
