Although I'd go for the solution of Brook myself, I would like to point out another elegant and short solution. public void MyMethod(Somestatus status) { foreach (Action toDo in new Action[] { DoA, DoB, DoC, DoD, DoE }.Take(5 - (int)status)) toDo(); } However, this assumes Somestatus is defined like this: enum Somestatus { Enum1, Enum2, Enum3, Enum4, Enum5 } I like this solution as an academic and because is very short, but it certainly does not have great readability or maintainability.
