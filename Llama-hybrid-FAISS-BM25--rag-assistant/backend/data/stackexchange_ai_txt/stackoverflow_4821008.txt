Try http://www.bostongis.com/ They mostly cover Postgres/PostGIS, though they talk about SQL Server also. There are some pretty good examples. The PostGIS manual is really good too, chapters 4 and 6 in particular, though it is all worth reading. http://www.postgis.org/docs/ch04.html PostGIS again, but this book is really very comprehensive in its coverage of spatial sql, and many of the queries will port to other dbs, particularly Oracle -- as the Postgres devs have made an effort to be compatable with Oracle syntax, where possible. It starts with the basics, but some of the later examples are really very advanced. http://www.manning.com/obe/
