new jQuery selectors

I recently wrote the following selector with a little help from (possbily you) StackOverflow $(':submit[name="Delete"][value="Delete"]').click(function() { return window.confirm(this.title || 'Delete this record?'); }); Q: Now that 1.4 has been released, is there a more elegant way to write the selector?
