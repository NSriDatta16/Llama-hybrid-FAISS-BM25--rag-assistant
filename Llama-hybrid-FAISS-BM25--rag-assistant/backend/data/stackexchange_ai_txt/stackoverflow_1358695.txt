To quote: "Nested collections are handled automatically, but you are correct that top level collections need to be iterated over. Currently there isn't a more elegant way to handle this." Someone has figured a way to do it without a looping construct in your code base , but I think it's just easier (and more readable/maintainable) to put it in your code. Hopefully they'll add this ability sooner than later.
