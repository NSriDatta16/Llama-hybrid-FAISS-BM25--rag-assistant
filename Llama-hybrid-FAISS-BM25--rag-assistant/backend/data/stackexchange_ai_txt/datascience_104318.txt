How can I choose the best machine learning algorithms from all kinds of algorithms?

When I want to find a model for my data set, I find that there are lots of algorithms that I can use. I know how to minimize selection choices by separating supervised and unsupervised algorithms and the purpose of the problem I am trying to solve. But after that, there are also lots of algorithms to choose from, even in the scikit-learn library that I currently use, and there are lots of algorithms that I don’t know. They might work better in my problem and also there are deep learning algorithms that are stronger than machine learning algorithms. After looking for them, I’ve got tired and a simple project cost me a whole two weeks, but I wasn’t satisfied with the result at the end either. So, what should I do? Do I have to memorize all the algorithms in machine learning libraries, like scikit-learn? Or should I abandon learning machine learning algorithms and start learning deep learning?
