You have a wide choice of measures of dispersion, and it really depends on how you want to balance the different values that can be taken with different probabilities (as entropy does) against the width of the range of these values (as variance does). If you wanted something less dramatic than variance because of your concerns about the impact of a rare extreme outlier, you might try the average absolute deviation from the median. For for example A, you would get $$|0-0|\times 0.999 + |1000-0|\times0.001 =1$$ while for example B $$|0-0|\times 0.6 + |1-0|\times 0.2 + |2-0|\times 0.1 + |4-0|\times 0.05 + |8-0|\times 0.05 = 1.$$ It is not quite a coincidence this measure of dispersion is equal to the expectation for these two examples: this will happen for any random-variable where $\Pr(X \lt 0)=0$ and $\Pr(X = 0) \ge \frac12$. But you should look at other measures of dispersion too.
