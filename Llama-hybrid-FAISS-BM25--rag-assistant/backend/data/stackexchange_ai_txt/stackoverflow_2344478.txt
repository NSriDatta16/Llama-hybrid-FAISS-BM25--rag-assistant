I'm poking in the dark here, since i haven't tried anything of this, yet: There's this blog entry from XBinder which claims that they are releasing an android-compatible version "in a few weeks". While that might not be an option right now, they also explain a bit of how they have done it, wrapping a light StAX-like wrapper on the XmlPull support already present in Android. (my answer originally had another paragraph on XStream working on android, but then i read the question again and saw that your problem was with getting XStream to work on the AppEngine side...)
