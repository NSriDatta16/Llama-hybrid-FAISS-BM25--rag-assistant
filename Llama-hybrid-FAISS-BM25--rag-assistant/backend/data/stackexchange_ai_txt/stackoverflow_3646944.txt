creating a WCF client proxy with 3 solution windows open

My WCF service library, the console host for the service, and the client are all in separate Visual Studio solutions. Does this choice of organization impose a problem? I cannot seem to create the client proxy by using the Add Service Reference and Discovery features. When I run the console hosted WCF service, then change focus to the Visual Studio solution for developing a client, invoke "add service reference" and "discover" it says "no services found in the solution". Do I have to develop the client code inside the same Visual Studio solution as I have developed the host code? That would seem unreasonable.
