What's the best way to get a return value out of an asyncExec in Eclipse?

I am writing Eclipse plugins, and frequently have a situation where a running Job needs to pause for a short while, run something asynchronously on the UI thread, and resume. So my code usually looks something like: Display display = Display.getDefault(); display.syncExec(new Runnable() { public void run() { // Do some calculation // How do I return a value from here? } }); // I want to be able to use the calculation result here! One way to do it is to have the entire Job class have some field. Another is to use a customized class (rather than anonymous for this and use its resulting data field, etc. What's the best and most elegant approach?
