Adjusting energy consumption per day for average temperature

For a slight bit of insight, I'm (crudely) measuring my energy consumption (kWh and gas) per day. I have the thermostat set at a constant 19 degrees Celsius. However, I want to adjust the outcome for average outside temperature. How do I do that? I'm not modelling/predicting anything yet, so multivariable regression analysis does not seem applicable at this stage (but if that's the way to go, I'll do it). My data is in has the following variables: Measurement date Electricity (kWh) Gas (m3) kWh/day m3/day Avg. outside temp in period since last measurement (degr. C) (TBD: electricity consumption/degree day) (TBD: gas consumption/degree day) My idea was to calculate the consumption per degree day . Does this approach make sense statistically? Are there any alternatives? Some background: Gas is used for cooking, central heating, and heating water Electricity is used for heating with an electric radiator
