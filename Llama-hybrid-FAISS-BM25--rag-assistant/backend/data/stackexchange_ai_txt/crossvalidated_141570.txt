I think that power output at time t is clearly connected to wind speed at time t (by laws of physics) while power output at ( t -1) is not very predictive of power output at time t . This situation probably will be captured by different regression methods, not just neural networks. Whether it is correct approach or not depends on your task. If you want to forecast situation at time t , from ( t -1), then using any data only avaliable at time t is clearly incorrect. However, if you goal is to predict power output at time t , given some other data at time t , like windspeed, then it is perfectly ok, but it is not actually forecasting . Neural networks are universal function approximators and there is nothing wrong per se by appying them to time series forecasting or other regression problems, while actual results depend on many different factors.
