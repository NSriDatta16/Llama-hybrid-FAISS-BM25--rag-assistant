The logistic regression model is $$ E[y|X_1,X_2,\dots,X_k] = \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k) $$ The coef column displays the $\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots$ parameters, where $\beta_0$ is described as const . On the interpretation of the parameters you can read in the following threads: interpretation of model coefficient in logistic regression Regression coefficient interpretation in binary logistic regression Binary logistic regression: interpretation of regression coefficients The z column shows the $Z$ values discussed in: Logistic Regression Z-value Z test vs Wald Test in logistic regression Why use a z test rather than a t test with proportional data? Those are just examples of multiple threads we have, so check other questions tagged as logistic-regression for more details.
