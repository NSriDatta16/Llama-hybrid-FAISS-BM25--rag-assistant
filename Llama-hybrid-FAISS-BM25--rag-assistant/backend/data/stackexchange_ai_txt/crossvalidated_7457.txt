How to stop excel from changing a range when you drag a formula down?

I'm trying to normalize a set of columns of data in an excel spreadsheet. I need to get the values so that the highest value in a column is = 1 and lowest is = to 0, so I've come up with the formula: =(A1-MIN(A1:A30))/(MAX(A1:A30)-MIN(A1:A30)) This seems to work fine, but when I drag down the formula to populate the cells below it, now only does A1 increase, but A1:A30 does too. Is there a way to lock the range while updating just the number I'm interested in? I've tried putting the Max and min in a different cell and referencing that but it just references the cell under the one that the Max and min are in and I get divide by zero errors because there is nothing there.
