Can it? Yes. Will it? It really depends, but unless you're writing a defragmenter that runs 24/7, it's likely that (1) the system will cache a lot of the disk accesses, and (2) your consumer's computer will be replaced before the hard drive ever fails. In either case, though, if you don't have to access the disk, then obviously just don't. :)
