Mysql DB Table Rows Disappearing

A really weird (for me) problem is occurring lately. In an application that accepts user submitted data the following occurs at random: Rows from the Database Table where the user submitted data is stored are disappearing . Please note that there is NO DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE or other SQL statement issued on the database table except from the INSERT statement. Could this be a bug of Mysql? Did some research on mysql.com (forums, bugs, etc) and found 2 similar cases but without getting a solid answer (just suggestions). Some info you might find useful: Storage Engine: InnoDB User Submitted Data sanitized and checked for SQL Injection attempts Appreciate any suggestions, info. regards,
