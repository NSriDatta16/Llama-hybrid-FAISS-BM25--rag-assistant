With RNN going in left-to-right direction you model sequence $$ x(1), x(2), \dots, x(t-1), x(t) $$ with right-to-left RNN, it goes backwards in time $$ x(t), x(t-1), \dots, x(2), x(1) $$ In bi-directional RNN, we compute both and combine them. What you are proposing is to model the sequence $$ x(1), x(2), \dots, x(t-1), x(t), x(t), x(t-1), \dots, x(2), x(1) $$ If you look closely, now the "second" $x(t-1)$ depends on $x(t), x(t), x(t-1), \dots$ and this doesn't make much sense, since you are introducing some kind of time travel cycle from the future to the past and dependence of $x(t-1)$ on itself.
