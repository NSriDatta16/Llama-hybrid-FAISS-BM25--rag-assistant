Additive vs Multiplicative model in Time Series Data

The above time series plot is a daily closing stock index of a company. I want to know which model between additive and multiplicative best suits the above data. I know what the two models are, but i haven't been able to figure out the correct model for the above data. Also, is there any way other than simple visualisation which can help me decide the correct model?
