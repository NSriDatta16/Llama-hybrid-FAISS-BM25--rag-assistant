Strictly Stationary Time Series with Infinite Moments

Can someone give me an example of a strictly stationary time series with infinite moments? I am reading a book on Time Series by Wayne A. Fuller where it is said that a strictly stationary time series if having finite moments can satisfy the conditions of weakly stationary time series. I want to understand how a strictly stationary time series have infinite moments thus not behaving like a weakly stationary time series.
