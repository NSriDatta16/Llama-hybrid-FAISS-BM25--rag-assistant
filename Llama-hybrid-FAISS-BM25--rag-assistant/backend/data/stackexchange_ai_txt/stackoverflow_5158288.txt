Add Library JAR Files to EJB project

I have created Maven project project using m2eclipe plugin for Eclipse. I have choose ejb-javaee6 archetype and added few dependencies to pom.xml, Eclipse resolved this dependencies fine. When I try to deploy this project on Glassfish server using WTP plugin, I can see that my dependencies did not copy to ear archive. There are few commons ways how to add library jar files to classpath of j2ee application. So I have to copy my dependencies in application server lib directory or copy it to top level of EAR file and provide manifest file of EJB module with classpath information. What is the common way to achieve it ? I want eclipse/maven to automatically add jar files to classpath of EJB.
