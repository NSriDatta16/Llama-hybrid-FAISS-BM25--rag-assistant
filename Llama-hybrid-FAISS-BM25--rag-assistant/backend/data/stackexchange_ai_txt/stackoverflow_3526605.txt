In a Silverlight 4 (OOB) app can you move the main window in code

In a Silverlight 4 out of browser app (oob) is there any way to programatically move the main window after the application start-up event . The reason / Use case: A user selects an option on a silverlight desktop gadget app, the apps window grows to accomodate extra details. If the app started very near the right of the screen the details are obscured/ fall off the edge of the screen and the user needs to drag the window to the left. When the window returns to its smaller state it is now positioned to far left so the user needs to drag the window right again. It would be convention for the app to move itself back and forth automatically to accomodate the details. Thanks.
