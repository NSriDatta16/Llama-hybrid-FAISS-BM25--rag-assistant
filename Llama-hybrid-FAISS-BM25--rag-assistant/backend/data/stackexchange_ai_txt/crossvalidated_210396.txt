The easier definition of $P(X $$P(X where $$f_{X|U}(t,u)=\frac{f_{XU}(t,u)}{f_U(u)},$$ where $f_{X,U}(t,u)$ is the probability density of the $(X,U)$ and $f_U(u)$ is the probability density of $U$. Also $$P(X Your formula with the cdf inside the integral is probably wrong. We have $$F_{XU}(x,u)=P(X Now $$\min(X,Y)>u = X>u \cap Y>u, $$ so you can use de Morgan's law to get the expression for $\min(X,Y) This is not a complete solution, but it may clarify things a bit.
