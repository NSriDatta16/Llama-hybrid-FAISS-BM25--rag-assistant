Have a look at InnoDB and MyISAM InnoDB is a storage engine for MySQL, included as standard in all current binaries distributed by MySQL AB. Its main enhancement over other storage engines available for use with MySQL is ACID-compliant transaction support MyISAM is the default storage engine for the MySQL relational database management system versions prior to 5.5 1 . It is based on the older ISAM code but has many useful extensions. The major deficiency of MyISAM is the absence of transactions support. Versions of MySQL 5.5 and greater have switched to the InnoDB engine to ensure referential integrity constraints, and higher concurrency.
