Estimator of autocovariance in a wide-sense stationary process

From Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process One can discuss the ergodicity of various properties of a stochastic process. For example, a wide-sense stationary process $x(t)$ has mean $m_x(t)= E[x(t)]$ and autocovariance $r_x(\tau) = E[(x(t)-m_x(t)) (x(t+\tau)-m_x(t+\tau))]$ which do not change with time. One way to estimate the mean is to perform a time average: $$ \hat{m}_x(t)_{T} = \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^{T} x(t) \, dt.$$ If $\hat{m}_x(t)_{T}$ converges in squared mean to $m_x(t)$ as $T > \rightarrow \infty$, then the process x(t) is said to be mean-ergodic[1] or mean-square ergodic in the first moment.[2] Likewise, one can estimate the autocovariance $r_x(\tau)$ by performing a time average: $$ \hat{r}_x(\tau) = \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^{T} [x(t+\tau)-m_x(t+\tau)] [x(t)-m_x(t)] \, dt.$$ If this expression converges in squared mean to the true autocovariance $r_x(\tau) = E[(x(t+\tau)-m_x(t+\tau)) (x(t)-m_x(t))]$, then the process is said to be autocovariance-ergodic or mean-square ergodic in the second moment.[2] A process which is ergodic in the first and second moments is sometimes called ergodic in the wide sense. I wonder if $m_x$ should be $\hat{m}_x$ instead in the definition of $\hat{r}_x(\tau)$, i.e. $$ \hat{r}_x(\tau) = \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^{T} [x(t+\tau)-m_x(t+\tau)] [x(t)-m_x(t)] \, dt$$ should be $$ \hat{r}_x(\tau) = \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^{T} [x(t+\tau)-\hat{m}_x(t+\tau)] [x(t)-\hat{m}_x(t)] \, dt$$ Thanks!
