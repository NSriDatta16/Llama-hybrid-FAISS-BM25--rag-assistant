You should check out OLAP databases. OLAP allows you to create a database of aggregates meant to be analyzed in a "slice and dice" fashion. Aggregate measures such as counts, averages, mins, maxs, sums and stdev's can be quickly analyzed by any number of dimensions using an OLAP database. See this introduction to OLAP on MSDN.
