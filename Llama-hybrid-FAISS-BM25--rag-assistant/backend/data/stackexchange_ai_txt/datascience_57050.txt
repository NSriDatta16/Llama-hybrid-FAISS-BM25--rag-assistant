Deploying an LSTM Model

I have trained and validated my LSTM and I would like to deploy it. So, I know that we can save and load the Sequential object of Keras (I am working with Keras as you can guess). I thus implemented a code using these functions. But, I would like to know whether I must train my model with all the available data (training + test) or just on the training set as I did during my study. Many tutorials talk about how to train a model but not so many are clear about how to deploy a model. I would like to know what is common to do, knowing that I am doing Time Series Forecasting which is a specific problem.
