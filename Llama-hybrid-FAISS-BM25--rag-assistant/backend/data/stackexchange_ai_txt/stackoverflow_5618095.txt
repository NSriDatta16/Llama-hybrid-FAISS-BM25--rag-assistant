not entirely sure what you mean ? can u elaborate/provide more detail? you select any row first (either programatically or by clicking it). and any rows you add shouldnt chnage the positon there was also way you can bring particular row into view (i think it was called ScrollIntoView() or BringIntoView(), look at Infragistics API).
