Log4J and Java Web Start, how to alternate between different configurations?

i'm starting with Log4J and i want to have a default log4j.properties in our Java Web Start distributed application, which only logs errors and important events. But if something was wrong in one client i want to have a more detailed log, the way to do this is to define an alternate log4j configuration file in this client. This can be done by specifiying the alternate config file with the log4j.configuration system property. but... How can i define an system property for this particular client in a java web start launched application? (i know that i can define theese propeties in the .jnlp file, but this affects all clients). Our users work in windows environment but they often have a restricted permissions computer and they can't acces My Pc->Properties-->Advanced Options-->Enviroment Variables (i'm in a spanish configured computer i don't know the exact names in english).
