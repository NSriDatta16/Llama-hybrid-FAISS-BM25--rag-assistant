Using OpenCV 2.2 on MAC OS X 10.6

I had tried to use openCV 2.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.6, I follow the instruction on http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port and How to Install OpenCV2.0 in Mac OS 10.6.1 (Snow Leopard) . I install it through macport. Everything seems OK during installation. But when I follow the step by step instruction to use it, it just appear a lot of error like this: I do not know what's wrong with is. Can anyone tell me the reason? I just include the opencv.hpp and the main function just return 0. Thank you all.
