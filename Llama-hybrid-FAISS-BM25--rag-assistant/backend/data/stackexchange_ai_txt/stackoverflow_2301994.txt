You will have to keep track of the individual TCP connections between the browser and the server - that's just keeping track of the source/destination IP and port numbes in the packets you capture. Then you'll have to parse the HTTP in the captured packets and correlate HTTP requests with its response and take the time difference(which you'll get from the timestamps from pcap). This is non-trivial in the cases the HTTP request/responses spans several packets, and certainly non-trivial if you also want to account for lost packets and retransmission.
