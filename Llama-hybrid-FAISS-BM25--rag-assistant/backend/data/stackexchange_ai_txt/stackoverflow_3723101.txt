RGB values have no meaning to human perception but they can be easily converted to Hue, Saturation, Luminance which is more sensible to people. Unfortunately, saturation and luminance are pretty intuitive: richer:paler and lighter:darker, but we have no natural ordering for colors so hue is expressed as an arbitrary number of degrees around a circle. In practice, asking people to make fine hue discriminations, especially when searching for something yet unseen is pretty hard. Therefore, you might want to limit your categories to the vertices of the hexagon in figure "a" . Then you run into the question of what is the representative color of a photograph? Is the image that is half blue sky and half tan sand blue or tan? Are you picking a dominant hue? You might want to apply a huge Gaussian blur and then average the resultant hues. You probably need to refine your question and goals further. Idle musing on perceptual models Even HSL has its descriptive limitations. I mention "tan" above as the color of sand. Most readers probably have no problem at all perceiving or naming it, but unless you have too much experience playing with color, it is pretty non-obvious that the hue of tan is orange but pale (less saturated) and bright (higher value). And about a third of the hue circle is devoted to greens, etc.
