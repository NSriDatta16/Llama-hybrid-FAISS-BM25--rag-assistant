Bayesian Information Criteria variable penalisation for increasing N

I am trying to understand the Bayesian Information Criteria for model performance, given by the formula below: BIC=âˆ’2ln(L)+kln(n) I understand the aim is to minimize this function. I can see that the penalization factor kln(n) is increasing in n (the sample size). What is the intuitive reason for penalizing the inclusion of additional variables more heavily for bigger values of n? Thanks a lot.
