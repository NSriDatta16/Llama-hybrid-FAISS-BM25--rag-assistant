Go for the SCSI and LSILogic. IDE and BusLogic are for compatibility reasons. Like when you do physical2virtual... There's a whitepaper from vmware showing the difference between LSILogic and BusLogic, which in my opinion is rather small: http://www.vmware.com/pdf/ESX2_Storage_Performance.pdf Edit after like three years: With current ESX environments it's best to use the Paravirtual SCSI device.
