Im sure when you get to organizations such as myspace,facebook and google you cant have just one person working on code. I think the best way to tackle a situation is by logging everything and explaining what work/changes they have made. For example if my partner works on some feature for my site he will be required to document and explain in full the changes he has done or implemented and also explain what his code is doing and how it integrates into the rest of the system. This way when i come along i can see that he has made a change to the system in the Input class and he has explained how he has secured one of the latest XSS Attack or what ever. So when i read His code i already know: What the purpose of the code. How the code implements into the rest of he system. Why it was necessary. Its main purpose and functionalities . The main part of being a team is communication so having such a system that will provide the communication would be vital. People tend to work great on there own because there's no need for the communication. but as you grow and expand you have to be able to structure your application and team you need to make sure that you can have 20 people doing different things but they all know what is going on within the application as they see a "Change Log" as such. My opinion is that a team is better than a singular person.
