No, with LINQ to SQL there is no real good way to do this. You can create a DayOfWeekStorage property (as Nick Craver explained), make it internal, and define a new WeekDay DayOfWeek property. This will even compile when you use this new property in a LINQ query. However, this LINQ query will fail at runtime, because LINQ to SQL has no idea how to transform your query to LINQ to SQL. This is where LINQ to SQL stops. Creating a new property is possible when you have no intention to use it in a LINQ query (so no filtering, grouping, and ordering based on that property), but it is easy for accidentally do this and find out at runtime.
