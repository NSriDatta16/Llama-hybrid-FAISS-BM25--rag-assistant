Silverlight: Place an element at the top of the screen?

It is idiomatic in Windows Phone 7 to display a loading indicator at the very top of the screen. (I don't think there is any padding between the loading indicator and the top.) What is the best way to do that in Silverlight? This XAML works, sorta: It places the ProgressBar near the top of the screen, but there's still space. I could just apply a negative margin, but I suspect there's a more elegant way. What is the preferred way of doing this?
