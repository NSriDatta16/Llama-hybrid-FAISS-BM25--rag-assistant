flash as3: can children not run their own actionscript?

I thought I was being slick by having movieclips that I export for actionscript and then addChild later. I've made this one movieclip that loads html text through as, and it works fine when I drag it to the stage; but if I do var trackListingBox:trackListingScreen = new trackListingScreen(); addChild(trackListingBox); it either doesn't run the actionscript, or it's somehow broken. Can children not run their own action script?
