You can leverage the "remember me" functionality that Acegi provides. Since it is cookie based, once you authenticate against the first application, it will drop a cookie, and then when you attempt to log in to the second application, as long as the security model is identical, you will be authenticated immediately via the cookie. See: Acegi Documentation for further details.
