Just something to pay attention to, but unless something has changed recently CakePHP does not support ENUM column types. Your best bet is a Group model ( groups mysql table ) and a group_id field on the users table. Then you can $hasOne = array( 'Group' ); in your User model. From there you can follow any one of a HUGE number of group access control tutorials for the Auth Component via an easy google search for "CakePHP Auth User Group"
