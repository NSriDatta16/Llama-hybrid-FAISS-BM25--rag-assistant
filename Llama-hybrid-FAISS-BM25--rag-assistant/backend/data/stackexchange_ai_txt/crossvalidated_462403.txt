Per a sampling theory reference, I would regress an individual male's weight (y variable) vs. the sum of the male and a female's weight (x variable), based on a random pairing of a male and female (which would be a conservative estimate of the variance of the sampling theory regression estimator) that results in the statistic of interest: $$ Beta = \dfrac{\sum(\text{weight of sampled men})}{\sum(\text{weight of all sampled people})}$$ Then, per this sampling theory source Equation (47) : $$ Var(Beta) = ((N-n)/N) /(n*{XBar(all)}^2)*{S_e}^2 $$ where the ${S_e}^2 $ of the regression is the usual sample regression variance estimate based on the sum of squares of actual vs fitted adjusted for degrees of freedom. XBar(all) is the average of the total pair weights consisting of a single male plus a female as employed in the regression model. If the number of males N in the parent population is not known, replace the first term (sampling correction factor) with 1. Compute the standard deviation to produce a Student's t-test based confidence interval for the proportion of interest. [EDIT] Note, my suggested analysis does lose data unless the number of males equals the number of females. Also, for a parent population, where the number of males is smaller than the number of females, and the % is known, then apply an adjustment factor to the female's weight in constructing the x-variable to derive an appropriate statistic of interest for the parent population.
