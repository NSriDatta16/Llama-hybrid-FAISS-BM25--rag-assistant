Question 10.9 from Bayesian Data Analysis, what does accuracy mean here?

I'm doing an independent study in Bayesian Statistics following some chapters from BDA3 . When solving the first question from Ch 10 I got stuck. It says: [If] a scalar variable $\theta$ is approximately normally distributed in a posterior distribution that is summarized by n independent simulation draws [,] how large does n have to be so that the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of $\theta$ are specified to an accuracy of $0.1\ {\rm sd}(\theta|y)$? Just by following the formula for a numerical example in the same chapter I get $n=100$, but I do not understand actually what they mean by accuracy in this context. Any pointers?
