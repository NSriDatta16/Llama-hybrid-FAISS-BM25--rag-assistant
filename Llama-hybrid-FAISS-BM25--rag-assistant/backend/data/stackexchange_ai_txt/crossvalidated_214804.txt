I suggest you to use as proposal a mixture of your independent "prior" proposal and a classical random walk proposal so that you can use them alternatively and benefit alternatively from the rough characterization of the target density and of random walk to explore more largely the space. In practice, for such a purpose you can simply select your proposal distribution randomly at each step of the MCMC using a bernouilli trial (eventually using an adaptive scheme for optimising its parameter) and use the corresponding proposal to update (or not) the current sample. This procedure does not break MCMC convergence conditions.
