Normally you'd use JSONP here by adding &callback=? to your URL, however a JSONP callback is not supported in this case, from the crunchbase API documentation : List Entities To retrieve a list of all of the entities in a certain namespace on CrunchBase, use a URL of the form: http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/ The plural available namespaces are: companies people financial-organizations products service-providers This action does not support JavaScript callbacks. The bottom line is the most important, you'll see that this: http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/companies/permalink?name=Google&callback=callme still results in regular JSON, not JSONP.
