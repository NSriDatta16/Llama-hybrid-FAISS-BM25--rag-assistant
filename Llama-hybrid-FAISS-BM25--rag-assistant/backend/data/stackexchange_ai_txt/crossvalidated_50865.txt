Discounted cumulated gain

I've a little question regarding the Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) (Sorry, I couldn't find the papers of Järvelin and Kekäläinen). Can this evaluation-metric be used when a information retrieval system has only a binary classification of relevance? If this topic is misplaced, please tell where I should post it. Thank you
