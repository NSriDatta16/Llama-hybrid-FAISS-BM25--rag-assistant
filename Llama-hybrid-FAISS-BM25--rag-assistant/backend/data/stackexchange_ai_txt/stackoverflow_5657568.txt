Use of Java Enumerations/Iterators

I was just roaming through the API and it came to my attention that, Enumerations and Iterators aren't very useful interfaces. Specifically I mean, instead of saying (for Vector v): for (Enumeration e = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();) System.out.println(e.nextElement()); We can easily say: for (int i = 0; i What I wanted to know exactly is: Are there any performance bonuses for using Enumerations/Iterators? Has it provided you the ability to achieve something that cannot be achieved by the latter for loop?
