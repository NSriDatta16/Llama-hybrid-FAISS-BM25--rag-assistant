Loop over string variables in R

When programming in Stata I often find myself using the loop index in the programming. For example, I'll loop over a list of the variables nominalprice and realprice: local list = "nominalprice realprice" foreach i of local list { summarize `i' twoway (scatter `i' time) graph export "C:\TimePlot-`i'.png" } This will plot the time series of nominal and real prices and export one graph called TimePlot-nominalprice.png and another called TimePlot-realprice.png. In R the method I've come up with to do the same thing would be: clist This R code looks unintuitive and messy to me and I haven't found a good way to do this sort of thing in R yet. Maybe I'm just not thinking about the problem the right way? Can you suggest a better way to loop using strings?
