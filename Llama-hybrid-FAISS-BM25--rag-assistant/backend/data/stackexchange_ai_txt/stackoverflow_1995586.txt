create a many to many relationship in rails

Users can vote on posts, so I set a many to many relationship in rails: users have many votes posts have many votes posts have many users through votes users have many posts through votes Is there a more elegant way to create a new vote than this: user.votes.create(:post_id => post.id).save ? thanks
