Can we do multivariate time series analysis using holt-winter ( Exponential smoothing) method?

Just like we have a method like ARIMAX and SARIMAX where we can provide exog and endog variable for perfroming multivariate analysis. I was hoping is there a way, we can achieve same using ETS as well. Please let me know in case any has worked on this.
