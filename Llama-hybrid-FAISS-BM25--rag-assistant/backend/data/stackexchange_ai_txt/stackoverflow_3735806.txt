Can someone explain how this code transforms something from per vertex lighting to per pixel?

In a tutorial there was a diffuse value calculation of the type float diffuse_value = max(dot(vertex_normal, vertex_light_position), 0.0); ..on the vertex shader. That was supposed to be making per vertex lighting if later on the fragment shader.. gl_FragColor = gl_Color * diffuse_value; Then when he moved the first line - appropriately (by outputting vertex_normal and vertex_light_position to fragment) - to the the fragment shader, it is supposed to be transforming the method to "per pixel shading". How is that so? The first method appears to be doing the diffuse_value calculation every pixel anyway!
