Circular class reference problem

I am developing a C# application and have an Employee class and an Organisation class. An Employee object has an Organisation as an internal member and an Organisation object has an Employee member to indicate the Org leader. Will there be any problems with this setup that can lead to an infinite circular instantiations? Edit: I just tried it running the code and there seems to be a problem. The employee object instantiates an Organisation object and an Organisation object tries to instantiate an employee object. They both connect to a database to fill in their details This keeps happening until my SQL server runs out of connections. Is there any alternative to what I am doing?
