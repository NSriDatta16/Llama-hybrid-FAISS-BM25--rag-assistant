C# - Using LINQ to take two variables into a 2-dimensional array?

I have a list<> of an "region" class with two variables, "startLocation" and "endLocation". I'd like to combine those two into a new sorted 2 dimensional array where its just Location and an integer representing whether its start or an end. For example, if the list has three region objects with [Region 1] : startLocation = 5, endLocation = 7 [Region 2] : startLocation = 3, endLocation = 5 [Region 3] : startLocation = 8, endLocation = 9 I'd like to get a sorted two dimensional array (or list or similar) looking like: [3] [1] [5] [1] [5] [-1] [7] [-1] [8] [1] [9] [-1] (preferably i'd like the overlaps to add their second values together, so the two separate 5's in the array would be combined into [5 0]...but that's not too important) I'm currently using a regular forloop going through each one by one and adding them to a list one at a time. This implementation is quite slow because I'm working with large datasets, and I'm guessing there's a more elegant / faster way to accomplish this through LINQ. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
