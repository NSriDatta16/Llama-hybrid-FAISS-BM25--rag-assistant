After a bit more investigation and another question I have worked this out. The in the drop event on the droppable element you need to clone the helper as you cannot drop the actual helper that shows during dragging. $("#droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { var newDiv = $(ui.helper).clone(false) .removeClass('ui-draggable-dragging') .css({position:'absolute', left:0, top:ui.offset.top - 12}); $(this).append(newDiv); } }); Thanks also to Jason Benson .
