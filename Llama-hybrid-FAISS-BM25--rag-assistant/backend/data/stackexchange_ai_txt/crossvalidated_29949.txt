How to select best parameter for polynomial kernel?

I am using LibSVM library for classification. For my problem I am using polynomial kernel and I need to select best parameters ( d = degree of polynomial kernel, and C = soft margin constant). The LibSVM guide suggests for grid search for this job. In this library there exists a parameter selection tool ( grid.py ), but it seems to me this is implemented to tune parameters of RBF kernel (gamma). My questions are: Is there any other good solution for selecting suitable parameters rather than Grid search? Can anybody give me some hints / sample code for selecting parameters for polynomial kernel?
