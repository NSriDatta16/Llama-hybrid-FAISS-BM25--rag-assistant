In Visual Studio, there is a ZIP file with icons organized in folders. The organization is mostly by filetype and image size, is pretty messy, and contains many duplicates, so you should probably not follow their example. However, they provide a HTML file in each folder that shows the icons in that folder in a nice readable list (better than Explorer's standard preview). You could do something similar, but maybe provide a table instead, for example with one column per collection, and one row per "concept" (e.g. save icon).
