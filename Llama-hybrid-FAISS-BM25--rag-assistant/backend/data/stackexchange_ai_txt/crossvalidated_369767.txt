How to specify a zero-inflated Dirichlet model in JAGS/BUGS

There was a recent publication discussing the advantages of the zero-inflated dirichlet for microbiome count data which is compositional (you are modeling a matrix of species relative abundance data as a dependent variable, where the relative abundances within a sample sum to 1), and has lots of zeros (many taxa are not observed in over half of samples). I am sold on this in principle. Authors provide an R package to fit these models. However, the group I work with is most interested in using Bayesian statistics for a suite of reasons. As a result, I need to translate this into the JAGS/BUGS language. Fitting a standard dirichlet is easy enough and I copy data generation and fitting code below using JAGS and the runjags package in R. To do this I first have to add a 1 to all observations (the dirichlet can't handle hard zeros as is) before I normalize by rowSums to get proportions. Any advice on how to zero-inflate this model would be extremely welcome. #clear environment, load packages. rm(list=ls()) library(runjags) #data generation.----- #3 species abundances set.seed(1234) N Once this is run it is pretty easy to show the model over-estimates the abundances of the zero inflated species. out
