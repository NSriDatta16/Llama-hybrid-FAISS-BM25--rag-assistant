Put the enums right in your namespace (or make a new namespace for them) or Put them in a (static?) class somewhere if that makes more sense. I'd keep them in their own file for easy access and good organization either way. I usually wouldn't put them in a class unless they somehow "belong" there. Like you have a Car class with an enum for the types of car, and a Road class and Bridge class that can set limits for types of car. Car.CarType seems to be a logical organization for this...
