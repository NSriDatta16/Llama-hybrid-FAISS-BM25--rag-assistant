Magento - Google Checkout Free Shipping Problem

I have set up Google Checkout on my Magento store and I'm using Flat Rates for the shipping. the problem is if I put zero for the rate ie. free shipping I get a message when I go to checkout saying that I don't ship to that country. If I add any value into the rate (even 0.01) it works fine. Here is a screen of the config which doesn't work: http://skitch.com/a1anm/dqmw2/configuration-system-magento-admin Here is a screen of the config which does work: http://skitch.com/a1anm/dqmw9/configuration-system-magento-admin Here is a screen of the error I get at checkout if I set the shipping rate to 0.00: http://skitch.com/a1anm/dqmim/secure-checkout-with-google Any ideas why this isn't working?
