It's important that you understand the ASP.NET page life cycle (assuming that you're using web forms). With this you'll know the correct page events to use and their particular purpose. Page_Load and Page_OnLoadComplete are not used to save changes to data, but rather retrieval and rendering of that data. I would have the generic database calls inside a database class. The fields in I would place into a separate class, and this class would have an associated mapping class containing the particular CRUD methods you need (eg the names of Stored Procedures to call, Parameters etc). I'd pass this to an instance of the database class to perform the functions I want, triggered by an event from the page (eg a Button_Click event). On your second point, refreshing the page calls a HTTP GET, so your page will be reloaded. This to me implies that your write is not actually occurring, check the database to ensure that it is.
