Message queue solution for activities that come and go on Android?

Lets say I have a Service S and Activity A. S downloads data for A (or handles some long running work, whatever), but A is not always present. I don't want S to hang around when it's job queue is empty: S should post the results of the finished works to some kind of a mailbox for A, so A can pull the messages when it comes back again. Can this be achieved without using SQLite of file storage for the implementation of the mailbox? I'd prefer some faster mechanism, write operations tend to be quite slow on a device. I thought about using a simple static list inside the ApplicationContext, but afaik relying on the ApplicationContext results a risky/fragile solution. Could anyone recommend a pattern for this problem?
