There is no essential Bayesian / frequentist divide with a correlation any more than there is a Bayesian equivalent of a mean or median. A correlation is just an arithmetic calculation. The need for specific Bayesian techniques only arises when you do inference with it, so the appropriate Bayesian approach would depend on what your actual question is. But there's no fundamental reason why it wouldn't invove Pearson's product-moment correlation.
