In WPF, can you hittest segments of a PathFigure?

I'm making a control that involves dragging pieces of a displayed element around. Since part of it is an arc, I have to use a PathFigure so I can use ArcSegments. I'd like to be able to know if the mouse is over a particular segment of the figure, but I don't see an obvious way to do this. Is it impossible or am I missing something?
