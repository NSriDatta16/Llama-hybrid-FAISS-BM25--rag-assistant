Images from where? If you want to be able to drag images from the webpage itself, that is possible, but if you want images from outside to be dropped, that is simply not possible using JavaScript. difficult at the moment. Edit: As @John Boker mentioned, it is possible, but at the moment, the APIs are highly non-standard and vary wildly between browsers. HTML 5 will support a standard and simpler API for this but HTML 5 itself is not a standard yet. Some resources: HTML5 Drag and Drop File API - currently works only in Firefox, will hopefully become standard soon VBDataObject Interface - works only in IE
