Copy parts of a buffer in C

Gang, what am I doing wrong, I am wanting to take a specific offset + a length of data out of a file and copy it into an allocated buffer of same length... if( stru_ct->size != 0 ){ unsigned char * s_buffer = malloc(stru_ct->size); if( !s_buffer ){ printf( "Memory error!" ); return -1; } fseek( file, wp->stru_ct->offset, SEEK_SET ); fread( s_buffer, stru_ct->size, 1, file ); } There's no compilation error, the s_buffer still results in 0 after the fread. I know there's data at the offset + length. Thanks for your help!!
