One thing that doesn't help is that you don't specify the modelling language. You probably mean a data model: relational, ER, UML classes, or something like it. Possibly not. In any case, let's hope the language used is clear enough for there to be at least a consensus on what sort of information is supposed to be in the model and how it should be represented. Drawing boxes and lines with various types of shapes and decorations without a clear meaning won't give you good models. That being said my vote is for markus's answer: the more information you include, the more you have to drag along. Besides, what information you need and how best to model it depends on what you need it the information for, how easily and reliably you can obtain and store the information, possibly on access control considerations (can everybody see everything?) and umpteen other considerations. Without knowing these requirements and how they may change in the future, there is no such thing as a good model, let alone a perfect one. Except that there are of course intrinsic quality considerations - e.g. redundant representation of information is usually a bad idea unless you have a specific requirement that makes it attractive. This doesn't mean modelling or reconsidering existing models is a waste of time: on the contrary, often you only become aware of existing requirements or design limitations once you try to design a model and consider its implications. And it's good to strive for consistent representation, to make everything fit within a possible single universal model of everything. But that certainly isn't the goal of modelling. Perhaps the business needed to think long and hard about what information they have, where they need it, who maintains it, how, and how all this can be improved. In that case I suppose setting the goal of designing a single big, consistent and complete universal information model can be a good way to achieve that. But that model probably won't be the main outcome.
