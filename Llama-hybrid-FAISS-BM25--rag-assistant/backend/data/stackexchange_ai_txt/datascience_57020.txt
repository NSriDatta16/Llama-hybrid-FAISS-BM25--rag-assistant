How to display graph with MathJax in jupyter notebook?

I am trying to create a jupyter-notebook with a graphical depiction of a neural network. For starters, I am trying to display a simple network that evaluates a boolean NOT operator. I am using the %%dot cell magic that is documented at https://metakernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/README.html?v=20190725125340#id13 and I have a code cell in my notebook with the following contents: %%dot digraph NOT { rankdir = LR node [shape="circle"] x0 [label="+1"] x1 [label="$x_1$"] h [shape="plain"] y1 [color="coral" label=""] x0 -> y1 [label="10"] x1 -> y1 [label="-20"] y1 -> h [label="g()"] } This is rendered into an SVG that is displayed as the output of the code cell. However, for the label on the x1 node I've used $x_1$ , which I'd like to render as $x_1$ (presumably by MathJax, as it does in the Markdown cells). Unfortunately, I just get a blank node with no label, like this: Any idea what I can do to fix this?
