Representative elements of a set

I'm looking for the technical name of the following problem. It sounds like a standard machine learning technique, but I'm not familiar with the field, and can't seem to find it. Let's say that we have a set of $N$ objects. Each object is characterized by $k$ properties (real numbers), and is therefore embedded in the property space $\mathbb{R}^k$. We can define a metric $m$ for this space such that two objects $i,j$ are separated by a distance $$ ||\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j||_m = m_1(r_1^{(i)}-r_1^{(j)}) + m_2(r_2^{(i)}-r_2^{(j)}) + ... $$ where $\{m_\ell\}_{\ell=1,..,k}$ is a set of functions that defines $m$. I want to identify the $n \ll N$ objects that are the most representative of the set; i.e. the $n$ objects that will give me a good idea of what are the different "properties regime" of the $N$ objects. The metric is not necessarily defined a priori and could be learned simultaneously. The simplest approach calls for a straightforward metric, e.g. euclidean distance. Even if I don't know the name of my problem, I see two naive approaches. Both use the euclidean distance, because I do not know how to choose a proper metric and/or include the choice of metric in the proposed algorithms. Approach A: apply spectral clustering to the data. Draw one object per cluster, at random. Approach B: choose the $n$ objects which maximize the total distance between the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of objects.
