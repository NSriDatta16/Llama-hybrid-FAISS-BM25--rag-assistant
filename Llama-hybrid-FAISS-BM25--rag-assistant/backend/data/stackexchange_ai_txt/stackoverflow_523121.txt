Are you asking about the membership and role providers or the skeleton controller actions and view? The membership and role providers certainly support secure storage for passwords and allow you to secure your application adequately. I found them to be a little overkill for the kinds of things that I do so I opted to implement my own. As far as the controller actions, they are just skeletons and you should expect to modify them to fit your authentication scenarios. For one thing you may want to set things up to require secure connections when transmitting passwords. If you choose to redirect afterwards to a non-secure connection, you'll need to manually manipulate the redirect url since the default routing doesn't support (or at least didn't in MVC Beta) changing back from secure to non-secure protocols. The bottom line is that you still need to make sure that you are handling the data securely whether you are using MVC or WebForms. The layout of the controllers and basic set up is an adequate start, but you need to make sure that it fits your security requirements.
