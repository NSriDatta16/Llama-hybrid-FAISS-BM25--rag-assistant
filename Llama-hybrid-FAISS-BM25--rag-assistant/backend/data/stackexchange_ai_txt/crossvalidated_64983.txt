SVM with overlapping classes

Following my earlier post , I have successfully run linear svm on some datasets, however for other datasets, it is failing. These are the datasets where range of one class lies within that of the next class. What I did not mention in my post was that my classes have to be ordered i.e c1 should precede c2 which should precede c3. So for example linear SVM is not very accurate in classifying the following (where c1, c2 etc are class labels) c1={3,4,5,5,7} c2={1,2,3,4,5,6} c3={1,4,5,7,8} c4={3,5,6,9,10} linear SVM gives me the following classes c1={5,5,5,5,5,6,6} c2={1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,4} c3={} c4={7,7,8,9,10} What I am looking to get is c1={1,1,2} c2={3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5} c3={6,6} c4={7,7,8,9,10} Is there a better method to classify such datasets?
