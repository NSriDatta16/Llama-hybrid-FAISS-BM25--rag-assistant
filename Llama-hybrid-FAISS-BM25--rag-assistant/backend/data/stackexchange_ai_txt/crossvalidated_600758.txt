Is using the same person as data observation in different time stamps a way to produce data leakage in a Machine Learning model?

Let's assume we are going to train a regression model (could be any ML tabular solution for regression. Ex.: LGBM, XGBoost, Perceptron, ...) to predict a customer profit in the next month. While setting up the training dataset, we observe that the same customer appears in the dataset 3 times like the following table: ID REFERENCE_MONTH PROFIT ON MONTH M-3 PROFIT ON MONTH M-2 PROFIT ON MONTH M-1 PROFIT ON MONTH M+1 (TARGET) 123 2022/04 2,00 (2022/01) 4,56 (2022/02) 3,12 (2022/03) 7,87 (2022/05) 123 2022/05 4,56 (2022/02) 3,12 (2022/03) 1,02 (2022/04) 9,85 (2022/06) 123 2022/06 3,12 (2022/03) 1,02 (2022/04) 7,87 (2022/05) 2,64 (2022/07) The columns ID and REFERENCE_MONTH are just to determine the customer. The true training variables would be PROFIT ON MONTH M-3 , PROFIT ON MONTH M-2 and PROFIT ON MONTH M-1 . Therefore, the target variable is PROFIT ON MONTH M+1 . My doubt is about the fact that the target variable in row number 1 is 7,87 because it refers to 2022/05, but this same value is also an independent variable for row number 3. Does this characterize a data leakage? I mean, the target variable for customer 123 in REFERENCE_MONTH = 2022/04 is inside the training dataset.
