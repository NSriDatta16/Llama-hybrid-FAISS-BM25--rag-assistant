You can set the form's border to bsNone and then add a panel to the form. Set the panel's align property to alClient and adjust its border however you like. You have control over the inner and outer bevels and their widths to a 1 pixel granularity. Since Panel1 is a container, it should be easy to just drag everything onto it as though it were the form itself. In the designer, it would be nearly invisible. If you are not familiar with it, you can drag all the controls from one container to another using the structure view (it's called the object treeview in older versions). This makes it so you don't have to redesign your form to do this. If the panel itself is a problem, you can always just send it to the back and leave all the other controls on the form. It will look exactly the same, but then the controls maintain a TForm parent instead of a TPanel parent. It's just a little extra thing to maintain in the designer. Having said that, I also recommend considering Mason's comment about nonstandard UIs.
