The Canvas is the right container to use as you can position its child control by coordinates. Your problem is more about moving elements around, which is in fact drag & drop. You'll have to handle mouse events: MouseDown to select an item, MouseMove to detect a drag and MouseUp to drop it. During the move or at the drop, you can change the element's coordinates to auto-align it on a grid or compared to surrounding elements. I successfully made such a project in Silverlight and used Adorner s to add resize handlers to the elements. I solved the panning and zooming question by putting the Canvas into a Viewbox , which was in a ScrollViewer . If you want to let the user control the zoom factor, apply a LayoutTransform to the Canvas (available in the Toolkit ).
