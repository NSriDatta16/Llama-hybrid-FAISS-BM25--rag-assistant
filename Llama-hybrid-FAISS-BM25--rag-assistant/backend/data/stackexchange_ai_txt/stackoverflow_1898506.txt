Why would a browser make two separate requests for the same file?

I'm debugging a program I wrote and noticed something strange. I set up an HTTP server on port 12345 that servers a simple OGG video file, and attempted to access it from Firefox. Upon sniffing the network requests, I found these two requests were made: GET /video.ogv HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:12345 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive GET /video.ogv HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:12345 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Range: bytes=8122368- The video is almost 8 MB in size, so the fact that the second request specifics 8122368 bytes, which is 7932 KB, suggests it is requesting the very end of the file for some reason. Anyone have ideas?
