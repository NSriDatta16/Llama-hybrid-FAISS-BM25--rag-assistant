I've been struggling with the same problem for quite a while now. I discovered this morning that the team agent had all the notifications turned off, so I turned them all on and finally started getting state change emails when the app changed to "Waiting For Upload", but still nothing when the state changed to "Binary Invalid". After a few more attempts, I finally got the app update into the "Waiting For Review" state. What solved it for me was changing the value of "iPhone OS Deployment Target" in the target's build settings from iPhone OS 2.2.1 (the setting for the original app) to iPhone OS 3.0.
