Explain steps of LLE (local linear embedding) algorithm?

I understand the basic principle behind the algorithm for LLE consists of three steps. Finding the neighborhood of each data point by some metric such as k-nn. Find weights for each neighbor which denote the effect the neighbor has on the data point. Construct the low dimensional embedding of the data based on the computed weights. But the mathematical explanation of steps 2 and 3 are confusing in all the text books and online resources that I have read. I am not able to reason why the formulas are used. How are these steps performed in practice? Is there any intuitive way of explaining the mathematical formulas used? References: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/lle/publications.html
