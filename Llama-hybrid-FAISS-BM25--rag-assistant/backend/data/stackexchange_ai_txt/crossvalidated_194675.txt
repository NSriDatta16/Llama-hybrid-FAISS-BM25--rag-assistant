Why do we need to estimate mean using MLE when we already know that mean is average of the data? The text book problem states that $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N$ is from $$x\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$ They tell you that $\sigma$ is known, but $\mu$ has to be estimated. Is it really that obvious that a good estimate $\hat\mu=\bar x$?! Here, $\bar x=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i$. It wasn't obvious to me, and I was quite surprised to see that it is in fact MLE estimate. Also, consider this: what if $\mu$ was known and $\sigma$ unknown? In this case MLE estimator is $$\hat\sigma^2=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(x-\bar x)^2$$ Notice, how this estimator is not the same as a sample variance estimator! Don't "we already know" that the sample variance is given by the following equation? $$s^2=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i}(x-\bar x)^2$$
