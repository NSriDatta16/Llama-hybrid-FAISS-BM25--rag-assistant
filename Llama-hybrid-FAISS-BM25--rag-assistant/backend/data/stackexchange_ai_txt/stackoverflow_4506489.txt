If you haven't worked with Magento's codebase before, I wouldn't recommend that you start with that, it's fairly complex. Using an extension is probably the safest option. I haven't used it, but I believe this extension should do the job. Standard disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with the vendor in any way. Caveat emptor .
