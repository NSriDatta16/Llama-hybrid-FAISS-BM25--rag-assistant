Interpreting Intercept when doing logistic regression with categorical data in R

In R I have a categorical variable that I performed logistic regression on and got the following result: glm(formula = mortality ~ SMOKE, family = binomial, data = c.data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.2155 -0.2155 -0.2155 -0.1860 2.8515 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -4.0483 0.3189 -12.694 Is the value for the intercept the same as SMOKEY (has a history of smoking)?
