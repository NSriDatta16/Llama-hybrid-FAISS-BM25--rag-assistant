Can a neural network be created that will derive the pythogorean theorem?

I tried training a neural network with various numbers of hidden lawyers etc where the training set was just pairs of different side length and the answer was length of the hypoteneuse, but I could not get it to give a reliable answer. Is it possible to do this kind of thing with a neural network? If so, what would the network look like? just two input cells and one output cell for the answer? What should be in the middle?
