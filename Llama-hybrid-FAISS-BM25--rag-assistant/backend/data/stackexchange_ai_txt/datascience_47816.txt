You need to know what the outcome should be of a given test on a dataset before you try to test a new method on them. Ask yourself, 'What do I expect from this?' Linear SVM finds a plane to cut through the data to best represent the difference between two sets. If you have a look at what you are separating (Iris_setosa from Iris_virginica and iris_versicolor), you'll find that the clumps themselves are perfectly separated. You can draw a line easily on each graph you care to use, and that is what I have done in the picture below. If the clumps are perfectly separated, then the SVM will return a perfectly separated result.

Or alternatively, just generate a dataset of your own from randomly placed gaussian points.
