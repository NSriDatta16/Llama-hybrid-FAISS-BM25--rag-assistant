Loannis, If your research questions are: 1) are participants more confident, and 2) is the change in confidence significant, then the approach might be the following. A simple calculation of the after confidence level minus the before confidence level for each question for each participant could be calculated with a spreadsheet. You could then report the range of changes and the average change in confidence levels. The data could also be plotted as comparative histograms or comparative boxplots to visualize the change for participants. The issue of whether the change is significant could be approached with a paired t-test. The average confidence level for each participant could be compared before and after. Your sample size is really too small to do anything fancier; and you shouldn't use a more high powered test than you really need to answer your research question. My response presumes that you don't want to get into validating the questionnaire, but simply want some feedback. I do have a concern with the length of the questionnaire. With 40-items you may have some survey fatigue. Checking the amount of variance for the last half of the items compared to the first half should reveal if fatigue is an issue. A quick Cronbach's Alpha estimate will also provide you some feedback on the internal consistency of the questionnaire.
