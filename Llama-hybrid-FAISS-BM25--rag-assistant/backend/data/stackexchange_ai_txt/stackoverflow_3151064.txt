find and replace keywords by hyperlinks in an html fragment, via php dom

I'm trying to use the simple_html_dom php class to create a find and replace function that looks for keywords and replace them by a link to a definition of the keyword, with the keyword as link text. How can i find and replace "Dexia" with Dexia using this class, inside a string such as The CEO of the Dexia bank has just decided to retire. ?
