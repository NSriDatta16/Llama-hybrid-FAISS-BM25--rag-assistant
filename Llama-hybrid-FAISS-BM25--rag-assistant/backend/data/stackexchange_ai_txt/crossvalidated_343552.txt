Are there good recent (i.e. year 2018) papers and discussions on the issue of "Statistics vs. Machine Learning"?

I try to get an overview about the most recent discussions of how machine learning and classical statistics differ. There is an excellent discussion on this issue here on stackexchange ( The Two Cultures: statistics vs. machine learning? ), but the original posts are about 8 years old by now. Does anyone know of a more recent discussion (here on this forum or elsewhere)? Or are the main points in the Breiman paper still valid?
