Before going forward with implementing any kind of estimation/inference procedure in order to detect cross-correlations, you should know that stationary and non-stationary data "do not mix", and it is usually misleading to try to find any kind of association (correlation, co-movement e.t.c.) between them (which nevertheless may exist). To look at a concrete example: Assume the following two AR(1) time series, $z_t$ stationary, $y_t$ containing a unit root and hence non-stationary: $$z_t = \gamma + \delta z_{t-1} + u_t,\qquad E(u_t)=0, \; Var(u_t) = \sigma^2_u, \; E(u_tu_s) = 0 \; t\neq s,\; \delta $$y_t = \alpha + y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t,\qquad E(\varepsilon_t)=0, \; Var(\varepsilon_t) = \sigma^2_\varepsilon, \; E(\varepsilon_t\varepsilon_s) = 0 \; t\neq s,\; y_0=0$$ Assume now that their white-noise disturbances are contemporaneously correlated, i.e. that $E(u_t\varepsilon_t) = v_{u\varepsilon} \neq 0$. Hence the series are not independent. What will the attempt to calculate their correlation give us? By repeated substitution (and assuming that the $z_t$ series is long enough), the two series can be written: $$ z_t = \frac {\gamma}{1-\delta} + \sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\delta^ju_{t-j} \Rightarrow E(z_t) = \frac {\gamma}{1-\delta}, \; Var(z_t) = \frac {\sigma^2_u}{1-\delta^2}$$ $$ y_t = \alpha t + \sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\varepsilon_{t-j} \Rightarrow E(y_t) = \alpha t, \; Var(y_t) = \sigma^2_{\varepsilon}t$$ The contemporaneous correlation coefficient between the two is $$ \rho(z_t,y_t) = \frac{Cov(z_t,y_t)}{\sigma_{z_t},\sigma_{y_t}} $$ We have $$ Cov(z_t,y_t) = E(z_ty_t) - E(z_t)E(y_t) $$ $$= E\Big[\Big(\frac {\gamma}{1-\delta} + \sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\delta^ju_{t-j}\Big)\Big(\alpha t + \sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\varepsilon_{t-j}\Big)\Big] - \frac {\gamma}{1-\delta}\alpha t $$ $$ = E\Big(\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\delta^ju_{t-j}\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\varepsilon_{t-j}\Big) = E\Big(\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\delta^ju_{t-j}\varepsilon_{t-j}\Big) = \frac {v_{u\varepsilon}}{1-\delta}$$ Therefore $$\rho(z_t,y_t) = \frac{\frac {v_{u\varepsilon}}{1-\delta}}{\Big(\frac {\sigma^2_u}{1-\delta^2}\sigma^2_{\varepsilon}t\Big)^{\frac12}} = \frac{\sqrt{1-\delta^2}}{1-\delta} \frac{v_{u\varepsilon}}{\sigma_u\sigma_{\varepsilon}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$$ We see that the theoretical correlation coefficient is monotonically decreasing in time, i.e. it is also non-stationary, and different at each and every point in your sample . So any attempt to estimate it from the available sample, will give some "average" correlation coefficient which, moreover, will only hold for the specific time period that the sample covers. And being the average of a decreasing non-linear function of time, it will be difficult to interpret meaningfully. The point of all this algebra was: you have to read about stationary and non-stationary series, in order to see whether you can extract some meaningful conclusion from their statistical study together. Examine at least, whether they are co-integrated .
