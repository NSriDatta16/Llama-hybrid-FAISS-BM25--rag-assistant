how to start a feature in magento

I would like to set up a zip locator functionnality straight from the home page of a pizza magento website. The idea is to redirect user depending on his postcode to a specific store (I set up multistore option in the backend, each store match a real physical store) so he can be deliver (or not) by the nearest pizza shop. The idea is pretty much simple but i didn't find any good ressources abording the subject...So if you have good link/tutorial/how to, or know the basic step to build it from scratch..like builiding a plugin or surcharge precise core lib.. Thx
