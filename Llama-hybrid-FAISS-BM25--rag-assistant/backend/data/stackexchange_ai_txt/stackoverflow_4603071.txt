These pieces of code are identical from Magento view - you didn't forget anything about how PHP works. With default Magento installation all 3 snippets must produce same results. If the results of those code blocks are different, then you should: a) turn off all custom extensions you use and try your code blocks without them - maybe some of extensions modify the default behavior of Order or Payment models. b) check that your code snippets are really same as presented in this question - maybe there were other code lines that you thought of as non-important and didn't include in this question c) check that you update view in your MySQL client after executing each code snippet - maybe you see just some old information in payment table c2) check that you don't use replicated MySQL severs - maybe you update information on master DB, but sees payment table from slave DB, where these changes haven't yet been synced to d) check that no other code executes after yours - maybe some other model or controller modifies additional_information and so deletes all your changes. Try to insert 'exit' just after your code so you'll be sure about it.
