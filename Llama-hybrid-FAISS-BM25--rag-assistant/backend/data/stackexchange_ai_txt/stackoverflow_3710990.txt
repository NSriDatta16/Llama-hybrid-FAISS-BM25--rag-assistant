How to use separate databases for production and testing in an eclipse RCP app

I am writing an eclipse RCP app and I am trying to use a separate db for tests to prevent corrupting my production db. During the setup of the test db i need to execute an sql file to fill it with test data. Is there a way to tell the app to use a different db and execute a specific sql script (maybe via launch properties or maybe fragments or sth else)? Thank you
