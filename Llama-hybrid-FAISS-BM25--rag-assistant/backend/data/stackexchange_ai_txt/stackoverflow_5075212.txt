You need to understand that id and name on are XML attributes - you need to express that in your classes, too: public class job { [XmlAttribute] public string id { get; set; } [XmlAttribute] public string name { get; set; } public List Files { get; set; } } The same applies to your tag and its class representation. Also: a valid XML document always has one root element and one root only - your XML fragment is not a valid XML document.
