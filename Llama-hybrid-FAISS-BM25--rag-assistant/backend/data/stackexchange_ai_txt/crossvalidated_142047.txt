If you don't mind me asking, why use a SVM? why not do something like a multi-class logistic regression (apologies if you have already tried it but thought I should put this in there). As a tip, this is a scenario very similar to what you use in Natural Language Processing (NLP) so you might think of borrowing a lot of the results developed there. For e.g., \ to classify words in a sentence what you suggested is essentially softwares you do for Proper Nouns (e.g. James). These words either (a) have not occurred in the sentence or (b) are words your machine did not find in a dictionary (so they are put in an `other' bucket)
