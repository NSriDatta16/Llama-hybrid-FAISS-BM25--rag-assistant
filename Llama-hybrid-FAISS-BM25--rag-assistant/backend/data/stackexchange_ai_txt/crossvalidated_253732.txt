Formula for inverse weighted average (smaller value gets higher weight)

In Python, I have some 'VALUE' with a metric for 'WEIGHT' in a pandas DataFrame: import pandas frame = pandas.DataFrame( { 'VALUE': [1,2,3,4,5] , 'WEIGHT': [23, 21, 10, 3, 0] } ) # VALUE WEIGHT # 0 1 23 # 1 2 21 # 2 3 10 # 3 4 3 # 4 5 0 I'd like to make a weighted average of 'VALUE' , but the logic should give more weight to smaller values of 'WEIGHT' . What's a generally accepted formula for accomplishing this? Thanks!
