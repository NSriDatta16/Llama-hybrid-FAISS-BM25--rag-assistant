XtraGrid Suite - is there a way to add a button or hyperlink to a cell?

I'm working with the XtraGrid Suite made by DevExpress. I can't find any sort of functionality to do this, but I'm curious if you can add a button or hyperlink to a grid cell. Context: I've got an Events list. Each Event has a Time, Start/End, and a Category (Utility and Maintenance). There can be Start events and Stop events. Having done my analysis of the problem, I've decided that having a StartTime and EndTime for each event would not work. So if an event starts, I'd record the current time to the Event object, and set it as a 'Start' event. I'd like to add a "Stop" button/hyperlink to a cell in that row. If the user wishes to log an Ends event, the event type, etc would be copied to a new Event with the type 'Stop' and the button would disappear. I hope this makes sense. EDIT: Aaronaught's answer is actually better than what I was originally asking (a button) so I've updated the question. That way, anyone looking for putting a hyperlink in a cell can benefit from his example : )
