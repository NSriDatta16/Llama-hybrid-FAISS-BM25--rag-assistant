Yes it is, at least for some flags. You can push and pop diagnostic settings like this: #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-pedantic" #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wall" This is also possible for optimization levels on a per-function level : #pragma GCC optimize ("string"...) These #pragma definitions affect all code after them in a source file. See these other questions for more information: Switching off optimization for a specific function in gcc 4.2.2 Selectively disable GCC warnings for only part of a translation unit?
