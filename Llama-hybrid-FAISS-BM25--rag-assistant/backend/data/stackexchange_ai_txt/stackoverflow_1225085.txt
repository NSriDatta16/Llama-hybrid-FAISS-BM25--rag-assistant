1st way: You could put the text fields into an array that mirrors the array that your cell values are in. The problem with this method tho is that when you need to bind a mouseListener or ActionListener to the TextField you will have a hard time figuring out which cell number it corrisponds to. 2nd way: You could extend the JTextField into a custom class with new instance variables that store cell number in it. Using this method you can also implement MouseListener or ActionListener on the extended class too and get whatever information about the field you need, without searching through your array. And combining with the first to put them into an array organizes them for quick access.
