How to combine dissimilar curves into a single "average"?

With relevance to " functional data analysis ", I am looking for some approach which can give an intermediate function among these five different function plots, where this "average function" has the closest distance at each point on the x-axis to each of the five plots. The plots are shown here for the purpose of the question: Are there any particular methods one can use?
