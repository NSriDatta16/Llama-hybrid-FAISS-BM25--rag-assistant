I'll bet your company is doing > $1B annually, all based on an Excel spreadsheet. You aren't alone in that. I'd start by thinking about the problem instead of the Excel spreadsheet. What is the business problem? Can you model it with objects? I see a few objects: Policy, with all its attendant Coverage and Class children; Insured, with characteristics like gender, smoker, etc. - you get the idea. Projection sounds like you'll have a handful of "what if" variables that will have some statistical properties that you'll vary. Your job will be to run lots of Monte Carlo like simulations that alter the variables by drawing from a sample and computing the output. Your result will be a projected mean value with a standard deviation and a confidence level. Could be a good candidate for massive parallel computing. What is the basis for the calculations? Any well-known models that you can share? Maybe that would give a hint.
