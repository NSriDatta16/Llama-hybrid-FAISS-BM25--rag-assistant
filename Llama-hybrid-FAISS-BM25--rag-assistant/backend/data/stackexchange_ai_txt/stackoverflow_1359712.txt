You might want to take a look at Are You Certifiable from Microsoft. You have to register with a Windows Live ID to access all the questions. The questions they have cover a range of programming technologies (includes SQL Server and sysadmin). The questions are multiple choice and include a paragraph or two on why each response was correct or incorrect. The site includes a cheesy point system with awards and badges.
