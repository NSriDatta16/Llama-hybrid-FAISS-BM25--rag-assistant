predicting proportions in a sample with multiple dichotomous variables using a logit model

For a (fictional) multiple logistic regression , let's consinder a DV 'hired' (0,1) and three dichotomous IVs 'college_degree' (0,1), 'affluent' (0,1) and 'recommendated' (0,1) for N = 1,000 participants. Running a logistic regression and generating predicted probabilities of being hired using the predict function for a glm object works well. For every respondent I have a probability value ranging continuously from 0 to 1. Since I do have a base distribution of all three IVs and the DV, I want a kind of simulator that predicts the percentage/proportion of the DV using each indivduals predicted probability. Let's say in the sample 20% are hired, 50% have a college degree, 10% are affluent and 35% are recommendated. I want to use the predicted values to see how much would the proportion of 'hired' goes up, when I, e.g., change the proportion of recommendations to 50% . I guess, I could also use the equation with the coefficients of the logit model, but would need to run it for every individual. Is there any way to implement this in R (well or Excel, if that is easier)?
