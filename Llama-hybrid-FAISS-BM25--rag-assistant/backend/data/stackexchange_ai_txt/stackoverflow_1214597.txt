Apparently it is not possible to allocate more than 2GB even under 64 bit .net application running on a 64 bit OS. I find this to be very disappointing and completely without regard for what 64 bit applications and OSs are made for. I am dealing with gigantic images and would like to be able to work with the raw bytes all in RAM at once. Now I have to implement paging algorithms to limit the chunks to 2GB. Hey Microsoft, hows abouts you fix this in the coming .NET release? Yes, I said fix. That's because it's broken. How do you expect 64 bit applications to take off when you do stupid things like this. (Can you tell that I am annoyed .) Thanks for listening. Link http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/archive/2005/08/10/450202.aspx
