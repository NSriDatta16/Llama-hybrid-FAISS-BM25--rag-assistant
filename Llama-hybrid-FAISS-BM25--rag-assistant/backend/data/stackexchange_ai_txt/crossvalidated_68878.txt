To answer the notation questions: The notation "$\bar x$" means the sample mean of $x$'s, $\bar x = \frac{1}{n}(x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n)$. So just take the (sample) average of whatever is under the bar. $\sigma_{\text{something}}$ should represent a population standard deviation, not a sample standard deviation (for which instead one might use $s_{\text{something}}$). From context, it appears that $R$ is a return, and the subscripts $\text{port}$ and $\text{mk}$ are "portfolio" and "market" respectively. There seem to be a number of problems with the exposition in that post (as it stands, it seems to be wrong in several ways), but as you suggested in comments, that's beyond the scope of the specific question relating to notation.
