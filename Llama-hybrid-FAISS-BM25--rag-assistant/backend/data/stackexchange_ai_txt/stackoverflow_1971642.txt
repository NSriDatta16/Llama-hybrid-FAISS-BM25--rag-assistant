For cross-sectional time-series data the package plm is very useful. It has a lag function that takes into account the panel nature of the data. library(plm) data("Produc", package="plm") dnow One problem with the package is that using with (or within or transform) gives you the wrong answer. head(with(dnow, lag(pcap,1))) 15032.67 15501.94 15972.41 16406.26 16762.67 17316.26 So be careful.
