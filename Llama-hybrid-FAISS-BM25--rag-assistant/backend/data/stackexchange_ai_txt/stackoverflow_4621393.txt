I would explain git as "a directed graph of commits where a commit is a diff, a parent (or parents) hash, and a hash of itself." A git repository is, FWIW, a forest of history trees, of which the commit leaves are (commit metadata plus) trees of directories and files. No diffs , not in Git, at least when it comes to the concept. If the storage engine happens to do deltification, that is another story. As for AccuRev, I watched their 2-minute introductory video (link intended for reference, not advertisement), and it looks pretty much like your average time-arranged SCM history tree (branches). The items with the watery-wave icon are branch heads, and the yellow folder-like thing is a working copy. When the presenter moves the working copies, he seems to be doing a rebase of all his subordinate's working copies (evil that! just think about the merge conflicts!). The icon with three green dots (the issue list) would be a commit list then that is cherry-picked when you copy it. In one sentence: nothing you don't know already through prior experience to cvs/svn/git â€” move along I'd say.
