Pre-trained word vectors seems the most logical solution for your problem. Other than that, it might be worthwhile translating your non-english words to retain similarity. Services like Google Cloud offer automatic translations (like using google translate directly) accessible through typical NLP language like R or Python.. I don't believe there are pre-trained word embeddings that have been trained on different languages and made consistent, I also think this would be a very non-trivial task because of the fundamental differences between languages!
