Get the next 4 months in a formatted string

What is the most elegant way of getting the following: Starting from today's date, return an enumerable that would be the following: July 1st July 15th August 1st August 15th September 1st September 15th October 1st October 15th Should account for things like if it's the end of the year, then it goes December 15 January 1st.
