I think you answered your question writing it down Brann. This problem can be seen in this way: from one hand you have "real time data". You have fresh data and from them it's nice to create view to show "real time data" too. But as time goes on, there are more data and logic changes. So it's good to have written down summaries of data you had some time ago. It's very pragmatic - you do not duplicate data, because you recalculate them and save into new table summary of them. So when you think of it in this way, it's obvious that in this example new table will be better. As you write: Faster access Can have more complicated logic Have archive data unchanged when logic changes So when you meet this (or part) of this criteria as you requirement than its not choice - you go into tables. When I would use view is only when showing fresh data out of other fresh data. In very, very simple problems. And when it gets more complicated - you always switch to new table. So do not be afraid to go into it. Having one summary table with faster access is very pretty solution and it's a sign of well formed database. Take care of the design of this table - so when business logic changes - you do not need to change everything from one stone in this table. And then everything will be OK!
