I have a time series data with date and revenue columns. That is daily data. I need to forecast revenue for next 365 days. When i applied adf test, my p-value was much higher and hence showed that the data is non stationary. So I applied log and differencing to make data stationary and then applied auto.arima. Is my approach correct? How do I validate my result? Also how can i get back the undifferentiated and unlogged data in forecast?
