A sample count proportion is not equal to the population proportion. Count proportions (e.g. from a binomial or hypergeometric) tend to vary more when they're close to the middle (a broad range of proportions near 0.5), less when they're close to zero or one. A count proportion is a kind of average, and like other averages, they tend to be more variable when sample sizes are small and less variable when sample sizes are large (the standard error of a mean is $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ here as well, but $\sigma$ is related to the true population proportion). This means that a large difference in two sample proportions can very easily occur when the population proportions are equal if sample sizes are small, but only relatively small differences will occur when sample sizes are large. This means that sample size is critical to deciding whether a certain amount of change in proportion is indicating the population proportions differ or if it could be consistent with there being no difference in population proportions.
