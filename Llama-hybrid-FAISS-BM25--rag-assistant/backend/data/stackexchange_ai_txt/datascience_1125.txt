Named entity disambiguation contests

I am interested in the field of named entity disambiguation and want to learn more about it. I have heard that there are contests organised by various associations on these kind of research topics. These contests are very helpful as they give a practical experience in these fields. I found one such contest organised by Microsoft research here though the dates have already passed. Can anyone point me to any other such contests ? Also, is there a site which catalogues these contests so that one can just go there and know about all upcoming contests ? Thanks in advance.
