You aren't telling the button about name anywhere. You could set it in the title buttons title with [aa setTitle:name forState:UIControlStateNormal]; then access it in fullscreen: with [sender currentTitle] . If you want the message to be independent of the title you could either make your own subclass of UIButton to store the message or have a different target action for each button. Also, the way you are constructing the names is fragile. Something like this might be better: NSArray* names = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"ZERO", @"ONE", @"Two", @"Three", nil]; for (NSString* name in names) { // Do stuff with name }
