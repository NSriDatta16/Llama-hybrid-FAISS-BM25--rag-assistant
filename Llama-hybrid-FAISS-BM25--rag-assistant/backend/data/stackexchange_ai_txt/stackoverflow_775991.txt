Many people have mentioned the pros of moving. I suggest you make the move, but here are two of the biggest annoyances I found: You need a project file to debug a binary. In VC6 you can just drag an exe to the VC window and debug it. In every version after that, you need a project file first. Everything is an extra mouse click away. A lot of menu items were moved one menu level further away which is annoying if you are a mouse junky like me.
