There are actually two separate issues here: reliability of any given timing method when CPU clock frequency changes (either increasing via e.g. Turbo Boost or decreasing because of e.g. power saving or thermal management kicking in) - this is addressed in some of the other answers reliability of a benchmark measurement (given a reliable clock) - this is more problematic - if you're working on optimisation and looking for small improvements, e.g. around 10%, then it's easy to get misled by the effect of clock variations from Turbo Boost at al. Possible solutions are: 2.1. disable Turbo Boost and other clock frequency scaling 2.2. run benchmarks for a long enough time to average out clock speed variations
