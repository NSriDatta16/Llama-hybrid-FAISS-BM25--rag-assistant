How to avoid "505: HTTP Version not supported" error?

I am trying to use the Bing SOAP API for a simple search request. But now that I finally figured out how to send the request using JAX-WS, I am stuck again. I get the reply com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.ClientTransportException: The server sent HTTP status code 505: HTTP Version not supported when I send the request. Can anyone help me out? I am using dynamic invocation with JAX-WS 2.0, if that makes any difference. Dispatch dispatch = service.createDispatch( portName, SOAPMessage.class, Service.Mode.MESSAGE); MessageFactory messageFactory = ((SOAPBinding) dispatch.getBinding()) .getMessageFactory(); SOAPMessage request = messageFactory.createMessage(); // Add content to the request SOAPMessage response = dispatch.invoke(request); Wireshark tells me, that the request header contains POST /soap.asmx HTTP/1.1 and the reply comes back also with an HTTP/1.1 versioning. Doesn't this mean, it's alright? Thanks, moxn UPDATE : It's not a JAX-WS specific error. I implemented the communication via Commons HTTPClient and still get the same 505. Following the headers from the HTTPClient request: Content-Length: 435 Content-Type: text/xml Host: api.bing.net:80 Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.0.1 (java 1.5) Expect: 100-Continue UPDATE : It also doesn't work with HTTP/1.0 btw...
