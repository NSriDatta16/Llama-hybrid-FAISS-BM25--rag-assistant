You can avoid capitalizing a model name by setting a verbose_model_plural in the Meta class of your model definition in models.py with the setting as you want and a space as the first character. E.g., class SomeModel(models.Model): class Meta: verbose_name_plural = u' \u03BC' EDIT1: My initial solution didn't work, as django always capitalizes the first letter even in a verbose_name_plural (though it won't automatically convert the other letters to lowercase like the admin normally does to model names.) However, making the first letter of the verbose name be a space, it works. Note since the name is in a html table (which ignores whitespace before the first/last character) the space in the verbose model name doesn't get noticed to the user. EDIT2: Or to avoid capitalizing a field name (sorry -- didn't read question carefully). class AnAverageModel(models.Model): mean = models.FloatField(u" \u03BC")
