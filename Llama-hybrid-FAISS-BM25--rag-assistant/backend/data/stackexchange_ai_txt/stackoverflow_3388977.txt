It looks like Bespin uses Python in the same way it would use PHP, if the autors chose PHP and not Python. If you are a PHP developer, you already are a "back-end" programmer and you already know what it does, the only difference is the programming language that was used to do that. Some web sites, mostly the huge ones like Facebook or Twitter, consist of more layers than the usual MVC ones. If you look at Facebook, you can see PHP scripts that generate HTML and AJAX responses as the "front-end" and high-performance databases, storage, computation cluster, application servers etc. as the "back-end" (where PHP is rarely used). So what is considered "front-end" and what "back-end" may also depend on how you look at it.
