Garbage collection rate vs object allocation rate

Is it conceivable that the rate at which new objects are created by a Java program somewhat exceeds the rate at which these objects are garbage collected in the young generation ? ...Thus causing an ever greater backlog of new objects sitting on the heap until a full gc is triggered ? Any metrics I could collect to identify/verify this scenario ? The objects created have a maximum lifespan of around 1 second. Most are alive for about 400 milliseconds, on average. Thanks.
