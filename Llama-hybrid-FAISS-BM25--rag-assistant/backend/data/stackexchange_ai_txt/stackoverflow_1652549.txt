Algorithms of the Intelligent Web (Manning) (esp. Chapter 4) and a book with a similar title from O'Reilly cover clustering algorithms. The Manning book starts with naive SQL approaches and moves to K-means, ROCK, and DBSCAN. It's more generalized than just focusing on tags, but easy to apply in that context. Code is presented in Java but is easily adapted to Ruby (sometimes more easily than adapting the Java code to your problem). Chapter 5 covers classifications, which is about building topologies, and discusses Bayesian algorithms.
