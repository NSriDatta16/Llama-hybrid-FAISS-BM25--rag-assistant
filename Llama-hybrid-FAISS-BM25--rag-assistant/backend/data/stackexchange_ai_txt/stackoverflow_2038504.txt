dojo.gfx matrix transformation

Matrix transformations has got my head spinning. I've got a dojox.gfx.group which I want to be draggable with Mover and then be able to rotate it around a certain point on the surface. My basic code looks like this: this.m = dojox.gfx.matrix, . . . updateMatrix: function(){ var mtx = this.group._getRealMatrix(); var trans_m = this.m.translate(mtx.dx, mtx.dy); this.group.setTransform([this.m.rotateAt(this.rotation, 0, 0), trans_m]); } The rotation point is at (0,0) just to keep things simple. I don't seem to understand how the group is being rotated. Any reference to simplistic tutorial on matrix transformations would also help. The ones I've checked out haven't help too much.
