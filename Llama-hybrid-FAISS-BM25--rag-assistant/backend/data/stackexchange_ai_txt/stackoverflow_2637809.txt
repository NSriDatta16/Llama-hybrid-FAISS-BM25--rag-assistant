How can I differentiate two different touches on a layer?

I am writing an app in cocos2d. I hava a sprite and a text in my scene. I have written two separate classes for sprite and text. And I added both of them to another class. In sprite class I have written - (void)ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event And in text class I have written -(void) registerWithTouchDispatcher { [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher]addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES]; } -(BOOL) ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { return YES; } -(void) ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Recognized tOuches in Instructions");// CGSize windowSize = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] winSize]; CCNode *node = [self getChildByTag:kTagNode]; [node setPosition: ccp(text1.contentSize.width/2,text1.contentSize.height/2 - windowSize.height)]; } -(void) ccTouchMoved:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; CGPoint prevLocation = [touch previousLocationInView: [touch view]]; touchLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL: touchLocation]; prevLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL: prevLocation]; CGPoint diff = ccpSub(touchLocation,prevLocation); CCNode *node = [self getChildByTag:kTagNode]; CGPoint currentPos = [node position]; [node setPosition: ccpAdd(currentPos, diff)]; } But, only touches in the text are recognized and touch of sprite is not recognized ? How can I differentiate the two touches. Can anyone suggest better method for it than my solution.
