Time series (more generally: all observed data) consist of signal and noise. Time series algorithms (more generally: all models and fitting algorithms) aim at extracting the signal and forecasting that. They don't forecast the noise, because that is by definition unforecastable. Therefore the predictions will always be less variable than the original data, because the noise component is not included. To account for the inevitable noise, you can calculate prediction-interval s. I very strongly suspect that your training data exhibits a large amount of noise. Or what the algorithm believes is noise. If you can feed your algorithm some information that explains the noise, i.e., predictors, noise can miraculously be transmuted into signal . And improve your forecasts.
