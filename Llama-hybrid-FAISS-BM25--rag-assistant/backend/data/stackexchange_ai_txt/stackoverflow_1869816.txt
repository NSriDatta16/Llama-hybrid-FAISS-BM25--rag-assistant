An alternative that doesn't require configuration in a ViewResolver might involve a top-level Velocity file, then conditionally parsing sub-files that has something like the following. #if ($userAgent1) #parse ("user-agent-1.vm") #elseif ($userAgent2) #parse ("user-agent-2.vm") #end However, implementing a new or extending an existing ViewResolver is a pretty simple solution and would be the way I'd go with.
