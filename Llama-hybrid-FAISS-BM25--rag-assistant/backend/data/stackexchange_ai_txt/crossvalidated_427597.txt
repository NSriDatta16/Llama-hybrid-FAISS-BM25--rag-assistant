Obtaining VAE reconstruction probability

How does one calculate the reconstruction probability? Let's look at the keras example code from here . Is the reconstruction probability the output of a specific layer, or is it to be calculated somehow? According to the cited paper, the reconstruction probability is the "probability of the data being generated from a given latent variable drawn from the approximate posterior distribution".
