Breuschâ€“Pagan test: what exactly is the z-variable

I want to perform a Breusch-Pagan-Test. I did calculate some very small examples following the procedure described below, just to understand what the test does: found here: ( https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Breusch%E2%80%93Pagan_test.html ) in Step 2: it is says, that "z could be partly replaced by independent variables x." Also in all hand-calculated examples I found z was just replaced by x. But can somone tell me in simple words what z really is? If it is x, why is it not named so, in the formulas? Thanks for any help you can offer!
