Is what I did supervised or unsupervised Machine learning?

My goal is to get a smartphone names from Twitter. So this is what I followed: 1- I extracted 100K tweets using the keyword “smartphone”. 2- I Applied LDA after applying ngram tokenization and cleaning.So, I got noisy results such as:(giveway, international, apple, iphone_6, samsung_s5,news…) 3- I filtered the results using a smartphone list (iphone_6, samsung_s5,iphone_4s,…) extracted from DBpedia in order to remove the noise. Is what I did supervised or unsupervised Machine learning?
