"Methodologically" it doesn't make a difference, because more or less whatever method is applied to these data will give you equivalent results, whether you code it between 1 and 5 or between 0% and 100%. There is some controversy around whether Likert scales can be analysed as quantitative (more precisely: interval scaled) data or whether only methods for ordinal data (such as medians) should be applied, but even then it doesn't make a difference how the levels are coded. If you compute averages of the original values, you have already chosen to treat them as quantitative, so the issue has nothing to do with whether percentage scaling is used. I think what you really want to know is not a "methodological" issue but rather a psychological one: Will the percentage scale give some people inappropriate ideas about what these values mean? I can't address that because this is really not an issue for a statistician. However, I doubt it will make a big difference.
