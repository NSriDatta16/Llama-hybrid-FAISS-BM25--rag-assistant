Django: How do you access a model's instance from inside a manager?

class SupercalifragilisticexpialidociousManager(models.Manager): # Sorry, I'm sick of Foo and Spam for now. def get_query_set(self, account=None): return super(SupercalifragilisticexpialidociousManager, self).get_query_set().filter(uncle=model_thats_using_this_manager_instance.uncle) The magic I'm looking for is the "uncle=model_thats_using_this_manager_instance.uncle". It seems like I should be able to do this somehow. I know I could say self.model to get the model, but how to get the instance?
