So, due to the nature of the problem (mail is being accepted for delivery - $mail is true), the problem is likely in the message content. Do you have access to the mail server itself? Can you check the logs? var_dump() the $subject, $message, and set the headers to a var and var_dump() that as well. Examine the contents with a fine tooth comb. Remove suspect characters and line breaks until it does work. One thing to try... (though, the fact that your other mail is being accepted says this is likely not the case) http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it does not comply with Â» RFC 2822. The problem with mail() is that its just feeding mail to the local sendmail daemon. It doesn't give you any active feedback on the mail, and the relay headers sometimes get you spam de-rated. I'd check out http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/
