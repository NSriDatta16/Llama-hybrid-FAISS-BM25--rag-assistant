Is spearman correlation a good approach to discriminate anti-phase v/s in-phase?

I have oscillating time series and i want to discriminate if there are in anti-phase or in in-phase. At least for cosine like time series it work great. Spearman correlation between cosine and -cosine = -1 (complete out-of-phase) and between cosine and sin = 0 (just in the middle between in and antiphase) import numpy as np import scipy.stats as ss t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000) x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) x_anti = - np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) y = np.cos(2 * np.pi * t) ss.spearmanr(x, x_anti)[0] ss.spearmanr(x, y)[0] I was wondering what are the limitations and if there's a better tool to discriminate it.
