Logistic regression - how good is my model?

I am a beginner in ML so apologize in advance if this sounds silly. I did a logistic regression on a real data set and I am having problems measuring how well my model fits. I still don't understand how to apply the F1 score in my case. After performing the error analysis on the cross validation set I got the following values: Precision: 0.8642534 Recall: 0.8488889 Accuracy: 0.8222222 F1 score: 0.8565022 Are those good values? What do I compare them with? Is this a sign of a strong relationship between my predictor variables and the response variable? The classes on the response variable are not skewed (I am predicting a gender). Any help ... I would much appreciate. Thanks a lot
