How to pop up a minimized wxPython window

I have a utility where I want it to pop up to the front of the screen from time to time to request user input. (I know it is very annoying general behavior but I have good reasons in this case.) I have found the RequestUserAttention method that can be used for a more pleasant request for input from the user but in my case I just want it to pop up a window. Maybe even modal on top of all the other windows. The platform here is XP if that makes any difference.
