E-Commerce Development: Contracting with a talented developer vs. expensive larger company

I'd like this post to evolve in to a general pros and cons list for contracting to upgrade a significant e-commerce site. (Let's say, 400-1200 hours of work depending on the talent and organization). What are the pros and cons of contracting with a small talented and experienced company or single developer? What are the pros and cons of contracting with a larger company for the same work? (30+ employee operation) I could definitely use some help cleaning this question up, but I think the post can end up being a pretty good resource on stackoverflow. This is a question that has to be answered time and time again for small businesses.
