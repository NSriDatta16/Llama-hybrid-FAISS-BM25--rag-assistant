Random Forest: Different accuracy, TPR and FPR between training set and test set?

I'm a newbie learning Random Forest. When I use this method to predict my outcome and check with the same data set (training set), I see that the model fits almost perfectly the data. But when I check with the test set, I obtain the good TPR (True Positive Ratio ~ 99%) but very bad FPR (False Positive Ratio ~ 64%). What is the reason here? And what is the model-building strategies for Random Forest?
