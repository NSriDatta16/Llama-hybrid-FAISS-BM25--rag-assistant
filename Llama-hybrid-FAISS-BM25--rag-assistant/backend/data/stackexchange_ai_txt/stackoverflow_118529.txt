Some database products (e.g., Oracle) offer file system-like storage that you can put files into. Since it's an Oracle-managed file system, you have all the Oracle backup and management facilities. Since it's a file system, you just use ordinary OS tools like cp to move files in and out of it. The best practice is to avoid wasting RDBMS on large BLOBS of data that the RDMBS can't use. use the database for names, dates and stuff it handles well. The actual image file or spreadsheet file can be left in ordinary filesystem world. If you do this, you don't have a lot of effort or complexity -- you're just collecting essential information on your files. You don't duplicate storage (the spreadsheet is only an ordinary file). You don't put large objects in the database that can't be processed by the database. The file system is faster, simpler and more reliable than the database. Feel free to use it for bulk storage. The database has cool search capabilities. Use the database for just that.
