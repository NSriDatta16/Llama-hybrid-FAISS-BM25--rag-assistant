This seems to be a challenging question. Having asked it some time ago, it remained unanswered as tumbleweed and got finally removed. The manuscript cited below makes progress on the question, the proposed method could deal with the question; an efficient implementation is still missing. Key elements are An efficient integration method for repeated calculation of statistical integrals for a set of hypotheses (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals) using importance sampling Introduction of pointwise mutual information as an efficient test statistics that was shown to be optimal under certain conditions. Eliminating the need for complex minimax optimizations by demonstrating that priors may be used to derive loss functions, rather than trying to determine optimal minimax priors given the loss function. The proposed approach has a few fringe benefits: The proposed test statistics (point wise mutual information) can be used for frequentist and Bayesian inference and results in consistent confidence intervals and credible intervals. The proposed approach is entirely based on the Likelihood function It includes a generic proposal on how to use prior information for frequentist tests. Still missing is an efficient implementation of marginalization. Ref: Using prior knowledge in frequentist tests. figshare. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4819597.v3
