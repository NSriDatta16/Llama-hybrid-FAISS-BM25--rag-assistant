jquery for ruby on rails

I am tying to use this code http://gist.github.com/110410 to dump Prototype in favor of jQuery but I do have a problem. This is my HTML (a link_to generated link): Add to cart Issue: Everything works as it should except that the page does a reload. I suspect that the submit gets thru which causes a page reload. Is there an elegant way to prevent that ? return false; doesn't seem to cut it in this case.
