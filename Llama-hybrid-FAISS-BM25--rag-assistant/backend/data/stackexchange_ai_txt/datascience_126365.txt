Hyperopt: initializing the search with manually defined points

So I am making a transition from the bayesian_optimization (bayesopt) package to hyperopt. A great feature of bayesopt is that it allows to initiate the search with manually selected points (probing) . The motivation is that I want to ensure that the search process will evaluate a machine learning algorithm on the default parameters. Is it possible to achieve that in Hyperopt? If yes, what is a good and straightforward practice to achieve that?
