Interpretation of zero-one-inflated beta models in brms

I have 20 participants who have watched 18 clips. Every clip belongs to one category of pleasure (p_cat: negative, neutral, positive) and one category of intensity (i_cat: low, medium, high). I have 2 different clips for each combination of p_cat and i_cat (3 * 3 combinations). In terms of the response variables, the participants evaluate the clips on two sliders: pleasure and intensity of emotion respectively. The sliders had hidden values, that were continuous in $[0, 1]$ . I am working for the first time with Bayesian statistics and the brms R package. After looking into several sources, I concluded that I should use a zero_one_inflated_beta family for my model, since I have several zeros and ones. One of my main sources is Matti Vuorre's How to analyse visual analog (slider) scale data? Here are the formulas I used for two models: pleasure ~ p_cat * i_cat + age + experience + gender + (1|item) + (1 |subject) intensity ~ p_cat * i_cat + age + experience + gender + (1|item) + (1 |subject) I used random effects for participants and items (clips), since every participant evaluates every clip. I have the following questions: In the summary of the fitted model, the lower and upper 95% CI for all covariates contain $0s$ . Does this mean that the covariates do not have an effect, or I need to antilogit before attempting to interpret the results? I understand that I need to antilogit before doing contrasts analysis. For contrasts, I use the following code adapted from Andrey Anikin's example to see if the pleasure response differs between neutral and negative levels of p_cat ( fit$p_catNeu and fit$p_catNeg respectively, which I've got with posterior_samples() , and antilogit): neu_vs_neg = fit$p_catNeu - fit$p_catNeg > quantile(neu_vs_neg, probs = c(.5, .025, .975)) 50% 2.5% 97.5% 0.11766086 -0.04730185 0.29740290 > mean(neu_vs_neg > 0) [1] 0.92725 How can I interpret it? Following Andrey's example (slides 35 and 36), I would say: Are neutral clips evaluated with higher pleasure compared to negative clips? Possibly yes, 11.7% higher, but the evidence is not very strong. And for the mean of the differences that are greater than zero: we are 92.7% confident that neutral clips are evaluated higher in pleasure compared to negative clips. But for me this is confusing; I have weak evidence but high confidence to answer the question positively? How about the Family Specific Parameters estimates phi, zoi, coi ? How do I deal with them? I understand the estimates I get in the Population-Level Effects summary are the mu . Are these enough to show contrasts, or do I need additional regressions for phi, zoi, coi in a bf() as Matti Vuorre does in his example?
