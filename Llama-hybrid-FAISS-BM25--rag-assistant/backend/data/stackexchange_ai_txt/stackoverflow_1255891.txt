Maybe it won't be a full answer to your question, but here's what I've been able to find so far : there is some kind of a partial answer in the book " Extending and Embedding PHP ", written by Sara Golemon ( amazon ; some parts are also available on google books). The relevant part (a note at the top of page 56) is : Ever wonder why some extensions are configured using --enable-extname and some are configured using --with-extname ? Functionally, there is no difference between the two. In practice, however, --enable is meant for features that can be turned on without requiring any third-party libraries. --with , by contrast, is meant for features that do have such prerequisites. So, not a single word about performance (I guess, if there is a difference, it is only a matter of " loading one more file " vs " loading one bigger file ") ; but there is a technical reason behind this possibility. I guess this is done so PHP itself doesn't require an additional external library because of some extension ; using the right option allows for users to enable or disable the extension themselves, depending on whether or not they already have that external library.
