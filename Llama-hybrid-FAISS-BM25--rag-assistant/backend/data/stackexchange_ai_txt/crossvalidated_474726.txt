I do not understand the truncation in the probability computation. If an observation $X_i$ is generated from the mixture distribution with density $$p\varphi(x;\mu_1,\sigma_1)+(1-p)\varphi(x;\mu_2,\sigma_2)\tag{1}$$ the probability that it comes from the first component is given by $$\mathfrak{p}(x_i)=\dfrac{p\varphi(x_i;\mu_1,\sigma_1)}{p\varphi(x_i;\mu_1,\sigma_1)+(1-p)\varphi(x_i;\mu_2,\sigma_2)}$$ For instance, here is the probability attached to $$p=7/10,\mu_1=0,\sigma_1=1,\mu_2=2,\sigma_2=3$$ Interestingly, when simulating a sample from this mixture, about a fraction $p=7/10$ of the observations have a larger likelihood for the first Normal component. About $7/10$ of them have a posterior probability of being from the first component larger than $7/10$ : mu1=0;si1=1;mu2=2;si2=3;p=.7 pr dnorm(x,mu2,si2)) sum(pr(x)>.7) Furthermore, from a Bayesian viewpoint, the probability for a observation $x_i$ to stem from component 1 versus component 2 should not use estimated parameters $p,\mu_1,\ldots,\sigma_2$ but integrate them out.
