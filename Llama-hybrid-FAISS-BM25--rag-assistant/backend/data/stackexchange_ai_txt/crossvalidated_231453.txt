Statistical significance between several percentages

I am trying to find a statistical difference between the success rate of several machine learning techniques using different activation functions. I obtained the success rates for each machine learning technique and the different activation functions. The following data is what I obtained: +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Column | Activation function A | Activation function B | Activation function C | +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Algorithm 1 | 90% | 70% | 50% | | Algorithm 2 | 40% | 50% | 100% | | Algorithm 3 | 60% | 90% | 90% | +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ As you can see there is one entry with a success rate of 100%, however that does not necessarily mean that algorithm 2 with activation function C is definitely the best approach. It might be the case that 1A, 2C, 3B and 3C are all good options since there might not be a significant difference among these algorithms. Which significance test should I use to test which algorithm(s) in combination with an activation function(s) is preferred over others? The sample size is fairly small, per condition n=10.
