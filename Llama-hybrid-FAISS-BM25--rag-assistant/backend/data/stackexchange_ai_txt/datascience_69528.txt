Even I agree that the number of features is less. I think you should follow the following roadmap to achieve your task:- Analyze the data and find out columns with missing values Try to fill up the missing value (if possible) or you may also drop the columns depending upon the nulls in it. For all the column data where data is not in numerical form, transform the data into the numerical form using the one-hot encoding method. Now your data is ready to be trained. Meanwhile, you can also see if you want to drop any feature or want to create a new one. Train your model with any of the regression algorithms like XGBoost, SVM, Lasso Regression, etc and predict your values. For verification of your model performance, you should check RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
