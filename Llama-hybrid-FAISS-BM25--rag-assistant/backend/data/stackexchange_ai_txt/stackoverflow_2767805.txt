You have multiple problems with your code that make it either not working in some browsers or partial working in others: onmouseover/onmouseout event handlers assigned as properties do not and shall not be copyied when cloning (in any browser according to DOM specification), that is why you do not see text-underline effect in any browser In Internet Explorer (prior to IE9) it is not possible to assign an event handler by setting a onxxx attribute with setAttribute method You clone an HTML structure with id attributes and insert it into the same document which creates a problem of duplicate id's - this is "illegal" and can lead to unpredictable behavior So the only solution for you code to start working properly in every browser is to clone fragment without ids and (re-)assign event handlers manually.
