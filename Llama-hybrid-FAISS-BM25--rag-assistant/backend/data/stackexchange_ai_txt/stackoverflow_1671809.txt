I don't know GML but at the moment, you seem to be converting the result of the division to a real, and by this time it is too late. I have revised your program, making some other improvements. Forgive me if it's not valid GML. var num, totalNum, averageNum, numItems, msg; totalNum = 0; numItems = 0; num = get_integer("Please enter a number. Enter -99 to quit.", "type here"); while(num != -99) { totalNum += num; numItems += 1; num = get_integer("Please enter a number. Enter -99 to quit.", "type here"); } msg = "Total is: " + string(totalNum) + "#"; averageNum = real(totalNum) / numItems; msg += "Average is: " + string(averageNum); show_message(msg);
