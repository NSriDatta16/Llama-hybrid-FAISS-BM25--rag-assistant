Developing an appropriate volatility variable to predict stock returns based on past month

I am doing a project about the predictability of stock returns. I am using following regression model: \begin{equation} r_{t} = \alpha+\beta X_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}, \end{equation} where $r_{t}$ is the stock return in month ${t}$ , $\beta$ is a slope of regression line, $X_{t-1}$ is the predictor of stock returns at month ${t}-1$ , $\alpha$ is a constant and $\epsilon_{t}$ is the error term. I have data set on monthly returns for 1764 months and I am trying to develop past month volatility as the predicting variable. I tried to do it by following method: \begin{equation} \sigma_{monthly}=\sqrt{(r_i-\overline{\mu})^2} \end{equation} where $r_t$ is monthly stock return at the time $t$ and $\overline{\mu}$ is the average stock return defined as: \begin{equation} \overline{\mu}=\frac{1}{1764}\sum_{i=1}^{1764} r_i. \end{equation} However, I am not sure if this is done correctly as I can't find any sources on exactly this issue. Thank you very much in advance for the help
