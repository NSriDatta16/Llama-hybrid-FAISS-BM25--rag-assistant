How to setup Park Place or other S3 clones

I'm about to design an application using S3 for storage. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to use the real service for development. Thus, I've to work with an interface-compatible replacement. I searched a lot and ended up with to solutions: Eucalyptus Walrus and Park Place. However, I have some trouble with both. Walrus does not seem to be a good replacement. It is obviously okay for storing virtual machine images, but it has some problems when used as a real key-value storage with multiple concurrent requests. The performance is really not as good as it should, and the whole eucalyptus system is way too heavyweight just for using a single component. Then I stumbled upon Park Place, a lightweight Ruby implementation. Unfortunately, the original source is not available anymore and there are a few scattered git-clones around, mostly outdated. There is also no complete documentation and no installation howto, especially for people that are not familiar with Ruby. Has anybody succeeded in installing Park Place? Or do you know of other interface-compatible S3 clones for development? Thanks in advance
