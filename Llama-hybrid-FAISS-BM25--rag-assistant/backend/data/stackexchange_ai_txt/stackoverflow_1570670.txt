Geocoding - Grouping multiple addresses into major cities

Been hunting through previous questions on Geocoding and while many are helpful I'm not finding one to my needs. I need to group multiple addresses to the nearest city centers. My only address information is city, country, and state (if applicable). For example, all addresses in San Francisco and within miles should be listed as San Francisco. I'll need to know the count of addresses rolled-up to San Francisco. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this. I don't particularly want to manually identify a list of major cities if possible. Is there a list of these I can start from? What about using an average lat/long location of all addresses within miles? Granted the final 'center point' would move around a bit as the average is computed but perhaps that is an approximate solution. Not quite sure how to do this so again, appreciate input!
