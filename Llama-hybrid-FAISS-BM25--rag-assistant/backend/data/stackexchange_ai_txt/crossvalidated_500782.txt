What is the difference between Rplot ACF and ggplot ACF?

I am using below two codes for plotting the autocorreleation of a time series, The data looks like below: head(hr_mymts) Time Series: Start = c(1, 1) End = c(1, 6) Frequency = 168 TempCurr [1,] 173.2593 [2,] 176.8880 [3,] 175.6530 [4,] 174.2694 [5,] 174.1474 [6,] 173.3630 attr(,"index") [1] 1597042800 1597046400 1597050000 1597053600 1597057200 1597060800 attr(,"index")attr(,"tzone") [1] attr(,"index")attr(,"tclass") [1] POSIXct POSIXt ggAcf( hr_mymts, lag.max = 940, type = c("correlation"), plot = TRUE, ) and , plot(acf(hr_mymts,lag.max = 940,plot = FALSE),main=NA) Both results should be the same, but I can see the x-axis of the lag is different. Is there any way to get similar results? I want ggplot of ACF should have lags 1,2,3,.... on x-axis. I didn't understand the difference between the two ACF plots.
