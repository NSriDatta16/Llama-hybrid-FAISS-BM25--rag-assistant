Multivariate Laplace distribution

I find it strange, but I can't find what multivariate Laplace distribution looks like. What is its pdf? I googled for a while but couldn't find a good description. I wasn't paying attention to Laplace. Now, all of a sudden when I need it, I can't find the multivariate case.
