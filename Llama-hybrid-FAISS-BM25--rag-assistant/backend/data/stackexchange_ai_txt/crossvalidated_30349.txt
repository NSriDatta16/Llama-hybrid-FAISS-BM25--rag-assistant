You could use theory and the PCA to construct your components using a formula. For example Overall Ability = zSpell + zRead Relative Aptitude in Spelling in comparison to reading = zSpell - zRead That's basically what the PCA is doing. However, it removes issues of different signs across analyses. If the studies use exactly the same variables, you could even take it one step further and standardise the variables in both studies by a common mean and standard deviation. This would make the absolute values in the two studies comparable.
