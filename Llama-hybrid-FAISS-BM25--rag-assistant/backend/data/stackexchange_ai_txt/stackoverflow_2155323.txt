FILESTREAM and partitioned storage

I have a question about the current implementation of the FILESTREAM type for SQL Server 2008. Say I have a table that stores my documents using FILESTREAM. After a year, I want to archive (move) off a number of these documents to a different server. Is it possible to have FILESTREAM documents on two separate drives? Or do they have to all be on the same drive? Assuming the answer is yes, can someone post the T-SQL that would be used to create this table that uses two different locations for storage of the FILESTREAM data?
