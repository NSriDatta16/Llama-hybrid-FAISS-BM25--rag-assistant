Unless you really need the features of an integer (that is, the ability to do arithmetic), then it is probably better for you to store the product IDs as strings. You will never need to do anything like add two product IDs together, or compute the average of a group of product IDs, so there is no need for an actual numeric type. It is unlikely that storing product IDs as strings will cause a measurable difference in performance. While there will be a slight increase in storage size, the size of a product ID string is likely to be much smaller than the data in the rest of your database row anyway. Storing product IDs as strings today will save you much pain in the future if the data provider decides to start using alphabetic or symbol characters. There is no real downside.
