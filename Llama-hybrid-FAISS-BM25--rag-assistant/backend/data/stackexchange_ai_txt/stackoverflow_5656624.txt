BlackBerry webworks weird behavior with JavaScript

I am new to BlackBerry development, having developed iPhone apps for years. I am trying to do a simple menu like the following, invoked onLoad: function initMenus() { var item = new blackberry.ui.menu.MenuItem(false, 1, "Save", saveMe); var item2 = new blackberry.ui.menu.MenuItem(false, 2, "Load", loadMe); blackberry.ui.menu.addMenuItem(item); blackberry.ui.menu.addMenuItem(item2); } function saveMe() { localStorage.pixels = window.pageYOffset; } function loadMe() { window.scrollTo(0, localStorage.pixels); } In the configuration file, I have: 007 Sample Application created using the BlackBerry Widget SDK that demonstrates how to use the Menu and MenuItem objects found within the Widget API collection. Adam Stanley Having installed the WebWorks last SDK, I can try with emulators of OS5 and OS6 families. Now, with OS6 simulators everything is fine. JavaScript functions are properly called. With OS5 simulators menu items are shown, but once I click on them, just nothing happens. I tried also with simple alerts, rather than to save and load data in localStorage, but functions are simply not called after clicking menu items. What am I doing wrong? I am aware that there is a known issue when declaring blackberry.ui.dialog and blackberry.ui.menu in the same application, but I'm just declaring blackberry.ui.menu .
