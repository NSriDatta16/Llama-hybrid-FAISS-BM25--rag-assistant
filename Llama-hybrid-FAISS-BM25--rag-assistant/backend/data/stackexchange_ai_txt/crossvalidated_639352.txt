You need to define a reference level for each separate categorical variable, which will be absorbed into the intercept. (Specifically, R does this automatically, by using the alphabetically first factor level as the reference.) The intercept is the fitted value for an instance of Local and Louisiana . An instance of Local and Oklahoma would add (i.e., subtract) the regionOklahoma estimate of -3000. An instance of National and Louisiana would add the geoNational estimate of 500. And finally, an instance of National and Oklahoma would add both the regionOklahoma estimate of -3000 and the geoNational estimate of 500. Everything is as it should be. In your example, region==Texas exactly where geo==Local , so these two factor levels carry the exact same information, and we can't disentangle the two. R addresses this issue by assigning the estimate to the column that comes first in the data frame, or in the formula. Compare the result of summary(lm(charges~region+geo,rev)) , which just switches the order of the two variables - you get an NA elsewhere, because your data is still redundant. If you get NA estimates in your actual data, then you almost certainly have exactly this issue: collinearity, AKA this factor level can be exactly determined based on the other variables. Hard to be more specific without digging into your actual data. Especially if you have more predictors, chasing the specific constellation that is redundant can be hard, and usually depends on the exact order of terms in the formula or in the data frame, as above. In a later comment, you explain that you are looking to get "the effect of region==Louisiana ". Now, "the effect of" something implies a comparison. If you want to compare the effect of being in Louisiana vs. the effect of being in Texas, then predict with your models, once for Louisiana and once for Texas, and take the difference. If you want the effect of Louisiana vs. a grand average, then fit a model for Louisiana and another one for all possible regions, taking the grand average, and compare the two fits. In simple cases, yes, this is just the parameter estimate. In more complex cases, you can derive this difference by using contrasts and the parameter estimates. Contrasts will also help you assess the statistical significance of any such difference, but if all you are interested in is the estimated value of the difference, I would say that simply fitting models and subtracting predicted values is easier to understand. In any case, you will need to decide on what to do with the other predictors. The "overall typical setting" may be very atypical in Louisiana, or in some other state. (I usually recommend Miller & Chapman, 2001 .) So it very much depends on getting the question right that you are looking to get an answer for.
