Can the BIC be used in neural nets despite its large no. of parameters?

I wonder if I can calculate a BIC value ( $BIC=-2\log L(\hat{\theta}) + \log n \cdot d$ ) for a neural net. The number of parameters is large, $d \approx 20,000$ and I only have $n=700$ samples. Here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion , they say that the BIC is only for models with $n>>d$ , but I couldn't find another source confirming this statement. Does anybody knows something? I thought that they are maybe referring to the regression context, where $d-2$ is also similar to the number of covariates. But this actually does not matter for other regression methods..
