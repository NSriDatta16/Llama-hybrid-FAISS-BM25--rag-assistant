I'd recommend getting VMWare Player and using the free Mono development platform image that is provided on the website. Download Mono Setup time for this will be minimal, and it will also allow you to get your code working in .NET and then focus on porting issues without a massive hassle of switching machines and the like. the VMWare Player tools will allow you to simply drag and drop the files over to copy them. I'm looking to take a couple of my .NET apps and make them Mono compliant, and this is the path I'm going to take here shortly.
