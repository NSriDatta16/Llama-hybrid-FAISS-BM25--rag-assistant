According to How to Internationalize your Eclipse Plug-In article A plug-in fragment provides additional functionality to its target plug-in. At runtime, these plug-in contributions are merged along with all dependent fragments. These contributions can include code contributions and contributions of resources associated with a plug-in, like property and HTML files. In other words, the plug-in has access to the fragment's contents via the plug-in's classloader. The Eclipse Platform merges plug-in fragments in a way that the runtime elements in the fragment augment the original targeted plug-in. The target plug-in is not moved, removed, or modified in any way. Since the fragment's resources are located by the classloader, the plug-in developer has no need to know whether resources are loaded from the plug-in's JAR file or one of its fragments' JAR files. I suspect the classLoader detect plugin.name in the de.support.help plugin first before the de.support.help.fragment fragment. At this point, I am not sure it can be done, since it has been attempted before (for the Eclipse CheckStyle plugin ), without much success.
