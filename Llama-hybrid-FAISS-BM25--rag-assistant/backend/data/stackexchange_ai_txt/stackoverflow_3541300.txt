You want to either do or . is simpler (it just drags everything in) while is more flexible (if there are templates colliding between the two, the over-ride of the called by the calling is better defined and generally sensible). Edit for added info: You need to make sure you call the templates in the imported stylesheet using the appopriate namespace. The easiest way is to make sure you have matching xmlns:foo declarations in the stylesheets, though you could call foo:template in one stylesheet as bar:template in the other if it had xmlns:bar instead.
