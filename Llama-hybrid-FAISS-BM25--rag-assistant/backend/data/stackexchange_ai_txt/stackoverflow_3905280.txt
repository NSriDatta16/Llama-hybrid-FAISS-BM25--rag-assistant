boost::filesystem::path and std::string

I have a String class which has a member std::string. One of the constructor is String (std::string s) { // member: std::string _mString; _mString = s; // error on path assignment } I now have functions that take String as parameter, e.g. Load(String path); but it turns out that boost::filesystem::path::string() is incompatible with that String constructor, yet, normally assigning is ok boost::filesystem::path somepath("some directory") std::string filename = somepath.extension(); // OK! What is happening? How can I make my constructor work? Thanks. EDIT: Issue solved by making it const ref, but still curious why the error because it seems ok to pass a copy since it can be assigned directly. Error in file xstring void __CLR_OR_THIS_CALL _Tidy(bool _Built = false, size_type _Newsize = 0) { // initialize buffer, deallocating any storage if (!_Built) ; else if (_BUF_SIZE (_Bx._Buf, _BUF_SIZE, _Ptr, _Newsize); _Mybase::_Alval.deallocate(_Ptr, _Myres + 1); } _Myres = _BUF_SIZE - 1; // **** ERROR *** _Eos(_Newsize); }
