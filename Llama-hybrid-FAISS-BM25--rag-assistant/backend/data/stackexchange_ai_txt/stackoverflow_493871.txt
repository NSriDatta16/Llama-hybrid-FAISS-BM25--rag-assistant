The problem is that the method signature must match the interface exactly. The easiest solution is to change public AwwaTransmissionInfo fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { to public IXmlSerializable fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { If you are unhappy with that, you can implement the interface explicitly. Add this: public IXmlSerializable IXmlSerializable.fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { return this.fromXML(inXml); } Then you will have two definitions for fromXML(), one for use when being called as as instance of the class, and one for use when being called through the interface.
