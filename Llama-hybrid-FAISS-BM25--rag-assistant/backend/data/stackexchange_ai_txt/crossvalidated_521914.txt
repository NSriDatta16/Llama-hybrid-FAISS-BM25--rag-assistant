The lag of a moving average is actually the X-axis coordinate of the centre of gravity of the weight function: (image by John Ehlers): In your tutorial, the "forecast value" is an arithmetic mean : or in in plain English: sum all observations, and divide the sum by the number of observations, resulting in a " Simple Moving Average " (SMA). Another way to come to the same result, is to multiply all observations by $1/n$ , and sum those products. In discrete time series analysis, you have a window that moves from the start (left) to the end (right) of your graph, step by step, so you look at the ( $n$ ) observations in the window, multiply them all with $1/n$ , sum them, and this gives you the result (the value of the moving average), after that, you move 1 step to the right, and you repeat the process for the next value of the moving average: engineers call this process " convolution ", and the $n$ times $1/n$ are the "coefficients", or "weights" you multiply the segment of your time series that falls in the window with (in the current step). Now, your "forecast value", is a Simple Moving Average. So the weight function will have a rectangular shape, and the (X-axis coordinate of the) centre of gravity is not $(m+1)/2$ , but it is $(n-1)/2$ , with n the window length. There are different types of moving averages, who use different shapes of these weight functions to try to reduce this lag: e.g. the weights of a Linear Weighted Moving Average will not have a rectangular, but a triangular shape: the centre of gravity's x-axis coordinate of a right triangle will be at $1/3$ rd its length, so this averaging technique will follow the original time series quicker if it turns. There even is a group of moving averages that try to cancel out the lag entirely, by using weights/coefficients that are negative at the back (left) of the window ( ZLEMA , HMA , ...). These are good attempts, but there is 1 thing you need to keep in mind: this theoretical lag is only correct on consistently rising/falling prices, and if you define $m$ , (or $n$ ) in terms of lag, there actually is very little difference between all these coefficients/weighting schemes. So to answer your question: "As an example, how does a window size of m in a moving average smoothing model, correspond to a lag of 3?" -> it depends: for a SMA (or EMA) it will be 7: ( $(n-1)/2$ ), for a LWMA it will be 10: ( $(n-1)/3$ ), ... It all depends on the shape of your coefficients / weight function, and its centre of gravity. And btw: a moving average as a forecast would require highly, highly persistent input data to be statistically significant. But that's another discussion entirely.. Good luck.
