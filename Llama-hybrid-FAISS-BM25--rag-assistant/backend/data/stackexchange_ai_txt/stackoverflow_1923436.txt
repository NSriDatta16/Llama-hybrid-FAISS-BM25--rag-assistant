It might be more than a problem of choosing a display character set. That string unfortunately has a lot of replacement characters (�), which indicates that it's already gone through a process where characters have been lost because the incoming encoding wasn't understood. Even the fragment "ï¿½" is probably the replacement character in utf8 viewed through a single-byte encoding. To check the quality of the information in the database, can you append the output of say select charset(colname), hex(left(colname, 20)) to the question?
