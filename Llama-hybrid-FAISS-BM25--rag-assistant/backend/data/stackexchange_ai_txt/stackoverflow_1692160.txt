Fastest file access/storage?

I have about 750,000,000 files I need to store on disk. What's more is I need to be able to access these files randomly--any given file at any time--in the shortest time possible . What do I need to do to make accessing these files fastest? Think of it like a hash table, only the hash keys are the filenames and the associated values are the files' data. A coworker said to organize them into directories like this: if I want to store a file named "foobar.txt" and it's stored on the D: drive, put the file in "D:\f\o\o\b\a\r.\t\x\t". He couldn't explain why this was a good idea though. Is there anything to this idea? Any ideas? The crux of this is finding a file. What's the fastest way to find a file by name to open? EDIT: I have no control over the file system upon which this data is stored. It's going to be NTFS or FAT32. Storing the file data in a database is not an option. Files are going to be very small--maximum of probably 1 kb. The drives are going to be solid state. Data access is virtually random, but I could probably figure out a priority for each file based on how often it is requested. Some files will be accessed much more than others. Items will constantly be added, and sometimes deleted. It would be impractical to consolidate multiple files into single files because there's no logical association between files. I would love to gather some metrics by running tests on this stuff, but that endeavour could become as consuming as the project itself! EDIT2: I want to upvote several thorough answers, whether they're spot-on or not, and cannot because of my newbie status. Sorry guys!
