For the build service I'm pretty sure you just change the account used by the build service. (In Manage Services right click on the Visual Studio Team Foundation Build service and then go to the Log On tab and edit the account) You'll need to make sure that the new account has permissions to the drop location used by the builds. Also the Build Agents's working directory.
