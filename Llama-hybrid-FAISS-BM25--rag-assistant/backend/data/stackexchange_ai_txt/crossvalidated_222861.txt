Not sure how this really helps but you can use the same trick to get something proportional to the mean, with known proportionality constant. E.g. say the log values are $1000$ and $1001$. Subtract the max to get the log of the scaled values: $-1, 0$. So, the scaled average is $(1 + e^{-1})/2$. Scaling up by the proportionality constant, the average is $e^{1001}(1 + e^{-1})/2$. Equivalently, the log of the mean is $1001 + \log(1 + e^{-1}) - \log(2)$
