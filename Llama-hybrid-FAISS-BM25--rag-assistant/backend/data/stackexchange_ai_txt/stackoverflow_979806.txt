Well, you didn't specify the OS so, for Linux I will suggest Wireless Tools for Linux by Jean Tourrilhes ( http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html ). The iwlist() command displays a lot of information about the available networks. The source code is in C. Another way is to write your own code in C using libpcap for capturing the beacon frames and extracting SSID from them (in monitor mode only). I haven't tested my sniffing code yet so I won't paste it here but it is pretty simple job.
