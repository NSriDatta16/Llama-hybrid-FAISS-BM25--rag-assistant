I finally devised the following solution. For my case it's useful enough, but it assumes that ClassA knows about it's derivatives and is limited to those two options. Not really high-level thinking, but it works. :) ClassA { public ClassA DoSomethingAndReturnNewObject() { if (this.GetType() == typeOf(ClassB)) { return new ClassB(values); } else { return new ClassC(values): } } } ClassB : ClassA {} ClassC : ClassA {}
