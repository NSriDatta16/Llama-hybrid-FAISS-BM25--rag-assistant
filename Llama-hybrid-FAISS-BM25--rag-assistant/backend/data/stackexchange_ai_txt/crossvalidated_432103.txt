So here's what I came up with.... $\lambda_z(t)= \lambda_0(t) \exp(\beta_1z_1 + \beta_{_2}z_{_2} + \beta_{_3}z_{_3} + \beta_{_4}z_{_1}z_{_2} + \beta_{_5}z_{_1}z_{_3} + \beta_{_6}z_{_1}z_{_4} + \beta_{_7}z_{_2}z_{_4})$ I believe that I've accounted for every single condition and interaction between covariates accounted for in the paragraph below. It is thought that the effect of treatment may be different for men and women. It is further thought that hazard increases with age, but that the effect of treatment does not vary with age. However, the treatment group is slightly older, on the average, than the control group. It is not thought that the hazard function varies with height, but the control group is slightly taller, on average, than the treatment group, and men are somewhat taller, on average, than women. I'm still unsure as to whether I've listed my interactions correctly but this is a start. Age ( $z_{_3}$ ) was believed to affect the hazard so its included with its own beta parameter and is also used as an interaction on $\beta_{_5}$ with treatment due to the treatment group being older than the control group. Height ( $z_{_4}$ ) was believed to not affect the hazard by itself so I've left it out but I included it in an interaction with treatment( $z_{_1}$ ) and sex ( $z_{_2}$ ) on $\beta_{_6} $ and $\beta_{_7}$ respectively...
