If the omnibus F-test for testing is not significant, is it still possible for the pairwise comparison for testing to be significant?

Continuous outcome data are collected for three independent groups of equal size (i.e., all group n’s are equal). A linear regression analysis is performed to model the group means. More specifically, indicator variables are created for each of the three groups, and two of the three indicator variables are included in a regression model. Alternatively, all three indicator variables could be included in a no- intercept model. Assume group 1 has the lowest observed mean and group 3 has the highest observed mean. Design and carry out a simulation experiment to answer A and B below: A) What value for the observed mean for group2 would result in the minimal value for the omnibus F-test for testing: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3? That is, would the F statistic be smallest if ... • the observed mean for group 2 is exactly equal to either the observed mean for group 1 or the observed mean for group 3? • the observed mean for group 2 is exactly equal to the average of the observed means for group 1 and group 3? or • the observed mean for group 2 is some other value (but remember it must lie between the observed means for group 1 and group 3)? B) What value for the observed mean for group2 would result in the maximal value for the omnibus F-test for testing: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3? C) If the omnibus F-test for testing: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 is not significant, is it still possible for the pairwise comparison for testing H0: μ1 = μ3 to be significant? Justify your answer mathematically (i.e. not with simulation). D) Justify your answer to (A) or (B) mathematically. I am most confused with the part C for the mathematical solution, and also for A and B, my simulation somehow give me the different answer compare with the theoretical form as below. theoretically seems like the mean of group 1 and 3 make the F statistic the smallest, but simulation show when group2 equal the group1 give the F statistics the smallest value. This problem have been bother me for quite a long time without finding the satisfied solutions, any help would be much appreciated! set.seed(1) res
