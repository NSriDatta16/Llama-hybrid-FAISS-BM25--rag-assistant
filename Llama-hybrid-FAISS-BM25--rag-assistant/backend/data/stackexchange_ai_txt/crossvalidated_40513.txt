Given that all your data is observational (necessarily so) and further given the complex nature of cause-effect in your data (which you show in your question) I would be very careful to avoid words like "cause" and "effect" in interpreting your results. You state Our variable of interest is a binary variable of whether there is a shortage of suitable brides as a result of sex-selective abortions. I don't see why this is binary. Surely the shortage of females can be mild, moderate, extreme ... and can be indexed by the male-female ratio in a given age range? Then this variable (male-female ratio at suitable age range) could be used as a dependent or independent variable in regressions, which would allow you to control for multiple independent variables at once. Yet another possibility (depending on how much data you have) might be time series analysis.
