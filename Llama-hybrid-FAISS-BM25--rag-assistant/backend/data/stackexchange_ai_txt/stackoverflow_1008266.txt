Changing the order of struct members when debugging in VS2008

I am trying to align some data in a c# struct that was created in c++. I know I'm a couple of bytes off, but I can't tell where becuase VS organizes the members in alphabetical order, rather than the order the occur in the struct (which is defined explicitly). Is it possible to change the order of the display of members in the debug dialog that shows the struct's values?
