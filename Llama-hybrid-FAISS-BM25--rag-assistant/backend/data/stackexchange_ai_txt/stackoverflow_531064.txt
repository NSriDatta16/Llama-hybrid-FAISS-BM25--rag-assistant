Todd's answer works fine, provided you have only one instance of the control and there's no other code that wants to "inject" anything in the tag for the master page. Unfortunately, you can rarely rely on this. I would suggest you include the all the css files you need in the master page. There will be a small perf hit on the first visit, but after that the browser caching will kick in. You can (and should) split your styles in multiple .css files to benefit from HTTP agents that can downoad them concurently. As for the .js files, I'd suggest to implement something close to the google.load() mechanism, that would allow you to load scripts on demand.
