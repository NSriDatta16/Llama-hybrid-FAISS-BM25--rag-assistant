If you have AllowOverwrite and mod_rewrite activated, then you can create a redirect from www.site.com/agentid to your format without messing with the core apache conf, by placing a rewrite rule in a .htaccess in your main web directory. I do not think there are any other solution without changing the apache configuration.
