Basically to solve this, one needs to: a) Prevent the default callout bubble from coming up. b) Figure out which annotation was clicked. I was able to achieve these by: a) setting canShowCallout to NO b) subclassing, MKPinAnnotationView and overriding the touchesBegan and touchesEnd methods. Note: You need to handle the touch events for the MKAnnotationView and not MKMapView
