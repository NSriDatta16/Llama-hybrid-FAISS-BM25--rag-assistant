Refer to my answer to your question about changing the action path of the subscribe.phtml file. If you override the newAction in subscriberController.php , you will be able to add in all your extra requirements, such as emailing the store admin, changing the information in the outgoing email, etc. There is a detailed walkthrough on the Magento wiki on how to configure Magento to use your custom controller instead of the core. This is best practice as it means that future patches/upgrades from Magento shouldn't break your customization.
