One of the problems with change scores is that, unless the measurement is very reliable, change will be correlated with error. So, for your example: You have some measure of loneliness. This measure will not be close to perfectly reliable (no psychological measures are). So, suppose John and Jill are measured at time 1 and time 2. Suppose they are equally lonely in the true sense (that is, if you could measure loneliness perfectly). But John had a lousy day the day before and Jill had a great one so John gets a higher loneliness score. At time 2, both had average days. Then John gets a good change score and Jill a bad one, despite no real change. Before the invention of multilevel models this led some psychologist-methodologists to suggest not measuring change at all (I could probably dig up a citation but a lot of my books are packed in boxes).
