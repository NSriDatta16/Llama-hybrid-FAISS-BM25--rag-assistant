I think we all know the temptation of seeing coded we think is "not the way I'd do it". But we resist it. I would have a chat about it with your boss first to get their take on it. But the first thing that springs to mind is that unless you specifically asked the contractor to do the work, he was not doing what he was hired to do, regardless of any benefit he thinks he may have been adding. So there needs to be a discussion about that. The next thing that sprung to mind is that regardless of how good they may be or well intentioned, people who make bulk changes without discussing it with the owners of the code are bad news. They will piss people off, or worse introduce bugs and unforeseen behavior that you will have to clean up. He needs to be set straight that doing this sort of thing without permission on other peoples code is not acceptable. When I see things I don't like in others code which are serious enough to warrant attention, I check with the owners of the code first. Even if there are obvious bugs, it s their code and their decision about cleaning it up, not mine.
