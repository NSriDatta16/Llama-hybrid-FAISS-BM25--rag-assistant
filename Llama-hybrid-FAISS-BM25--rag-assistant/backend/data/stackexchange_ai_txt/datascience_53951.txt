Some thoughts: Your data is highly imbalanced. This is a critical issue which should be dealt with. Possible solutions include simple under-/over-sampling to more complicated synthetic approaches like SMOTE. Decision trees and random forests do not require feature scaling - this means that normalisation is not needed (unless perhaps you plan on using some other modelling technique which uses regularisation). Just because this data set only shows a particular relationship between values of V1 and target does not mean it is always the case - especially if your model is to be deployed for a period of time. The relationship may change over time so do not rush to artificially curtail your model.
