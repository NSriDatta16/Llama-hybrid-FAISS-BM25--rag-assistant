Why does the theoretical value of the difference between these 2 stochastic integrals differ from the observed value in r?

Consider the stochastic integral $$ 2 \int_0^1 W_t \hspace{2mm} dW_t $$ Using r, this may be evaluated using one of the following summations $$ S_1 = 2 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left[ W_\frac{j}{n} \left( W_\frac{j+1}{n} - W_\frac{j}{n} \right) \right] \\ S_2 = 2 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left[ W_\frac{j+1}{n} \left( W_\frac{j+1}{n} - W_\frac{j}{n} \right) \right] \\ $$ where $S_1$ evaluates the integral from the lhs of each interval and $S_2$ evaluates the integral from the rhs of each interval. My question is: how would you expect the value of $S_1 - S_2$ to change as $n \rightarrow \infty$? Intuitively, I would expect $(S_1 - S_2) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, since $S_1$ and $S_2$ would get closer and closer to the true value of the integral as more intervals were considered. However, I have a program in r which: Generates a vector of $n$ values representing a standard Brownian motion Based on this vector, evaluates the summations $S_1$ and $S_2$. Using this program, I have tested the value of $S_1 - S_2$ for $n = 1, \dots 5000$. Based on the results of these tests, the value of $S_1 - S_2$ seems to be tending to $-1$ (from above). Can anyone see why this might be? Edit: Upon further thought, perhaps the reason why $S_1 - S_2$ might tend to a non-zero value is because, if we take $$ W_\frac{j}{n} - W_\frac{j-1}{n} = W_\frac{j+1}{n} - W_\frac{j}{n} $$ (which should be true 'on average', since both sides of the above have the same distribution) then $$ S_1 - S_2 = 2 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left[ W_\frac{j}{n} \left( W_\frac{j+1}{n} - W_\frac{j}{n} \right) \right] - 2 \sum_{j=1}^{n} \left[ W_\frac{j}{n} \left( W_\frac{j+1}{n} - W_\frac{j}{n} \right) \right] = 2W_0 - 2W_1 = -2W_1 $$ and the expected value of $W_1$ is 1. However, this is still not equal to $-1$. Furthermore, if this is the case then I cannot understand why my initial analysis, that $S_1 - S_2 \rightarrow 0$ would be incorrect?
