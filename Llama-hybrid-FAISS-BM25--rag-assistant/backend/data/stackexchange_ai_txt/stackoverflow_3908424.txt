After doing HttpWebRequests for a while the result starts timing out

I have an application that spiders websites for information. It seems like after 20-45 minutes of creating HttpWebRequests a bunch of them return timeouts. One thing we do is attach a BindIPDelegate anonymous function to give the request a specific IP since we round-robin through about 150 IPs. I'm setting up the HttpWebRequest object with the following settings.. Setting User-Agent Setting Keep-Alive to false so that the IP isn't re-used Setting TimeOut to 60000 (60 seconds) Setting ReadWriteTimeout to 60000 (60 seconds) Setting Proxy to null Setting Accept to / Setting CookieContainer to new CookieContainer Setting Piplined to true Setting Automatic Decompression to Deflate & GZIP The application is using .NET 4.0 and running on Windows Server 2008 R2. This definitely seems like something application/TCP/.NET related because if I restart the application it runs fine again. Also it appears more or less like the ones timing out are just queued up waiting on a local port or something. Any ideas?
