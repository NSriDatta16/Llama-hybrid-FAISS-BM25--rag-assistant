This isn't really about specific fixed populations, it's about models for the data-generating process. The model we have is that there are $X$ s. For each possible value $x$ there are infinitely many possible $y$ values, forming a probability distribution. We only observe a few values $x_i$ and only one $y_i$ for each $x_i$ . One possible model is that the mean of $Y$ for each value of $X$ is described by a straight line: $$E[Y|X=x]=\beta_0+\beta_1x.$$ Given this model it makes sense to talk about the true line, which is the one with intercept $\beta_0$ and slope $\beta_1$ . The true line goes through $(x, E[Y|X=x])$ for every $x$ . The model also gives enough mathematical structure to talk about how the least-squares estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ relate to the true $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ . It also lets us talk about values of $x$ where we haven't observed any $Y$ . Even if you have data from a large (finite) population and the model is true, the averages of $y$ for each distinct value of $x$ will typically not trace out the line. You typically won't have enough observations with a specific value of $x$ to guarantee that the average of their $y$ s is close to $E[Y|X=x]$ . To say the population line "joins the mean of the dependent variables" really requires a probability model for a potentially infinite collection of observations. As a separate issue, because it came up in comments: this model might not be true , even approximately. In general, the curve traced out by $E[Y|X=x]$ is not a straight line, and it need not be close to a straight line. If it isn't, you need an expanded model, one that allows for varying shapes of the curve. In that setting, if you wanted to be careful about inference, you could either try to estimate $E[Y|X=x]$ , by estimating the whole shape of the curve decide you wanted the best-fitting straight line $\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_1 x$ , and then consider what the properties of this line would be if the truth is not a straight line.
