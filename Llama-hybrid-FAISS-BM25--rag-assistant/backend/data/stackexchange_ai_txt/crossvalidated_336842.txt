Modeling as AR or MA according to these results and checking stationarity

I need to classify a process into AR or MA, because this determines if I can use some expressions in a future chemical analysis. To this end I sampled the variable of interest and used statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.ARIMA with differents p, d, q values for fitting ARIMA(p,d,q) models, and extracted the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value. p d q AIC 0, 0, 1, 345368 0, 0, 2, 289863 0, 1, 1, 190172 0, 1, 2, 189956 0, 2, 1, 196621 1, 0, 0, 192536 1, 0, 1, 187833 1, 0, 2, 187777 1, 1, 0, 190929 1, 1, 1, 189890 1, 1, 2, 187842 1, 2, 0, 256829 2, 0, 0, 188227 2, 0, 1, 187772 2, 0, 2, 187767 2, 1, 0, 190215 2, 1, 1, 188234 2, 1, 2, 187840 2, 2, 0, 236290 I have zero experience or formation on this subject. My intuition suggest me that: The process fits well into AR(1) classification. The coefficient is very close to 1.0 and because of this (0, 1, 0) also works fine. The process is not of MA, and (0, 1, 1) do not indicate non-stationarity of the series. I wish to know if my reasoning is correct or incorrect. If it is incorrect, why and which kind of model is it? If nothing can be concluded from this data, what can I do for classifying the process? Additional information : The times series correspond to the mean direction of particles at different times. The sample vector has 125000 elements. I won't do forecasting. The parameters (constant/coefficient) for (1,0,0) are (-0.0008, 0.9364). For (1,0,1): (-0.0009, 0.9616, -0.2136). EDIT: If it is important, the normalized autocorrelation function of the series behaves like $e^{-|a|t}$ EDIT 2: I uploaded the data. As original time series is extremely large, for storage issues, I uploaded just a fraction of it. However, it should be much more larger than needed for all purposes. http://m.uploadedit.com/bbtc/1522088203837.txt Plot of variable vs time. Plot of the autocorrelation function
