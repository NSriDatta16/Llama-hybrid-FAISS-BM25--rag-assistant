Can I use multiple groups of dummy variables? How do I interpret results for missing groups?

Say I want to do a logistic regression on whether it snows on a given month of the year and day of the week. I'd have 12 months and 7 days. My understanding is that this would translate into 17 dummies (11 for months and 6 for days). First off is this correct? Second, how would I interpret regression results (i.e. assuming I dropped January, what's the p-value for January)?
