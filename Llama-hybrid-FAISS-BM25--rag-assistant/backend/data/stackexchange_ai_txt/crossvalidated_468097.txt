The typical approach is to train on all the data (other than test) using the best found hyper-parameters. For example, in cross-validation, you don't have a single training/validation pair, so you'd naturally do the final training on all the training and validation data. On the other hand, sometimes, (like in neural networks) you need a separate validation set to decide where to stop (i.e. epoch number). It's not common to choose the epoch number using validation set and retrain with all the data.
