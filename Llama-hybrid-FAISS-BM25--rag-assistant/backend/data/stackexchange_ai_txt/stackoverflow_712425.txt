What operating system? Do you want to remove files in the current directory also? Under cmd.exe in Windows, for files, you can run del /s /q * or to remove just folders and their contents, for /d %d in (*.*) do rmdir /s /q %d Under most Linux/UNIX shells, to delete files and folders , you can run rm -rf * or as pointed out below by derobert (and tidied up a little), you can do just folders and their contents with find . -maxdepth 1 -not -name '.' -type d -exec rm -rf \{\} \; This will find all the directories in the current directory (maxdepth 1) excluding the current directory '.', and run rm -rf on each of them.
