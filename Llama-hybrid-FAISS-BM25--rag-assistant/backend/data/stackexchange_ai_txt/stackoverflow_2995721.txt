Magento: server requirements for a quite big shop to run smoothly

I'm working on a quite big magento: it will have 50 different shops (1 magento install, 1 admin to rule them all) for start, this number is expected to raise in the future, and a catalog of more than 1k products. This catalog will be shared by all shops. I'm concerned about the server requirements I need for this to run smoothly. So far this is what I've found to get the most of it: Caching: using magento's cache with APC, MySQL's querys use FastCGI instead of mod_php database clustering: I don't think it will be necesary for 1k products, what do you think? using Zend Server Are there other thing I can do in order to improve magento's performance? I'd like to know all I need from the beginning so I can find the right server. thanks in advance.
