Should one still be concerned about multi-collinearity? Why? If the non-linear model is tree-based model, then you shouldn't consider it serious. Different tree model will have different deal method, such as the random forest will keep them both (because they build the tree independently, and random select the feature for every trees), but it have no effect about the prediction performance, even you remove the redundant one. But for xgboost, it will choose anyone of them, and use it until the last tree build. If the answer to the above is true, how should one fight it considering that one is using these types of non-linear models? It just about the interpretation meaning, so remove the highly correlation variable is suggested.
