All fine answers, but here is a simple one, as suggested by @MrMeritology, which appears to work well for the time series in question, and likely for many other "similar" data sets. Here is an R-snippet producing the self-explanatory graphs below. outl = rep( NA, length(dat.change)) detr = c( 0, diff( dat.change)) ix = abs(detr) > 2*IQR( detr) outl[ix] = dat.change[ix] plot( dat.change, t='l', lwd=2, main="dat.change TS") points( outl, col=2, pch=18) plot( detr, col=4, main="detrended TS", t='l', lwd=2 ) acf( detr, main="ACF of detrended TS")
