It seems that git diff do only a 2-way diff (which make sense to generate patch etc) except in a merging state , you have to do a merge for that. I was in a similar situation the other day and I ended up mergin using the ours strategy. That worked but wasn't ideal. Maybe we need a 'nonresolve' merging strategy which doesn't try to resolve any conflicts. You might be able to emulate that by tweaking the .git/MERGE_* files and set all the files as conflicted. Otherwise the obvious solution is to checkout 3 different directory and run kdiff3 , but I guess you are looking for a more elegant solution
