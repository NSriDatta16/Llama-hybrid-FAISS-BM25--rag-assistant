Do all Flash swf files have inbuilt methods for interfacing with Javascript?

I don't work with Flash and consequently know nothing of it, but I have the task of embedding a swf film into a web page. I know nothing about the swf's internal design, other than it plays a short film. I'd like to control when the swf starts playing, rewind it (it will be played infinitely), and possibly even cache it in the browser. It will be part of a Javascript-powered rotation of images, in which the element will be temporarily replaced with an for the swf. My question is do swf files have an interface for Javascript built-in when compiled (Actionscript I think?), or would this entirely depend on the author's decision to include such code? If it is dependent on the author's inclusion of the code, are there any possible tests I can run to see what methods might be available?
