How does NSTextView's automaticLinkDetectionEnabled method work?

I'm setting up an NSTextView programmatically: NSTextView *infoTextView = [[NSTextView alloc] initWithFrame:insetRect]; [infoTextView setAutoresizingMask:NSViewWidthSizable|NSViewHeightSizable]; [infoTextView setBackgroundColor:[NSColor clearColor]]; [infoTextView setTextContainerInset:NSZeroSize]; [infoTextView setEditable:YES]; [infoTextView setSelectable:YES]; [infoTextView setAutomaticLinkDetectionEnabled:YES]; I'm targeting 10.6, and thought that automaticLinkDetectionEnabled meant that when the user typed a string that was a website address, NSTextView would format it blue color, underlined, and make it a clickable link. that doesn't happen. its just read as plain text. i have no formatting on the textView's textStorage. the doc reads: 'Automatic link detection causes strings representing URLs typed in the view to be automatically made into links to those URLs.' what else do i need to do?
