There is a good answer to this exact question on Yahoo! Answers: I suspect the point here is to learn to write assembly language. Here's the instruction set ( http://www.emu8086.com/assembler_tutorial/8086_instruction_set.html ) You have all the instructions you need to perform the equation you need to generate pseudo-random numbers except the 'mod' instruction, which you'll have to write a subroutine for. Pay particular attention to the limitations on the MUL and DIV instructions. "store in a separate file" isn't implicit in the instruction set. You'll have to better understand what's wanted here. "File" and "Print" are concepts related to operating system; they're forms of output in this case. from http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081030112909AAmjEsp
