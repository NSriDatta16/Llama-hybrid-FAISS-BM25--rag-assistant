If you only need the keys, and no associated value, Python offers sets: s = set(a_list) for k in sorted(s): print k However, you'll be sorting the set each time you do this. If that is too much overhead you may want to look at HeapQueues . They may not be as elegant and "Pythonic" but maybe they suit your needs.
