It looks like compound interest where you're generously rounding up. The 100 case + 1 is pretty boring. But the 105 case + 1 is interesting. T[0] = FC[105] => 31.5 T[1] = FC[136.5] => ? Where does 136.5 hit -- 135 or 140? At 140, you've made an extra $1.05. Or... If the rates were ever not calculable, that would be one reason for this implementation. Or... The other reason (and one I would do if annoyed enough) would be that these rates were constantly changing, the developer got fed up with it, and he gave them an interface where the end users could set them on their own. The $5 buckets seem outrageous but maybe they were real jerks...
