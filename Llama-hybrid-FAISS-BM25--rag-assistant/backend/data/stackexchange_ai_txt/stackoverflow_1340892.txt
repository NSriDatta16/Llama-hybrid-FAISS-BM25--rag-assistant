Should Python unittests be in a separate module?

Is there a consensus about the best place to put Python unittests? Should the unittests be included within the same module as the functionality being tested (executed when the module is run on its own ( if __name__ == '__main__' , etc.)), or is it better to include the unittests within different modules? Perhaps a combination of both approaches is best, including module level tests within each module and adding higher level tests which test functionality included in more than one module as separate modules (perhaps in a /test subdirectory?). I assume that test discovery is more straightforward if the tests are included in separate modules, but there's an additional burden on the developer if he/she has to remember to update the additional test module if the module under test is modified. I'd be interested to know peoples' thoughts on the best way of organizing unittests.
