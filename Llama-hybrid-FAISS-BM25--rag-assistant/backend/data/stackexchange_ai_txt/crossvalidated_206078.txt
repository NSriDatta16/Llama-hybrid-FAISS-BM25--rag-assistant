You're discarding information by taking continuous predictions and making them into categories. I would strongly advise against taking that path. Instead, you could (1) average or (2) stack the models. Averaging is straightfoward and requires no additional tuning; on the other hand, all models are weighted equally which might be suboptimal. Stacking adds another layer of learning to train the model on the model outputs against unseen data outcomes.
