Do I model my training set on real world classification percentages?

NOTE: This is just a toy project - I'm trying to learn by doing. I am aware of the previous work in this area. This question is about how to correctly populate my training, validation and test sets in this specific example. My goal is to use a CNN to classify images into 3 distinct categories: normal blurry highly sharpened I've built the CNN (using Keras) and it is working. There will be many more normal images than blurry images. And there will be more blurry images than highly sharpened images. Let's assume that 85% of the images will be normal , 10% will be blurry and 5% will be highly sharpened . Does that mean my training/validation/test set should also contain this same percentage breakdown of examples? I don't think it makes sense to just fill each set with ~33% of each class. Also: this must be incredibly common... is there a Keras/Tensorflow api for this type of partitioning?
