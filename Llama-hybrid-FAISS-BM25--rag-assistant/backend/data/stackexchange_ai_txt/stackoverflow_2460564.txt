Runtime C function details

Is there any way to find particular C language function's input and output parameters from a framework (apple's ARM) during the runtime or from any method with out knowing the headers. It is a framework and there are no header files for it.I decompile it with IDA Pro and it gives me the function names but not input and output parameters information. I am able to load those private functions using dlsym. Is it possible to find the parameters info in runtime (C language or Objective C) or from IDA Pro ? Regards, Raghu
