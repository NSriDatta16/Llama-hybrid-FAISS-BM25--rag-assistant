What is your P matrix? (I suppose it's a world->camera view transform). vNormal = normal4*modelRotationMatrix; Why did you change the order of arguments? Doing that you are multiplying the normal by inversed rotation, what you don't really want. Use the standard order instead (modelRotationMatrix * normal4) vViewVec = tempCameraPos - pos . This is entirely incorrect. pos is your vertex in the homogeneous clip-space, while tempCameraPos is in world space (I suppose). You need to have the result in the same space as your normal is (world space), so use world-space vertex position ( modelTranslationMatrix * modelRotationMatrix * modelScaleMatrix * gl_Vertex ) for this equation.
