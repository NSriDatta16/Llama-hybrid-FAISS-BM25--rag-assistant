Silverlight Isolated Storage and loading big files

In a Windows Phone 7 application, I would like to query a big XML file (list of cities) stored using Isolated Storage . If I do that this way, will the file be loaded to memory (> 5 mo) ? If so, what other solution do I have? Edit: More details. I want to use AutoCompleteBox (http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/10/introducing-autocompletebox/), but instead of using a web service (this is fixed data, no need to be online), I want to query a file/database/isolated storage... I have a fixed list of cities. I said in the comments it's 40k, but it finally seems closer to 1k rows.
