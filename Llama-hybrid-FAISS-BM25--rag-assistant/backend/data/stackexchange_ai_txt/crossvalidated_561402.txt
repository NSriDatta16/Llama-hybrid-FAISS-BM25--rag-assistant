How can I confidently state the error of a specific test is within a range with a 95% confidence interval

I have a test that provides values with known amounts of error. For instance the error on the test (Value - TrueValue) = -7.62, -9.33, -8.36, -9.79,-10.45, -9.51, -10.83, -10.64, -9.96, -10.30 I want to try to linearly adjust the value to reflect the true value by correcting for the average error. In this case, the average error is -9.679, so adjusting for this the new errors are: 2.059, 0.349, 1.319, -0.111, -0.771, 0.169, -1.151, -0.961, -0.281, -0.621 How can I state with confidence that given any new test, adjusted by the error, its true value is within X given 95% confidence? What sort of test would I want to use? Can anyone provide a resource to read about this topic? Thank you
