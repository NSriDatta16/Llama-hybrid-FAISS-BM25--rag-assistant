Multicollinearity in Auto Regressive models

I have just started learning about time series analysis. I had a doubt regarding AR models. I understand that in Auto Regression, we regress one variable on values of the same variable at different past time points. And I know that ,in linear regression the independent variables must be independent of each other. But wouldn't the values of the same variable in a AR model be dependent on each other and cause multicollinearity? And if there is multicollinearity how do we deal with it? Please explain if I am correct in my understanding or am missing something. Thanks in advance...
