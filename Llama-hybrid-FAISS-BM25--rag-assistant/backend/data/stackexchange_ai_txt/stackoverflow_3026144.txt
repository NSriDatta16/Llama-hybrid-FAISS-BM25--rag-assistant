jquery-ui drag and drop - how to dropped items?

I'm trying to use jquery-ui. I am using one of the drag and drop examples which is pretty much exactly what I need, except instead of moving items between the two lists, I'd like the items to be cloned: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists $(function() { $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable' }).disableSelection(); }); Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 so moving an item from the first list to the second list results in list 1 have 2 items, and list 2 having 4 items. I just want it to make clones of the items on the drop. So in the above example, list 1 would still have 3 items, but list 2 would have 4 items, Thank you
