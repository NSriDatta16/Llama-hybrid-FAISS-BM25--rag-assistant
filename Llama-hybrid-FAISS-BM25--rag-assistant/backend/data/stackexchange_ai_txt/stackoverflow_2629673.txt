Since you mentioned TestPartner which is a commercial tool. QTP and TestPartner have a comparable pricing level. So you should consider other important factors: integrity of the tool, learning curve, level and quality of commercial support, level of community support. You may also want to look at TestComplete, which is also very powerful, and incorporates support for Load Testing, and Unit Testing, but has significantly lower price. Generally, I would say, automation success is much more dependant on automation skills of a person rather than on capacities of a specific tool.
