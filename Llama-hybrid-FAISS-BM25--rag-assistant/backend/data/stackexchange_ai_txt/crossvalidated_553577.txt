How many predictors can I include in my logistic regression model

If I am dealing with a small sample size (n = 48; n = 29 have disease vs n = 19 without disease), what are the maximum numbers of the predictors I can include in my multivariable logistic regression model (I am building a predictive model)? There are so many rules online and I am not sure which one I should use. Any help is much appreciated!
