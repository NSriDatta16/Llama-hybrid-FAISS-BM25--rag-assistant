Cobertura will instrument your code fine. It will dump out .ser files that can be merged together. The only part I have not tried is taking a snapshot every day. My two ideas are to try to either a) What happens if you copy the .ser file off, and delete the old .ser file. Will it crash, or will it create a new .ser file? If it creates a new file, this would work. b) Would it be possible to shutdown your app for 1 minute per day, to copy and delete the .ser file? In either case, once you have a bunch of .ser files, it is real easy to merge them toegether and create a html report.
