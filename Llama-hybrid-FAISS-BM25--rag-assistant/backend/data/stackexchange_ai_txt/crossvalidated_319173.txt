Variance of weighted average when weights have a distribution

Given two random variables $S$ and $W$, I'm trying to determine the variance of the weighted average $$Z = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n s_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$$ (With the same $w_i$ in denominator as in the numerator) It seems $E[Z] = E[S]$, but what would be an estimate of the variance? If the denominator term wasn't there could simply use the Variance of a Product [ link ]
