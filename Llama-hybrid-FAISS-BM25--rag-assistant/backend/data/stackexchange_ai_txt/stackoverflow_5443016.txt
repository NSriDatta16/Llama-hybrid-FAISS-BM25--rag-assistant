Rails CMS: static files or database records?

I'm trying to figure out the cut-off with respect to when a "text entry" should be stored in the database vs. as a static file. Are there any rules of thumb here? The text entries will be at the most several paragraphs and have links to images and tables (and hyperlinks to other text entries). Some criteria for the text entry: I'm thinking of using DITA as the content format The text should be searchable If the text is revised, a new version will be created thanks in advance, Chuck
