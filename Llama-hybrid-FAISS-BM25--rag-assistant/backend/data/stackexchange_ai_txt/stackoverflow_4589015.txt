This is my workaround . My guess, without looking at and understanding how jQuery's internal drop and drag stuff works, is that there's some elapsed time before everything in the drag & drop has finished processing. So I figured that the swap should not be initiated until everything is done. Because I don't know when this happens, I had the swap occur after some delay. I used setTimeout in the drop event. I had to use at least 600ms to be sure 'everything was clear and safe'. Less than 600ms, the 'top' & 'left' still had some values which meant the process wasn't done yet. The longer the delay, the smaller those values are; until anything bigger had top and left equal zeros. By trial and error 600ms seems to do it. If anyone has a 'cleaner' solution I would appreciate it. Plus a 'scientific' explanation is helpful.
