SQL Server 2008 - Storing Files

I am building a MVC3 web app against a SQL Server 2008 database. The web app will allow users to upload photos and documents. Currently the files are stored in a column of type "image". Is this an okay thing to do, or is it an outdated approach? Is there any advantages in moving storage to another data type or start using FILESTREAM? Stats - 500 (users) x 7 (avg documents each) x 2MB (avg doc size) EDIT 1 Can anyone comment; is what I'm doing currently--storing as "image" data type--bad?
