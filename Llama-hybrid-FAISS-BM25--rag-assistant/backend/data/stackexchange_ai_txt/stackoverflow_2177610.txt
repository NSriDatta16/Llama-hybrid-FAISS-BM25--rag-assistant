Correct text input width for cloze

I've got a JS-generated fill-in-the-gap text/ cloze and I'm having trouble adjusting the text boxes to the right size. But unlike others I'm in the position of knowing exactly what the user will/should enter. So, if I have a gap _______________ like this, I want the input to be exactly 4 characters wide. However, maybe since I'm using a proportional font (and that won't change), the width is always too large (even for a succession of capital Ds which are pretty wide). So, what do you suggest? I tried setting the width with size, CSS width in em (too big) and ex (too narrow even for xxes). I could calculate the width of the actual word (the one that needs to be filled in) a hidden span element, but that seems inelegant. Is there a way to make the browser have a more accurate guess at the width of the input when I'm using a proportional font?
