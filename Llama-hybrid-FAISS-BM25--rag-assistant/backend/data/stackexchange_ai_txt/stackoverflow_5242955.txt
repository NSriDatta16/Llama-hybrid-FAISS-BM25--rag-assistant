Now the Web server sends HTML not XHTML to all browsers. The Web framework I use is Lift-Web and I had to add this line to Lift-Web's Boot.scala: LiftRules.htmlProperties.default.set( (r: Req) => new Html5Properties(r.userAgent)) as described here: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/HtmlProperties_XHTML_and_HTML5 (And here are some more things I think you also need to do: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Setting_the_DocType ) The server now says Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 instead of application/xml . So now the document renders as HTML5.
