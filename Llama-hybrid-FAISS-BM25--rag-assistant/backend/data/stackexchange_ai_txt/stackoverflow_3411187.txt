One thing you may be able to do is have the user confirm their password, and use it for the login function. I may be completely mis-reading what you're trying to accomplish, but if you have the user Confirm their password w/ a password 2 field, you can compare the two, and also use the starting state of the confirmation password for whatever it is that you're wanting to do. So: echo $form->input('password', array('label' => 'password')); echo $form->input('password2', array('label' => 'Confirm Password')); Inside of your logic for whatever you're wanting to accomplish, you can just put: $morePermanentDataStorage = $this->data['User']['password2']; if($this->data['User']['password'] == $this->Auth->password($this->data['User']['password2']) { //function logic here } I am also assuming that your form logic from above actually starts with: echo $form->create('User');
