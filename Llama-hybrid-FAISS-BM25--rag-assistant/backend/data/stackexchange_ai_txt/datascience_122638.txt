Seeking guidance regarding course selection

I have completed Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization a week ago and now exploring different competitions (Titanic, House Price Prediction, and from the Playground Series). I want to learn more about deep learning and different neural network architectures. So should I proceed with the Deep Learning Specialization by Prof.Ng or go with Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate by Prof. Moroney
