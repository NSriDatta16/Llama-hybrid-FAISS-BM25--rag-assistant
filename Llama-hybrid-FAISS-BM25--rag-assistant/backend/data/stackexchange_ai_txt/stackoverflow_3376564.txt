I am trying to evaluate javaee6 and ejb3.1 and jpa2.0 with maven as a build tool; so trying to find the maven artifacts for it. Please suggest Any opensource javaee6 embedded container full implementation. There is obviously GlassFish and the Embedded GlassFish . Here is the relevant artifact: download.java.net Java.net Maven Repository http://download.java.net/maven/2 ... org.glassfish.extras glassfish-embedded-all 3.0 compile ... Actually, providing an embeddable container API is part of the Java EE 6 specification (Chapter 22 of the EJB 3.1 spec). See EJBContainer .
