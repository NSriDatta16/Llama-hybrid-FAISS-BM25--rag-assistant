Markov property of manifest variables in longitudinal ESM

I am working on a longitudinal ESM model were the indicators are (highly) autocorrelated. This means that the classic cross-lagged models of panel data analysis cannot be used directly. I have explained the main problem here (although my proposed approach to model the sequence was very inefficient.) And I am going to discuss a one-level model (capturing the within-person variability of one individual) here to avoid further complications. I have seen several papers and tutorials on dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) like (Hamaker et al. 2018) and (Asparouhovet al. 2018) and Mplus' learning material on DSEM ( here ). However, mostly in order to implement it in R (using lavaan) and to avoid limitations of their approaches, I decided to assume Markov property of lag one ( $MP(1)$ ) which allows significant simplification (while there is suggestive evidence supporting it for the type of data I'm analyzing). To illustrate my model, suppose that at each time point $t$ , I have a vector of manifest variables $Y_{t_{n \times 1}} = [y^1_{t}, y^2_{t},..., y^n_{t}]^T$ and a vector of latent variables $\Theta_{t_{m \times 1}} = [\theta^1_{t}, \theta^2_{t}, ..., \theta^m_{t}]^T$ , which are related by a loading matrix $\Lambda_{t_{n \times m}}$ such that $Y_t = \Lambda_t \Theta_t + \Delta_t$ Where $\Delta_{t_{n \times 1}} = [\delta^1_{t}, \delta^2_{t}, ..., \delta^n_{t}]^T$ is the vector of measurement errors of items. I assume that my model has $MP(1)$ at the factor level, meaning that $P(\Theta_{t}|\Theta_{t-1}, \Theta_{t-2},..., \Theta_{1}) = P(\Theta_{t}|\Theta_{t-1})$ . However, the manifest variables (at the item level) are (highly) autocorrelated, meaning that I cannot basically assume error independence, so in general $corr(\delta^i_{t}, \delta^j_{t}) \neq 0$ . As a result, I have to take the autocorrelation of errors into account. My solution was to make a new time series of consecutive observations $\Upsilon_{2n \times 1} = [Y_{t-1},Y_{t}]^T$ , and as a result, I will have a new vector of factors $\Omega_{2m \times 1} = [\Theta_{t-1}, \Theta_{t}]^T$ . I further assume measurement invariance accross time (i.e., $\Lambda_t = \Lambda$ ). Hence, I will have a new loading matrix $\Pi_{2n \times 2m} = \begin{bmatrix} \Lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \Lambda \end{bmatrix}$ . However, this formulation relies on the $MP(1)$ assumption, both at the factor level and at the item level. In other words, I have generalized the $MP(1)$ assumption from factor level to the item level, which might not be true. So, my question is, am I actually allowed to assume $MP(1)$ at the item level given that $MP(1)$ is the case at the factor level? How do I justify this choice and/or derive the independence of $Y_{t-2}$ and $Y_{t}$ implied by this assumption analytically?
