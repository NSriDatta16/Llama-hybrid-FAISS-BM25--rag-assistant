There are some different methods you can use to measure your model's accuracy. As @BeamsAdept mentioned in his own answer you can use the ROC AUC metric. Alternatively you mind find the Odds Ratio useful and if your dataset is big enough I would highly encourage you look into something like K-fold cross validation in order to get more representative results. I would also be cautious when the training accuracy is significantly higher than your testing accuracy which is the result of overfitting. Perhaps finding the P-values of your features would help you filter out potentially useless information and as a result improve your accuracy in new observations. Hope this helps!
