True parameter in relation to credible interval

I know that in the frequentist approach, the confidence interval contains the true parameter $\theta$ with some minimum probability (e.g. 95%); while in the bayesian approach, the credible interval includes 95% of the posterior distribution. My question is, how would we relate the credible interval (with left and right bounds L and R) to the true parameter? In other words, how would we find $P(L(X) \leq \theta \leq R(X)$ ? To put my question in another way: given a set of data, we can derive some posterior distribution (and thus credible interval), but that doesn't guarantee the true parameter is captured by this credible interval. How would I find the probability that the true parameter lies within the credible interval?
