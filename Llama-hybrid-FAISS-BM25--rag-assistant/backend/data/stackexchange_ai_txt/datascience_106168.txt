Analysis of probability distribution of each features and Machine Learning

While I know that probability distributions are for hypothesis testing, confidence level constructions, etc. They definitely have many roles in statistical analysis. However, it is not obvious to me now how probability distributions come in handy for machine learning problems? In ML algorithms, they are expected to automatically pick up distributions from dataset. I wonder if there are any places of probability distributions in better solving ML problem? Shortly put, how could statistical techniques related to probability distributions can benefit the solving of ML problems? If yes, in what ways explicitly?
