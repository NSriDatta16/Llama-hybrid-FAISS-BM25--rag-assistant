If you are keeping the stored procedures and not doing it writing LINQ to SQL queries, you can just drag the stored procedures onto your dbml file and it will create the classes for you. You can do it two ways if I remember correctly. 1) You can have the return result map to a view. 2) You can have it autogenerate a class for you. If you stored procedure is something like GetCustomers then it would create a class named something like GetCustomersResult or something like that. If you have a view named uvCustomers then you could tell it to use that view instead of having a different class for every stored procedure that returns the same columns.
