I have attempted this but, I find it very difficult to do because, generally there are typically many things which I have not considered until I am forced to write out the algorithm in a strict language. English is just such a good language to lie to yourself in. I actually found it harmful because I spent time on non-problems, and neglected the real problems that I didn't see until I attempted to write the computer code. In fact, I've written computer code to help organize my thoughts for things I am writing in English. I have found that drawing pictures and/or taking a geometric approach can be very helpful.
