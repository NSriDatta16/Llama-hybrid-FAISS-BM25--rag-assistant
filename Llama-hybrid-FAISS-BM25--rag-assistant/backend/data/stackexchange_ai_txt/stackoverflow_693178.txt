The best way is to upload the files to teamcity. Choose step1 (General Settings) and enter artifacts path. It should be something like /SourceOfProject/bin/releaese/*.dll. I zip files before I upload them, because you only want to download 1 file that contains the complete build. My build always has 2 steps in a nant - file. Step1 - call msbuild Step2 - use 7zip to create zip Build Script Anyway my working path is: C:\Programme\TeamCity\buildAgent\work
