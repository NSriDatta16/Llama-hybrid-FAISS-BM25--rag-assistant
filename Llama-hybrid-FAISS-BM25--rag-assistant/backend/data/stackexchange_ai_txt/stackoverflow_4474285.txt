compare email domain to website domain

Is it possible to register an email domain identical with the domain of a website you don't own? For instance myname@cnn.com. I'm creating an app which compares your email to a domain name so I'm trying to determine if there are any loopholes in terms of verifying if you own a site based on your email.
