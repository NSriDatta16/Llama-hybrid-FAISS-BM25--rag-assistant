Your first two issues are not real problems (Finglas describes why so). I would consider "All registered data types have a default constructor" as a code smell (assuming the class is loading dependencies directly from your IoC container). When this happens its either 1) an application entry point where it is appropriate to get the object from your Ioc container (as you probably need to initialize that Ioc container anyhow), or 2) a place you could be using a factory instead. Having a default constructor fill in dependencies is discouraged. The reason being you're duplicating the knowledge of how to create the class. Ideally each class should not even have to know where your IoC container is - thats the job of your application entry point. It sounds like the IoC usage at your company is not bad overall.
