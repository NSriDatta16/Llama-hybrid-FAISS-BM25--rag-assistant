Quantification is difficult when you don't have anything to measure/compare against. If your dev-box takes 12 minutes to compile a project of 100,000 lines of code without any other dev-box to measure against you have no idea if this is good or bad. Maybe 12 minutes for 100,000 lines is actually good? Measuring it won't help you and it certainly won't help your decision makers. Consider; "Yes boss, it takes an average of twelve minutes to compile our project." The boss says; "Ok, is that normal?". You have no idea. Computer hardware is cheap. Look at the dev-box and consider asking the decision makers to throw some cash at it to improve its performance. If you compile on average 5 times a day and it takes an average of 12 minutes a compile, that's a lost hour every single day - adding up to 5 lost hours a week. Well worth the cost of some RAM or a CPU upgrade.
