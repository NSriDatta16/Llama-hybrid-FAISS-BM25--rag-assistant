How to measaure the similarity between two series?

I'm confused about how to measure the similarity between two time series with the same length . For example, both time series are 2 hours in length and every 5 minutes a point. I really want to know which Distance Algorithm should I use. I have tried the Euclidean Distance but it didn't work well on this type of data. Should I find some point-to-point distance algorithms?
