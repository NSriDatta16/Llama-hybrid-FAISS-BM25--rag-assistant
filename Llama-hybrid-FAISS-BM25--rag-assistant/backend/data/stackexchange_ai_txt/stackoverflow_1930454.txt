What is a good solution for calculating an average where the sum of all values exceeds a double's limits?

I have a requirement to calculate the average of a very large set of doubles (10^9 values). The sum of the values exceeds the upper bound of a double, so does anyone know any neat little tricks for calculating an average that doesn't require also calculating the sum? I am using Java 1.5.
