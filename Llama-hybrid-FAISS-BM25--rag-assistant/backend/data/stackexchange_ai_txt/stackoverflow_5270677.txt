You could use the check_jmx4perl configuration with pre-defined Tomcat checks as a starting point. It references the names of quite some MBeans which can be found on a standard Tomcat installation. I.e. the following metrics are pre-defined: Nr. of servlet requests for a certain servlet Processing CPU time for a webmodule Check whether a webmodule is active Active sessions Max. number of active sessions Number of rejected sessions Average lifetime of a session Max. lifetime of the longest session Data received rate for a connector Data sent rate for a connector Processing time for a connector Number of active datasource connections You can find this sample tomcat.cfg configuration here: https://github.com/rhuss/jmx4perl/blob/master/config/tomcat.cfg
