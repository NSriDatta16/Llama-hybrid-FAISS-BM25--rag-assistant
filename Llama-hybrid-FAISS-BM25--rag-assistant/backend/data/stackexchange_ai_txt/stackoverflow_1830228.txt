I'll explain how I've come to understand cloud computing using a couple examples: Let's say you are creating a personal finances web application. You contact several banks with your proposal and they like the idea but they refuse to allow you access to their servers for a Web Service. In cloud computing, the banks could create a web service in a cloud service like Microsoft's Azure that would extract the data from their server. You would then call their web service from the cloud not their servers. Basically the "cloud" in an intermediary server run by a reputable company like Microsoft, IBM, Google, etc. On the other hand for the bank it lessens the responsibility and cost of managing the web services and hardware/software required. If a small credit union has only data storage servers and no web server the cloud affords them the same opportunity to participate in your application as a large bank could. So basically you can imagine the cloud as an intermediary of web services and/or data storage.
