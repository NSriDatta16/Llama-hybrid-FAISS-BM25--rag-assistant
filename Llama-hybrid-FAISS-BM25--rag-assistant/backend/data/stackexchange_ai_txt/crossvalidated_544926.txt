Why do we do matching for causal inference vs regressing on confounders?

I'm new to the area of causal inference. From what I understand, one of the main concerns that causal inference tries to address is the effect of confounders! For the sake of reference, let's denote the feature that we are interested in (a.k.a treatment or exposure) by A , other features by X (Let's say some of them are confounders) and outcome by Y . I focus on the case where all our confounders are observable . I also limit to the case when we want to estimate average treatment effect . We have the below simple DAG: So there could be two cases: A is categorical A is continuous As I conceptually understand, the whole idea of matching is to marginalize the effect of treatment A on outcome Y , results in ignorability assumption to hold, which conceptually would be like replicating a randomized trial by making the distribution of covariates similiar in an observational data. I am wondering isn't it conceptually the same thing that we would have when making multiple regression on all variables? So the interpretation of each coefficient would be the marginal effect of each feature on the outcome! What is the point that I am missing? What prevents us from going for multiple regression for controlling confounder and turn into matching?
