Custom Windows Forms Control not exporting functions, not showing in tools list, showing as Text

I have written a very simple control. C# Visual Studio 2008. Its output should be, and is a dll. I have added a reference to the dll within the project that I intend to use it with. The msdn article about how to write a control states that it should appear in the 'Add reference / projects' list, which it doesn't but I simply navigated to it under the 'browse' tab, went to the /bin folder and added the reference that way. I dragged it over to my toolbox, but it shows up as a 'Text:xhair_tool' and when i try and add it to a form, it won't, so what have I done wrong? It was created as a 'Windows forms control' project. It should export the one method which is 'Target' which return an array, as shown below. using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel; using System.Drawing; using System.Data; using System.Text; using System.Windows.Forms; namespace xhair_tool { public partial class xhair : UserControl { public xhair() { InitializeComponent(); } private void xhair_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { } protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { Graphics g = e.Graphics; Pen pen = new Pen(Color.Black, 1); SolidBrush redBrush = new SolidBrush(Color.Red); g.DrawLine(pen, 8, 0, 8, 7); g.DrawLine(pen, 8, 9, 8, 16); g.DrawLine(pen, 0, 8, 7, 8); g.DrawLine(pen, 9, 8, 16, 8); //ControlPaint.DrawReversibleLine(start, end, backColor) } /// /// Returns the point at the center of the crosshair /// /// int[x,y] public int[] Target { get { int[] _xy = new int[2]; _xy[0] = this.Left + 8; _xy[1] = this.Top + 8; return _xy; } } } } Thanks, R.
