Machine learning: inferring parents from child data

In producing SCADA systems, we get large lists of signals. The signals can be a couple of thousands and all have verbal descriptions such as: Diesel Generator 1 Fuel Pressure Diesel Generator 1 Oil Pressure Diesel Generator 2 Fuel Pressure Diesel Generator 2 Oil Pressure There are no guarantees how much of the phrase (or what part) covers the Parent (Diesel generator 1) and what is the specific signal detail. These lists are perused by humans to implement them. In Power Management System, the entities "DG1"and "DG2" (DG = Diesel generator) are sort of singletons. They are pre-known entities that are either present or not present. So it is possible to look for them and it makes sense that the resulting algorithm will be able to positively identify them. But in other subsystems, such as Cargo Management, we do not know upfront how many pumps, valves and sensors we have. Their naming is not consistent or interesting. We have been in this business for a long time and we have hundreds of delivered vessels where a human has already created a system from such a signal list. I can reverse engineer existing vessels and tell the algorithm what signal descriptions turned out to be related. However, I'm not sure how this would be represented in the learning data, though. If I e.g introduce a column like this Separator 1 Inlet pump pressure "Inl1Pmp" Sep1 Inlet Pmp flow "Inl1Pmp" Sep1 Inlet Pmp Emgcy Stop "Inl1Pmp" Sep1 Outlet Pmp flow "Out1Pmp" The challenge here is that I want to signify that the top three signals were acting on the same main equipment , that it was a pump in the Process subsystem. It's not as interesting to find that it was "Inl1Pmp" specifically because the next project will have similar sounding signals, but with a completely different name for the pump itself. All of these things I can tell the learning data if there is some good way to represent it in the learning data. Being a Pump and being a part of Processing are just two columns in the learning data, but again the really interesting bit is to reduce thousands of signals automatically grouped into hundreds of onboard equipment. I have presented this problem in casual conversation to a couple of machine learning experts. One speculated that this may be a clustering problem. My questions: How do I represent signal affiliation in learning data without attaching an identity to it? What sort of machine learning problem is this? Are there specific topics I should look into? Are there online tools where I can direct the data in csv/xml/json form? I don't know if this was clear. When trying to explain the problem to laymen, I try to use an example of a picture of an unknown number of people and that you should, based on a list of facts about the individuals determine how many individuals are in the picture without knowing if a person is referred to as "John" or "The clown", "The guy with makeup".
