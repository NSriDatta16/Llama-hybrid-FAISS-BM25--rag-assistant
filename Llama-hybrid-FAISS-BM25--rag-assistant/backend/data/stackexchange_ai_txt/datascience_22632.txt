Adding hand-crafted features to a convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow

Let's say I want to add a few hand-crafted features to a convolutional neural network CNN in TensorFlow. The CNN can be a simple one as described here . Naturally I'd like to add these features right after the second pooling and right before the first fully-connected layer (FC1 in the example). Is that easy to express my method in code? I'd have to append my features to the h_pool2_flat vector/tensor: h_pool2_flat = tf.reshape(h_pool2, [-1, 7*7*64]) h_fc1 = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(h_pool2_flat, W_fc1) + b_fc1)
