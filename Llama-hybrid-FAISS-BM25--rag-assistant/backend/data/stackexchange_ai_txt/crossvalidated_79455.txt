Do I need to counterbalance 8 audio excerpts to control for order effects?

I have 8, 1-minute audio excerpts, all that feature the same music. Four of them were recorded by a middle school music ensemble (2 expressive, 2 unexpressive) and four by a high school music ensemble (2 expressive, 2 unexpressive). I am getting participants in the MS ensemble, the HS ensemble, and a set of expert evaluators to listen to all 8 excerpts and assign a single rating. Because all of these excerpts feature the same 1-minute piece of music (although by two different groups and under two different conditions - expressive and unexpressive), do I need to have 3 different audio presentation orders to help control for order effects? I am going to average the 2 expressive and 2 unexpressive audio excerpt ratings for each group (MS, HS, Experts). My thought that was by averaging the ratings (to get scores for each group - MS Expressive, MS Unexpressive, HS Expressive, HS Unexpressive) that I wouldn't really need to do have separate orders. Any help about counterbalancing and/or ways to avoid fatigue effects (since it is 8, 1-minute excerpts of the same piece of music, although recorded by two different music groups under two different conditions) would be most helpful. Thanks for your help!
