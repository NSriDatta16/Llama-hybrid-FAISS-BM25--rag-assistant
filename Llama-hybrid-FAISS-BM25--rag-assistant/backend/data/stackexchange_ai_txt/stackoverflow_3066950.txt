There is no such feature in Maven proper, though you can achieve the same by installing repository manager and replacing all references in your settings.xml with a single reference to the repo manager. This also simplifies and centralizes the configuration for the whole team and gives you more control over what you use. Both Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory support "artifact routing" using wildcards or regexes. If it's too difficult to propose something like this in your organization, you can install the repo manager on your desktop - usually they do not take too much resources.
