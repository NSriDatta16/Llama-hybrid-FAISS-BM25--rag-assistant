Definition from answers.com Heap: A group of things placed or thrown, one on top of the other: a heap of dirty rags lying in the corner. It's just basic naming due to the conceptual image of throwing things in an unordered fashion. As other posters point out, the heap is not organized as a heap data structure. That depends on the memory allocation routines in your system library (eg. check how malloc works)
