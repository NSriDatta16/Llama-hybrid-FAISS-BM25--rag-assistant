Which library do you use? Cross-validation is not a model selection method by itself, it's rather a way to estimate mean square error (for regression) or accuracy rate (for classification). It is likely that the model you get is the SVM fitted for the data specified in the parameters, no specific selection should be done on behalf of CV. Cross-validation allows you to fit the model to all available data and still be informed about it's performance.
