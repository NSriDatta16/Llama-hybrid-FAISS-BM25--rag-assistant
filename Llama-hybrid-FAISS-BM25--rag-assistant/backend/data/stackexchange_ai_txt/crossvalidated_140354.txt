Machine learning for discovering formulas

I have a vector of desired values that I want to fit based in some generated predictors. The tricky part is that I wish to have the explicit formula. For example, giving the below input I would like to get the following formula Input: Y=[1,2,3,6,7] X=[1,2,3,4,5;0,0,0,1,1] Output: Transf={'multiply',1,'transform',linear;... 'multiply',2,'transform',linear} Y=Transf(X) %which would be equal to: Y=1*X(1,:)+2*X(2,:) This is a not so complicated linear regression. but generalizing it could give, log transforms, sin, cosin, roots, exponents. What software could I start with? Or how might I implement this?
