In C++, creating a static data member for a class is a two-step process. First, you have to declare the variable, which you've done here. However, you also have to define it somewhere so that the compiler knows where to put the storage space for the variable. Typically, this is done in the .cpp file for the class. In the .cpp file, try adding this line: int Editorial::sm_nTotalEditorials = 0; This gives the compiler the definition that it needs, and so you won't get any more linker errors complaining about the missing definition. You will also probably want to do this for the other static data members as well. Note that when making these sorts of definitions you do not repeat the static keyword; that would give the static field static linkage, which won't resolve the problem.
