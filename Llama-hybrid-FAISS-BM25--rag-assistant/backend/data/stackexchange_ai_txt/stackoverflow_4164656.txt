Using Devexpress ASP.NET controls with Delphi Prism

Has anybody had any hands-on experience using Devexpress ASP.NET components with Delphi Prism? At the moment I'm specifically interested in using their "Calendar and Scheduling for ASP.NET" suite. Sharing your pros/cons, successes/failures would be greatly appreciated. I'm looking leverage my knowledge of Delphi (and my ownership of RAD Studio). Thanks in advance.
