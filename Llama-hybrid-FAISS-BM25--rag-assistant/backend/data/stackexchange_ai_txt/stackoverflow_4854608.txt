How to data bind the text property of a TextBlock to the text property of a TextBox

I have a WPF application with two pages. On page one, there is a TextBox (boxSource). On page two, I have a TextBlock (blockDestination). I want to databind in XAML, the Text property of boxSource to the Text property of blockDestination. I set the DataContext of page two to page one when the application is initialized. I setup blockDestination as follows: This does not pickup the value of the TextBox. My guess is that it is because the TextBox is a variable instead of a property? Can anyone explain the issue, and is there an elegant solution? Thanks for any help
