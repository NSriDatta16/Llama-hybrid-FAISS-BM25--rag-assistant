Thank you for your feedback. The limitations on SQL Express are suited to the primary target users of the product, who typically don't need to store significant amounts of data. At this point we are planning to continue the 4 GB database size limit for SQL Express 2008. Given that the bulk of your file size is the result of storing blobs, you should take a look at a new feature being introduced in SQL 2008 called Filestream Data. This feature allows for the storage of blobs directly on the NT file system while tracking them from within the database. A bit more can be read about this feature in the SQL 2008 Product Overview available from http://www.microsoft.com/sql/techinfo/whitepapers/sql2008Overview.mspx . This feature will be included in SQL Express and should significantly reduce the size of your file while giving you the flexibility to track your blobs in the database.
