How do I decide if a variable is numeric in Perl?

Possible Duplicate: How do I tell if a variable has a numeric value in Perl? I want to decide if a variable (value parsed from a string) is a number or not. How can I do that? Well, I guess /^[0-9]+$/ would work, but is there a more elegant version?
