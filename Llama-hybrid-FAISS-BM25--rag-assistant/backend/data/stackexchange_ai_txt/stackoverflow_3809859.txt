Switching links between multiple wars

We have a big application having 13 modules. We want to create war file for each module and deploy the app as an EAR. We navigate to different pages through top menu which contains link for all modules. Now problem is that each module have their own context. In order to switch the context we are using an external.jsp " width="100%" height="80%" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0"> and using urls in this format "/external.jsp?/app/newDerivativeTrade.do?method=loadNewDerivativeTrade&isFreight=false". Is there any other elegant way to navigate links between multiple wars.
