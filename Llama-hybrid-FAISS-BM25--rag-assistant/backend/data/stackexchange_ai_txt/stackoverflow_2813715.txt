Hash calculation in your case will almost certanly be I/O bound (unless you'll be running it on a machine with a really slow processor), so multithreading or processing of multiple files at once probably won't yield you expected results. Arraging files over multiple drives or on a faster (SSD) drive would probably help, even though that is probably not the solution you are looking for.
