Optimal PCA is 0?

I am following this post ( https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-tune-hyperparameters-of-tsne-7c0596a18868 ) to reduce of data's dimension with PCA; however, the according optimal PCA is 0! (100% sure the code is correct!) What should i do with this? my data consists 500 rows and 400 columns
