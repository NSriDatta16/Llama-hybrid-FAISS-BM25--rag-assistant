Time series/ ARMA Simulation

Given: I have a question, given a continuous real spectral density f(w), -infinity my idea: I would folding, discretize and truncate the spectral density to get a real (one-sided) discrete spectral density. Afterwards via the inverse FFT, I would calculate the autocovariance function (acvf) of the desired ARMA (,which i complex-valued), i.e R(t) t=0,...N-1. Since I know that a (complex-valued) acvf is hermitian, I can also get R(-t) t=1,...N-1. Until now am I right? (I am a little confused that the acvf is complex for an (desired) ARMA-TS. is it possible that also the defining polynomial of an ARMA-TS are complex? If this all is true, I would apply the extended Yule-walker algorithm, as proposed in Krank & Clausen (On the Calibration of ARMA Processes for Simulation) THX for any help (concrete steps/ideas are welcome)
