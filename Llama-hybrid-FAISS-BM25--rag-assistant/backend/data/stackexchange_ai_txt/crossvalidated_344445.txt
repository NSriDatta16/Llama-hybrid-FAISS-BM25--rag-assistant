What do you call models that are not invariant to predictor order?

Most models are invariant to predictor order, i.e. they do not assume feature[31] to be related to feature[32] more than to feature[42] . On the other hand, Gaussian Process Regression or Convolutional Neural Networks do assume that the closer two features are, the more likely it is that they are related. What do you call the property that distinguishes these two kinds of models? A good candidate may be permutation invariance . It is not clear, however, whether this refers to the permutation of the observations or the predictors. Perhaps a proper name would be symmetric /asymmetric model?
