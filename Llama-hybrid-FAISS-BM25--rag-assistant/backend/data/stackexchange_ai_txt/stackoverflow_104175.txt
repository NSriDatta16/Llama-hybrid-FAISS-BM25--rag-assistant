The major reason I've found for using workflow foundation is how much it brings you out of the box in terms of tracking and persistence. It's very easy to get the persistence service up and running, which brings reliability and load distribution between multiple instances and hosts. On the other hand, just like forms apps, the code patterns that the workflow designer pushes you towards are bad. But you can avoid problems by writing no code in the workflow and delegating all work to other classes, which can be organized and unit tested more gracefully than the workflow. Then you get the cool visual aspect of the designer without the cruft of spaghetti code behind.
