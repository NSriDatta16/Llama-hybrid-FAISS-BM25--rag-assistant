You know normalization isn't just for large enterprise level database (I know you know :). History has shown that if you don't normalize you will get anomalies. Start with 5NF and 'optimize' from there, though I suspect you will find that optimization is not required. I suspect the propsed design will not suit its intended purpose e.g. data analysis. Try writing some typical SQL queries against it (e.g. average length of Observations across all Pedagogical questions then across all questions) and you will find it a pain: huge CASE statements, tables UNION ed many times over, ... it's likely you will end up writing VIEWs to normalise the data!
