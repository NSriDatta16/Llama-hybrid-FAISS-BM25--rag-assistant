deriving activity diagram-based GUIs and CRUD them with a DB?

i received a big book full of processes. i was thinking about the end user (they will be lawyers) and decided the best GUI would be showing activity diagrams or business processes. It reminded me Quickbooks and how non-accountants can successfully use it and understand accounting processes. i began doing research before sending my project to a bunch of programmers: is there some open source solution? can i use MS Visio libraries? which UML tool is programable? what about Eclipse and its modeling tools? etc etc the key points here are: relationships between events, artifacts, actors, etc should be stored in a database. processes or steps in a process should be easily modified by updating the database do this sounds too crazy? (should I explain a bit more why it must be programmed this way?)
