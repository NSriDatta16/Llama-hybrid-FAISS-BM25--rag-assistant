A neural network can be trained with x as created date and y as appnt scheduled date. This is a complex dataset so a neural network regression is recommended. Convert all dates into numerical figures in days from a common reference origin like 1/1/1970 or whichever was start date of your clinic. Neural Network logits output would predict likely appnt scheduled date
