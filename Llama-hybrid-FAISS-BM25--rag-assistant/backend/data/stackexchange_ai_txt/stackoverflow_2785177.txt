Instead of using a scalar stored procedure, use a scalar function instead. The dataset designer will correctly detect the data type for the scalar function. You only need to use a scalar stored procedure if you are making changes to data during the query. A scalar function is read-only. You can also very conveniently drag the function into your dataset as a query instead of having to go through the wizard. If you insist on using a stored procedure, or a regular query, you can always cast your result like so (in VB)... Dim ta As New DataSet1TableAdapters.QueriesTableAdapter Dim result As Decimal = DirectCast(ta.StoredProcedure1, Decimal) or With Option Infer On Dim resultInfer = DirectCast(ta.StoredProcedure1, Decimal)
