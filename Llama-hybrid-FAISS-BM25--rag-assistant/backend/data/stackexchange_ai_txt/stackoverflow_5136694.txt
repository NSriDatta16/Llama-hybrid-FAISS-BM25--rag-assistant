Infinite scrollbar in Javascript

I am writing a book viewer that dynamically loads content as the user scrolls down to it. The first problem I'm having is how to set up the scrollbar. Since we only store paragraphs in our database with no size information, I can only guess how long the document is. Based upon such a guess, I may want to create a scrollable window that appears 10,000 pixels long and loads paragraphs as needed. The simplest way I can think is to actually create a DIV that is 10,000 pixels long and absolutely position an embedded div at the scroll position showing my content. Is there a way to totally control the scrollbar under Javascript (setting its min, max, position, relative thumb size) or do I go the simple way mentioned above or is there another way to do this? I am using ExtJS framework but it does not seem to offer any direct help there, though V4 does include an infinite grid.
