I'd say if you want to go with Perl, you have to use Net::FTP. Once, I needed a script that diffs a directory/file structure on an FTP server with a corresponding directory/file structure on a local harddisk, which lead me to write this script . I don't know if it is efficient or elegant, but you might find one or another idea in it. hth / Rene
