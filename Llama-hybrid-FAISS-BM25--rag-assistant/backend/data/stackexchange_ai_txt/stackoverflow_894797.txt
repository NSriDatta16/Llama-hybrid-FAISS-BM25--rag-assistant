I usually let exceptions leak, though if I'm in a particularly Enterprisey mood I'll wrap them in a RepositoryException to keep clients from caring about the underlying storage engine. I would never return false/null instead of an exception, as there's already a meaning behind those values. In rare cases, you could have a brain-dead storage engine that generates exceptions on non-exceptional cases - and I would catch those specific ones and return null if appropriate (eg., if a row does not exist, but the storage engine throws an error on that case - I'd catch it and return null).
