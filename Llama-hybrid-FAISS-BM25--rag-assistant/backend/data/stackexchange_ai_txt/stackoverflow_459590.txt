What is the difference betwen including modules and embedding modules?

module Superpower # instance method def turn_invisible ... end # module method def Superpower.turn_into_toad ... end module Fly def flap_wings ... end end end Class Superman include Superpower ... def run_away # how to call flap_wings? # how to call turn_invisible? end def see_bad_guys(bad_guy = lex_luthor) #is this correct? Superpower.turn_into_toad(bad_guy) end end Hi I saw some ruby code which I couldn't understand. How do you call flap_wings from within the Superman class? Is it possible to call an instance method from within the class? What is the difference between including modules and embedding modules? Why and when should you do that?
