How are the source and objects currently organized? Would you want to set up Subversion to work with the current library structure instead of creating this new IFS directory structure? I'd suggest using object types (pgm, file, cmd, pnlgrp, sql, etc.) for file extensions instead of source file types (rpgle, clle, sql, etc.). You could have xyz.rpgle and xyz.clle sources in conflict as they both compile to XYZ *PGM.
