Xgboost Regresion tree

I am building a boosted regression tree in R and I use the simple xgboost function from the package xgboost in R. xgboost(data=insample, label=df$y[insampleinds], nrounds = 1000) I have data for around 1 million observations for 5 features or independent variables (x1 to x5). I do get good out of sample performance. I am interested in computing the sensitivity of my response y to the independent variables. To do this I: 1) Randomly and with replacement sample from the distribution of say x1(keeping x2 to x5 fixed), and create a simulated vector of x1 2) Compute the response y from the tree output at this simulated x1 vector I find that the results from step 2 seem to change from run to run, for instance every time I build a new tree, I would get a new response y (the tree output) for my simulated set of x1. Would anyone know how to deal with this issue or an alternate method? Thanks.
