I got introduced to Dramatis at OSCON 2008, it is an Agent based framework for Ruby and Python. The author (Steven Parkes) has some references in his blog and is working at running a language agnostic Actors discussion list . This page at erights.org has a great set of references to, what I think are, the core papers that introduce and explore the Actors message passing model.
