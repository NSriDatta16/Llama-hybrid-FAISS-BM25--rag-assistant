With the R-Package "label.switching" ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/label.switching/index.html ), the following algorithms can be compared: ECR algorithm (default version), ECR algorithm (two iterative versions), PRA algorithm, Stephensâ€™ algorithm, Artificial Identifiability Constraint (AIC), Data-Based relabelling and a probabilistic relabelling algorithm (SJW). With the function permute.mcmc() the labels in the mcmc chains can be relablled for parameters that differ between mixture components or latent classes.
