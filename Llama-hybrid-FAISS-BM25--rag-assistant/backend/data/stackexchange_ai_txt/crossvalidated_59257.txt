I wouldn't place much stock in "rules of thumb" such as this. It is dependent upon so many things such as the number of variables, the number of sites, what dissimilarity you use etc. Also note that the vector fitting approach is inherently linear and we have no reason to presume that the relationship between the variable and the NMDS configuration is linear. The key thing is that it is a small/modest correlation but that it is significant. But you probably want to look at the linearity assumption. In the vegan package for R we have function ordisurf() for this. It fits a 2-d surface to an NMDS solution using a GAM via function gam() in package mgcv . It essentially fits the model $$g(\mu_i) = \eta_i = \beta_0 + f(nmds_{1i}, nmds_{2i})$$ where $f$ is a 2-d smooth function of the 1st and 2nd axes of the NMDS, $g$ is the link function, $\mu$ the expectation of the response, and $\eta$ is the linear predictor. The error distribution is a member of the exponential family of distributions. The function $f$ can be isotropic in which case we use smooths formed by s() employing by default thin plate splines. Anisotropic surfaces can be fitted too, where we use smooths formed by te() ; tensor product smooths. The complexity of the smooth is chosen during fitting using a, by default in the development versions, REML criterion. GCV smoothness selection is also available. Here is an R example using one of the in-built data sets provided with vegan require("vegan") data(dune) data(dune.env) ## fit NMDS using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (default) set.seed(12) sol This produces > summary(sol.s) Family: gaussian Link function: identity Formula: y ~ s(x1, x2, k = knots[1], bs = bs[1]) Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std.

Read ?ordisurf for details on the arguments used, especially what select = TRUE does.
