I don't think there is any rule of thumb. It depends on the type of model you want to use (e.g., simple logistic regression vs. fancy neural net), your data (e.g., i.i.d. vs. highly dependent), the complexity of the relationship you're trying to model (e.g., no interactions vs. lots of interactions), and probably some other things I couldn't think of. The more complicated your problem is, the more data you'll need. The "build model and check generalization error" approach is an excellent idea (I assume you're doing prediction). Note that the amount of data you need depends your algorithm or desired accuracy. For example, if you have 20 observations, a linear regression might work fine but a neural net definitely won't.
