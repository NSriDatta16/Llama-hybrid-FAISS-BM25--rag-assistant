PostgreSql + Searching Issue for "'" present in string

Here, I have a problem in searching record in Postgresql DB in RoR Application. Name of table :: address_books, name of attributes :: organization_name, federal_tax_id, city, zip , business_name. In search, organization name contain :: Claire's Inc as record. At the time of searching, it does not show the data while we select Claire's Inc in search box. Because "'" breaks the string and gives no result. So I have used "?" replace "'" at time of search in mysql and it works. But I am getting appropriate conversion to make search of this words. Query :: SELECT * FROM "address_books" WHERE ( address_books.organization_name = 'Claire?s Inc' and address_books.federal_tax_id = '59-0940416' and address_books.city = 'Hoffman Estates' and address_books.zip = '60192' and address_books.business_name ='' ) ORDER BY address_books.organization_name , city LIMIT 100 Please suggest any other way to make successful search. Thanks in Advance
