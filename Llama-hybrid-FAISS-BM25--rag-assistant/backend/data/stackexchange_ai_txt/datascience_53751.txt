You might find some more useful methods if you look for event detection or outlier detection, rather than clustering. Given the shape of the spikiness in the data, you could try using the mean value of the time series as a threshold, then contiguous chunks of values that are greater than the global mean will be your abnormal states. Now this method might be a little bit fragile in the long run, so you might want to make it more sophisticated. You could use the mean value over a large rolling window, rather than the global mean, if you are more interested in local changes. If you wanted to keep things in a clustering framing, then it might work better if you did the clustering in 2D, i.e. your points will be (time, value) tuples/vectors, rather than doing the clustering on the 1D data. Another thing that would probably work would be to use K-means clustering on the 1D data, but only have 2 clusters (normal and abnormal) you would then have to use time information to separate individual events/anomalies.
