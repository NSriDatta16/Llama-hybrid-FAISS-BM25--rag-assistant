Creating objects dynamically in general is considered a bad practice in C++. What if an exception is thrown from your "//..." code? You'll never be able to delete the object. It is easier and safer to simply do: std::vector FindPoints() { std::vector result; //... return result; } Shorter, safer, more straghtforward... As for the performance, modern compilers will optimize away the copy on return and if they are not able to, move constructors will get executed so this is still a cheap operation.
