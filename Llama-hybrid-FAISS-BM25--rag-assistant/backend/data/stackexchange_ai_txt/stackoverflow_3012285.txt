Magento hiding all errors page

Magento Production version 1.2.1 store running on linux centos. I want to hide all error messages generating from Magento, or if error occurred then I want user to send to custom error page. I tried some solutions like putting Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true); in index.php but it is not working properly, I even tried to set ini_set('display_errors', 0); but it is still not working. Magento still giving errors like "undefined index"
