JavaScript drag-and-drop proxy

I want to enable drag-and-drop behaviour on my Web application. I have an image I want to drag. The image is behind another one that has transparent sections so that you can see the image beneath it. I do not want to change the order of the images. My thinking is I should use another layer on top of both images that is transparent and use it as a proxy to transfer events to the image I want to drag. jQuery UI's draggable function will not allow me to transfer the events in real-time i.e. I cannot hook into what it is doing while the drag is taking place, only when it is completed. Is there a JavaScript library or jQuery plugin that will allow me to enable drag-and-drop on an element and have it transfer those events to another element in real-time?
