How to compute sample size?

For example: I want to survey a group of people to get the average time the call will ring before answered. To calculate a sample size, I used the formula $$ n = \frac{z^2 \times \text{Variance}}{(\text{Margin of error})^2} $$ eg. for a 95% CI and 5% margin of error and variance is 5 seconds $$ n = \frac{1.96^2 \times 5}{0.05^2} = 7683.2$$ How do you interpret the $n$ here? Is it the total seconds we need to sample or will it be the number of people we need to sample?
