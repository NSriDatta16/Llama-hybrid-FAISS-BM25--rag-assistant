It's pretty easy to write a method that does it, assuming you're using something like Rails which has #capture , #concat , and #markdown helpers. Here's an example, using Maruku: def markdown_filter(&block) concat(markdown(capture(&block))) end Then you can use this as so: # Title This is a *paragraph*. This is **another paragraph**. There are a few things to note here. First, it's important that all the text in the block have no indentation; you could get around this by figuring out the common indentation of the lines and removing it, but I didn't do that in the example helper above. Second, it uses Rails' #markdown helper, which could easily be implemented in other frameworks as so (replacing Maruku with your Markdown processor of choice): def markdown(text) Maruku.new(text).to_html end Rails 3 has removed the #markdown helper, so just add the above code in the appropriate helper, substituting the Markdown processor of your choice.
