Here's the thing with PCA. It's unsupervised and exploratory. You can't build in a theory into the mathematics behind it. Here are some possible explanations and options: the item that loaded poorly is bad. It doesn't measure what you think, is worded poorly, or was misunderstood by respondents. Get rid of it. the dimensions you think exist don't exist in the way you thought. Reframe your theory. something else is going on with the way the item relates to other items in your data. That could be creating noise somewhere. If you think the item is needed, and you have a strong idea about how item should load, then consider running a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). That allows you to specify what loads where based in substantive theory. If you are interested in the construct validity of what you are measuring, not just data reduction, you should be working with CFA, and there is a host of different tests you can run there. If you don't have exposure to CFA then dig into any introductory psychometrics or multivariate statistics text. Here's a posting asking about recommended book: Book recommendations for multivariate analysis I can't vouch for these but they should point you in the right direction.
