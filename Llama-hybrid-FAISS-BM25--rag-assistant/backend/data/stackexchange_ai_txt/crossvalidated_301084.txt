Displaying distributions of data with a high number of features

I have data of two different groups. From each data, I have say 100 samples, each sample having 20 features. I want to display the distribution of each of the two datasets. Now I have some very basic questions: If I want to fit a distribution to the data of each of the groups, do I fit a distribution to each sample of this group, or do I average over samples and then fit the distribution? Making a histogram of any of the samples using all of the features, the histogram looks roughly normally distributed. However I assume that being in 20-dimensional space, the underlying distribution of the data would have to be a 20-dimensional gaussian - so what does the distribution of the histogram represent, and which distribution is relevant for classification, say with a classifier which assumes normality?
