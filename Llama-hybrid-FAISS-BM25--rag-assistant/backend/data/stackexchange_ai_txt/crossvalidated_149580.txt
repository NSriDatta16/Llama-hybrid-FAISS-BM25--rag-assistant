First let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it: you have 5 points, but you don't want to classify the points, you want classification probabilities . If that's the case, that's what multinomial regression (Wikipedia) is designed to do. It's covered in several textbooks; I learned out of Categorical Data Analysis (Amazon link to 3e) by Agresti but it might not be the best book for self-study. You can also use a neural network (blog post by Brian Dolhansky) that outputs class membership probabilities. Interesting coverage of the subject here (Ou and Murphey, 2007, Multi-class pattern classification using neural networks. Pattern Recognition 40, 4-18).
