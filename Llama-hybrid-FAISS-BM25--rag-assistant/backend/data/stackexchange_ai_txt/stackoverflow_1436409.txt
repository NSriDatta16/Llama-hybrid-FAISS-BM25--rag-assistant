Well I hesitate to suggest this because it certainly won't be computationally efficient (see the stored procedures answer for that...) but it will all be in one query like you wanted. I'm also taking some liberties and assuming that you want the 5 most recent shows...hopefully you can modify to your actual requirements. SELECT * FROM artists AS a, venues AS v, shows AS s LEFT JOIN tours AS t ON s.show_tour_id = t.tour_id WHERE s.show_artist_id = a.artist_id AND s.show_venue_id = v.venue_id AND s.show_id IN (SELECT subS.show_id FROM shows subS WHERE subS.show_artist_id = s.show_artist_id ORDER BY subS.show_date DESC LIMIT 5) ORDER BY a.artist_name ASC, s.show_date ASC;
