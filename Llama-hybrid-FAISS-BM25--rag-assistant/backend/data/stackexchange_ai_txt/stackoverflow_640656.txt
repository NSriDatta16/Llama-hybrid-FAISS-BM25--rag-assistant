SQL Query for Summary By Instances Per Day

I've got a table in a mysql database that contains monetary transactions. Let's say the tabled is called transactions : id int, to_user int, from_user int, created datetime, amount double I'm trying to create a query that returns the average amount of a transaction grouped by the number of transactions that appear per day. The applicable columns are amount and created. So I'm trying to answer the question: what is the average amount of transactions that occur on days where there are between 0 and 2 transactions, between 2 and 4 transactions, between 4 and 6 transactions, etc. Any ideas?
