Are IO Control codes determined by the hardware or ...?

I have a small project (for my cell phone) on the go, and I believe I have found IO Control codes for what I want to accomplish (theres nothing at a higher level unless I can reverse engineer the dlls and call them). However, the codes are from a different device from a different manufacturer (the board is the same - a snapdragon 8650) Will those control codes be likely to work on my device, or is that going to be dependent on something manufacturer specific? Am I likely to be able to do permanent damage to my phone by trying them?
