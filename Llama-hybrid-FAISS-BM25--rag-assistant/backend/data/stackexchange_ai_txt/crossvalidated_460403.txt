Interpretation of VAR results with exogenous variables

I have three time series A, B and C and I ran a VAR using C as a exogenous variable. I add that the B variable is likely associated with C, in the sense that B could have a casual impact on C. I found (see below the regression for A as dependent variable) that B is positively and significantly associated with A, and also the exogenous C is positively and significantly associated with A. My question is: Can I conclude, based on the following results, that the effect of C on A is significant and independent from that of B on A? In other words, can I say something like "keeping the other variables (and especially B) constant (or, controlling for the effect of B), C has a significant positive effect on A"? Thank you Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) A (Lag 1) 0.48795 0.02999 16.273
