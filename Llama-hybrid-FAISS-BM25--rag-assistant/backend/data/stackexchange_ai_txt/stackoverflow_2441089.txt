What about changing the order? mydiv = $('#someDiv'); // clone without the events and insert newDiv = myDiv.clone(false).insertAfter(myDiv); // datepicker won't re-init if this class is present // not necessary anymore // newDiv.find('.hadDatepicker').removeClass('hadDatepicker'); newDiv.find('input.datefield').datepicker(); // datepicker attached as a last step mydiv.find('input.datefield').datepicker(); Honestly I don't know how datepicker works internally. My hunch is that it stores something in jQuery DOM storage. Let's avoid copying it at all costs. (You might have long business logic between these lines of code. The point is to have a backup of #someDiv before putting a datepicker on it.)
