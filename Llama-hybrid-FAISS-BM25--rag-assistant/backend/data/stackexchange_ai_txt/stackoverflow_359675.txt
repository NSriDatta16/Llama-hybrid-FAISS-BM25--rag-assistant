Java REST client without schema

Goal Java client for Yahoo's HotJobs Resum√© Search REST API . Background I'm used to writing web-service clients for SOAP APIs, where wsimport generates proxy stubs and you're off and running. But this is a REST API, which is new to me. Details REST API No WADL No formal XML schema (XSD or DTD files). There are example XML request/response pairs . No example code provided Progress I looked at question Rest clients for Java? , but the automated solutions there assume you are providing both the server and the client, with JAXB invoked on POJOs to generate a schema and a REST API. Using Jersey (a JAX-RS implementation), I have been able to make a manual HTTP request: import com.sun.jersey.api.client.*; ... ClientConfig clientConfig = new DefaultClientConfig(); Client client = Client.create(clientConfig); WebResource webResource = client.resource("https://hj.yahooapis.com/v1/HJAuthTokens"); webResource.accept("application/xml"); // body is a hard-coded string, with replacements for the variable bits String response = webResource.post(String.class, body); // parse response into a org.w3c.dom.Document // interface with Document via XPATH, or write my own POJO mappings The response can look like: 0 Login successful NTlEMTdFNjk3Qjg4NUJBNDA3MkJFOTI3NzJEMTdDNDU7bG9jYWxob3N0LmVnbGJwLmNvcnAueWFob28uY29tO0pVNWpzRGRhN3VhSS4yQVRqRi4wWE5jTWl0RHVVYzQyX3luYWd1TjIxaGx6U0lhTXN3LS07NjY2MzM1OzIzNDY3NTsxMjA5MDE2OTE5OzZCM1RBMVNudHdLbl9VdFFKMFEydWctLQ== Or, it can look like: description errorCode Questions Is there a way to auto-generate POJOs which can be marshalled/unmarshalled without a formal schema? Should I attempt to generate those POJOs by hand, with JAXB annotations? Is there some tool I should be leveraging so I don't have to do all this manually?
