How to understand network neural network architecture from a research paper

Hello everyone I have the following architecture from the DELP-DAR research paper ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865519303216 ) and I dont really understand two things, first how can you go from 960x570 size to 481x286 with a 3x3 convolution? Does this mean I have to have asymmetric padding or what? Second, what is the value after a slash? 3 x 3 / 2 - i though it to be stride but then you cant have a stride of 2 and end up with output of the same dimensions as the input. Thank you for your help.
