There are various options for integrating SharePoint into a windows forms application. The simplest is embedding a web browser control and point it to the page with the dashboard set up. Alternatively you could use the SharePoint client object model (2) (make calls to the SharePoint server) and retrieve data (and potentially pages) from SharePoint to put into your dashboard. I would recommend to management that we can display SharePoint through our current application, and we can demonstrate with a simple dashboard part (eg chart control) to demonstrate how we can make the dashboard integrate more naturally over time piece by piece. This would minimise risk by displaying from SharePoint, while being able to show the potential advantages of using the SharePoint data and creating a customised windows forms dashboard.
