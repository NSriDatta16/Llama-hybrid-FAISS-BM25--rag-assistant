I think I have a solution for you. You need to emerge everything involved with the 'xinerama' USE flag. Then set meta modes in your X config or using nvidia-settings for each screen. This makes your monitors look like one screen to the driver, but informs the window manager of your independent screen boundaries. Now you can drag back and forth from window to window, AND you can do and independent fullscreen on each. Yay! Note: I have tested this successfully on Gnome, but not KDE yet. Good Luck! Edit: forgot to mention that then you still need to figure out how to get your application to be meta mode aware. :p
