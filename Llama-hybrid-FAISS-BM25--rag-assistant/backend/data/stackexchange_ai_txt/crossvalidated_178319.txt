Bayesian inference for power laws

Let $G$ be a graph with $N$ nodes. Let $p(d_i)$ be the probability of node $i$ to have $d$ connections. If this follows a power-law: $$ p(d_i) = \frac{d_i^\alpha}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} d_j^\alpha} $$ $\alpha$ is often estimated by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Is there a common Bayesian estimation of the posterior? $$ p(\alpha | G) \propto \prod_{i=1}^N d_i^\alpha \times p(\alpha) $$
