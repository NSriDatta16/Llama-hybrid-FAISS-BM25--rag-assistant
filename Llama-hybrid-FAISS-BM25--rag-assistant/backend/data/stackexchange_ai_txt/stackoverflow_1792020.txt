I personally like Django. I had a problem with Ruby on Rails where I just got overwhelmed by everything when I just wanted to do something simple, which it sounds like you want to do (since you said ROR feels like overkill). The cool thing I found with Django is that if you WANT everything, then you can get everything by plugging it in...but if you want less then you just don't plug in that technology and it's that much more lightweight. Take for example "views". Django, like ROR, uses MVC. But if you just want to return a string of data and don't need the view, then you don't need to plug in the view. But if later on you decide that it will be more organized in a view then you can easily plug it in at that time. Here's their website: http://www.djangoproject.com/
