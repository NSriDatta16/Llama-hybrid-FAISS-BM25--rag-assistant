Markov property in time series

I work on some time series which are 1Hz. I have three questions about them: How can I test Markov property on time series? If Markov property doesn't hold, Is it possible to downsample time series to Markov property holds? If the answer of 2 is yes, How is possible to choose a good frequency for downsampling? Actually I want to know about practical methods. This article explains a theoretical point of view but I don't how can I implement it.
