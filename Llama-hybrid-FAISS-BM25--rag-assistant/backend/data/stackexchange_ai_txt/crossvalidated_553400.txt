Time Series Forecasting with known values

Is there a way to incorporate known values into a time series model? For example if we look at hotel bookings. It makes sense to build a seasonal forecasting model, but I'd like to try to factor in "early bookings". Say we look 180 days prior to a specific week, we know that a certain # of people have already booked for that week and would be a helpful indicator to what actual bookings would end up being.
