Jquery is a client side library used for: Traversing the DOM: Selecting every other paragraph, or getting all the child elements inside a list, for example. Manipulating the DOM: Wrapping every link in a div tag, changing all tables to red. Ajax: Sending requests to the server and retrieving and displaying the response the server sends back, without refreshing the whole page. Animation: Fade in, Slide Up, grow, shrink, move, etc. Browser normalization: Make all browsers behave the same way with the same jquery code.
