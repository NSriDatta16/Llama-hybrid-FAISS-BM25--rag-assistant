What are non-machine-learning methods called?

For my masters, I'm comparing different approaches to solve a problem (like image segmentation). I'm comparing machine learning and deep learning approaches to «classical» algorithms (like simple or adaptative threshold). How would you call these «classical» or «standard » approaches? Like algorithms that don't rely on data but are «hand-designed». I can't seem to find a correct term.
