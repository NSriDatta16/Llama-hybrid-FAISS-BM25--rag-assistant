Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR?

I have built a logistic regression where the outcome variable is being cured after receiving treatment ( Cure vs. No Cure ). All patients in this study received treatment. I am interested in seeing if having diabetes is associated with this outcome. In R my logistic regression output looks as follows: Call: glm(formula = Cure ~ Diabetes, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = All_patients) ... Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.2735 0.1306 9.749 However, the confidence interval for the odds ratio includes 1 : OR 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 3.5733333 2.7822031 4.646366 Diabetes 0.5713619 0.3316513 1.003167 When I do a chi-squared test on these data I get the following: data: check X-squared = 3.4397, df = 1, p-value = 0.06365 If you'd like to calculate it on your own the distribution of diabetes in the cured and uncured groups are as follows: Diabetic cure rate: 49 / 73 (67%) Non-diabetic cure rate: 268 / 343 (78%) My question is: Why don't the p-values and the confidence interval including 1 agree?
