The odds ratio is the multiplicative factor that converts one odds to another. For example, if one passenger's odds of survival is $1$ (i.e., a $50\%$ probability of survival), and another passenger has all the same covariate values as the first except that they have one more sibling, then the second passenger's odds of survival is $1\times 0.68 = 0.68$ (i.e., a $40.6\%$ probability of survival). Negative coefficients in a logistic regression model translate into odds ratios that are less than one (viz., $(0, 1)$ ). That in turn, means that the predicted probability is decreasing as the covariate increases. Regarding sex, that is a categorical variable; you just have to understand how those work in regression models. You have reference level coding here, with female as the reference level. The model indicates that males had a lower log odds of survival than females. It may help you to read my answer here: How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept?
