If you have a database schema, sizing is pretty straightforward ... it's just estimated rows * avg row size for each table * some factor for indexes * some other factor for overhead. Given the ridiculously low price of storage nowadays, sizing often isn't a problem unless you intend to have a very high traffic site (or are building an app for a large enterprise). For my own sizing exercises, I've always created an excel spreadsheet listing: col 1: each table that will grow col 2: estimated column size in bytes col 3: estimated # of rows (per year or max, depending on application) col 4: index factor (I always set this to 2) col 5: overhead factor (I always set this to 1.2) col 6: total column (col 2 X 3 X 4 X 5) The sum of col 6 (total column), plus the initial size of your database without growth tables, is your size estimate. You can get much more scientific, but this is my quick and dirty way.
