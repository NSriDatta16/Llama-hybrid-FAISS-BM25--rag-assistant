Pre trained neural networks to recognize certain things

How do you approach the problem or is not classification? For example, I would like to recognize if a face has makeup. But, in order to do this, it would first need to be able to recognize if it is a face. Since a very small amount of pictures are faces, I canâ€™t possibly feed the no_face category with everything else. Also, is it better to recognize if it a face first and then use a second neural network to recognize if it has makeup? Are there pretrained models I can download for common things like faces, animals, etc. PS: By facial recognition, I would like recognize whether it is a face or not, not who the face belongs to.
