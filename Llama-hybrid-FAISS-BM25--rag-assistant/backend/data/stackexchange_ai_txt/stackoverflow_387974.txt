I think you should read Douglas Crockford's Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript and Classical Inheritance in JavaScript . Examples from his page: Function.prototype.method = function (name, func) { this.prototype[name] = func; return this; }; Effect? It will allow you to add methods in more elegant way: function Parenizor(value) { this.setValue(value); } Parenizor.method('setValue', function (value) { this.value = value; return this; }); I also recommend his videos: Advanced JavaScript . You can find more videos on his page: http://javascript.crockford.com/ In John Reisig book you can find many examples from Douglas Crockfor's website.
