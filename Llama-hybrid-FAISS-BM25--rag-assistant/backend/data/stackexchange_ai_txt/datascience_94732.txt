We need to choose filter size from hyperparameters tuning. It is always based on your problem what kind of features you are trying to extract. Sometimes 3 3,5 5 or 9*9 is appropriate and it always based on what kind of problem we are solving. we can Initialize filter value with random 1 and 0 in a matrix. The filter value are learnt during training (i.e. during backpropagation). Hence, the individual values of the filters are often called the weights of a CNN.
