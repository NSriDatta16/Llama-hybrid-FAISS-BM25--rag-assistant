Converting a string to dummy encoded variables

Here's the data PlayerID, Characters, Win or Lose I can make it look like this 8PYPY0LLQ,valkyrie5 , chr_witch4 , hog_rider5 , zapMachine1 , mega_minion3 , baby_dragon2 , bomber7 , skeleton_horde1, 0 Or like this 2GRG822L9,"barbarians8, valkyrie5, chr_balloon3, fire_spirits8, minion8, firespirit_hut6, rage4, skeleton_horde3,",1 The second column is an 8 character combination from 70+ n characters. I need to encode the variables to be dummy variables, so each character gets its own column. Is there a way to do this in python/R? I'm assuming you have to leave the second column as a string rather than outputting a csv file that looks like this. 2GRG822L9,barbarians8, valkyrie5, chr_balloon3, fire_spirits8, minion8, firespirit_hut6, rage4, skeleton_horde3,1 8PYPY0LLQ,valkyrie5 , chr_witch4 , hog_rider5 , zapMachine1 , mega_minion3 , baby_dragon2 , bomber7 , skeleton_horde1,0 It should probably look like this before dummy encoding (I can get rid of commas within the string) 2GRG822L9,"barbarians8, valkyrie5, chr_balloon3, fire_spirits8, minion8, firespirit_hut6, rage4, skeleton_horde3,",1 8PYPY0LLQ,"valkyrie5 , chr_witch4 , hog_rider5 , zapMachine1 , mega_minion3 , baby_dragon2 , bomber7 , skeleton_horde1,",0
