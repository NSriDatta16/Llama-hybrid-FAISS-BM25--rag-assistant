1 - Yes it will work. Eclipse provides OS specific functionality for its supported OSes in the form of plug-in fragments, and the correct one is loaded depending on the detected running OS. If you are simply building a plug-in for anyone using Eclipse you should be fine. If you were shipping your own set of plug-ins in an Eclipe RCP you'd have to ensure that the fragments for the OSes you wanted to support were all present. 2 - It depends what APIs you use and if they have changed, they should only be broken when the major version changes . So Europa -> Galileo ->Helios should be fine.
