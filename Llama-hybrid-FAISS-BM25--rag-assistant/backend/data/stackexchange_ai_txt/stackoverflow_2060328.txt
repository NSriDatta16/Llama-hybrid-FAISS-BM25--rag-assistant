One really easy way of implementing zoom in XAML is to use a Silverlight ViewBox. This zooms the XAML not the pixels. You can specify the stretch to use and the ViewBox will scale based on this (Fill, None, Uniform etc). There are some great Viewbox blog posts on the web if you search for Silverlight+Viewbox on Google. The panning is easily accomplished with a similar mechanism to drag and drop and there are also numerous how-to blog posts on this, available via Google. Just amounts to capturing MouseDown, MouseMove and MouseUp events.
