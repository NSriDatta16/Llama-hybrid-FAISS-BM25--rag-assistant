Discarding correlation among inputs in a neural network

I am working on a problem with 4 inputs and 1 continuous output variable. The sum of all values of the 4 input variables is always 1. a1+a2+a3+a4=1 So, they are correlated. My question is: should I use all 4 variables for neural network training? Or, should I use any 3 of them to get rid of correlation? Is there any problem if I use all 4?
