SQLCMD in Batch Files - Force all output to one file

We have batch files to compile all the sql scripts in a folder against a database. Problem is that we have a couple of thousand scripts and it makes an output file for each script. It makes it difficult to check for errors and a lot to do cleanup on. Is there any way to output all of the results to one file? Here is the script we use: for %%f in ( .sql) do sqlcmd -Sservername -i"%%f" -o"%%f.txt" -Uusername -Ppassword -ddatabasename Regards, Albert
