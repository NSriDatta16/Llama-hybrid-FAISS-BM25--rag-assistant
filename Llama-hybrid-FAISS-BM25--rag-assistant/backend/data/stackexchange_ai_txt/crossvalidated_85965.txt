Linear-logarithmic Regression in MATLAB with two input arguments - which model to assume?

Look at the following plot and ignore the solid lines please (just look at the dotted/dashed ones). ONE curve is described by the following parameters and ONE fixed value for the second input parameter V: X-axis: Input-Parameter T Y-axis: Output-Parameter g For each curve, g is between [0, 255] (thus always positive), concave, bijective. I know from the process that lies behind the measures, that by increasing V , the corresponding curve flattens. The different curves result when varying V . The orange curve at the top is for like V=100 , the bottom curve (red/magenta) results for V=180 . I have measured data with a lot more data points in the following form: T[1] V[1] g[1] T[2] V[1] g[2] T[3] V[1] g[3] ... V[1] g[4] T[N] V[1] g[5] ....... T[1] V[N] g[1] T[2] V[N] g[2] T[3] V[N] g[3] ... V[N] g[4] T[N] V[N] g[5] Now I want a regression like this: g = g(V, T) which would yield the curve for a fixed V-value: g = g(T), V=Vfix Which regression-funktion in MATLAB do you think would work out the best way? And how to assume a "model" here? I only know (from the process itself AND obviously from the plots), that its some sort of linear curve at the beginning, pass over into a logarithmic curve, but I dont know how the value of V inferfers with it!? Thanks a lot in advance: for any advice..
