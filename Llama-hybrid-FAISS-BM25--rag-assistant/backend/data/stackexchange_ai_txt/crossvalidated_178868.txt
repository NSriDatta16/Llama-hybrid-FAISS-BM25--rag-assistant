You've got your work cut out for you. Luckily, there is a large computer science literature that develops explicit models for record linkage that dates back several decades. I would begin with papers by William Winkler at the US Census Bureau. Bill was recently honored by the ASA for his many contributions over the years. Here are links to a few of his papers that deal with various types of models for record linkage: http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/Proceedings/papers/2000_003.pdf http://doku.iab.de/fdz/events/2008/SDC-Workshop_Winkler_Paper.pdf https://fcsm.sites.usa.gov/files/2014/05/J1_Winkler_2013FCSM.pdf https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/matching/WinklerAsa02.pdf There are many others working in the field along with Winkler. Here's a recent paper that leverages a Bayesian framework for linkage... http://www.stat.cmu.edu/proposals/MauricioSadinle.pdf Hope these help.
