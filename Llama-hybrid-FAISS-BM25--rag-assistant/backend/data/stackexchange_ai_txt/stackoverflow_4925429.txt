I think your best bet is the jQuery :contains() selector. With it you could do things like this (note: it matches any paragraph that has [box] in its HTML and maybe you need to escape the brackets): $("p:contains('[box]')").wrap($(' ').addClass('box')); And btw. accepting answers and proving that you already put effort in your problem will make it much more likely to get a helpful reply.
