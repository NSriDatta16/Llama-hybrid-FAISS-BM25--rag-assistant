The word "similarities" is not clear defined. For your example, you can run T-test to see if two data have same mean value. We can run an statistical test to see if the average temperatures for two months are the same. In addition, we can fit two models to the two data sets, and compare to models. Assume you want to fit the Gaussian distribution to the temperature for each month, you can compare the mean and standard deviation of the two models.
