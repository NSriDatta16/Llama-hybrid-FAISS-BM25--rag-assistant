Why PCA is not considered in the taxonomy of blind source separation approaches?

Blind source separation (BSS) approaches are divided in the literature into four methods, including independent component analysis (ICA) , sparse component analysis (SCA) , and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) . Principal component analysis (PCA) and ICA are similar. The former is based on the second-order moments ( variance / covariance ), and the latter uses higher-order statistics . Both of them aim to find a mixing matrix $A$ to recover the original sources $S$ from a set of observations $X$ , by the formula $S = AX$ . My question is why PCA is not considered as a blind source separation technique?
