I think the 'level' means a weighted average between the prediction and real value. If we are taking a simple exponential-smoothing method without trend, we will get: $$\hat y_{T+1\mid T}=\alpha y_T+(1-\alpha) \hat y_{T\mid T-1}.$$ To get a $(T+1)$ step prediction, you take a weighted average of the $T $ step real value and $T$ step prediction. So in the exponential-smoothing with trend, you should also take a weighted average of them to get a "level", and then add the trend to get a final prediction.
