I think you are asking to much of the HttpServletRequest. Once a request has been completed you shouldn't count on the request object being of any use. I don't recommend threading inside a J2EE container in most cases anyway but that's a different issue. If you must handle the request in parallel I recommend you extract the data you need from the request object and send that to your threads and make the worker threads mostly Servlet ignorant with the exception of the HttpSession where they could store their computed values for the Ajax retrieval.
