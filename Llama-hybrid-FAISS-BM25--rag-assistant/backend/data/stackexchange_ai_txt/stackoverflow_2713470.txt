How to create a mobile friendly website [infrastructure]

if i wanted to create a mobile friendly version of a relatively small website would it be better to have a sub domain that redirects to a completely new url with separate markup and styling or would it be better to detect the user agent in code and programmatically change to a different mobile friendly stylesheet, or is their a better infrastructure based solution i am overlooking.. Thanks.
