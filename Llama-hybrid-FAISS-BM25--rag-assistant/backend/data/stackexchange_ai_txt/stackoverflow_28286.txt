It depends on how "general" you want it to be. If you want it to be really really general such as be able to parse mathematical functions as well like sin(4+5)*cos(7^3) you will probably need a parse tree. In which, I do not think that a complete implementation is proper to be pasted here. I'd suggest that you check out one of the infamous " Dragon book ". But if you just want precedence support , then you could do that by first converting the expression to postfix form in which an algorithm that you can copy-and-paste should be available from google or I think you can code it up yourself with a binary tree. When you have it in postfix form, then it's piece of cake from then on since you already understand how the stack helps.
