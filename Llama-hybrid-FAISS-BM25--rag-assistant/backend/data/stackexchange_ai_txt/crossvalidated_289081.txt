Principal Components Analysis Terminology

I've been studying PCA, and some of the terminology isn't very clear. I do not understand what they mean when they refer to a "principal component". One definition I have seen calls it the new coordinates after the transformation the original data. Another calls these new coordinates the principal component scores. Clarification would be greatly appreciated.
