Your code looks correct. Are you sure your folder testfolder is included in your build? If not, your call to pathForResource: ofType: inDirectory: will return nil. And according to the documentation of the NSURL class , passing nil for the parameter of the fileURLWithPath: class method produces an exception. To check that your folder is included in your build process, expand the 'Copy Bundle Resources' build phase, and look for your folder. If it is not there, drag and drop it into it. A way to check that you added it correctly is to navigate to your builded application, right click on it and select the "Show Package Contents" item.
