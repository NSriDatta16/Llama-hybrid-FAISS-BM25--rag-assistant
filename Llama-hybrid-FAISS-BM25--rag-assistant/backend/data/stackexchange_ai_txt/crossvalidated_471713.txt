Consider a binomial model instead of a model with several independent Bernoulli trials. Each row contains a summary: number of trials and number of successes for each combination of independent variables. Maximum likelihood logistic regression can be modified to take the sample size and number of successes as inputs. The scenario given in the question is similar to the summarized form of binomial logistic regression where each input combination is repeated several times. Therefore, each row will have sample size and number of observations for each class of the multinomial distribution. Now multinomial logistic regression can be used as @EdM suggested. The predicted output will be a probability distribution over the set of possible outcome classes (age 65). It is similar to applying multinomial logistic regression on a data set with observations repeated several times (total = sample size) with cumulative relative frequencies of outcomes matching the observed probabilities.
