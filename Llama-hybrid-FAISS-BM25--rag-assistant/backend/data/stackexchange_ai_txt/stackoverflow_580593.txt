Porting from MS Access

I've recently been given a MS Access .mdb database file and asked to make it usable in a Linux system. What I'm looking for is a way to convert the Access database to an open-source database such as MySQL or PostGres. I don't have MS Office, and it's a one-time project for a volunteer organization so I don't want to spend money if it's avoidable. I'm running Vista x64, and have a Linux virtualbox, so something usable in either one will be good.
