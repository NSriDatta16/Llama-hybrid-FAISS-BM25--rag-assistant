@Firefeather: Does your data contain (and can only really ever contain) only positive values? If so, model it using a generalized linear model with gamma error and log link. If it contains zeros then you could consider a two stage (logistic regression for probability of zero and gamma regression for the positive values). This latter scenario can also be modeled as a single regression using a zero inflated gamma. Some great explanations of this were given on a SAS list a few years ago. Start here if interested and search for follow-ups. link text Might help point you in another direction if the truncated regression turns out implausible.
