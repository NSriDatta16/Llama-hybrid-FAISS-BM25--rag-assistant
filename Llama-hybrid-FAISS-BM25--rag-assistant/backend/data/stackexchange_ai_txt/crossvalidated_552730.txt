Struggling to find a good Instrumental Variable for Housing Tenure (Social housing)

As part of some research, i am examining the impact of living in social housing on youth violence at a borough level (London). The explanatory variable (social housing) clearly exhibits endogeneity but I can't seem to find a relevant IV. I considered using Average Property price but I'm not sure if this satisfies the exogeneity condition. Any help would be appreciated.
