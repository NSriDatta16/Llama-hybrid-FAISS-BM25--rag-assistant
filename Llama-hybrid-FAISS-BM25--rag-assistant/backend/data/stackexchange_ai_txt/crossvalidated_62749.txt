This appears to be a variation on a classification problem. Given your data, you want to be able to classify projects as active (i.e. the poster cares about them) or inactive (i.e the poster doesn't care about them). Now if I understand your description correctly you have data on projects that have been completed (and you definitely know that they have been completed), and you have data on projects that have not been completed. What you don't know is if the projects that have not been completed are active or inactive, and you want to be able to figure that out. Immediately two possible approaches come to mind. The first is treating this as a standard classification problem with a latent (or unobserved) grouping. Personally, if I was pursuing this approach I would start by examining the distributions of the variables for your not yet completed projects, and see if there was any clustering. After I examined that, I would probably assign labels, and then just run a logistic regression. However, I think that a different approach might be a bit more fruitful. This problem might be able to be treated as a survival analysis problem. I am much less familiar with survival analysis, so I can't tell you exactly what I would do. In a nutshell, survival analysis builds a model that describes the amount of time until an event (such as death), given other covariates. What you have here is a problem that is asking, can we predict which projects die (are completed), and which projects never die. It is a slight variation on classic survival analysis, seeing that one group never dies, but it might be something to look into.
