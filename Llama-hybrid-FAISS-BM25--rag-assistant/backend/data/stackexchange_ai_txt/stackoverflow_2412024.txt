I 've never worked with Tomcat but I find it hard to imagine it wouldn't serve changed JS files straight awayafter deployment. My guess is this is a caching issue on the browser's side. Can you try to force a refresh by opening the actual CSS file and pressing F5 ? The usual approach to making sure a JS file gets updated is embedding it with a GET parameter that marks the version/revision: when you update the script's revision, and change the GET parameter, the browser should forget the cached version and re-load the file.
