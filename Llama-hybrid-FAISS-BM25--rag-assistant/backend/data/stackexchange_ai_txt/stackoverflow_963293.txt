Best practice is to try it both ways, see which way works best for your organization, then do it that way. Occasionally try it the other way to see if anything has changed. That way you get a solution tailored to your situation without worrying about ephemeral transitory things like "best practice". As you can probably tell, I'm not a big fan of rules being handed down from on-high. Don't get me wrong, if something proves to be an advantage, I'll use it (agile, for instance, since it focuses you on immediate deliverables). But it has to be proven in the environment you work in, otherwise it's just something that worked for someone else.
