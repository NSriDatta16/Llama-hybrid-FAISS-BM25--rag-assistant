Kia ora. Boredom compels me to provide an answer on this topic. Layer part (i.e. @interface GetMyTouches : CCLayer): -(void) ccTouchesMoved:(NSSet *)inappropriateTouches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touchMyMinge = [inappropriateTouches anyObject]; CGPoint currentTouchArea = [touchMyMinge locationInView:[touchMyminge view] ]; CGPoint lastTouchArea = [touchMyMinge previousLocationInView:[touchMyMinge view]]; // flip belly up. no one likes being entered from behind. currentTouchArea = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:currentTouchArea]; lastTouchArea = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:lastTouchArea]; // throw to console my inappropriate touches NSLog(@"current x=%2f,y=%2f",currentTouchArea.x, currentTouchArea.y); NSLog(@"last x=%2f,y=%2f",lastTouchArea.x, lastTouchArea.y); // add my touches to the naughty touch array naughtyTouchArray addObject:NSStringFromCGPoint(currentTouchArea)]; naughtyTouchArray addObject:NSStringFromCGPoint(lastTouchArea)]; } Node part (i.e. @interface DrawMyTouch: CCNode) : @implementation DrawMyTouch -(id) init { if( (self=[super init])) { } return self; } -(void)draw { glEnable(GL_LINE_SMOOTH); for(int i = 0; i Layer part II (i.e. @interface GetMyTouches : CCLayer): -(void) ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { DrawMyTouch *line = [DrawMyTouch node]; [self addChild: line]; } Remember touching is easy. Knowing what you're doing while touching isn't rocket science. Finally, if you don't understand anything i've posted ... take up baking. The world needs more chocolate cake producers. Clarification: No one learns from cut 'n paste ~ this code was never meant to work without caressing If you fail to see the humour, you're in the wrong profession Of note, I love a good chocolate cake. The world really does need more fantastic bakers. That's not an insult, that's encouragement.
