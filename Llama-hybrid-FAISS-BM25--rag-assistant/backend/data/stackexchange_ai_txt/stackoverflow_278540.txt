Best process for auto-zipping of multiple MP3s

I've got a project which requires a fairly complicated process and I want to make sure I know the best way to do this. I'm using ASP.net C# with Adobe Flex 3. The app server is Mosso (cloud server) and the file storage server is Amazon S3. The existing site can be viewed at NoiseTrade.com I need to do this: Allow users to upload MP3 files to an album "widget" After the user has uploaded their album/widget, I need to automatically zip the mp3 (for other users to download) and upload the zip along with the mp3 tracks to Amazon S3 I actually have this working already (using client side processing in Flex) but this no longer works because of Adobe's flash 10 "security" update. So now I need to implement this server-side. The way I am thinking of doing this is: Store the mp3 in a temporary folder on the app server When the artist "publishes" create a zip of the files in that folder using a c# library Start the amazon S3 upload process (zip and mp3s) and email the user when it is finished (as well as deleting the temporary folder) The major problem I see with this approach is that if a user deletes or adds a track later on I'll have to update the zip file but the temporary files will not longer exist. I'm at a loss at the best way to do this and would appreciate any advice you might have. Thanks!
