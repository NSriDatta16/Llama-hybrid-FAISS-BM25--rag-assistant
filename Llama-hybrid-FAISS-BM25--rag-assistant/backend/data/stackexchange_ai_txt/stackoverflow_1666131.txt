You might setup two tomcat instances with an Apache mod_proxy_balancer in front of it, as described here . For a redeployment of the application a "rolling upgrade" strategy might be applied (assuming app1 and app2 are your two tomcat instances): Disable tomcat@app1 in Apache's balancer-manager Redeploy application to tomcat@app1 Do some testing with app1 and see if everything works Enable tomcat@app1 in balancer-manager Disable tomcat@app2 in balancer-manager Redeploy application to tomcat@app2 Enable tomcat@app2 in balancer-manager And you're done. You don't need multiple physical or virtual machines for doing so - it's also possible on a single box. If your application upgrade implies database changes, be careful. The above might be encapsulated e.g. in an gant script , so a simple "grails cluster-redeploy" does everything you need. Such a script is currently on my list, but I have no idea when this will be finished.
