How can I use PIVOT to show simultationly average and count in its cells?

Looking at the syntax I get the strong impression, that PIVOT doesn't support anything beyond a single aggregate function to be calculated for a cell. From statistical view showing just some averages without giving the number of cases an average refers to is very unsatisfying ( that is the polite version ). Is there some nice pattern to evaluate pivots based on avg and pivots based on count and mix them together to give a nice result?
