After trying a number of overcomplicated ways to solve this I've done a small hack for my problem: after I insert/remove a row I call setRowHidden to hide the first n rows. This is not the most elegant solution and is particular for my needs, but I am unable to find a better alternative. I like to mention that on gtk, because the filter and the sort proxy models are separated, this can be done fairly easy. I'm still hoping someone can provide a better solution to this.
