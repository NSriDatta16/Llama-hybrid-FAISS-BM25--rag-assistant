How to make a reward function in reinforcement learning?

While studying Reinforcement Learning, I have come across many forms of the reward function: $R(s,a)$ , $R(s,a,s')$ , and even a reward function that only depends on the current state. Having said that, I realized it is not very easy to 'make' or 'define' a reward function. Here are my questions: Are there rules on how to make reward functions? Are there other forms of the reward function? For example, a polynomial form perhaps that depends on the state?
