Can silhouette be calculated with distances to centroids, instead of pairwise point distances?

I am using Silhouette cluster validation for each repetition (for a specific K) of k-means, k-modes and k-medoids. All the definitions of Silhouette I see calculate the distance of each point to others points within the same cluster , then compare it to the distance of the same point with points in other clusters, in turn. From wikipedia: $ a(i) = $ average distance between point $i$ and other points in the same cluster $ b(i) = $ average distance between point $i$ and all points in the closest cluster $ s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max\{a(i),b(i)\}} $ I would expect similar results by, instead, comparing each point with its own centroid, and then the centroids of other clusters, in turn . Is this a good approach, or do I risk losing information? It's much more efficient computationally (with my dataset, it's a concern).
