I use bits when appropriate. Aside from it being semantically the correct type (semantics count!), multiple bit fields (up to 8) in a single row (on SQL Server, anyway) can be consolidated into a single byte of storage. After the eighth, an additional byte is needed for the next 8, and so on. References: SQL 2000 SQL 2005 SQL 2008
