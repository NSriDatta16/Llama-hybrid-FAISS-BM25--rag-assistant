is_a? and dRuby objects

I'm working with dRuby and basicly I'm calling a remote method that returns me an object. In the clientside I have this code: handle_error(response) if response.is_a?(Error) where response is the DRbObject. (I've developed this code before using dRuby and I'm returning an Error object if something went wrong). The problem is that now response.is_a?(Error) comes back with "false" because the object is actually a DRbObject. Any idea on how I can check the class of my application object? Thanks! Roberto
