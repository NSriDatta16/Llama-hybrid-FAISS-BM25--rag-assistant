Python: How can I modify dictionary values in a for loop alternating the keys?

I am new to Python (and to programming). I'd like to modify a dictionary in a for loop by alternating the key of the dictionary. I wrote the following code, which was unsccessful, however: #coding: utf-8 dict1 = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'} dict2 = dict.fromkeys(dict1.values(),[]) for key in dict2: if key == 'value1': dict2[key].extend(['test1', 'test2']) elif key == 'value2': dict2[key].extend(['test3', 'test4']) elif key == 'value3': dict2[key].extend(['test5', 'test6']) print (dict2['value1']) print (dict2['value3']) I expected the results to be: ['test5', 'test6'] ['test1', 'test2'] but I actually got: ['test5', 'test6', 'test3', 'test4', 'test1', 'test2'] ['test5', 'test6', 'test3', 'test4', 'test1', 'test2'] I guess the problem might come from my making the dictionary from another dictionary using "dict.fromkeys", but I couldn't see why it is problematic even if it is the case. Thanks for your attention. Looking forward to your suggestions.
