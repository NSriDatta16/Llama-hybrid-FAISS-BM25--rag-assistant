Delphi 2010 WriteLn to TextFile cutting off around 55 characters

Given this mess (designed years ago to write some data out csv "field1","field2") the output file has began stopping around 55 characters. Same happens in a showmessage() call or placing inside a local String variable. Converting to a TStringList to clean the code up even fails in the same way. Inspecting this as a local string variable in the IDE while the code is stopped shows the entire built string as planned. ShowMessage() even puts trailing ellipsis ... on the end. I end up with "LD","BC63781S","JACKSON","MS","DENVER","CO","1186","0"... in showmessage and "LD","BC63781S","JACKSON","MS","DENVER","CO","1186","0" in the on disk file.
