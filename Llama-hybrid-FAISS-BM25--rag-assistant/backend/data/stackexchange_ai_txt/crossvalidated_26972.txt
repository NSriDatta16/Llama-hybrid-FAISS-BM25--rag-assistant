Estimate in presence of missing observations

I'm trying to estimate a parameter based on its past history. However, I do not have the observed data at every point of time. To illustrate the scenario, consider a group of N people where each person estimates how many email the remaining N-1 persons would receive the next day. These people meet infrequently; when X meets Y, they only exchange the count of emails received yesterday i.e. no historic data is available. Would it be right to use exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) in this case? $$ \hat{X}_t = a * X_t + (1 - a) * \hat{X}_{t-1} $$ To be precise: I'm trying to estimate (or rather, forecast) a value based on historical values where some observations could be missing. I could use either EWMA of Kalman filter (or anything else) -- point is which method would be robust in case of such missing observations ?
