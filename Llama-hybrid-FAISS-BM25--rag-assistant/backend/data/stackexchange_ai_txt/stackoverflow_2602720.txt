Can JAXB Incrementally Marshall An Object?

I've got a fairly simple, but potentially large structure to serialize. Basically the structure of the XML will be: ... main_object_type repeats up to 5,000 times The main_object_type can have a significant amount of data. On my first 3,500 record extract, I had to give the JVM way more memory than it should need. So, I'd like to write out to disk after each (or a bunch of) main_object_type . I know that setting Marshaller.JAXB_FRAGMENT would allow it fragments, but I loose the outer xml document tags and the . Any suggestions?
