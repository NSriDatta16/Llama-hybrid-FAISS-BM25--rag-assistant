Variables derived from factor analysis as a response variable in logistic regression

I have a dataset derived from a questionnaire filled out by high school students, with 7 variables (one continuous and six binary). Three variables(binary) are related to "interest in physics". Is it possible, after having derived the new variable "Interest in physics" from the three original variables, to then perform a multivariate logistic regression with the new variable "interest in physics" as the response variable?
