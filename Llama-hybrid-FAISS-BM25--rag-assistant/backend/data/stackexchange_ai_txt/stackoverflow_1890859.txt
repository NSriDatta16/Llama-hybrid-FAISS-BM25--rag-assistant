As an alternate option, if you need to unpack and save the files on the users machine (say a chm file you want accessible outside your app) you can also do the same with zip files. You said you wanted the file to be "Dragged" onto your app. Simply have your DDE events check to see if the file is a zip (maybe even using something like a jar with metadata) and unpack the necessary files, including the actual plugin. This is the same idea as openxml docs, they are really just zips in disguise.
