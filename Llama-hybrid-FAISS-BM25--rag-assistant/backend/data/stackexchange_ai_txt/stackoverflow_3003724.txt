Can't click allow button in flash on firefox

I have a webapp embedding some flash content in an iframe. The flash part is requesting access to the webcam. On firefox/mac os, user's can't click the allow button. This only happens when the page embedding the swf file is loaded in the iframe, it works fine when laded separately. Has anyone else faced a similar problem? Do you know any workarounds? EDIT: For future reference: we were positioning some stuff via JS and we had positions using "half pixels" (e.g. 20.5px). Once we fixed that everything worked fine.
