PHP MySql display returned content without html tags being stripped

I have a column in SQL 'Text' datatype and inside I have content within html tag, eg somecontent: one two ... I want the mysql query to echo out the databases contents without stripping the html tags (its possible this is done by php for security reasons or?) so that the html code will render if you get me? At the moment it just lumps out a paragraph which looks aweful! It should be noted security is not much of a concern as this is a project and not going to be exposed publicly Cheers folks Nick
