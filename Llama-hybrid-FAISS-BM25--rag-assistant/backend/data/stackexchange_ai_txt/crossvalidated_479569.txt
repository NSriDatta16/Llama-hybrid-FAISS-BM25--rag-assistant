Optimization of hyperparameters and parameters

As far as I understand, in Machine Learning there are 2 moments for optimization. Before training the model there is the optimization of the hyperparameters to find the best configuration of the model before really training the model (please correct me if I am wrong). The second moment is the optimization of the parameters. The optimization of the parameters are only possible when we have an active learning model, or an online machine Learning model? And the optimization of the parameters adjust the same coefficients as the ones during the optimization of the hyperparameters?
