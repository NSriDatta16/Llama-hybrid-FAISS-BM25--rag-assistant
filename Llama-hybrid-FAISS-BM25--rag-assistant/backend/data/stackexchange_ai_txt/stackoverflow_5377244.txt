It depends on what do you expect from your language. For example I am developing firmware for embedded device. I can boot Linux in it and do my work in Python, but I need really fast code tuned for the hardware, so I use C on bare metal (without operating system). On the other hand, I need to develop many programs for my PC communicating with that device, mainly for developing and testing purposes. I don't need this programs to be tuned, I don't even need them to run fast. I just need them to be created quickly and to be robust and safe - so I use Python. EDIT: When picking a language, I think you should read Beating the Averages
