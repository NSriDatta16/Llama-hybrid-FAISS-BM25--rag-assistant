How are random forest and extremely randomized trees split differently?

For random forest, we split the node by Gini impurity or entropy for a set of features. The RandomForestClassifier in sklearn, we can choose to split by using Gini or Entropy criterion. However, what I read about Extra-Trees Classifier, a random value is selected for the split (I guess then there is nothing to do with Gini or Entropy). The ExtraTreesClassifier from sklearn has the option to choose Gini or Entropy for the split. I am a little bit confused here.
