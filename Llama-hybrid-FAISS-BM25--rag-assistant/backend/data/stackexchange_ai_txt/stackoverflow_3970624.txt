You're right, everything can be tunnel through an HTTP POST. In fact, SOAP web services do exactly that. Everything is a POST using SOAP web services. In that case, you are tunneling through HTTP, and not using HTTP to its fullest. If that's all you want to do, then that's fine. However, if you wish to leverage HTTP for the features and benefits that it provides beyond simple message transport, then you should read the RFC and learn the rest of the HTTP protocol including GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, and all of the headers, cache management and result codes.
