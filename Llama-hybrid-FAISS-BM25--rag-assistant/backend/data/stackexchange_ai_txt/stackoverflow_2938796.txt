Using different models to handle User (a model that handle basic authentication) and Account (a model that holds all the informations about what a user can do, how , ...) could give you some plus: storing User's data using a secondary storage system exposing higher security level restricting User's data access by other application artifacts (models, controllers, whatever) making code review and security audit easier I tend to add personal informations (real name, phone number, ...) to the the User model while exposing operational data about the user in the Account model (nickname, bio, ...).
