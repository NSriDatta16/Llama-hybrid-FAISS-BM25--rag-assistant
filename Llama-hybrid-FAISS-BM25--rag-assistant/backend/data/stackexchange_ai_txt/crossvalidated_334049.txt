Use of random noise in Generative adversarial networks

I was reading Image to Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks . On its third page, it states that Without z, the net could still learn a mapping from x to y, but would produce deterministic outputs, and therefore fail to match any distribution other than a delta function. Here z is the random noise given to the generator as input. x refers to the labels fed as input for Conditional Adversarial Networks. Can somebody please explain the above paragraph.
