I'd reconsider using a speech recognition library... like CMU's Sphinx software or Microsoft's speech recognizer . Unfortunately, its not a simple task to do this on your own. One approach that is somewhat typical of how to accomplish what you are trying to do is as follows: 1) Chop the sample into small segments (a few miliseconds) 2) Fourier transform on each segment, collect the principal coefficients 3) use a Hidden Markov Model to figure out the likely transition of phonemes given your sequence of coefficients 4) map to a dictionary depicting phonemes to words (you could look at the Sphinx dictionary as a guide)... a small set like yours should produce excellent results. If you wanted to simplify this somewhat, you might try taking the coefficients at specific timesteps and feeding them into an SVM or neural network... I haven't tried this yet but bet you could get reasonable results with some tuning.
