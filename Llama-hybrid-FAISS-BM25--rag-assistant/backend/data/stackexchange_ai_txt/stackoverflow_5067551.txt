md5 in http with range

Imagine a user asks for Rage: bytes=2-5 of a 10-byte file. What MD5 sum has to be served to the user? The MD5 sum of all 10 bytes or only of the partial content, bytes 2-5? RFC2616 Section 14.15 reads: The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body. If the message is received with a transfer-encoding, that encoding MUST be removed prior to checking the Content-MD5 value against the received entity. How must I interpret that? I ask this because I would refrain from adding md5sums to partial content, iff it has to be re-generated for each range-request.
