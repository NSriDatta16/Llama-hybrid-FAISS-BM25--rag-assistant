You can check the User-Agent string. In JavaScript, that's really easy, it's just a property of the navigator object. var useragent = navigator.userAgent; You can check if the device if iPhone or Blackberry in JS with something like var isIphone = !!agent.match(/iPhone/i), isBlackberry = !!agent.match(/blackberry/i); if isIphone is true you are accessing the site from an Iphone, if isBlackBerry you are accessing the site from a Blackberry. You can use "UserAgent Switcher" plugin for firefox to test that.
