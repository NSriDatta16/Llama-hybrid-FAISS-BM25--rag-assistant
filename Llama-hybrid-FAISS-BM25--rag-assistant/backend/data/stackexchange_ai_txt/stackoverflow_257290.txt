A project I did a couple of years ago achieved 100% line coverage but I had total control over it so I could enforce the target. We've now got an objective to have 50% of new code covered, a figure that will rise in the near future, but no way to measure it. We will soon have tools in place to measure code coverage on every nightly run of the unit tests, so I'm convinced our position will improve.
