Classes of neural nets and their applications

Would you say, you could design, tune and/or train any DNN for any application, or do their designs inherently postulate some specialization? Is there such a review? For example, are CNNs better for the spatial domain (e.g image analysis), and RNN for temporal (e.g. time series data, or speech), or it does not matter?
