"ignoring" non-competing risks or censoring that datapoint

Although another post has raised a similar question - survival analysis with external non-competing events , my question seems slightly different and not addressed by the answers within the post. Example: A statistical analysis plan of a breast cancer study that investigates the efficacy of a new drug X stated that "competing risk survival analysis" would be used to estimate overall survival as multiple competing (new) risks were expected to emerge during the trial. For example, a patient might develop a new skin cancer (radiation-induced skin cancer) after she was treated by radiation therapy for her breast cancer (but before she was treated by the new drug X). As the new skin cancer may impact her survival, but new skin cancer is not relevant to the efficacy (or toxicity) of new drug X, new skin cancer could be considered a "competing risk" and patient's overall survival needs to take this "variable" into account. This seems sensible. However, let's assume patients may also develop a new breast tissue pathology in the other (normal) breast when she was also being treated by new drug X for her breast cancer. Assuming that this new breast tissue pathology occurs at a high frequency in an average woman and is known not to have any impact on breast cancer patient survival. As the disease organ is breast, the study plan needs to preemptively address this type of potential events. From the medical literature, there are at least two different approaches to this type of event: ignore the occurrence of the event and continue to follow patient's subsequent development in terms of survival censor this patient and do not follow her subsequent development in terms of survival I can vaguely grasp the thinking process of point 2, but have no idea if point 1 is statistically justifiable. Q1. can "time-varying covariate" be used to account for this type of "non-event" events, although this time-varying covariate model seems to assume (layman's understanding) that the non-event plays a "covariate role" to the final (survival) outcome? Q2. does point 1 stand when we assume these "non-events" truly do not affect the survival?
