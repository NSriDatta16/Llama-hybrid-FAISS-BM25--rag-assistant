How to encode & scale IP addresses as input for ML models

Im currently working on an anomaly detection while making a transaction. As a part of the data that I extracted, I have the IP addresses of the indivduals who made the transaction. Since the IP Address doesn't have a coherent meaning behind it and it is arbitrary but it indeed acts as a good indicator for user activity. So my question is how can I convert these IP addresses into input which can be used as input for machine learning purposes (which is suitable for data preprocessing such as encoding and PCA). I know tools like OneHot encoding can do the trick however OneHotEncoder can create multi dimensional data and it gets complex if the dataset is huge + standardizing/normalizing it, is painful. So I'm looking for a better way to encode IP addresses.
