$\qquad\qquad\qquad$ This is a well-documented issue with mixture modelling, although in your case of having only the means unknown, they are identifiable when the weights in the mixture differ from $(1/2,1/2)$ . A first branch of results in this area follow the 1963 paper of Teicher . And indeed a plain Bayesian approach under exchangeable prior assumptions cannot handle using a posterior mean since both marginals are identical. Another branch of results attempts at restricting the parameter space to make it identifiable. From strong truncation imposing ordering to representing the posterior as a point process as described in the first chapter by Peter Green in our very recent Handbook of Mixture Analysis , to isolate a single mode in the posterior distribution by fighting label switching , as also discussed in this X validated question , and advocated by Geweke (2007) .
