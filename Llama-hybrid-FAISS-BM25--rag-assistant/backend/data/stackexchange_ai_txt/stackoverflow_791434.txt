Magento 1.3 - Left Hand Menu

I'm wondering does anybody have a solution to enable the left hand menu in Magento 1.3. I've located the file i would like to use at design/frontend/default/default/template/catalog/navigation/left.phtml but am unsure how to customise my template to enable it. The tutorials i've found seem to relate to earlier versions of magento. EDIT- I tried that solution but it only moves the callout elements in my view, the catelog menu still appears at the top of the page and not on the left hand pane.
