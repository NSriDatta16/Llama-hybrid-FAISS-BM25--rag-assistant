Data Matching Using Machine Learning

I have around 4000 customer records and 6000 user records and about 3000 customer records match leaving 1000 unmatched customers. I have created a fuzzy matching algorithm using Levenshtein and Hamming and added weights to certain properties, but I want to be able to match the remaining records without manually doing this. Ideally I want to implement an algorithm to take a customer and user and output match/no match. However, wouldn't I need to train with true negatives? Is there an algorithm that can train with just 1 label? Thanks
