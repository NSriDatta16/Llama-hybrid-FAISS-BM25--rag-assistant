That's normal behavior. Your StartTask action blocks until it completes. It doesn't return any response until the DoIt method has finished executing. I suppose that's why you are calling it with AJAX $.post . The problem is that while this method runs and writes to the session and all other requests from the same session will be queued by the ASP.NET engine. You cannot write and read from the session at the same time. You will have to find another thread-safe storage for the progress data other than the session.
