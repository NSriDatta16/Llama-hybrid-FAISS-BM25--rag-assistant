The question is misguided. The problem is not one of speed, it's one of code organization. Using only global functions and variables, and lots of them, it'll get harder and harder to avoid naming conflicts and keep everything organized. Classes help you package and abstract things. Execution speed is a secondary concern, and in most cases won't increase noticeably, if at all. Development speed though can increase significantly over time, since you'll have to deal less with conflicts.
