Logistic regression intercept representing baseline probability

In a linear regression, when you standardize your numeric variables, the resulting intercept has the same value as the mean of your sample. Is there any way in a logistic regression, with numeric continuous variables, to have the intercept to express the odd-ratios of the baseline probability in the data (average probability of response)?
