Make sure File's Owner is set to an actual class (look in the identity inspector). Next make sure that you have an IBOutlet for the button. @interface Foo { IBOutlet UIButton *button; } Then ctrl-drag from the File's Owner node to the button (either in the view heirarchy or the actual screen). If you still can't select the button, then either the types don't match or perhaps the toolbar is just simulated...?
