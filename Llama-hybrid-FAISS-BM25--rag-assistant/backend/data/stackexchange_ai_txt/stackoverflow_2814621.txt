Some fun projects could be: Make a website about something you like or do. Help out a friend and make a website about something he/she likes or does... Help out an small organisation / shop in you neighbourhood (for example a restaurant, a shop, a cafe, a radio station ...) by making their website. Maybe you could get some free beer or food in return :-)
