100 GB/day is not a number you need to worry about. It's an average of slightly over 1 MBYte/sec. You could get that over old Ethernet, to put that in perspective. Now, your actual peak throughput will be a lot higher, perhaps 10 MByte/s. Still, this is no problem at all for a modern server. So, I don't think you need those multiple servers, so that's no reason for splitting the 10MB downloads. And if you're downloading from a single server, why would you insert 19 disconnect-and-reconnect sequences in the middle of a 10MB download?
