An excerpt from Box 1 in the article " A deep learning framework for neuroscience ", by Blake A. Richards et. al. (among the authors is Yoshua Bengio): The concept of credit assignment refers to the problem of determining how much ‘credit’ or ‘blame’ a given neuron or synapse should get for a given outcome. More specifically, it is a way of determining how each parameter in the system (for example, each synaptic weight) should change to ensure that $\Delta F \ge 0$ . In its simplest form, the credit assignment problem refers to the difficulty of assigning credit in complex networks. Updating weights using the gradient of the objective function, $\nabla_WF(W)$ , has proven to be an excellent means of solving the credit assignment problem in ANNs. A question that systems neuroscience faces is whether the brain also approximates something like gradient-based methods. $F$ is the objective function, $W$ are the synaptic weights, and $\Delta F = F(W+\Delta W)-F(W)$ .
