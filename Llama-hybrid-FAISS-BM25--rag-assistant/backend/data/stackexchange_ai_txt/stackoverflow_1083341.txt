The easiest way to be able to let those icons affect the width of the text is to have them precede it (they're absolutely positioned anyway), and to give text itself a container as well (I'm pretty sure you need that, whichever way you do it). So you end up with this: This is some text that should have overflow that is hidden. This is some text that should have overflow that is hidden. This is some text that should have overflow that is hidden. Here's the only new CSS you need to make that work (in addition to the CSS in the question): .text { overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; } .flag ~ .text { width: 183px; } .circle ~ .text { width: 168px; } .star ~ .text { width: 154px; } The .text rule is the same as the .line div you used for your own working example. The real "magic" happens in those last rules, and they're the reason I moved the image divs up. That allows you to use the CSS3 sibling selector to set the width of the .text div based on the presence of the icons. You can simply let the CSS cascade take care of the width by listing the icon classes in right-to-left order. As a side note, I do have to say that there are rather a lot of divs here, so there's no indication of what it actually means. Your first concern should always be to create semantic HTML. I'd probably want to put the text in paragraph tags and the icons in a list, and give each list item a textual description as well (hiding it with CSS). Then again, maybe that's not actually appropriate (and maybe the icon divs should really come after the text); I can't tell. And if the icons go in a list, the sibling selector will need some help...
