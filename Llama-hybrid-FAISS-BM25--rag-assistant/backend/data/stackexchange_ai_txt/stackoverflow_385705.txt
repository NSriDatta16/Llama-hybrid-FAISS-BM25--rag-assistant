ASP.NET : Intermittent 'Access Denied' Error When Uploading Files

I have a .NET program to upload an image to a webserver. I am using the ASP.NET file uploading control to do it. The program works alright in my local environment but when I run it on the webserver, I get the following error: > System.UnauthorizedAccessException: > Access to the path > '\\fsvs02\target03\352972\352974\www.mysite.com\web\content\Images\TempStorage\tempImage.jpg' > is denied. > at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 > errorCode, String maybeFullPath) > at System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, > FileMode mode, FileAccess access, > Int32 rights, Boolean useRights, > FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, > FileOptions options, > SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs, String > msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy) > at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String > path, FileMode mode) > at System.Web.HttpPostedFile.SaveAs(String > filename) > at uploadimage.UploadImage() A quick Google search confirmed that it is a permissions issue; but since it only happens intermittently, I don't have a plan for diagnosing how to fix it. My question is: What should I do to diagnose and fix this issue?
