Logistic regression where dummy dependent variable is heavily clustered at '0'

As the title suggests, the distribution of my DV is as follows: 0=4,230; 1=41. There are 9 primary IVs I'd like to regress it on as well as 7 CVs. Something tells me that the skew in my DV will compromise any test of significance/effects. Is this true? And, if so, how should I proceed in this situation? Thanks in advance for the help!
