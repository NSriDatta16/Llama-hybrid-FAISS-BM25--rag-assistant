When searching Youtube using the Data API, how can I exclude videos that cannot be played externally?

The Youtube API will return videos that can be played no problem within the chromeless player. It also returns videos that cannot be played, - "Embedding disabled by request". I don't want to retrieve videos that cannot be played, is there a way to request only videos that can be embedded? cheers
