It's usually not necessary to initialize COM in .NET -- unless you've done some native things such as P/Invoking. Using IDispatch does not require explicit initialization of COM. I think you're just dead locking somewhere. Fire up your debugger, when it hangs, break in, and type Monitor.TryEnter(...) for each of the object that you can lock ( actionsToRun , results and others). BTW, you should really consider restructuring your application to not use Excel concurrently -- even if you do some kind of "serialization". Even if you get it work, it will come back and bite you forever. It's officially discouraged, and I speak from experience.
