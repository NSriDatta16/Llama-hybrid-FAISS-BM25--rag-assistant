Short answer: it's perfectly OK to just average across the four repititions, so you're left with a year x category (10 x 3) design. You can find plenty of examples of this in the psychology literature, where research participants often perform many repititions of a task, and their data is averaged together for ANOVA. It's not clear from your question whether your categorical variable is a repeated measure or not, which is another topic.
