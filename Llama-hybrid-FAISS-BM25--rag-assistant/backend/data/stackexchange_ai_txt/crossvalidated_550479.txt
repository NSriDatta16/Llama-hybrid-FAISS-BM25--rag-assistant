One way to answer your questions is to start by adding the corresponding argument indicating what the ellipses are. For example: ellipse.type = c("confidence") will made ellipses of confidence intervals and thus, the argument ellipse.level now indicates the confidence interval level set at 0.68. Another option for ellipse type is "convex", which will plot the convex hull. Another way of plotting individuals and their corresponding ellipses is using fviz_ellipses(), for example: fviz_ellipses(res.pca, treat, graph.type = "ggplot", ggtheme = theme_minimal(), pointsize=2, geom="point", palette = c("palegreen3","black") , ellipse.level = 0.95, ellipse.type = c("confidence"))
