If you put IBOutlet in there like that, it will allow you to link the item while you're in interface builder. Once you have the IBOutlet setup, you can open that class's nib and then select the File's Owner, then go to the inspector and drag a link from the Connections tab to the object. This let's you then make changes to the object in your class's code and it will change the linked object. So once you link "statusText" to a specific UILabel, you can then use statusText.text = @"new text" in your class's code to modify the item, for example. Also, IBAction allows you to make links in the same way. You can drag a connection from a control's event to the file owner and then select any method within that class that has IBAction as a return value.
