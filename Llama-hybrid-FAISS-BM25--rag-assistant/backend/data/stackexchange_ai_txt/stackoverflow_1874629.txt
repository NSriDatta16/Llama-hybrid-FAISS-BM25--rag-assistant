When you run an execution plan for the query using the DBMS_Xplan.Display method oracle will estimate (usually pretty reasonably) what size of temporary tablespace storage you would need to execute it. 2.2 Million rows may be irrelevant to the sort size by the way. the memory required for aggregate operations such as MAX and SUM are more related to the size of the result set than to the size of the source data. Providing a link to a jpg file stored on your pc does not count as having provided an execution plan, btw.
