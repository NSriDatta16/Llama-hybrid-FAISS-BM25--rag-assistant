Order-independent Deep Learning

I have a dataset with parallel time series. The column 'A' depends on columns 'B' and 'C'. The order (and the number) of dependent columns can change. For example: A B C 2022-07-23 1 10 100 2022-07-24 2 20 200 2022-07-25 3 30 300 How should I transform this data, or how should I build the model so the order of columns 'B' and 'C' ('A', 'B', 'C' vs 'A', C', 'B' ` ) doesn't change the result? I know about GCN, but I don't know how to implement it. Maybe there are other ways to achieve it. Thank you!
