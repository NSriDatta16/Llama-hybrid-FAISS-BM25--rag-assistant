The problem is that your C-cast is apparently creating a new object rather than upcasting as expected. Since this new object is a temporary it can't be bound to the non-const reference parameter to the parent's operator function. If you static_cast to a reference to the parent it should work: operator>>( s, static_cast &>(b));
