Any tool that can help on manually label a time series data please?

i am working with a 10 years weekly financial time series data set, which has the standard format date open high low close volume. i would like to manually label (classify) the data set with label/class uptrend,downtrend,buy,sell n etc in a new column. my question is whether there is any tool to help on this data processing work. For example, maybe the data can be loaded and plotted. i can then select a range (sequence)of data from the graph and give a label to it.
