Because the return is in the scope of the xmlhttp.onreadystatechange function and not your loadXML function. This is how asynchronous requests work, they run in the background while the code already continues. When the request is finished it calls a function, which is usually set on the onreadystatechange . So quick example; in FunctionA you start the XMLHTTP request, which on completion calls the onreadystatechange function that calls FunctionB with the responseText. If you want to have the code wait for a response, you need to use a synchronous request - however, doing so stalls the entire browser until the request finishes. So it's best to just adjust your code to what I wrote in the first paragraph.
