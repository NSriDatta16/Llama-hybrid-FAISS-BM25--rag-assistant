I want to launch a java subprocess, with the same java classpath and dynamically loaded classes as the current java process. You mean invoke a new JVM? Given that... it is possible to plug in all sorts of agents and instrumentation into a JVM that can transform classes at load time it is possible to take a byte array and turn it into a class it is possible to have complex class loader hierarchies with varying visibility between classes and have the same classes loaded multiple times ...there is no general, magic, catch-all and foolproof way to do this. You should design your application and its class loading mechanisms to achieve this goal. If you allow 3rd party plug-ins, you'll have to document how this works and how they have to register their libraries.
