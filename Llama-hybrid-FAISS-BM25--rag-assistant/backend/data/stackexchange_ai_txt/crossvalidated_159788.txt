This is very easy, you include a trend as a dependent variable (DV) in the regression. Simply plot y over the period, and decide on the appropriate trend. Say it is linear, then you include a DV that starts with 1 in the first periode, is 2 in the second period, and ends with 69 in the last period. If you decide on a qudratic trend, then include: $1^2$, $2^2$, ... , $69^2$. You could also do an exponential trend, basically what ever you can imagine. But linear, exponential and quadratic are normally the only ones needed. Infenrece does not change! And so the regression add-in in Excel will calculate the confidence level, and p-value the same as for any other DV. You might get a very large $R^2$, and you should not overstate the importance of this. EDIT: I might also add that, in most time series aplications it is wrong to not include a trend. Why? Because regression (espcially OLS/GLS) will pick up a strong relationship, but in reality you just a have trending (spurious) relationship.
