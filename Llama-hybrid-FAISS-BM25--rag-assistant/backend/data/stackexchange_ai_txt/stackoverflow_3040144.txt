There is no "lotus tag" unfortunately. Domino is designed to incorporate Lotus Notes data into web pages, but doesn't have a mechanism for easily including content from other sources into its HTTP response stream. You could write an agent in Domino to retrieve the HTML code produced by the jsp pages, save that content into a Notes Document, and then use that document's data to produce a page in Domino. If the content doesn't change frequently, you could consider it like using a caching system. The other idea that comes to mind is to use IFrames in the output from Domino, and include the jsp pages within those frames.
