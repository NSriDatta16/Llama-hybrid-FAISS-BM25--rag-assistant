Actually it depends on the development process that is used by the team/organization. In Agile (Scrum, XP and variations) processes there usually no requirements and acceptance tests are used to verify that user story is implemented correctly. So the User Story is some sort of requirement/specification. In Test Driven Development tests are the requirements. In Waterfall you usually create a document that lists all requirements for your software and approve it with stakeholders. Then you develop according to these requirements and test your software to accordance with them. As mentioned in the Frank's answer, with this process you need a traceability from a requirement to the test case, as CMMI mandates you to test all your requirements.
