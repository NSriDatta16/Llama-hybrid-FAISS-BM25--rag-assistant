Can anyone explain this paragraph of the current C++0x standard draft?

Can anyone explain this statement from ISO N3242 ยง3.2, 2nd point A non-placement allocation or deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-usedby the definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the lookup at the point of definitionof a virtual destructor (12.4).26 A copy-assignment function for a class is odr-used by an implicitly-defined copy-assignment function for another class as specified in 12.8. A move-assignment function for a class is odr-used by an implicitly-defined move-assignment function for another class as specified in 12.8. ISO Standard 2003 says: A copy-assignment function for a class is used by an implicitly-defined copy-assignment function for another class as specified in 12.8. What is the actual difference in these statements? Any one explain the above added point in terms of example/program...? I know move constructor / move assigment function -->new feature added . Can any one explain this with the help of an example/program? please............. please.......... answer
