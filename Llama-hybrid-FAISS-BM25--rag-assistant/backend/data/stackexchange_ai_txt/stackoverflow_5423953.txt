XSLT transform of XML document to XHTML document

Here's my template: Given a document like so: Item 1 Text Item 2 Text The above transform will turn it into: Item 1 Text Item 2 Text The problem I'm having, is that this transform doesn't respect text nodes properly, and I don't have enough background with XSLT to figure out how to fix it. Here's the problem: given xml like so: This is a paragraph people! I would like to see the following output: This is a paragraph people! The problem is that I'm not getting this - I'm getting this: This is a paragraph Notice the missing 'people!' text node. How can I fix my XSLT above to provide me with the output I need?
