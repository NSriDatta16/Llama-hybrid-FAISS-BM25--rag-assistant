Not sure where your statement comes from, but you need to consider the ideas behind the SVM and how it works to answer your question. Here is the summary: SVM approach is to actually map data to higher dimension space than the dataset has - to achieve better separability. You can refer to kernel trick article. SVM's advantage is that it works faster, and only samples near the boundary affect the separating hyperplane. Success of any model depends on proper parametrization, and in case of SVM - proper kernel choice. Here is an example of under- and overfitting of SVM from ISL book . You can read about regularization there too. As noted in comments - there is no free lunch, and same SVM setup can work for some problems and fail for the others. The only way is to perform several experiments and observe quality for yourself on specific datasets you've got.
