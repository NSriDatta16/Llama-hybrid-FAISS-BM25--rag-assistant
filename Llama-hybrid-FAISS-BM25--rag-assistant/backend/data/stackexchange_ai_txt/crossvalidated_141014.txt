Distribution of numbers affected by "round" numbers (ending in 0 or 5)

I have a large data set that I'd like to perform statistical analysis on, and I'm in the beginning stages of this process. This data set comes from a large sample of user inputs of integer values from 1-30(ish). I'd like to compute some basic statistics like mean and standard deviation, but I have an issue with the data. Because it comes from human input, people frequently select "round" numbers, such as 15 or 20, drastically skewing any results. Is there an elegant way to handle this problem? I'd imagine that I could perform some sort of averaging or smoothing on a histogram to approximate this, but that seems messy. I don't know of any process that handles something like this, but certainly someone has faced the problem before. Thanks!
