That syntax is called heredoc Basically, it's a way of writing a string without worrying about escaping quotes and so on. As you've mentioned, it doesn't really provide a lot of benefit over other string formats - although, it does mean you can write a block of HTML without escaping out of PHP with ?> It also isn't too popular as its use generally goes against the practice of seperating content from logic by embedding the content in the middle of your script.
