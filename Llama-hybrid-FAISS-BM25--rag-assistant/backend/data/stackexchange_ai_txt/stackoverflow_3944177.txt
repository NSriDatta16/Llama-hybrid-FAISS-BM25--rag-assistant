AS3: Referencing mc's from an array to then assign further array properties

I have a number of 'items' (mc's) contained in a scrolling mc that can be drag-dropped to other matching mc's. The items names are listed in an array and I wish to assign variables of suitability and feedback to each mc from the array also. I think this is called an associative array? Having some trouble correctly referencing the items from the array. To explain, here's a working script with a simple array and an inefficient workaround: var itemArray:Array = new Array("ball","box","hex"); //only a few items in this prototype scrollitems.ball.ifeedback = "Woo... hoo..."; scrollitems.box.ifeedback = "Great!"; scrollitems.hex.ifeedback = "Oops!"; scrollitems.ball.isuitable = true; scrollitems.box.isuitable = true; scrollitems.hex.isuitable = false; for (var i:int=0; i Here's a potentially better script using an associative array, but its not working as per CAP comments... var itemArray:Array = new Array[{iname:"ball",isuitable:true,ifeedback:"Well done!"}, {iname:"box",isuitable:true,ifeedback:"Great!"}, {iname:"hex",isuitable:false,ifeedback:"Oops!"}]; for (var i:int=0; i Any suggestions for the AS3 newbie?
