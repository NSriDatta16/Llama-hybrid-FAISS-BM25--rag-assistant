getElementById does not work on class names. You asked for jquery, why not use change() ? $('.quantity input').change(function() { alert('Input changed'); }); From the manual: The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to elements, boxes and elements. For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
