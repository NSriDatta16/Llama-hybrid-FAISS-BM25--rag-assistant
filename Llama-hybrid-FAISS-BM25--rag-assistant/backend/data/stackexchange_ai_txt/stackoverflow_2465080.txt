Using RestructuredText and Sphinx to include a preformatted file

I'm trying to make this fragment work: Version History --------------- These are the versions over time:: .. include:: ../../CHANGES.txt That is, use the include directive so that a file is included as a block quote. Once inside a block quote, the directive is quoted. I want the contents of the file in a block quote. Any idea how to do this?
