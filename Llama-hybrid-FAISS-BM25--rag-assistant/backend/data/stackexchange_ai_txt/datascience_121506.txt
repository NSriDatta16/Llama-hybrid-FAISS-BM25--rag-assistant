Questions on reproducibility of TimeGAN results

I am playing the timeGAN model, using the example code from ydata-synthetic repo. To train the model, we used synth.train(stock_data, train_steps=50000) to generate data, we used synth_data = synth.sample(len(stock_data)) One way to evaluate the synthetic data is to measure discriminative score . Ideally, high-quality synthetic data should be similar to real data. So if we build a post-hoc real/fake data classifier, the classifier should have difficulty to tell data is real or generated, thus accuracy ~ 0.5 and discriminative score ~ 0 . I have two questions: Does synth_data have the same time order as stock_data ? For example, synth_data[123] somehow is synthesized from stock_data[123] ? I doubted it since synth.sample(xxx) where xxx could be any number > real data size. Does anyone (using the timeGAN on the stock data) reproduce the discriminative score ~ 0.1 from the paper Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks ? I trained a model with 50000 iterations myself and confirmed all the results shown in the example code, except discriminative score. I used GRU or LSTM to build real data/fake data classifier, which can show high accuracy (> 0.9) such that the score > 0.4.
