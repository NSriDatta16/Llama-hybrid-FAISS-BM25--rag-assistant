QTMovieView not in pallet

I am trying to follow the QTKit tutorial . I add and include the QTKit framework and .h file. I create the QTMovie property. Then in IB I am supposed to drag out the QTMovieView from the library but it isn't there. If I go to the Classes tab, I can find it. However, when I drag it out, it doesn't have the attributes to set like movie source or anything... Any ideas?
