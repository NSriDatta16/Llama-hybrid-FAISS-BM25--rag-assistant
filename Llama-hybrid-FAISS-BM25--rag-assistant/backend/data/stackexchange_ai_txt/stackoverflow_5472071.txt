Delete an item in a listbox with a button, in wpf MVVM

I have a problem. It seems a simple thing but it isn't that easy. I have two listboxes, with objects in it. One is full with available objects and the other is empty, and I can fill this up with drag and drop. If you fill this empty listbox, the items are also added to a list of, this is a property of another object. But now my question is how I can easily delete an object in this listbox by clicking on a button. I tried something but it wouldn't run. Here is my xaml: here is my viewmodel: // other stuff and properties.. public ICommand Commands { get; set; } public bool CanExecute(object parameter) { return true; } public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged { add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; } remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; } } public void Execute(Object parameter) { foreach (ExaminationQuestion exaq in this.Examination.ExaminationQuestions) { if (exaq.Question.Guid == SelectedQuestionDropList.Guid) { this.Examination.ExaminationQuestions.Remove(exaq); SelectedQuestions.Remove(SelectedQuestionDropList); OnPropertyChanged("SelectedQuestions"); } } } can somebody please help me out?
