Meaning of "reconstruction error" in PCA and LDA

I am implementing PCA and LDA for compression and classification respectively (implementing both an LDA for compression and classification). I have the code written and everything works. What I need to know, for the report, is what the general definition of reconstruction error is. I can find a lot of math, and uses of it in the literature... but what I really need is a bird's eye view / plain word definition, so I can adapt it to the report.
