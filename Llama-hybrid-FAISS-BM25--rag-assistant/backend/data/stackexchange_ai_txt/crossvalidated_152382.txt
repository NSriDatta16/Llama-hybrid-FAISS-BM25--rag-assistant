Yes; however, it is problematic not for the learning algorithm per se but for interpretation: it assumes directional continuity (eg sample id 1500 is 50% 'greater' than sample id 1000), thereby becoming a meaningless pseudo-continuous variable. I tried to simulate this and it mattered for both IncMSE and NodePurity rankings. How much it would matter though would depend on your particular dataset. This seems a) unnecessary for random forests and b) incorrect for reasons specified above.
