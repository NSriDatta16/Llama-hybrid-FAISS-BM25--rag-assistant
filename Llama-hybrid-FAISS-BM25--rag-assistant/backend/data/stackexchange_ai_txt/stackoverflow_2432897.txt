How to set an event for all cells in WPF Datagrid

I need OnDragEnter event for every cell on my WPF Datagrid. I tried this : But doesn't seem to work. Any ideas people? Edit: Thanks for the responses, i realized that i was facing another problem though : My real problem was that the TextBox control always marks drag and drop events as handled so even if you set AllowDrop="True" it will look like AllowDrop is not working. It is not a bug, this behavior is actually by design. I used the Preview Events to anticipate to this, and be able to handle D'n'D events. Hope this helps. I am marking your responses as answers as they were accurate regarding the initial question.
