What is the probability that 3 students spend an average of more than $7?

Each student spends money on snacks after school every afternoon: Student 1's spending follows a normal distribution, he spends \$8 on average with a St. Dev of $3 Student 2's spending follows a normal distribution, he spends \$9 on average with a St. Dev of $2 Student 3's spending follows a normal distribution, he spends \$6 on average with a St. Dev of $5 What is the probability that on a given afternoon, the average of all 3 student's spending is more than $7? I found that the chance of Student 1 spending more than $7 is .63056 Student 2's chance is .84134. Student 3's chance is .42074 This is a total guess, but would it be the average of all 3? (.63056+.84134+.42074)/3 Which would be 0.63088
