How to calculate cumulative Poisson probabilities without adding each one if no. of outcomes is large and hence, adding (without excel) is difficult?

One can calculate the probability of a correct score of a football match by Poisson(Number of Team1 goals, Mean average Team1 goals) x Poisson(Number of Team2 goals, Mean average Team2 goals) So for 0:0 scoreline, Poisson(0, 1.05) x Poisson(0, 2.5) if mean Team1 is 1.05 and mean Team2 is 2.5. But how does one calculate the probability/odds of "home team to win by exactly one goal"? Adding double Poissons for each 2:1, 1:0, 3:2, etc scorelines might be one of the methods but it will be a tedious task and I am trying to avoid Excel for the time being to find the simplest method to calculate this. How do you involve the other team in your calculations? Was hoping an easier, simpler way was there (something like calculating P=0 and then 1-P(0) to find odds of P>=1).
