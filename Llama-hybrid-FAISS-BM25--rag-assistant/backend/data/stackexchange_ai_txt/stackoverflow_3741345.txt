Disable conversion of & to shortcut indicator (winforms)

I have a tab control (in my case a UltraTabControl from Infragistics) and I add a new tab. The text of this new tab is set to "Escape &Characters". lTab.Text = "Escape &Characters" When visualizing the tab control the & will become an _ (underscore) for the next character - in this case "C" I know that & is the Microsoft way of indicating a shortcut character - but is there any way of disabling this behaviour? Thanks in advance.
