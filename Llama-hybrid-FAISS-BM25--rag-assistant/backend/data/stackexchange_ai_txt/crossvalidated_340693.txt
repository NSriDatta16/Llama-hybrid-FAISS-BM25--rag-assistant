What happens when two parameter values are equally likely?

Suppose you want an estimator for a parameter theta. What happens when two different values for theta yield the same likelihood? (I mean there are two equally likely values for theta that are more likely than every other.) Which is selected? Would a Bayesian procedure yield a posterior distribution for theta that has two peaks? Is there any example of such situation?
