Calculting logLikelihood and AICs "by hand"

I'm a total newbee, when it comes to R and I need some help - my task is to calculate the logLikelihood and the AIC for a logistic regression, without using the logLik() fuction or the AIC() function. This is what I have so far : #Model: mod $coefficients[1]+mod$ coefficients[2]*Radius+mod $coefficients[3] *Dichte+mod$ coefficients[3]*Homogenitaet)/ (1+exp(mod $coefficients[1]+mod$ coefficients[2]*Radius+mod $coefficients[3] *Dichte+mod$ coefficients[3]*Homogenitaet)) logLikelihood My biggest problem right now is that i have no idea how to calculate p. I'm aware that p is the probability of the model. However I just can't think of a function right know, how to calculate it. BTW : The Variable "Krebs" is a dummy variable. I would really appreciate some help and I'm really sorry for my english. :)
