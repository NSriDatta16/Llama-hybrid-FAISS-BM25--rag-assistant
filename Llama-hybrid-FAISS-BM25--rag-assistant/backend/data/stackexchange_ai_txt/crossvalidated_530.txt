It's very common in forecasting to aggregate data in order to increase the signal/noise ratio. There are several papers on the effect of temporal aggregation on forecast accuracy in economics, for example. What you're probably seeing in the daily data is a weak signal that is being swamped by noise, whereas the weekly and monthly data are showing a stronger signal that is more visible. Whether you want to use temporal aggregation depends entirely on what your purpose is. If you need forecasts of daily incidents, then aggregation isn't going to be much use. If you are interested in exploring the effects of several covariates on the frequency of incidence, and all your data are available on a daily basis, then I would probably use the daily data as it will give a larger sample size and probably enable you to detect the effects more easily. Since you are using the forecast package, presumably you are interested in time series forecasting. So do you need daily forecasts, weekly forecasts or monthly forecasts? The answer will determine whether aggregation is appropriate for you.
