Bayesian networks - prediction question

Let's consider a dumb spam filter BN (see figure below) for which I've already calculated the a posteriori parameter distributions (see normalized table values). I want to predict if next email without the "book" word (Y1=F) and with the "free" word (Y2=T) is spam (X=T) or not spam (X=F). I guess the question can be written as P(X=T | Y1=F, Y2=T) ... you may confirm ... Here Y1 and Y2 are independant, I've been playing around with Bayes and Chain rules to get the right formulae for computation, without success. P(X|Y1,Y2) = P(Y1,Y2|X) P(X) / P(Y1, Y2) = P(Y1|X) P(Y2|Y1,X) P(X) / P(Y1|Y2)P(Y2) = P(Y1|X) P(Y2|X) P(X) / P(Y1)P(Y2) The R script below says that this probability is 0.3034 . Is this P(X=T | Y1=F, Y2=T) even though the function parameter "type=marginal" is used ?. Note: displayed conditional probability tables are not normalized (sum is not 1). library(gRain) X
