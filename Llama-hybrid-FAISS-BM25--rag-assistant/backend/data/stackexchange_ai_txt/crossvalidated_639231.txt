Sample size calculation for logistic regression

I need to perform an a priori power analysis for a logistic regression. My dependent variable is binary and I have two independent variables (between subjects), one variable with 3 levels (group) and the other with 2 levels (posture). I did not perform any pilot study, but from the literature, I know the ANOVA effect size of posture on the dependent variable (partial eta squared = .22), but I didn't know how to correctly determine the sample size for the logistic regression knowing only the effect size of the ANOVA. I didn't know odd ratio or other parameters to calculate the sample size for logistic regression.Can anyone help me with this? I have alpha, Power, and the ANOVA statistics from the study in literature.
