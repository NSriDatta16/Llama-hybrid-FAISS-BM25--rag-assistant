In some sense it makes no difference in a frequentist partial maximum likelihood analysis. I.e. any comparison between the categories you make afterwards will not change. On the other hand, it makes sense to parameterize things so that you directly get the comparisons you are the most interested. If you do a Bayesian version of the analysis, it might be easier to specify prior distributions (that reflect the assumptions you want to make) in some parameterization. Note also that specifying a reference category is just one of several parameterizations you could choose (you could e.g. also do average of the categories and difference from category 1 to 2, as well as difference from 2 to 3, or many other options). It just does not matter too much in a frequentist setting for the reasons indicated above.
