Image sharing websites like Flickr and Picasa do mention in their terms of service that you can only upload images that were created by yourself. So if users of your website would upload their images and you would put them in a Flickr or Picasa account created for your website, it would possibly conflict with the terms of service. I guess it's therefore better to go with a file storage service like Amazon S3, which don't have these restrictions.
