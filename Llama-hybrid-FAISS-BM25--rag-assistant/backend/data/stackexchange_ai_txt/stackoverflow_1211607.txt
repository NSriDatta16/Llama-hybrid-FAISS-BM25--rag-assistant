Perhaps you should supply the URL of the second servlet to the first as a servlet parameter. I realise this means encoding the URL twice in the web.xml (which I really abhor), but to avoid problems you can always build the web.xml as part of your build, and populate from a properties file. A little bit nasty and fiddly, I appreciate, but in the absence of any cross-container API solution, perhaps it's the most pragmatic solution.
