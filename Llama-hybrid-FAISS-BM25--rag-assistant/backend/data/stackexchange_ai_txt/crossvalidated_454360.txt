The advantage of a well-trained GAN is that you can create an unlimited amount of data that is indistinguishable from the "real" data you are modeling. From such a lot of synthetic data, you can derive many quantities of interest. If you need a prediction for the expectation of some quantity, just generate data and take its mean. If you need a quantile prediction, take the quantile from your generated data. And so forth. For instance, I work in forecasting supermarket sales. I have not yet seen anyone use GANs for this, but if we could generate a large amount of "sales" for a future situation (e.g., promotion X three days before Christmas) that approximates the actual distribution of sales closely enough, we could take a 98% quantile and fill the shelves up to this amount, ensuring an adequate safety stock.
