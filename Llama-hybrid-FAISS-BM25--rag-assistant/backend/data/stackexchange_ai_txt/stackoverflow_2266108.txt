These kind of things are never simple from both technical and organisational perspectives. If I had to tackle this I'd first look to see if we could be convinced that a single database or perhaps a more integrated collection of centralised databases would cater for the functional needs of the organisation. Once happy with that I'd see if I could plan to build that database and migrate applications to using it with either overhaul of the front end's totally or modify them to use data from elsewhere (I believe this is possible with MS Access). Alternatively it might just be best to find some big enterprise app that does all that you want and migrate to that. I'd echo what Stephan says, that you'll need to understand the functionality so that you can prioritise and accomodate it. This will be important in determining if you end up with something a lot nicer or just a big ball of mess compared to lots of separate balls of mess. This will also be a cultural change for your organisation since you're going to take power out of the peoples' hands and you'll need to keep them involved and "sell" the concept to them otherwise they'll not use the centralised system and will revert to building their own Access databases. :(
