There are several options. (i) You could do a two-sample test of binomial proportions / two sample proportions test. With your sample size, the normal approximation should be okay, though - you don't necessarily have to worry about the binomial part. (ii) You could do a chi-square test of independence (which also tests equality of proportion); this is basically equivalent to the first option if your test is two-tailed, or similarly, you could do a $G^2$ test. (iii) You might do a Fisher test, I guess. (You could do something more complicated like a logistic regression but I don't see the need here.) Depending somewhat on your area, the 2x2 chi-square test is probably the most likely to be familiar to other people looking at it. If you want a one tailed test, the two sample proportions test is the way to go.
