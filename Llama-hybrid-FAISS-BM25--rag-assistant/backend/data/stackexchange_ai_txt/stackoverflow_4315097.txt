If you have many controls on a form chances are that they are organized with containers such as panels and group boxes. When setting the tab order you have to consider the order of the containers as well. An inconsistency between tab orders on in the containers could explain the weird jumping. This can happen especially if two or more controls/containers have the same tab order value which makes the tabbing process arbitrary. Solution Idea: Of course updating and correcting the tab order is slow, error-prone work. It may behoove you to write a routine that iterates through the form's containers and controls recursively and assigning tab order values properly. You would set the tab order by comparing the Location point of each control of the container where top and left most point is the "lower" rank and the bottom, right-most component is the "highest". This would of course need a custom sorting alg. And if you look around, something like this may already be out there. Solution Idea 2: Refactor! Divide and conquer. It will take some time but if you move the UI components into separate, logically-organized user controls you'll get tighter of the codebase. You'll also uncover a lot of bugs!
