Which probability distribution fits my data?

I have generated a dataset (available here ) for which I try to find out the best fitting probability distribution. I first generated uniformly distributed random directions and then calculated the angle between two succeeding directions. The dataset are these angles. You can interpret the random directions as random points sampled on the surface of the unit sphere. The dataset of random directions is available here: random_dirs.txt I generated the random directions through polar coordinates $\theta = 2*\pi*u$, $\phi=acos(2v-1)$ (where $u,v$ are uniformly distributed from (0,1)); this method is also listed on this site . I then generate normalized direction vectors $\overrightarrow{n_i}=\left(\begin{array}{c} \sin(\phi)cos(\theta)\\ \sin(\phi)\\ \cos(\phi)) \end{array} \right)$ The angle between two suceeding directions is then calculated using random_dirs = load('random_dirs.txt'); rand_dirs_1 = random_dirs(1:end-1,:); rand_dirs_2= random_dirs(2:end,:); angles = acos(dot(rand_dirs_1, rand_dirs_2,2)); I tried the normal distribution: Density (PDF) Cumulative Probability (CDF) The CDF matches pretty good, but the PDF could be fitting "better". Is the data distributed according the normal distribution? How do I verify that? or is there a better matching distribution? The reason I need to identify a distribution is that I want to compare with other datasets using mean and standard deviation, so I guess first finding out a matching distribution which calculates these measures is necessary. e.g. this is the same original data, but I applied a spatial sorting algorithm to the random directions and then calculated the angles between neighbouring directions. The angles between the sorted directions are available here . The sorting uses a space-filling curve (e.g. Hilbert curve) to map the 3D data into 1D space and sort the directions accordingly. Now I want to compare how much "improvement" in terms of mean and sigma the sorting introduced. Or are there other measures I could use to express the "improvement"? How many bins should I use for fitting the data? I used 61 according to "Scott's method" (Scott, David W. (1979). "On optimal and data-based histograms".). According to "Sturges' method" (Sturges, H. A. (1926). "The choice of a class interval") I should use 18 bins which changes the appearance of the data quite a bit, it looks more like a normal distribution:
