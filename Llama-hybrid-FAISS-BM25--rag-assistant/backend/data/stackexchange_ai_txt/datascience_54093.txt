Feature selection or Dimension reduction in unsupervised learning

I'm trying to do Embedded clustering using kmeans. This is customer data, so it involves a lot of sentences, so I'm using the universal sentence encoder before clustering. But I should be doing a feature selection or dimensionality reduction before embedding the features. I want to know if there is a method to do feature selection or dimensionality reduction in unsupervised learning. This could be very helpful as the clustering is giving a mixed result as of now and I have a strong feeling that this could be because of the unwanted attribute in the data. I have read all the resources which only gave options to be done on the supervised learning. Any help is appreciated! Thanks Arav
