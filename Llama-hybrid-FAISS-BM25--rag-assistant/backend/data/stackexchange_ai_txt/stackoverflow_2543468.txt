Binding elements when modal window loads from AJAX (jQuery)

I'd like to set up a drag'n'drop list inside a modal window. The window's content is loaded via an AJAX call, so I believe I need to use jQuery's .live() method. Here is my current code: $('#cboxLoadedContent').live('load', function() { // Event for sortable page lists $('ul#pageList').sortable(); }); How can I set up bindings when the modal window loads? The modal window comes from the colorbox plugin. Note: I'm guessing that 'load' is not the right event to use, because if I throw a simple alert() in there, it doesn't even show up when the window loads.
