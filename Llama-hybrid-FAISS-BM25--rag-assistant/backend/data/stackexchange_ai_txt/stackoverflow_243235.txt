Virtual hosting is usually better than separate IP addresses, but your mileage will vary. This is really a network vs. systems deployment connection. You want to look at the total number of sites and services you will have on a system. You might want them to live on separate network interfaces (hence multiple IP addresses). You might want them to live off bonded physical interfaces. You might want web applications to run that need to run separately from others because of security reasons. The other answers above mention other factors, like SSL, organizational boundaries. (Some software does make associations by IP-address, like spam control). There are probably many other factors I have not thought of.
