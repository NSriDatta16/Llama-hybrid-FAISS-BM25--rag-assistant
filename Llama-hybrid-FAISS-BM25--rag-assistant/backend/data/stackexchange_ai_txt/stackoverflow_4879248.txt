Flash can... access the web cam access the microphone access sockets in all browsers flash has... a gui for creating complex vector animations an elegant system for managing and nesting visual assets built in filters like blur and convolution that run in real-time real-time bitmap manipulation with BitmapData and PixelBender (much faster than canvas) software rendered 3d engines like PV3D or Away3D real-time audio manipulation for generating audio and processing existing audio files the ability to read and write binary data, enabling the reading and writing of any filetype (like pdf or doc) There's more but those are the main ones I can think of off the top of my head. I've been using lots of HTML5 lately and I think it's really excellent, but when it comes time to make games or do something related to the above list, I still find myself using flash. Recently while developing games in flash I've been thinking to myself how I would go about doing the same thing using canvas and/or javascript and HTML5. In some cases it's possible, but in most cases it would be a good deal more work and code.
