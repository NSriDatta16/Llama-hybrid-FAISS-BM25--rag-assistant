One way is to have a common back-end database or some kind of memory storage which will act as intermediary layer between the two technologies. Popular is for example to use NoSQL DB like Redis which is fast, memory based and supports advanced data structures which are handy for this scenario. Also node.js and RoR both have a good client libraries for communication with Redis. I would say the main problem is in initial authentication between the two separate systems which both needs to be synchronized. There are similar questions/answers related to this topic which may come useful to read, for example these two shows what are the possible ways how to solve the authentication problem.
