How can I implement a drag and drop file/folder upload that is recursive?

I am looking for some way to implement a drop box for files and folders to be uploaded to the site. I found one from rad inks , but it only supports multiple files. Does anyone know about something like this that supports folder uploading? The website itself is based on PHP.
