I too have had this problem when using maximum likelihood estimation - only I use Goldstein IGLS algorithm as implemented through the MLwiN software and not LME4 in R. However in each and very case the problem has resolved when I have switched to MCMC estimation using the same software. I have even had a correlation in excess of 3 which resolved when I changed estimation. Using IGLS, the correlation is calculated post estimation as the covariance divided by the product of the square root of the product of the associated variances - and this does not take account of the uncertainty in each of the constituent estimates. The IGLS software does not 'know' that the covariance implies a correlation and just calculates estimates of a constant, linear, quadratic etc variance function. In contrast the MCMC approach is built on the assumption of samples from a multivariate normal distribution which corresponds to variances and covariances with good properties and full error propogation so that the uncertainty in the estimation of the covariances is taken into account in the estimation of the variances and vice versa. MLwin beings the MCMC estimate chain with IGLS estimates and the non-negative definite variance covariance matrix might need to be altered by changing the covariance to zero at the outset before starting the sampling. For a worked example see Developing multilevel models for analysing contextuality, heterogeneity and change using MLwiN 3, Volume 1 (updated September 2017); Volume 2 is also on RGate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320197425_Vol1Training_manualRevisedSept2017 Appendix to Chapter 10
