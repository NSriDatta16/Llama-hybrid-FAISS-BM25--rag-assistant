I don't know if I have understood very clearly, in any case I think it is curious perspective,if you mean to animate and do the same things if we have dragged a layer into a droppable layer. I suppose you could do it like this: http://www.jsfiddle.net/dactivo/QLTUS/ You use animate() to move the layer to the droppable, and then in the complete function, you imitate what normally happens in a dropping action, that is to say change the class, and there you can include whatever. I mean it is not important the drop event, but what you execute in the drop event, that can be included in your complete event of the animation. I have encapsulated this in a function called layerDrop(). $(function() { $( "#draggable" ).draggable(); $( "#droppable" ).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { layerDrop(); } }); $("#btnMove").click(function() { $("#draggable").animate({"left": $( "#droppable" ).offset().left ,"top": $( "#droppable" ).offset().top}, { duration: 1000, specialEasing: { width: 'linear' }, complete:function() { $("#message").html("Completed!"); layerDrop(); //whatever } } ); }); function layerDrop(){ $( "#droppable") .addClass( "ui-state-highlight" ) .find( "p" ) .html( "Dropped!" ); } });
