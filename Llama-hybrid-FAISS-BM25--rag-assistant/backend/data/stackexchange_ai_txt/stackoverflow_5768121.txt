Like most encryption, it just needs to be stronger than the value of the data it's protecting. By the sounds of it, you aren't up against governments or professional cryptographers... If I can have a couple more characters, you could use a real encryption algorithm with a relatively small block size (CAST-128 with a 64 bit block size comes to mind). Base64 encoding will increase that to a 12 character code. ie. Code = Base64(CAST128(username + completion bits)). To avoid cases of long usernames, you could hash it first: Code = Base64(CAST128(Hash(Username) + completion bits)) Should be secure enough for an assessment program. (One glaring problem is that you need to embed the key in the software... but again, if you aren't up against government agents...)
