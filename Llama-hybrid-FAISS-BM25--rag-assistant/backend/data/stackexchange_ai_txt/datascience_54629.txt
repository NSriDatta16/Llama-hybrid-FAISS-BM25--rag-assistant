How interpret keras training loss without compare with validation loss?

I have several implementation of the same neural network, but each one with different starting parameter. This is one of my plot comparing the training loss of the base experiment with the training loss of another experiment. I have also other exaples: May anyone point me to some instruction on how understand these output from the keras fit()? Note that I don't have any validation set. Thanks
