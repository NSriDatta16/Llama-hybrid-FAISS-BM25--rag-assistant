C crypt(3) crypt() is the password encryption function. It is based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm with variations intended (among other things) to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search. key is a user's typed password. salt is a two-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./]. This string is used to perturb the algorithm in one of 4096 different ways. Ruby crypt Applies a one-way cryptographic hash to str by invoking the standard library function crypt. The argument is the salt string, which should be two characters long, each character drawn from [a-zA-Z0-9./]. PHP crypt crypt() will return an encrypted string using the standard Unix DES-based encryption algorithm or alternative algorithms that may be available on the system. Python crypt.crypt This module implements an interface to the crypt(3) routine, which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; C# The .NET Framework doesn't include an API for the Unix crypt function, but here are some libraryies that provide implementations: CryptAPI CryptAPI is a C# library that contains unimplemented algorithms in the .NET framework (NT, NTLM, BlowFish, DES and MD5) linking and emulating the crypt() unix function re-programmed in C#. The main purpose is to provide backward compatiblity. A C# implementation of Unix crypt()
