Something's up with your DB, server, storage or some combination thereof. 4:30 for a select count * seems VERY high. Run a DBCC_SHOWCONTIG to see how fragmented your table is, this could cause a major performance hit over a table that size. Also, to add on to the comment by RyanKeeter, run the show plan and if there are any table scans create an index for the PK field on that table.
