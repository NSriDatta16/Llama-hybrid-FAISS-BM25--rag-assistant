Difference in execution speeds when run on different machines

I am running the below program on 2 different machines with different architectures. The practice in our organization is to build the executable in New York machine and copy it to Singapore machine. Below is the architecture in New York and Singapore Machine. New York: SunOS pns15a-5203a 5.10 Generic_137111-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-V440 Singapore: SunOS sgs75a-5201b 5.10 Generic_137111-04 sun4v sparc SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise-T5220 #include #include #include #include #include using namespace std; int main (int argc, char **argv) { char **p; int num_allocations = atoi(argv[1]); clock_t start = clock(); p = new char* [num_allocations]; clock_t end1 = clock(); for (int ii=0; ii I am running the program for different char sizes. ./run_test.csh #!/bin/csh -f -x ./a.out 1 ./a.out 1024 ./a.out 2048 ./a.out 4096 ./a.out 8192 ./a.out 16384 The output for Newyork and Singapore machine is given below. New York Machine: Time Taken for allocations(1) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.00 seconds Time Taken for allocations(1024) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.00 seconds Time Taken for allocations(2048) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.01 seconds Time Taken for allocations(4096) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.03 seconds Time Taken for allocations(8192) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.11 seconds Time Taken for allocations(16384) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.37 seconds Time Taken for Singapore Machine: Time Taken for allocations(1) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.00 seconds Time Taken for allocations(1024) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.00 seconds Time Taken for allocations(2048) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.02 seconds Time Taken for allocations(4096) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.05 seconds Time Taken for allocations(8192) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.18 seconds Time Taken for allocations(16384) = 0.000000 seconds for initialization 0.53 seconds How do I start investigating the issue ?
