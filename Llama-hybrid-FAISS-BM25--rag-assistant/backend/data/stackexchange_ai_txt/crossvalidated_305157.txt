A very natural choice for this type of problems is the application of Apriori Algorithm that calculates the association rules. Alternatively, Bayesian networks can be used. Both of them are well documented and implemented in both Python and R. In your case, Bayesian network may work better as you can easily sample from it because it represents a random distribution. A starting point may be this , but there may be better material on that. Similarly, you can use Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is primarily dedicated to text mining where each sample is considered as a bag of words. In your case, you play with bag of items which is from the perspective of LDA the very same. Regarding GAN, it may be possible to use RNN GAN where it may be possible to sample a sequence of the items but I am not very sure about this approach.
