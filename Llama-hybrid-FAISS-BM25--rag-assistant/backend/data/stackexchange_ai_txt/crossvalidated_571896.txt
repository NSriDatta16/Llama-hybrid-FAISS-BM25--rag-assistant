Why logit transform explanatory variable restricted between $0$ and $1$ only if it is close to $0$ or $1$?

In Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition chapter 14 on linear regression they write Since the explanatory variable is restricted to lie between 0 and 1 (recall that we have excluded uncontested elections from our analysis), it would seem advisable to transform the data , perhaps using the logit transformation, before fitting a linear regression model. In practice, however, almost all the vote proportions $y_i$ fall between 0.2 and 0.8, so the effect of such a transformation would be minor . (emphasis mine) I think I may understand why one would want to transform the data: If we only have one explanatory variable $x$ , then some values of $x$ would take the predicted value outside of $[0,1]$ . But in that case I don't understand why this is not a problem when almost all the observed outcomes fall between $[0.2, 0.8]$ ?
