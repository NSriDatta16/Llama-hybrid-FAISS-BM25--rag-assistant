I may be misunderstanding your question (and falling into the same misunderstanding as fRed despite your explanation), in which case I apologize. It seems to me like you are saying you already know the various P_A, P_B, and P_C values for each context. I assume P_A + P_B + P_C = 1? Given those priors and the actual outcome you want to characterize the accuracy of the already established P values? One approach might be simulation. Given the various P_A, P_B, and P_C values for each context you could generate guesses from the model at the probabilities indicated by each P value and then compare that to the obtained data. Averaging over many simulations you should get a sense of the average hit-rate of the model.
