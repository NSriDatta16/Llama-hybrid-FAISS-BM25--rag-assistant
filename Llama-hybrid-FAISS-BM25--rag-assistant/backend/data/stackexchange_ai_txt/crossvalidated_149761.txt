Essentially, you're comparing the wrong things. The Mean Squared Error tells you the average error of each prediction. It's sensitive to the units you're predicting, so since you're predicting a log transformed variable, it's not surprising that the mean squared error would be small. To compare to R squared, you need to look at the Mean Squared Error as a proportion of the variance in Y (which is essentially the formula for R squared, turned around a bit). R squared is the proportion of variance explained - so it takes into account the variance of your dependent variable, as well as the average error, to get the percentage of variance that isn't error (essentially). What is probably happening in your data is that you have very low variance, such that your mean squared error is still pretty large in comparison to this variance, and that your model doesn't explain a lot (as shown by the low R squared). This post may be helpful to give a more mathematically complete answer: What is the difference between "coefficient of determination" and "mean squared error"?
