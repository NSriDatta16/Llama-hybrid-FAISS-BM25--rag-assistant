David, Which version of MSpec are you running? If you're still on 0.3.0.0 I encourage you to switch to the most recent 0.4.9.0 build . This build contains mspec.exe (AnyCPU) as well as mspec-x86.exe (x86). You should use the executable matching your build environment/architecture. Can you please trace the assembly binding with Fustion Log Viewer - it's part of the Windows SDK. The error message "An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format." indicates that MSpec is able to find the spec DLL, but target architectures do not match between the MSpec executable and and spec assembly.
