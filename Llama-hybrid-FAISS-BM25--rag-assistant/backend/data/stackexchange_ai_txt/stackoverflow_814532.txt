I can't "Create or Extend Web Application" in SharePoint?

I encounter this error "Cannot find an unused port" when I want to create or extend web application in Centeral Administration. I also tried to disable the antivirus and firewall but it didn't work. The associated error with this in Event viewer is : "The description for Event ID ( 0 ) in Source ( PrmBackgroundAgent ) cannot be found. The local computer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer. You may be able to use the /AUXSOURCE= flag to retrieve this description; see Help and Support for details. The following information is part of the event: system_monitor failed to run." If you have any idea, please let me know it ;) P.S. I use Moss 2007 with SP2
