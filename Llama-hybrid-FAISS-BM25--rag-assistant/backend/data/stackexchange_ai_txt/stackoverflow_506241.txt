You won't gain performance by doing d = 1 / c a = b * d You probably mean: d = 1 / c a1 = b1 * d a2 = b2 * d This way the division is done only once. Division is per se slower than multiplication, however, I don't know the details. The basic reason is that, similar to functions such as sin or sqrt, it's just mathematically more complex. IIRC, a multiplication takes about 10 cycles on an average CPU, while a division takes about 50 or more. How it is actually done was nicely explained by John Mulder.
