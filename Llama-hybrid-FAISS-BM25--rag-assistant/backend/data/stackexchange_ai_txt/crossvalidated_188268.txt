About the parameters from multinom and glmnet, I found this answer beneficial, Can I use glm algorithms to do a multinomial logistic regression? especially, "Yes, with a Poisson GLM (log linear model) you can fit multinomial models. Hence multinomial logistic or log linear Poisson models are equivalent." So I'll show the reparametrization of the glmnet coefficients to multinom coefficients. n.subj=1000 x1 Hope this helps. But I don't think I understand the equivalence of Generalized Linear Model(Poisson) and multinomial logistic model in and out. Tell me if there's good and readable and "easily" understandable source..
