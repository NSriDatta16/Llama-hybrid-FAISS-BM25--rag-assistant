As @thedom said, just use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] in PHP. Your user agent (Unless modified by the user) will contain the browser, browser version and os. Here's mine: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.612.1 Safari/534.15 BUT if you want to use javascript, you'll have to do something similar to what I did to implement ajax logins. I basically put this at the top of the script (login.php) session_id($_POST['PHPSESSID']); session_start(); And this in the page the javascript will be run from to detect session (index.php) $sessionid = ($_COOKIE['PHPSESSID']) ? $_COOKIE['PHPSESSID'] : $_GET['PHPSESSID']; var session = "$sessionid"; And then I post to the other script (login.php) (To log you in via ajax in this case) $.post("ajax/login.php",PHPSESSID=" + session); Using JQuery.
