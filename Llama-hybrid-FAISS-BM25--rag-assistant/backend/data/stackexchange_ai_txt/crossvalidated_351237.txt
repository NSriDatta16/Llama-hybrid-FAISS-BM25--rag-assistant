The interpretation for categorical variables with more than 2 levels is very similar to the binary case you mention; for a $k$ -level categorical variable, you will have $k-1$ regression coefficients each of which compare the odds of the outcome to the reference group. For the example you state, ethnicity (Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian), let us assume your referent (baseline) group is African-American. Many software packages for logistic regressions will give you 3 Odds ratios (for a 4-level categorical predictor) once you run the regression. Let us quickly look at how this is done in R based on simulated dataset: ###########Simulate Data########### set.seed(123) # set seed if you want to re-produce #simulation results x1 So what does the odds ratio of 1.23 for Asians mean? This means, compared to African-Americans Asians had 23% higher odds of the outcome. Equivalently, you can interpret as Asians have 1.23 times the odds of the outcome compared to the referent group of African Americans. The odds of 1.800 and 1.796 for Caucasians and Hispanics, respectively, are interpreted in the same manner. The most important part of modeling categorical variables is identifying the proper referent group. You can always change the reference group by using the relevel() command in R. See example here . In order to make comparison between two groups where one of them is not a referent group, there are a few ways to go: Use relevel() function and re-run the regression changing the reference group to your variable of interest (not my favorite approach when there are many levels in your categorical predictor) Use already built in packages to do this comparison. I am not sure how this is done in Stata or SAS (probably contrast statement for SAS) but you can easily do this in R using the car package. For example, if you want to test if the odds of the outcome differ between Caucasians and Hispanics, use the following commands: library(car) linearHypothesis(model1, c("x1CA - x1HI = 0")) Linear hypothesis test Hypothesis: - x1HI + x1CA = 0 Model 1: restricted model Model 2: y ~ x1 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) 1 9997 2 9996 1 0.0018 0.9658 In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in the odds of the outcome between Caucasians and Hispanics (p-value=0.9658).
