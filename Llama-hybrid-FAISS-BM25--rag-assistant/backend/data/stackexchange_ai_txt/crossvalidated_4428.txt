The issue is mainly that Bayesian analysis involves integrals , often multidimensional ones in realistic problems, and it's these integrals that are typically intractable analytically (except in a few special cases requiring the use of conjugate priors). By contrast, much of non-Bayesian statistics is based on maximum likelihood -- finding the maximum of a (usually multidimensional) function, which involves knowledge of its derivatives , i.e. differentiation. Even so numerical methods are used in many more complex problems, but it's possible to get further more often without them, and the numerical methods can be simpler (even if less simple ones may perform better in practice). So I'd say it comes down to the fact that differentiation is more tractable than integration.
