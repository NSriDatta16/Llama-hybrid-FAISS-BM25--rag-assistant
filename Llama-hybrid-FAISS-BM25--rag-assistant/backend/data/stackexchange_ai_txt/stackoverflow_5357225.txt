Magento - Check for Customer's First Order

Is there a quick way to programatically check if the currently logged in customer has ever placed an order? I'm writing an observer and at a point I want to simply say if ($this->isCustomerLoggedIn() && (has never placed an order)) { do this } possible? Thanks!
