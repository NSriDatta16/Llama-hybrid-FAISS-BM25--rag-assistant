After two weeks of wrestling with the JNLP file syntax and my CGI script, I think I finally found the crux of the problem. I am noting this down here (at the risk of looking pretentious enough to answer my own question) in case somebody else runs into the same problem. The href property of the tag, in my case was apparently unnecessary and when removed the application started working as intended on both linux and win systems. I am not 100% sure if this is the exact reason but my understanding is that as the jnlp syntax is generated from a script and directly returned to the user instead of a jnlp file somewhere in the filesystem, the href property was pointing to a wrong place and perhaps caused some sort of a clash that is handled differently in different OS.
