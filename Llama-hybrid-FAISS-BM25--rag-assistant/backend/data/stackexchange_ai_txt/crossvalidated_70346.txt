Questionnaire design

Answers to a questionnaire - Frequency of activity X 1 - 5 6 - 10 10 - 20 20 or more I have two questions regarding these answers: Uneven bins, the answer 10 to 20 has twice the number of numerical answers, if you were to analyse this data after collection, what implications would this have? Similarly the final answer, an open ended upper bound. I am advised to estimate the average for this category, I disagree as we wont know the upper limit of the answer. Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.
