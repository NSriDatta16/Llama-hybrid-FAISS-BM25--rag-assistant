Mathematical expression (string) to number in Java

I'm trying to find something like Java Embedding Plugin (JEP) that can evaluate a mathematical formula (string) and give back the answer. But it should also calculate a variable, for example: (25+36+x)*2 = 25 should give: x = -11 A little like http://www.wolframalpha.com/ , but it shouldn't be that versatile, and it should work off-line. Open source is preferred. I need it for my little calculator project, http://sourceforge.net/projects/calex/ .
