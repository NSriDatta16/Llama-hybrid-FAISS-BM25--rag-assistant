Broadcast to many webservices class

I want to make small framework with i could simply invoke webservices on many computers that have webservice. So, i have i.e five computers with webservices. Each ws provides 2 functions (could be more, but this is example): DataFormat[] GetXData(int) Something[] GetYData(string, int). Invoking service now looks like this: ServiceClient wsc; DataFormat[] data = wsc.GetXData(5); I plan interface of framework like this: MultiWebservice mws; DataFormat[] data = mws.BroadcastQuery( wsc.GetXData(5) ); As can see, i wish to inject function with iam interested to fire on every ws. And return merged data (merging is not subject of post. i handle it myself) I need a help how use C# to make this elegant, generic and if it isn't necessary, without many overloading of function because i don't want make new overloadings for each different return type or each function in ws. Please, give me advice. Maybe this interface is wrong and could be better.
