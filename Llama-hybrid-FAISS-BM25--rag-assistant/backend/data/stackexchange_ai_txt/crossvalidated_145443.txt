Despite the term multiple factor analysis (MFA) , used to describe the factor analysis (FA) that you've performed, it seems to me like a standard PCA approach (or, FA via PCA, at best), which focuses on principal components . Instead, I suggest you to use exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) , both of which focus on latent variables approach. EFA serves as an alternative dimensionality reduction technique with an added benefits of discovering latent factor structure, which has more explanatory power . Let me know, if you need further help.
