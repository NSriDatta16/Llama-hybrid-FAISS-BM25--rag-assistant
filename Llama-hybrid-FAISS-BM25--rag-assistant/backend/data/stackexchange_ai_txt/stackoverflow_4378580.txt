How to make ajaxtoolkit autocomplete super fast and bind it on clientside

I have used ajaxtool kit's autocomplete on a page which gets data from a web service. This autocomplete is slow, at the time I only have 10 to 20 records in table and it take about 3 to 5 seconds to search and show result in autocomplete. User have to wait about 4 second on average to see data. I am not getting how to make it super fast please guide me. Is it possible to bind autocomplete on client side? My idea is if I get data with page load from server and put it in some array in JavaScript and as user click it get data from client side.
