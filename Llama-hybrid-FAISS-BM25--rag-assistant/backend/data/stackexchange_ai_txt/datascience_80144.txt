After evaluating a few libraries against Chinese texts: spaCy's POS tagging has poor accuracy Stanford Stanza's POS tagging is generally good, but often incorrectly identifies words in single word sentences as POS = "PUNCT" NLTK does not natively handle Chinese POS tagging CoreNLP has good POS tagging accuracy and does a reasonable job of NER tagging. I suspect this is more about the quality of the pre-built models than the libraries themselves.
