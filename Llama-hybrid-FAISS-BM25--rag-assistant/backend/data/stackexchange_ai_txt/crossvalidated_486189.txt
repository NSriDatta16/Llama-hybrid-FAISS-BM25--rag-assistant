OK. Given your comments, I'll offer this hint: Have you plotted the raw data first? With so few data points, you probably don't even need to look at residuals. I'd encourage you to plot your points $(x,y)$ and overlay a fitted regression line. It's not clear to me where you obtained your function from since it doesn't appear to be a best fit line from a regression model. You can try do this with the following code in R (you never told us if you are using a program or doing this by hand, by the way, so I'll assume you are using R ): x = c(-4,-2,0,2,4) y = c(-18,-10,-2,6,15) fit1 Which outputs the following text and graphic: Call: lm(formula = y ~ x) Residuals: 1 2 3 4 5 2.00e-01 9.18e-15 -2.00e-01 -4.00e-01 4.00e-01 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -1.80000 0.16330 -11.02 0.0016 ** x 4.10000 0.05774 71.01 6.15e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.3651 on 3 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9994, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9992 F-statistic: 5043 on 1 and 3 DF, p-value: 6.154e-06 Compare your function $f(x)=4x-5$ with the regression model function. What do you think? Do you think your function could be improved upon?
