I suggest to create a different model which contains all the visualizazion data: in this way you could link an element of the data model to multiple instance of eleemnts of the visualization model and solve your problem in a simple and elegant way. Moreover you don't "pollute" the data model with all the data needed for the visualization, i.e. the coordinate of the elements in the diagram. Saluti
