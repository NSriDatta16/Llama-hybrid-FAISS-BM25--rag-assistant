You could conceivably create a layered service provider that can intercept data by inserting itself onto the winsock stack, but this won't short-circuit the data going through the kernel and the NDIS layer in windows. Your only real solution here would be a device driver. Also, there are some network cards that implement their own TCP/IP stack in hardware and you can communicate with those directly however these are not very common. Any of these approaches is not trivial and you're looking at a lot of kernel-mode C. If you're not comfortable with that, you shouldn't be trying this. You could also consider using winpcap as this would give you a lot of the functionality that you need. http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm
