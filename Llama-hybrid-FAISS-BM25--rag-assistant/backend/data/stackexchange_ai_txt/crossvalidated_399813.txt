Posterior distribution of ATE with Bayesian propensity score model?

I am using propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of some treatment $D$ on an outcome $Y$ with covariates $X$ . I have seen several ways in the literature (both analytic and bootstrap) for estimating the uncertainty of the PSW estimate. I'd like to use a Bayesian multi-level model of the propensity score. I assume there is not an analytic formula for the uncertainty of the resulting PSW treatment effect estimate. I could use the bootstrap but the model is prohibitively expensive to fit (using Stan). But since I'm using Stan I can get a big sample of the posterior distribution of the propensity scores. I could simply, for each posterior sample, calculate the PSW estimate (e.g. using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator). Now I have a distribution of ATE estimates. Does this distribution appropriately capture the uncertainty of my ATE estimate? Or do I need to incorporate the uncertainty of the ATE given the propensity score model? How can I do that? Any references would be great. Here are two useful references I found but I don't think they address my question as the former is about propensity score regression and matching (not weighting) and the latter only mentions delta and bootstrap. [1] Bayesian Propensity Score Estimators: Incorporating Uncertainties in Propensity Scores into Causal Inference by An [2] Propensity Score Weighting with Multilevel Data by Li et al.
