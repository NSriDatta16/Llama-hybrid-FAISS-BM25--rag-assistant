Will_paginate stuck on page 2

For some reasons, my will_paginate collection is stuck on page 2. I have the usual links the view helper provides except every page after page one links to: http://localhost:3000/ceo/gr_messages?page=2 I have tried to add the :order option with no luck. I have also ensured that the request is a get as mentioned here def gr_messages @organisation.gold_care! @messages = @organisation.messages.paginate(:per_page => 10, :page => params[:page], :order => 'id') if request.xhr? render :partial => 'messages_and_pagination' end end
