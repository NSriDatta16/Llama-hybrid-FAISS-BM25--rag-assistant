Model selection for sequence classification

Searching for best (highest accuracy) model to classify a sequence of values Some observations so far from manually classifying many of these: Each sequence will have 500-5k pieces Each piece can take on ~200 different values Ordering is important. (e.g. [...,4,4,5,...] can be very different from [...,5,4,4,...]) Frequency is important (seeing the value '9' many times has meaning) Neighbors are important (e.g. [...,7,3,7,...] significantly different than [..,7,..,3,..,7,..] Most of the sequence will be dominated by the same value (e.g. 80% of the entries in the sequence will be wither a 2 or 6) Entries that are close in value are not really related (e.g. 15 is not "similar to 14, but stronger") What I've considered Text classification . If I consider each entry in the sequence to be a character or a word, it seems like this is just a DSL that needs to be classified. The snag here is most advice/state of the art text classifiers I've been referred to are heavily embedding dependent, which I'm told is less effective in the dataset I've described above. CNN with the values as a picture . This sounded promising because CNN is cognizant of ordering, neighbors, counts, all those good things. Feedback here told me to avoid this because CNN is heavily dependent on edge detection which would fail here At some point I'm just going to just start diving in and see what shakes out but wanted to see if there are any suggestions I'm missing. Very new to this field. Followup Questions: "What is a sequence?" The list of past states of a player in a board game. "What is a piece?" Just one value in the sequence. An item. "What is the goal of this analysis?" To categorize an unlabeled sequence in one of two labels.
