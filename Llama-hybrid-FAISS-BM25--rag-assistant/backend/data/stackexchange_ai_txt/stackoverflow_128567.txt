Changing the algorithm is not improving the quality (except you expect an algorithm to be broken), it's only about the key/block length and some advantage in obfuscation. Doing it several times is interesting, since even if the first key leaked, the resulting data is not distinguishable from random data. There are block sizes that are processed better on a given platform (eg. register size). Attacking quality encryption algorithms only works by brute force and thus depending on the computing power you can spend on. This means eventually you only can increase the probable average time somebody needs to decrypt it. If the data is of real value, they'd better not attack the data but the key holder...
