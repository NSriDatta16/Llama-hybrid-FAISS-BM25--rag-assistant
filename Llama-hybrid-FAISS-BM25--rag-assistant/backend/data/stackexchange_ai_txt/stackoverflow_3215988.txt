How to get and set a global object in Java servlet context

I wonder if anyone can advise: I have a scenario where a scheduled job being run by Quartz will update an arraylist of objects every hour. But I need this arraylist of objects to be visible to all sessions created by Tomcat. So what I'm thinking is that I write this object somewhere every hour from the Quartz job that runs so that each session can access it. Can anyone say how best this may be achieved? I was wondering about the object being written to servlet context from the Quartz job? The alternative is having each session populate the arraylist of objects from a database table. Thanks Mr Morgan.
