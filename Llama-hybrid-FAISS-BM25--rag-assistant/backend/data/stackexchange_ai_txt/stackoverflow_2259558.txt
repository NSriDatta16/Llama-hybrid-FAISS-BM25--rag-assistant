You might be able to get away with this by asserting the sizeof(class) in different files. If the packing is causing the size of the object to be smaller, than I would expect that sizeof() would show that up. You could also do this as a static assert using C++0x's static assert, or Boost's (or a handrolled one of course) On the part of not wanting to do this in every file, I would recommend putting together a header file that includes all the headers you're worried about, and the static_asserts. Personally though, I'd just recommend searching through the code base over the list of pragmas and fix them.
