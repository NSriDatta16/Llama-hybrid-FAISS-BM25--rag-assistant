Stop Dragging from a WPF WebBrowser control

I have a WPF application which contains a WebBrowser control. Currently, the user can select something within the WebBrowser and can copy the content by dragging it out to another application and dropping it there. I'd like to be able to stop the user doing this. I'd assumed that there would be a "DragStart" event that I could capture and cancel - but I haven't been able to find something so simple. Is it possible to capture the start of drag event and cancel it? Is there a better way to achieve this?
