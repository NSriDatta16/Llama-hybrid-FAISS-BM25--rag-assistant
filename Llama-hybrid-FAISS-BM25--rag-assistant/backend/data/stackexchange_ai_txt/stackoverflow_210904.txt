Here is sample code of what I have done for something quite similar: // $mimeType is the mime type of the file header('Content-type: ' . $mimeType); // this will get the size of the file // (helps for giving the size to the browser so a percent complete can be shown) header('Content-length: ' . (string) (filesize($path))); // disposition is either attachment (for binary files that can't be read by the browser) // or inline (for files that can be read by the browser // some times you have play with this to get working so users get the download window in all browsers // original filename is the name you want to users to see // (shouldn't have any special characters as you can end up with weird issues) header('Content-Disposition: ' . $disposition . '; filename=' . $originalFilename); // the next 2 lines try to help the browser understand that the file can't be cached // and should be downloaded (not viewed) header('Pragma: Public'); header('Cache-control: private'); // this will output the file to browser readfile($path); You can of course add to this any login checking and logging to ensure it isn't downloaded too many times. Also, as said earlier, ensure you put the file outside (or above) the web server document root so people can't figure out the path. Or you could even put a password on the directory so only internal people could access the file list more easily, but wouldn't recommend this. (Only do this if you can put something outside the doc root.)
