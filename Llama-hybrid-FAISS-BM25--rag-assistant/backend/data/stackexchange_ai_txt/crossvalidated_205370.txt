Compare RMSE between original and logged time series data

I have some time series data, both in the original form $y$ and in logged form $\log(y)$. I should compare the models generated by applying neural networks and find the best one. How to decide which one is better since the two values are in different units? Would it be useful to normalize the RMSEs over the standard deviation?
