As per the statement, you are keen to see whether today’s sales is different from past 30 days average. It is more appropriate to use the average of actual sales data rather than the average of moving average data. You can also find out the 95% conference interval of past 30 days data. If your present data falls into it than conclude that the present day’s sales is not significantly different. Otherwise it is significantly different. This is a simple way. Another way could be to use t test with single mean. Treat past 30 days average as population mean and present days sales as sample mean. Then go ahead. Significant t test would reveal present mean is significantly different from that of past 30 days mean.
