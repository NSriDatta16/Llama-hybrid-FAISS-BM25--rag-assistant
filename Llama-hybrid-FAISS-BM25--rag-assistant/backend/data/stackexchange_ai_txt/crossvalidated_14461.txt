Scores and normal distributions

I'm in the process of designing a system. So basically, every day users on my site rack up points based on their activity on my website. So whatever they do on my website, they rack up points. So on 8/3, a user might do multiple things on my website so that they rack up 10 points. Every day, I figure out the number of points for the user for that day and add a row in the database with the number of points for that day. I want to give each person a score. Basically a score from 0 to 10 just like in school, but I want that score to depend on the mean score of all the users. I was thinking of finding the average number of points per day for each user (so user 1 might have an average of 10 points per day) and then finding the average ($X$) of these averages. And using $X$ to create a normal distribution to give each person a score from 0 to 10. But if the person is 2 standard deviations from the mean, how does that translate to a score? I'm not a statistician. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. What's the best way to calculate a score like this? Also I know with normal distributions that the distribution has to be normal. What if the average scores are right skewed? What should I do? Determine whether there is an outlier? Anyway help would be appreciated.
