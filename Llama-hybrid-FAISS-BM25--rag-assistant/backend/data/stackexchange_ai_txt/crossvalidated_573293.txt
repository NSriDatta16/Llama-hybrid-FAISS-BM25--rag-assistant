You might be interested in the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression (POOLR) model. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U is a score test of a POOLR model with one variable indicating group membership , similar to how an equal-variance t-test is a Wald test of a linear regression with one variable indicating group membership. This is not the same as applying a regression model to the rank-transformed data, but that seems like a hack to use until one learns about the POOLR model.
