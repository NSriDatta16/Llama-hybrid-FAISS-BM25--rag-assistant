What tools/stacks Moncaì will rely on?

On November, 11th, Moncaì has been announced . The post describes the product as "a platform as a service(PAAS) cloud solution for .NET/Mono web applications" which would allow to "deploy your web applications with ease by using Git or Mercurial by simply issuing a push command" à la Heroku . Beside this, very little is known about the supporting infrastructure. Manos may be involved ( tweet ) Maybe CouchDB could also be part through Ottoman API It looks like Redis will also be used ( tweet ) What have you been able to gather about the choosen tools (messaging, storage, ...) to support the project ?
