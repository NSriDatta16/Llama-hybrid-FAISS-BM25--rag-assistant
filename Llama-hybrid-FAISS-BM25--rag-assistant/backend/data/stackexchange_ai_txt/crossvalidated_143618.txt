There is a pretty nice algorithm described in Tom√© and Miranda (1984) . The proposed methodology uses a least-squares approach to compute the best continuous set of straight lines that fit a given time series, subject to a number of constraints on the minimum distance between breakpoints and on the minimum trend change at each breakpoint. The code and a GUI are available in both Fortran and IDL from their website: http://www.dfisica.ubi.pt/~artome/linearstep.html
