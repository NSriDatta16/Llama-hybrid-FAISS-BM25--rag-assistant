Are you trying to manipulate the auto-increment value of your table? If you want to do this, you COULD do SET @@auto_increment_increment=10; Keep in mind that this is a system wide variable that will affect ALL tables. Generally, I would discourage you to manipulate the way that the primary key (I just assume thsi) is generated. If you need to give a custom value, say i * 10, you could either write a trigger/function that does the job or a more easily, you can create a view provides you with the last inserted id (say 150) and adds your value (e.g. 10) to it so you can get 160. Doctrine itself does not support this (as far as I know) and that's good in my opinion. If you need to set different increments to the primary keys, PostgreSWL and Oracale for example are able to do so since they use sequences for the generation of the keys that can be manipulated by the dev
