What is the best way of combining audio and visual data to make predictions?

I am trying to predict the probability of a disease by using audio and images, the audio and the images do not come from the same source. I am thinking of combining the outputs (maybe average them) of two models one utilizing image data to calculate the probability the other using audio data. I am feeling unsure of this approach as I will not be able to verify the final combined output. Will the outcomes be reliable, or should I use a different approach?
