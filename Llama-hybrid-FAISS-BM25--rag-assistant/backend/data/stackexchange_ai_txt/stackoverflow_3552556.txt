Looks like the problem, at least in my test case, was somehow further down in the .htaccess file I did have RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !FeedBurner followed by some RewriteRules that I actually wanted and a RewriteEngine off -- the last being my misguided (?) efforts to clear the RewriteCond so as not to affect possible future RewriteRules. Also I see I originally had a problem with some of them in that I was including the initial "/" in the pattern match, which is apparently incorrect. I commented all that out and my test case and what I really wanted, started working as expected. Playing around since then makes me believe that RewriteEngine off was the real culprit. Anyhow all is working as expected now. Thanks for pushing me in the right directions and hopefully this helps someone else.
