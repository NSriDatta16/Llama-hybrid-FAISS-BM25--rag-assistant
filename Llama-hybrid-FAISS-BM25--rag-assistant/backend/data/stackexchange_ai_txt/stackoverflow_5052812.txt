A HashMap as a base data structure (I say base because you could combine multiple structures to get you the most optimal storage) would probably be the best solution. If you needed to access one of the cells and you implemented a linked list, it would require O(n) time to iterate the list to get to that cell, whereas a HashMap would only require O(1) time to access what you want. The same would go for insertions and deletions into the data structure.
