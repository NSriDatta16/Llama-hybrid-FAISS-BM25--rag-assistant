Being able to share common HTML fragments like headers, footers, "logged in" area of page, sidebars etc. is a very common requirement. Template engines usually provide means for this. If you're using Mako, here are the two main mechanisms you can use: Includes Check out the tag. In your page template you specify where various reusable bits would be placed. You kind of build the page from ground up, assemble it from the reusable components you have. Example from Mako documentation: hello world Inheritance Check out the tag. This works similarly to inheritance in programming languages like Python. In a base template you set up a skeleton of the page. In page templates you customize and extend some parts of the base template. Quick example, base.mako : ${self.header()} ${self.body()} This is the common header all pages will get unless they override this. And somepage.mako : This content will go into body of base. Template engines usually have many nifty features, and I encourage you to get to know them well!
