I think that the term "data-driven" has become now very popular because of deep learning techniques. The big change is that we do not longer hand-craft features, but design architectures and learning strategies that help the network learn the features directly from data. This has the advantage of being able to learn the "optimal" features for a given problem in an automated way, without having to rethink the design of those features. As an example, UNet is enormously popular architecture for segmentation. For a given problem you collect some data, choose the best fitting loss function, and you usually get pretty good results. With or without some transfer learning (fine tuning of pretrained models). Otherwise, machine learning is about designing programs that solve problems by learning from data, instead of designing hand-crafted algorithms specific for a given situation. So yes, so data-driven modelling is just part of machine learning.
