The SPARK subset of Ada would be a very good starting point. SPARK inherits all good features of Ada (strong typing, easy to read, ...) with the added benefit of having no undefined features, meaning that all SPARK programs will do the exact same thing, no matter which Ada compiler has been used to compile it. SPARK can be used with no runtime. Similarly for the Ada language (see pragma No_Runtime). Of course with languages such as SPARK you are trading flexibility for safety (or security).
