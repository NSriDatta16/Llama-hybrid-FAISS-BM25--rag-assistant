Can i take average of probability (p_1) value between two regression models?

I have build two logistic regression models and I want to see I can ensemble (take average) of both models and see if performance improves? P_1(model 1) + P_1 (model 2)/ 2= average P_1 Both models have same dependent variable, but different predictors. Please help.
