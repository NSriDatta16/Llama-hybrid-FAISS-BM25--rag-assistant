How to interpret this residuals vs fitted plot for logistic regression using R

I am working on a logistic regression on some fundraising data where "gave" is a rare event (approx 3.5%). My current model has 64% accuracy on test data and an AUC of .604. When I run the standard plot(model) I am seeing some outliers on each plot that are segmented completely away from the rest of the data set. What is your first thoughts when you see segregation in the plot like this? Is this indicative of a problem or just the nature of the nature of such a rare event?
