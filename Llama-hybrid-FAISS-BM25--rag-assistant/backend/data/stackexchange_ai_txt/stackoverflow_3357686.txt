There is an R6RS compliant Scheme implementation for the DLR called IronScheme . Since IronScheme uses the DLR, it can be embedded into any .NET application using the standardized DLR embedding APIs in exactly the same way that you would embed, say, IronRuby or IronPython: dynamic Scheme = new SchemeEnvironment(); var list = Scheme.list; var map = Scheme.map; // and so on The full snippet can be found in a blog post by IronScheme's author, leppie. It also shows how to pass a C# lambda to a Scheme higher-order function and other cool stuff.
