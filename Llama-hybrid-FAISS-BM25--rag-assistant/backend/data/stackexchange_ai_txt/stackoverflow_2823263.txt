The first answer is obviously, don't use an ORM. Only application programmers think they're good. Learn SQL like everyone else :) OK, so back to reality. What's to stop you restricting all schema changes to be additions only. Then you can update the DB schema anytime you like, and only install the recompiled application until a safe time (6am works best I find) after the DB is updated. If you must remove things, perform the steps the other way round - install the new app leaving the schema unchanged, and then remove the bits from the schema. You're always going to have a high-pressure time as you roll out changes, but at least you can manage it better by doing it in 2 easier to understand pieces. Your DBAs will be ok with updating the schema for the existing application. The downside is that you have to be a lot more organised, but that's not a bad thing when dealing with production servers and you should be seriously organised about it currently.
