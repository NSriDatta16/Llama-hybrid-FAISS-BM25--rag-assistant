if its a single session, store (queue) "all the updates" in a session / global variable. Update at the end of the session. if its a multiple-session system, I would suggest doing the above and update the table at the end of each session. :(upwards of few hundred kbs, this is not a good idea): You would want to make a shortcode endcoing /decoding library to store it into the sessions vars. If we are talking about huge data. For example, if you have a drag and drop system, the intermediate states could be key<>val pair structures. eg: LOC_A=WIDGET_1 ; LOC_B=WIDGET_88 .. so on and so forth.. is this making sense?
