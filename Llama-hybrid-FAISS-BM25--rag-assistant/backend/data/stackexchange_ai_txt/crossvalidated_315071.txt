You can tell the various forecast() functions, such as forecast.ets() or forecast.Arima() (note the capital A if you want to look at the help page) to forecast up to $h$ periods ahead by specifying the h parameter. If you are then interested in accuracy over the entire holdout horizon, just feed this into accuracy . If you want to compare accuracy 1 period out against accuracy 12 periods out, just extract the relevant periods from the forecast (and the holdout actuals). Here is an example, where I use the AirPassengers dataset, holding out the last 12 observations, fitting an automatic ARIMA model and assessing average accuracy over 12 months as well as accuracy 1 and 12 months ahead: > library(forecast) > > fcst accuracy(fcst$mean,AirPassengers[133:144]) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE Test set -15.3857 53.35746 45.6625 -4.632225 9.647511 > accuracy(fcst$mean[1],AirPassengers[133]) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE Test set -8.570209 8.570209 8.570209 -2.055206 2.055206 > accuracy(fcst$mean[12],AirPassengers[144]) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE Test set -38.26647 38.26647 38.26647 -8.857979 8.857979
