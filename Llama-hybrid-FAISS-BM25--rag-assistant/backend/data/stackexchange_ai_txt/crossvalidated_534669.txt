Definition of CNN Layers

I hope you are all well. I have to present an architecture of 1D CNN today and I am a bit confused. I have a 1D Convolutional neural network Consisting of input data, 3 fully connected 1D convolution layers, flatten layer, batch normalization layer, 2 dense layers, and one output layer with a softmax activation function. I am interested in the terminology of the layers because I have to represent them in a good way.I am interested in the terminology of how the layers are called. For example the 3 fully connected convolution layers according to my opinion can be represented as just Convolution Layers, the flattening and the batch normalization layers can be represented as post-processing layers, the two dense layers can be represented as Tickening Layers and the output layer with the softmax activation function can be represented as Activation Layer. This is how I have them at the moment, If you think that I am wrong somewhere please make a comment.
