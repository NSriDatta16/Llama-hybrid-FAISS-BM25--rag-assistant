Feature and predictor are used interchangeably in machine learning today though I must admit that it seems that feature is being used more than predictor. The definition is the one on Wikipedia which you have already mentioned. The term predictor comes from statistics, here one definition: An independent variable, sometimes called an experimental or predictor variable, is a variable that is being manipulated in an experiment in order to observe the effect on a dependent variable, sometimes called an outcome variable. and my favorite definition: A predictor variable explains changes in the response. In a nutshell: X columns: features, predictors, independent variables, experimental variables. y column(s): target, dependent variable, outcome, outcome variable.
