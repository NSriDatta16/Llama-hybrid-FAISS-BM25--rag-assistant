I used the analytical method of linear regression and regressed over the data as if it was just one dataset (as proposed by James Phillips' comment on the question). I don't know if I should even post my code here since this is not stackoverflow, but it might help someone someday: import numpy as np def mult_linreg(x, y): if len(x) The result is indeed very similar to what you get when regressing the average of all datasets, but that might depend on the input
