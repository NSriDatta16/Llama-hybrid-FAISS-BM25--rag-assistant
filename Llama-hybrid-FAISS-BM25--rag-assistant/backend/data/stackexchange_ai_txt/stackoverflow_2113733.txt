In MSSQL Server, NULL columns at the end of the column list actually reduce the space required to store that row, which can increase the number of rows per page, which can reduce the number of reads required per I/O operation, which is a performance benefit. While the performance benefit may not be huge, it is something to keep in mind for any column that has a preponderance of NULL values. Proof of trailing NULLs reducing storage space can be had at Deciphering a SQL Server data page : ... The null bitmap is slightly different (fe / 1111 1110) since it's now the second column that's null. What's interesting is that in this row, only a single variable length column is present, not two. Thus there's only a single variable length column end index identifier, 0d00 / 0x000d / 13. From that we can conclude that columns are handled in order, and thus one might want to consider the order of columns, if a specific column is usually null, it might be more efficient to have it ordered last. Note that this applies only to variable-length columns. While that clearly includes varchar, varbinary, and so on, I'm not sure about other data types (and don't have time right now to conclusively determine this).
