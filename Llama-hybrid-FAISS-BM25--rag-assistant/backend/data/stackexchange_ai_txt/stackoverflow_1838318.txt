IDENTITY keys are a good practice for server-side generated keys, in environments where you don't have replication or heavy data merging. The way they're implemented, they don't allow duplicates in the same table, so don't worry about that. They also have the advantage of minimizing fragmentation in tables that don't have lots of DELETEs. GUIDs are the usual alternative. They have the advantage that you can create them at the web tier, without requiring a DB round-trip. However, they're larger than IDENTITIES, and they can cause extreme table fragmentation. Since they're (semi) random, inserts are spread through the entire table, rather than being focused in one page at the end.
