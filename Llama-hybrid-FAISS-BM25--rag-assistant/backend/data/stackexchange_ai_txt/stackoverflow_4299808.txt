What's the best way to turn a .Net class into a SQLite table?

I have a bunch of classes in a WPF application, that read data from a REST service. I've decided to save time and traffic by saving the replies that rarely change in a SQLite database. I'm planning to use System.Data.SQLite to access the db. My question is: what's the best (read: elegant, fast, nice) way to take class properties and turn it into a SQL Create statement? Yes, I can start typing and configuring, and it would take less than an hour, but Ihave a nagging feeling I am missing a trick or two here. Any reply acceptable: Visual Studio tool, Linq, a class attribute I'm missing - I am in a learning mode/mood. Thanks for your time and replies. Guy
