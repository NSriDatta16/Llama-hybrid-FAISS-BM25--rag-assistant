Mathematics of simple performance testing

I have a set of sorted tables T that have known but different dimensions. There are two types of functions in this system: f( T ) g( T , n), where n is an integer parameter. ... and two types of costs as well: c(f( T , n)) c(g( T , n)) ... and there are a few things I believe to happen on average: c(g( T , a)) T , b), for a c(f( T , a)) > c(g( T , b), for a Now, I cannot directly formulate an objective function with both c(f( T , n)) and c(g( T , n)) since the two costs are incurred at very different occasions. However, I would still want to learn something about the parameter n. What kind of analysis do you think would be helpful? So far, I recorded the c(g(T_i, n)) for all T_i under a spectrum of n's (with 3 replicates). I already learned that: |T_i| and c(g(T_i, n)) have a Pearson correlation > 0.95, for large n However, I have not done any recordings on c(f(T_i, n)) yet since it's time-expensive to obtain (which is why I decide to gather my thoughts in here before proceeding). Admittedly, I am an amataur in stats. I know how to do chi-squared, f-test, fisher's, z-test, t-test, etc on paper but this is the first time I am thinking about using them in practice. Again, any heads up on this would be appreciated. Thanks. In case the gurus here deem this question to be outside of the scope of MathOverflow, I also formulated my problem in a different way in StackOverflow here . Note: This is a repost from MathOverflow since I did not know there's a statistics section in StackExchange until a responder mentioned it.
