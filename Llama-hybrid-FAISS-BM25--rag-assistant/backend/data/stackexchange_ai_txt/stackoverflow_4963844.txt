Have you tried COEFF = princomp(x) ? COEFF = princomp(X) performs principal components analysis (PCA) on the n-by-p data matrix X , and returns the principal component coefficients, also known as loadings. Rows of X correspond to observations, columns to variables. COEFF is a p-by-p matrix, each column containing coefficients for one principal component. The columns are in order of decreasing component variance.
