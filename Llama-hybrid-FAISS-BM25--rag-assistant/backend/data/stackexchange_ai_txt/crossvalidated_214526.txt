During my research in search systems design I met that article once upon a time: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/banerjee05a/banerjee05a.pdf This paper is pretty old, but is well written and proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, they derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. But my extensive experience in solving exactly your task suggests, that when you rely totally on association of words and locations you are not in a right track. Even short twitter texts are very free form, contain slang and homonyms and if some tweet contain no toponyms at all you have no chance to reliably estimate location of tweet. I don't know what task you really solve, but if I had to estimate location from tweets, I would consider all possible sources of information and form an ensemble. Those sources could be, for example: Social connections ( if I know for sure, that for some user X his friends just checked in at Paris and user X mentioned some French toponyms in some tweets, then my prior ( in Bayesian sense ) that X is in Paris is more, that if I had no idea about X's friends location ). Also bursts of mutual amount of messeges via connections could be important. Tweets sequence for each user. No one mention Paris and Seine in each tweet just to please data scientist :-) So, in Bayesian sense you are better to increase scores for Paris for each tweet, which coincides in time with tweets with toponyms. User photos. This resource is very valuable and using recent advances in deep learning and convolutional networks it's typically very simple to uncover full potential of photos Time difference between 'typical' user tweets and tweets for last day/3 days/week. If a user is in trip over a Paris ( but typically he lives in US ) then it's likely, that his tweets will suddenly have different time zone ( during this trip ) Actually, these sources are fractal-like, and can be combined in multiple ways, so I know no better tool than ensembling these evidences.
