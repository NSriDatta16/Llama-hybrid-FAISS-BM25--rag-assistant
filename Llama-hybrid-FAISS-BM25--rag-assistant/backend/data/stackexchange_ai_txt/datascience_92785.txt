Load data from SQL for Machine Learning

I have an SQL DB which has millions of records(10 years of data) and wanted to implement some ML Models. Most of the courses/tutorials explains using a local file or downloaded CSV. But in my case I can't download all the records, but I need to load the data incrementally and train my model.How do i proceed about this? And also if i'm wrong about incremental loading of data, how do companies load data for their ML models?. I use Python language and am flexible with using libraries (scikit, tensorflow etc.) Thank you.
