Waiting for invokeLater() to be called

Is there a more elegant way to do what I'm doing below? That is, is there a more elegant way than polling and sleeping, polling and sleeping, and so on to know when a Runnable.run() method has been called via invokeLater() ? private int myMethod() { final WaitForEventQueue waitForQueue = new WaitForEventQueue(); EventQueue.invokeLater(waitForQueue); while (!waitForQueue.done) { try { Thread.sleep(10); } catch (InterruptedException ignore) { } } return 0; } private class WaitForEventQueue implements Runnable { private boolean done; public void run() { // Let all Swing text stuff finish. done = true; } }
