How to test for differences with multiple observations per subject under the same (level-2) condition?

I'm trying test for the difference in a numeric outcome (WearTime) that was measured 7 times (7 consecutive days) for each subject under the same condition (Season) that was measured at the participant level. The question I want to test is: "Does Season affect daily WearTime?" This is not a primary outcome, but more of a check for going forward to determine if Seasonality needs to be accounted for in future analyses. Data structure: 700obs, 5 variables SubjectID: 100 individuals ObservationDay: 1 to 7; Day 1 refers to 1st dat etc. Every subject has 7 days with values Date: Date of ObservationDay; 7 days in sequence spread throughout a year Season: Fall/Winter/Spring/Summer; Season when observation period began based on Date from ObservationDay 1 for that subject WearTime: 0-1440 minutes; How long an electronic device was worn by a participants on each ObservationDay My instinct for testing this is a mixed model ANOVA approach with Season as an independent fixed-effects factor, and subject ID as a random effects factor. e.g. code from R (as this is the notation I am familiar with) library(lme4) library(car) Anova(lmer(formula = WearTime ~ Season + (1 | Subject), data = df) But if WearTime is measured at level-1 (per day, per subject), should Season be classified as a level-2 (per subject) variable? Something more along the lines of: WearTime ~ (1 | Season) So my questions to you is which interpretation of the Season variable is correct? As a level-1 or 2 variable? And if the latter how would I go about testing for a difference by Season (as when I try to apply car::Anova to the above model I get an error, so I assume this is not a valid approach)? Just want to make sure I'm using the appropriate statistical approach before wrestling with code. Thanks in advance!
