It's a little more complex than just inspecting the DTD as given by Yi Jiang and mu is too short . It's true that the XHTML 1.0 DTDs explicitly forbid elements as children of elements as given in your question. However it does not forbid elements as descendants of elements. So normal text bold text linked text is XHTML 1.0 Strict DTD conforming. But it has the same behavioural difference between Firefox and Chrome as the button fragment in the question. Now, it is known that DTDs have problems describing limitations on descendant relationships, so it's maybe not surprising that the above sample is DTD conforming. However. Appendix B of the XHTML 1.0 spec normatively describes descendant limitations in addition to the DTD. It says: The following elements have prohibitions on which elements they can contain (see SGML Exclusions). This prohibition applies to all depths of nesting, i.e. it contains all the descendant elements. button must not contain the input, select, textarea, label, button, form, fieldset, iframe or isindex elements. Note that it does not contain an exclusion for the element. So it seems that XHTML 1.0 does not prohibit the element from being non-child descendant of and the behaviour in this case is indeed undefined. This omission is almost certainly a mistake. The element should have been in the list of elements prohibited as descendants of button in Appendix B. HTML5 (including XHTML5) is much more thorough on the matter. It says: 4.10.8 The button element Content model: Phrasing content, but there must be no interactive content descendant. where interactive content is defined as Interactive content is content that is specifically intended for user interaction. a audio (if the controls attribute is present) button details embed iframe img (if the usemap attribute is present) input (if the type attribute is not in the Hidden state) keygen label menu (if the type attribute is in the toolbar state) object (if the usemap attribute is present) select textarea video (if the controls attribute is present) So in (X)HTML5 the element is prohibited from being a descendant of the element.
