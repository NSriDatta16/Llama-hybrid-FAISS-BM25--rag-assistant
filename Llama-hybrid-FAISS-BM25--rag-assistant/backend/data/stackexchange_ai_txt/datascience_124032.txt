The name en_core_web_sm-3.5.0 is not a valid name for a model. This works perfectly fine: import spacy nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") ans = nlp('this is a test string') Of course, you need to download the model first (e.g. python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm ) Then, if we want to actually compute named entities: ans = nlp("I called Tom to let him know I was in Dallas") ans.ents # output is (Tom, Dallas) You can check the docs to see how to use it.
