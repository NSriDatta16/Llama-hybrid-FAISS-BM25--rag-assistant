Observing quadratic behavior with quicksort - O(n^2)

The quicksort algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n*log(n)) and a worst case complexity of O(n^2). Assuming some variant of Hoareâ€™s quicksort algorithm, what kinds of input will cause the quicksort algorithm to exhibit worst case complexity? Please state any assumptions relating to implementation details regarding the specific quicksort algorithm such as pivot selection, etc. or if it's sourced from a commonly available library such as libc.
