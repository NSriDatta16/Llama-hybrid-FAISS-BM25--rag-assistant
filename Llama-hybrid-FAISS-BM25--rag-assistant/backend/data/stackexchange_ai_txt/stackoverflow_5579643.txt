Move an IntelliJ IDEA project to Eclipse?

I'm starting work on java project. The application has no GUI and does not use any JavaEE technology (I think it is important to say). Currently I'm the only active developer. The people who did write the application before me used IDEA, in fact all project development is done in IDEA. I'm a long term Eclipse user. I'm used to it, I know most of its traits and am comfortable in it. And Eclipse is most powerful in pure JavaSE projects that have no web interface. Currently I'm struggling to cope with IDEA - don't know shortcuts, don't know how to configure it, so on. IDEA's Mac OS version is not that well done as Eclipse's. The people that chose IDEA just said Eclipse didn't feel right (when I first started using Eclipse I had the same impression, then after a few months loved it). They also write the opening curly brace on a new line which really bugs me. So I don't see any valid arguments against Eclipse. Should I move to Eclipse or give IDEA some more time?
