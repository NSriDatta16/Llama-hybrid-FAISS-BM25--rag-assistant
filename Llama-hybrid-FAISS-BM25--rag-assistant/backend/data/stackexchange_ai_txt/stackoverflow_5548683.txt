You would put this in the footer of the class group. I always prefer to bring in the two parts that make up the score, add those up then divide them to get the average. The reason for doing this is simple maths, if you take an average of an already aggregated figure you are effectively giving each score the same “weight”. This is a problem if a student has taken lots of test in that class and scored well it is giving it the same weight as someone who takes 1 test and scores 10% clearly pulling the average down when it was a one off
