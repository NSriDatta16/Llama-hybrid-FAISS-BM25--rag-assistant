Actionscript 3.0, why is it missing good OOP elements?

Anyone who has programmed with actionscript 3.0 has most certainly noticed its lack of support for private constructors and abstract classes. There are ways to work around these flaws, like throwing errors from methods which should be abstract, but these work arounds are annoying and not very elegant. (Throwing an error from a method that should be abstract is a run-time check, not compile-time, which can lead to a lot of frustration). I know actionscript 3.0 follows the current ECMAscript standard and this is the reason for its lack of private constructors, but what about abstract classes, are they not in the ECMAscript standard eather? I guess the more specific question is why does ECMAscript standard not support private constructors? Is it something that can be look forward to in the future? I have been wondering this for quit sometime, any insight will be much appreciated.
