You can use a checkable button/action(that's a QPushButton/QAction with a checkable property set to 'true) to switch between Edit & Insert mode. Then you check the state in your mouse event and insert a new item only if you're in Insertion mode. You can also distinct between mouse buttons - insert item when dragged with the right button for example Or use QKeyboardModifiers - for example: on drag + Ctrl - insert item. Hope this helps.
