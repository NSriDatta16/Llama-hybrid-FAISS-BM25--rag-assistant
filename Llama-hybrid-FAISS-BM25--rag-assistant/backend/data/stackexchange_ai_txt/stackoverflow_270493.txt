How would you make two s overlap?

I need two divs to look a bit like this: | | ---| LOGO |------------------------ | |_______________| LINKS | | CONTENT | What's the neatest/most elegant way of making them overlap neatly? The logo will have a fixed height and width and will be touching the top edge of the page.
