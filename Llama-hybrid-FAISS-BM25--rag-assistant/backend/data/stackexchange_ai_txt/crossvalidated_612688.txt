I think it is possible to simulate this simply using three independent standard uniform random variables, without any approximation or numerical interpolation or rejection sampling or use of the Lambert W function. Yves Daoust's answer used $Z= X^{\alpha+1}$ and $\gamma= \frac{1}{{(\alpha+1)\log(\beta)-1}}$ to simplify the cdf for $Z$ to $z(\gamma\log z+1)$ on $(0,1]$ and so the density to $1+\gamma +\gamma \log(z)$ . You will have $-1 \le \gamma \le 0$ . This is a mixture distribution for $Z$ , with probability $1+\gamma$ of being drawn from a uniform distribution on $(0,1]$ and probability $-\gamma$ of being drawn from a distribution with density $-\log(z)$ on the same support. Somebody previously asked about the latter distribution with an answer suggesting it might be a negative log-gamma distribution and a comment suggesting it might be a product uniform distribution as the distribution of the product of two standard uniform random variables. That is the kind of thing we want to make random samples. The R code is short and simple: rthisdist -1 and # beta positive for logarithm and Testing this against your CDF gives a convincing match (simulations in blue, your CDF in red): testalpha
