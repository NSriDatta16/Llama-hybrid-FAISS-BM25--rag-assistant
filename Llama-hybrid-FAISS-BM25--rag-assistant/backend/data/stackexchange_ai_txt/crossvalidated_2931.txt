Cross validation is a fairly common way to detect overfitting, while regularization is a technique to prevent it. For a quick take, I'd recommend Andrew Moore's tutorial slides on the use of cross-validation ( mirror ) -- pay particular attention to the caveats. For more detail, definitely read chapters 3 and 7 of EOSL , which cover the topic and associated matter in good depth.
