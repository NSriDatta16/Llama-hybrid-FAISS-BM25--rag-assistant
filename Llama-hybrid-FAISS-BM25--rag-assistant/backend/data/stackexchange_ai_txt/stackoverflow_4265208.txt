Store a signature image in Active Directory

As a part of a PDF signing system solution it is required to capture and store the signature image in a data store.I was thinking of recommending the LDAP user object jpegPhoto to store the signature jpeg file (encryption can be applied).Rather than a database since then the question is who would take ownership of the database (IT-POLICY-DEPT thinge).The AD is already owned and secure (assuming).So it would be a matter of the admins give access on SELF or appropriate permission to update to user object for a period and then once the signatures are stored then later only retrieval permission given.I am not a system admin and we are just taking about 100 users,it this a big job ? The admins are just brushing off the suggestion without giving any proper explanation ! Can some give the pros and cons if any ....:-(
