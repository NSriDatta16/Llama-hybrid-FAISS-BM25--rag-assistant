jt - there's a fantastic example of this at dave wards encosia that will allow you to leverage nice compact composition on jquery templates. take a mosey over to: http://encosia.com/2010/12/02/jquery-templates-composite-rendering-and-remote-loading/ I think it'll get you onto the path of convention over configuration on this type of thing, it did me.
