In my opinion, the reason OOP is used so widely isn't so much that it's the right tool for the job. I think it's more that a solution can be described to the customer in a way that they understand. A CAR is a VEHICLE that has an ENGINE. That's programming and real world all in one! It's hard to comprehend anything that can fit the programming and real world quite so elegantly.
