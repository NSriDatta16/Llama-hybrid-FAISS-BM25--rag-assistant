I think you should go with subject as a fixed effect since you only have 3 subjects. What is the goal of the study? If you want to test whether all 8 treatments are the same - or test particular contrasts - you could treat subject like a fixed effect block. If you want to predict the response of an as-yet-unseen subject, you need random effects. You also need a bigger sample. RE: "dependence of observations." This doesn't matter. Whether subject is treated as random or fixed, you still have repeated measures - i.e. multiple observations nested within subject. I would go with options 2 and 3, averaging response and treating subject as a fixed blocking factor. You don't lose power in the comparison between treatments because treatments are applied at the "subject" level, not the replicate level. By taking the mean of your repeated measures, you reduce the variance of your response, so you gain that way (i.e. N is smaller but so is $\sigma^2$)
