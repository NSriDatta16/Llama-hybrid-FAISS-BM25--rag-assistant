If you're going to go through the pain of moving from an existing platform to a new one anyway, look at ASP.NET MVC . The Model-View-Controller methodology is a potentially cleaner way of thinking about web development, and it achieves the separation of concerns your team seems worried about. On a different note, you make it sound like LINQ and other such technologies are crutches. They are not unless you use them that way (as in, not being able to do data access without it). They are there as a tool to make your life as a developer easier and development go faster. Knowing how it works is great, if you didn't know I would be of the mindset that you shouldn't use it. But you clearly state that you do understand it, so why not leverage it?
