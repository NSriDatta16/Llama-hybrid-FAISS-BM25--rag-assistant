PHP email verification - how do I organize a message? using html tags?

when I send a user an email verification message, how do I construct it to look something like this: How do I add links? using tags? and newlines? $message = 'Thanks for signing up!' - a newline afterwards... then blablablah *link to confirmation* I would really appreciate any kind of help in this.
