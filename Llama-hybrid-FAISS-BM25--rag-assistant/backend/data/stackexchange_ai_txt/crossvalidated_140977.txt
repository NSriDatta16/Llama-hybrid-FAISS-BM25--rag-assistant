Are sufficient statistics for regression equivalent in the frequentist and Bayesian cases?

If I have a Poisson regression such that $\lambda = \alpha + \beta t$, $\alpha + \beta t \geq 0$ $\forall t, \alpha, \beta$ and $Y_t \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_t)$ for which I have 10 observations from $t=0$ to $t=9$ then the likelihood is: $$\prod_{t=0}^9 \left\{\frac{(\alpha+\beta t)^{y_t}}{y_t!}e^{-(\alpha+\beta t)} I_{\alpha+\beta t} \geq 0\right\}$$ If I set the prior to be proportional to 1, then the likelihood is proportional to the posterior, so mathematically the expressions for deriving the MLE of $(\alpha, \beta)$ and the posterior distribution are the same. However, are the sufficient statistics the same? I know that sufficient statistics for $(\alpha, \beta)$ with regards to obtaining the MLE in the linear model are: $$\sum_{t=0}^9 y_t\ \text{ and }\ \sum_{t=0}^9 y_tt$$ for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively (which I also have trouble seeing). But does this also apply for the posterior distribution?
