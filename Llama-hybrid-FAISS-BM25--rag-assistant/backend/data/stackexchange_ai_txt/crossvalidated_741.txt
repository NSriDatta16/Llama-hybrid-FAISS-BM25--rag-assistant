The basic way to see if your data is Weibull is to plot the log of cumulative hazards versus log of times and see if a straight line might be a good fit. The cumulative hazard can be found using the non-parametric Nelson-Aalen estimator. There are similar graphical diagnostics for Weibull regression if you fit your data with covariates and some references follow. The Klein & Moeschberger text is pretty good and covers a lot of ground with model building/diagnostics for parametric and semi-parametric models (though mostly the latter). If you're working in R, Theneau's book is pretty good (I believe he wrote the survival package). It covers a lot of Cox PH and associated models, but I don't recall if it has much coverage of parametric models, like the one you're building. BTW, is this a million subjects each with one entry/exit or recurrent entry/exit events for some smaller pool of people? Are you conditioning your likelihood to account for the censoring mechanism?
