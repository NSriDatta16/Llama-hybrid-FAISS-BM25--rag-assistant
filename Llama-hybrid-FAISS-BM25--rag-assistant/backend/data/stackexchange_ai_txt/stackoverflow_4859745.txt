There is a function in boost bool equivalent(const Path1& p1, const Path2& p2); That checks if two paths are equal. That would be ideal except that there is no equivalent Does anyone see a case where this will break ... Maybe; if you have input like "../test.txt", parent path might not do what you want. I would recommend completing the path first. See "complete" in the filesystem library. Good luck --Robert Nelson
