How to quantify nature-likeness/criticality/complexity of image based on its image-statistics in code? openCV examples?

I'm trying to come up with an image statistic that quantifies the criticality of an image. Criticality is a scale that is highest when an image finds itself on a sweet spot between randomness (e.g. white-noise) and pure order (e.g. only one solid surface). This metric could indicate whether an image appears more nature-like, or are more salient to people. Something like FID (Frechet Inception Distance) kind of comes close to it, but I think there could be something more elegant based purely on image statistics, or combining a few statistics. Maybe if you have a background in information theory this could be interesting. Any suggestions? OpenCV implementations score bonus points. Thanks!
