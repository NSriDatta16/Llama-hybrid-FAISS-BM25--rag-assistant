Have you tired setting the 'fail build if it runs lonnger than x' setting? See http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD5/1.General+Settings Check this option and enter a value in minutes to enable time control on the build. If the specified amount of time is exceeded, the build is automatically canceled. This option helps to deal with builds that hang and maintains agent efficiency.
