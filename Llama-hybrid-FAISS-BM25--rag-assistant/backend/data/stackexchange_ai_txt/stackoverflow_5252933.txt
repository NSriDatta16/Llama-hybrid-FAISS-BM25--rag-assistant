There aren't any built in capabilites for manipulating the contents of a file in IsolatedStorage in this way. The responsibility for working with the contents of the file is left up to the developer. The easiest way to do what you're after is to read the entire contents of the original file, update it in memory and then rewrite the whole file, use FileMode File.Create to overwrite the existing file. (This will avoid any issues with the smaller contents being written over the larger earlier contents.)
