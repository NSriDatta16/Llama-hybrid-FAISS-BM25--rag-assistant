Apple App SKU: How do I view and change SKUs?

When I go into iTunes connect and create a placeholder for a new App, it asks me for SKU. It seems that I can pick a number out of the blue to use. However, where can I find SKUs for my existing apps? I can't find this information anywhere!!! And where can I change them? Can I? For my first couple of apps I just put in some random number to get past to the next screen. but can I subsequently reorganize everything? Yet again the attempt to navigate through Apple's application deployment process has left me in a state of frustration and bewilderment.
