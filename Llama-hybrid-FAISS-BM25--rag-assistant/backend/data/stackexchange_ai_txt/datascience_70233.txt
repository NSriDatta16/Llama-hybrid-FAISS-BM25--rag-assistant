The minimum and maximum values are just known limits that are parts of the formula that reshapes the distribution of the data, so if a value is bigger than the previously known value the resulting feature scaling (Normalization) will be still appropriate. An alternative is z-scores if you don't feel like using minimum and maximum values. x'= (x-x̄) / σ Where x is the original feature vector, x̄ is the average of the vector x is the mean of that feature vector and σ is its standard deviation.
