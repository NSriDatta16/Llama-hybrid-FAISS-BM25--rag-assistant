I'm fairly new to this myself, but have spent a lot of time recently learning about time series and hope that I can help fellow learners. If I had the reputation to comment I'd ask you a few things first, but I can't. I'll happily do further work and edit this response if you respond or make edits to your question. With those caveats out of the way: Is it useful to use the previous value as a feature? One of the first things I would say is that the correct aspects to be looking at in your data very much depends on the nature of the data, as well as what you're trying to do with it: It sounds like you have monthly values, but it's not clear how far into the future you're wanting to predict, or how much historic data you have access to. We also don't know what these two series represent, or why one time series is being used to predict the other - and without that, I don't think anyone will be able to tell you whether the previous value of the series to be predicted is valuable information or not. Any caveats to using a 6 month time window? One obvious caveat to only using the last 6 months is that if there's any seasonality over the year-long period then you're going to miss it. If you're not sure: if you have multiple years of information, try plotting the series you want to predict over multiple years. You may well be able to see whether the series generally increases or decreases at certain times of year. If you can share this plot here, it might help people answer your questions in more depth. As far as caveats about this time-window approach, I'm not too clear from your post what algorithm you're using to predict values. More information on that would be helpful; it's possible that rather than questioning what features to select, you should be questioning what methodology to use for forecasting. Helpful further reading? Once you've provided more information I'll be happy to tackle your last question on suitable reading if I'm able to. For now, I will say that there's a lot of information available, but a lot of it is academic in nature. Quite frequently papers aren't easy to digest, seem to contradict one another, or are only relevant to specific situations. This is a rapidly growing and changing field, so it's sometimes difficult to find a clear best practice or consensus opinion. That said, it might be worth looking at some of the free, online courses available to see if any would help you understand the area you're interested in: Coursera "data science" related courses
