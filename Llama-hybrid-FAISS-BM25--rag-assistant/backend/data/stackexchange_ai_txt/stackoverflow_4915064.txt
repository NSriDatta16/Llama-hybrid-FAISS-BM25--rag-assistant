Treat get_all_threads as part of model - black box - you don't need to know HOW data are fetched (is it SQL query, xml files or external api call). You are intrested in data, nothing more. As far it is not possible to get multiple tags for one thread via SQL query. Even if you remove GROUP_CONCAT you will get a bunch of records for one thread, which also gonna need parsing in some way. But according to first paragraph, you should parse data in your function. function get_all_threads($link, $start) { $threads = select_Query("SELECT thread.title, thread.id as t_id,.."); //PHP 5.3 array_walk($threads, function(&$thread) { $thread['tags'] = explode(',', $thread['tags']); }); //PHP When you do it that way, your presentation code will be clean.
