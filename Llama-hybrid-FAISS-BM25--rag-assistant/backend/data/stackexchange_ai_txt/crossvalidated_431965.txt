Sampling from/near boundary of a region in R^n

Suppose $\Omega$ is a region in $\mathbb R^n$ , and suppose we are given a function $\chi(x)$ with $\chi(x)=1$ if $x\in \Omega$ and $\chi(x)=0$ otherwise. If it helps we can assume $\Omega\subseteq B$ for some compact box $B$ and that we know two points $x_0\in\Omega$ and $y_0\in\mathbb R^n\backslash\Omega$ . Assuming we can evaluate $\chi(\cdot)$ inexpensively, does there exist a procedure for sampling points on or near the boundary $\partial\Omega$ ? I have in mind MCMC/Metropolis-Hastings procedures that target distributions that concentrate around $\partial\Omega.$ I can think of a few that might work but before formulating my own method thought I’d make sure this isn’t some classical problem I’m neglecting. It’s probably optimistic to expect to sample eg from the uniform distribution on $\partial\Omega$ since we don’t have a parameterization of this set or means of finding points there, but it’d be great if we could sample from some distribution $p_\alpha$ that concentrates on $\partial\Omega$ as $\alpha\to\infty$ . I don’t want to assume we know something like the distance to $\partial\Omega$ , just the indicator function.
