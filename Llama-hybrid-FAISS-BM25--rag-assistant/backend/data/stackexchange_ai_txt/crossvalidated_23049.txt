Does control get us closer to or farther from causation?

In logistic regression with an N of 40,000, purchase decision is unrelated to price. However, with certain demographic variables controlled, price can show a positive coefficient of meaningful strength. (Searches for 2-, 3-, and 4-way interactions involving price have yielded nothing.) The goal here is to maximize the leverage one can get out of discounting. There seems to be a real risk of confusing the "real" relationship with one that, in the words of Elazar Pedhazur, has an "air of fantasy about it" due to statistical manipulation (regression control). Any suggestions as to how to proceed?
