This can happen with Tomcat 5 if you have a WAR under your webapps directory. Tomcat has 3 modes of deployment, Context fragment. A XML file under conf/Catalina/[host] WAR. A file ended with war in appBase (normally webapps) Directory. A directory (normally exploded WAR) in appBase Looks like you are mixing 2 & 3 and Tomcat is confused. If you put war under webapps, Tomcat will explode it automatically. If you want explode it yourself, don't put WAR under webapps and Tomcat should leave your directory alone. You can also run WAR without exploding it by adding this to your Context, unpackWAR="false"
