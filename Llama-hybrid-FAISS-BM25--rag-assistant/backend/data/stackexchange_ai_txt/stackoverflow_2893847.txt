Best practice for viewflipper containing 10 linearlayouts?

I'm embarking on a GUI Activity composed of a viewflipper, which I would like to contain 10 linearlayout layouts. Is it advisable to put all of my layouts into the same XML resource/layout file? If not, is there a more organized approach to coding a viewflipper with many layouts? Will having everything in the same file come at a significant performance cost?
