Error in PCA when dealing with multi categorical variables

I am working with an insurance dataset with around 77 predictors which are all categorical with multiple categories each represented by a number for example one such variable can have 20 levels few of them are given below: " 1 High Income, expensive child 2 Very Important Provincials 3 High status seniors 4 Affluent senior apartments 5 Mixed seniors 6 Career and childcare 7 Dinki's (double income no kids) 8 Middle class families 9 Modern, complete families 10 Stable family 11 Family starters" Now i am using the stats package prcomp() over the dataset and i am getting the following error Error in svd(x, nu = 0) : infinite or missing values in 'x' My ultimate objective is to reduce the predictors to around 20 from 77 and classify who will buy a new insurance policy. can anyone help please. Thanks Dwiti
