Is it possible to adjust a logistic regression model when the false positive rate is too high for observations belonging to a specific category?

This is a hypothetical scenario for self-learning purposes (not homework), so not a lot of additional details to give than what I mention below. Let's say I have a binary logistic regression model, using various independent variables. Let's say that among these variables, there's a variable "profession". I use the model for prediction: I classify observations in a category "likely to commit tax fraud" when the model prediction for an observation is above a certain level (say 0.65). My decision rule produces a certain overall rate of false positives (say 0.1). However, I notice that the false positive rate is much higher (0.3) for people belonging to a certain profession. This happens to be a problem, and I want to correct it, that is reducing the false positive rate for this specific profession, without affecting the false positive rate for other professions. My questions are: Is the situation I describe even possible? (i.e. a false positive rate higher for some categories than for others). If it is possible, in general what are the reasons why it happens? Is there a way to correct the issue directly in the model? (e.g. by using weights, completely re-specifying the model, etc.). Or is the only solution to adjust the decision rule on a "per independent variable" basis, after the model predicted the value for an observation?
