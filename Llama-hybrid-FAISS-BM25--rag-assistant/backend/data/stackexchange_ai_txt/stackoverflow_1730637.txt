While writing semantically correct mark-up is good for organisation and management of code, and makes separation of style and code easier, I think there's a stronger motivation behind it's use. Semantically correct mark-up increases the likelihood of a machine (search engine / bot / screen-scraper or other type of script) being able to parse your content to assess it's purpose. Microformats are a logical extension to semantic markup; use of microformat standards can allow a more accurate assessment to be made.
