Checked status not updated in CheckBox template

I'm trying to create an hyperlink that changes its text depending on a boolean value. I thought I could leverage the IsChecked method of a CheckBox. So I wrote this ControlTemplate for a CheckBox: Unchecked But when I click on the hyperlink, nothing happens. The checked status is not changed and the Text property of the TextBlock is not updated. Any ideas?
