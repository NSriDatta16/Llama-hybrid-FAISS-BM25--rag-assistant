ML engineers don't know what goes on inside a neural net Sorry to contradict you, but it's true. They know how neural networks learn, but they do not know what any given neural network has learned. The logic learned by neural networks is notoriously inscrutable. The point of using machine learning is usually to learn the rules that a programmer or domain expert would not think of. This is inherently difficult to figure out. It's analogous to a conventional computer program written with one letter variable names, no comments, no obvious structure, using obscure mathematics, and all by someone who is now dead. You can step through it in a debugger, but it is still far from clear how it works. Rarely, someone does take the trouble to figure out what a neural network does. For example, the min-conflicts algorithm was discovered by analyzing a neural network trained on the N-queens problem . But it's a lot of work.
