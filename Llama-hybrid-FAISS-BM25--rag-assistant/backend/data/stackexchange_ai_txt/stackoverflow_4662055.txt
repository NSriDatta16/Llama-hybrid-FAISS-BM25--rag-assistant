You can, of course, run w/ more than 2m on 64bit java but that will not solve the issue. Btw, for Area, you probably need id (not numUsers), the number of users/friends can be obtained from list.size() Database/disk storage is a natural solution for representing a lot of object, you can alternatively use cluster of servers (beside running a huge box w/ 500+GB of memory) To answer the question you have to supply some more data: what is the point of areas/ friend graphs/etc. If you can code your own struct(ure) using ByteBuffer (which is probably not an easy task) you can go beyond the 32bit limitations by java.io.MappedByteBuffer, ScatteringByteChannel/GatheringByteChannel. However, it's not a rookie task at any rate but if you like programming, I'd advise to try your hand at. I wish you good luck with your studies.
