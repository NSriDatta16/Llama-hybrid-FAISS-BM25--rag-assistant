Can MCMC iterations after burn in be used for density estimation?

After burn-in, can we directly use the MCMC iterations for density estimation, such as by plotting a histogram, or kernel density estimation? My concern is that the MCMC iterations are not necessarily independent, although they are at most identically distributed. What if we further apply thinning to the MCMC iterations? My concern is that the MCMC iterations are at most uncorrelated, and not yet independent. The ground I learned for using an empirical distribution function as an estimation of the true distribution function is based on Glivenkoâ€“Cantelli theorem , where the empirical distribution function is calculated based on an iid sample. I seemed to see some grounds (asymptotic results?) for using histograms, or kernel density estimates as density estimations, but I can't recall them.
