I've heard of several different ways to attack problems such as this. The most simple solution I've seen is to use a Microsoft Access database and use ODBC connection to connect to both the new and old Oracle databases. You can then use Access to migrate and transform the data as you need. The more elegant solution involes installing Microsoft SQL Server Development tools. You can use Business Intelligence Development Studio to create a SSIS package with two Oracle endpoints. SSIS can handle the heavy lifting of transforming the data between the databases and you can run the package locally so you don't have to have an instance of SQL Server running anywhere. There's a tutorial series for SSIS at: http://www.developerdotstar.com/community/node/364 You might also want to check out Oracle Warehouse Builder (OWB) . The name is a little confusing, but it's Oracle's ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) package. I've never used it personally, but it might do what you're looking to do as well.
