Let me add to Bogdanovist's excellent answer that cross validation is unbiased for what it measures: the predicitive abilities of "surrogate" models with respect to the data at hand ("drawn from the same population"). the often stated pessimistic bias arises in situations where the surrogate models are on average worse than the real model, usually because of the smaller training sample size (even if the drawn from the same population assumption is true) This paper stresses the "drawn from the same population" problems, particularly the drift over time: Esbensen and Geladi: Principles of Proper Validation: use and abuse of re-sampling for validation, Journal of Chemometrics, Volume 24, Issue 3-4, pages 168-187, March-April 2010
