Why doesn't Guice from TestNG delivery recognize @javax.inject.Inject while Guice from com.google.inject package does?

I'm trying Guice. I made a simple example which is very similar to the example in the Guice Getting Started manual. But it didn't work for some time and said: Could not find a suitable constructor in mypack.ServiceUser. Classes must have either one (and only one) constructor annotated with @Inject or a zero-argument constructor that is not private. at mypack.ServiceUser.class(ServiceUser.java:14) while locating mypack.ServiceUser The problem was in imports. I attached both Google Guice and TestNG to the project. And I imported classes from org.testng.guice package. But annotation Inject was imported from the javax.inject package. After I changed that import to org.testng.guice.Inject my program began working. But after that I played with imports a little more. And I changed all org.testng imports to com.google.inject . The program still worked. After that I went back to the @Inject annotation and changed its import to javax.inject.Inject (as it was in my very first broken version). And the program worked even after that. I checked ones again: Guice from TestNG packages doesn't work with javax.inject.Inject while Guice from google packages ( com.google.inject ) works normally with it. Why is it so weird? p.s. I use last versions of both Guice and TestNG (guice-3.0-rc1 and testng-5.14.5).
