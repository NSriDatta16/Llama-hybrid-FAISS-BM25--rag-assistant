Would descriptors of the last hidden layer of two different CNN be the same?

I am given a dataset of 2D medical images. I am asked to extract image descriptors from the hidden layer of the neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. I consider to use two networks: ResNet-50 with imageNet accuracy of X and VGG-16 with imageNet accuracy of Y (X I come from an NLP background, don't hesitate to explain to me as if I was 5 years old :p
