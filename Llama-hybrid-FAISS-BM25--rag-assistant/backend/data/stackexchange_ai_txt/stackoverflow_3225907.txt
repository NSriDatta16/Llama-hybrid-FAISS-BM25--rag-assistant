I found this page/script useful when I implemented OAuth for Twitter: http://www.jaisenmathai.com/blog/2009/04/30/letting-your-users-sign-in-with-twitter-with-oauth/ I'm sure you can get this from the page I linked to, but the code I use with this class for my page is $twtrObj=new EpiTwitter($consumer_key, $consumer_secret); $twtrObj->setToken($tok, $sec); $status="I just submited new artwork! http://gravityprops.com/dragonart/artwork?action=view&id={$id}"; $update=$twtrObj->post_statusesUpdate(array('status' => $status)); $tmp=$update->response; with $tok and $sec being the token and secret for any specific user which I pull from the database. The $consumer_key and $consumer_secret are declared in a separate file which are included (in the same fashion as on the page I linked to). I put all the files I need in my PHP include folder so that only PHP can access it.
