EDIT - This question is quite old and covers different versions of the CakePHP framework. Following is a summary of which version each answer applies to. Don't forget to vote on the solution that helps most. CakePHP 3.x and 4.x - using response object ( Roberto's answer ) CakePHP 2.x - using exceptions ( Brad Koch's answer ) [preferred solution] CakePHP 2.x - setting header only ( Asa Ayers' answer ) CakePHP 1.x - using error handler ( my other answer ) CakePHP 1.x - setting header only (this answer) EDIT #2 - A more detailed answer for CakePHP 2.x has been added by Mark37. EDIT #3 - Added solution for CakePHP. (May 2018: CakePHP 3.5 did some function renaming, solution by Roberto is still valid.) By looking at the relevant API code from the previous comment, it seems you can call Controller::header($status) to output a header without redirection. In your case, the proper usage is most likely: $this->header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
