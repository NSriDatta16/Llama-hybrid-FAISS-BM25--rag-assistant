Flex/Flash alone don't support multithreading - Adobe keeps argumenting that multithreading is not necessary for most of potential flex applications and would just increase complexity for the average flex developer too much. Looking for solutions myself I have only found snippets where the task to be done simultanously gets logically cut into smaller pieces, then you run them piece by piece, letting UI get time slices in between. It might work for some but is no solution to your problem. Now to Java - using the native process api could make it work. Java process would take over some part of the processing and you would control its working writing to and reading from input/output streams which gets connected between java process and flex app. Another possibility could be inter-process socket communication (did it myself before native process api was there - works!)
