Where should I store data/state information as I switch ViewControllers?

I am just starting to develop on the iPhone and was wondering about storing data that the user is entering into my application. Question: My application is organized as: UITabController LoginViewController (UIViewController) UINavigationController CustomViewController1 (UIViewController) CustomViewController2 (UIViewController) CustomViewController3 (UIViewController) UINavigationController CustomerViewController3 (this has a UITableView that allows the user to go to a Detail View and then a Map View) How should I be storing the input from the user? When the user logs in, I need to cache their username and password, so that I can pass it to web services. Also, I have an option to allow the user to save their username and password. Where should I store this information? In CustomViewController1,2,3, I collect various input and then at some point, pass it to a web service. I need to store this and the response of the web service, so that if the user wants to cancel I have the necessary IDs to send to the "cancel" web service. How do I create a "global variable" that can be stored and then any view controller can see? Any information and code examples would be hugely appreciated to getting me long the way. I have most of the Apple iOS Programming Guide and it's supporting PDFs printed out, but those can be really intimidating to someone new on the platform just trying to get started. Thanks again!
