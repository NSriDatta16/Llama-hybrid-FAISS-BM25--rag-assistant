Seeking code highlighter recommendation for WordPress

Can anybody recommend a reliable and decently documented code highlighter for WordPress 2.6.1? I have tried Code Snippet by Roman Roan and Developer Formatter by Gilberto Saraiva. But they don't seem to work as described in the documentation and are mangling the code snippets instead of prettifying them.
