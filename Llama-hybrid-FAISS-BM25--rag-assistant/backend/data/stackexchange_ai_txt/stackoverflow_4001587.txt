If I understand your question correctly, you are trying to use LWP::UserAgent on same URLs with different query arguments, and you are wondering if LWP::UserAgent provides a way for you to loop through the query arguments? I don't think LWP::UserAgent has a method for you to do that. However, you can have a loop constructing the URLs and use LWP::UserAgent repeatedly: for my $id (0 .. 100000) { $ua->get($url."?id=21&extern_eid=".(709-$id)) //rest of the code } Alternatively you can add a request_prepare handler that computes and add the query arguments before you send out the request.
