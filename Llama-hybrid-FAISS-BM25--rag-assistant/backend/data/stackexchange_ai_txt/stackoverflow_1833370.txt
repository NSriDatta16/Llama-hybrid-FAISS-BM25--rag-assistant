The easiest and really NONSAFE (as in dead easy to crack by anyone paying a bit of attention) method of doing it: int number1; int number2; int key; //encode (we know number1 and number2 and we want to know the key) number1 = 983; number2 = 2303; key = number1 ^ number2; //decode (we know number1 and the key and we want to know number2) number1 = 983; number2 = key ^ number1; Yet again (to avoid downvotes). This method is cracked in seconds by anyone who sits down for it. It does work for clueless users (clueless as in, no math or programming background).
