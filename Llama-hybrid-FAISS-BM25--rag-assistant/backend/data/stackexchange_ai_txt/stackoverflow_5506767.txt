If you want it to be formatted as is inserted in the database you could output it to a tag to preserve formatting. If you just want to have the newline replaced by a html tag, you can do that easily: ", " "), $sanitized); Why? I use str_replace() in this case to show you how it's done. I usually don't replace the new line with a break but with a (and this is why I didn't go for a nl2br() solution) If you think you'd want paragraphs instead of line breaks, just change the replacement.
