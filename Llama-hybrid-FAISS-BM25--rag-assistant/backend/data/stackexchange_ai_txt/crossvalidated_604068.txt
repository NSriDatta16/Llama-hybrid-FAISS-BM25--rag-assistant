This paper was published in 2011 in a journal with an admittedly high current impact factor (44) that is focused on psychology review. Despite the focus area, the paper has no applied example or motivating data analysis. It's been cited less than 500 times in over 10 years, which is on the low side for an open access article. Cullen has published prolifically in the space of psychology methods and is a respectable analyst. When I see your question and consider these facts, it reveals a huge gap in my mind. This particular paper discusses a highly esoteric problem. The author gives the analyst little insight into identifying data analysis problems where the entailed method may be applicable. Considering it on the whole, there is no intrinsic reason that I, when confronted by a general longitudinal data analysis problem, would consider this issue anywhere on my list of concerns or exploratory analyses to explore. I guess that's the point that I'd like to draw to everyone's attention: open access is a problem not to ignore. For those lucky enough to get it, open access publication draws disproportionate attention to articles. Searching open access articles with the topic of longitudinal modeling, panel data analysis, or related terms on Google Scholar yields literally thousands of papers, yet they are mostly likely far from the best or most useful to study. For the eager, bourgeoning analyst it's admittedly very hard to discriminate quality articles from ones where the author had seed funds to pay for open access or had prior relationship, or intellectual ingratiation with the editor.
