I would also consider PLS as my first choice, as others suggested. Alternatively, I wonder if you could take each of these 4 variables in turn as your DV, with the other 3 as your IVs. Then you have 4 multivariate regression models. Similar to bivariate regression of x on y, or y on x, you could take some 'average' of these lines, but whether that would be an arithmetic, geometric, harmonic or other type is open for debate. Your result will then be an implicit, rather than an explicit equation in all 4 variates.
