How do I learn the methods that can be accessed for certain objects?

I have the following code: $_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('catalog/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect(array('name', 'price', 'small_image', 'status'), 'inner') ->addCategoryFilter(Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load($catid)); $_helper = $this->helper('catalog/output'); foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): echo $_product->getProductUrl(); endforeach I want to learn how I discover the methods I can use on an object. For example $_product->getProductUrl() is using the method getProductUrl() to get the url, but I need price and have no idea what method calls that. Using a print_r doesn't provide enough info for me to discover what they are. I presume they are in controllers that are located in the MAGE core. I have commerce bug and I have tired looking at: http://docs.magentocommerce.com/ But I find myself lost at times. Does anyone know a good tutorial on this or can give me direction to figuring this out?
