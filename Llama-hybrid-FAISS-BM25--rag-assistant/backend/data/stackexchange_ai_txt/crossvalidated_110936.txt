How do you interpret the parameters obtained from lasso logistic regression when the response is binary?

Are we still able to interpret the parameters in the same manner as we would in ordinary logistic regression? I'm asking this because I'm toying with the german credit data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data) and doing a lasso logistic regression model to perform feature selection. I'm using the good_bad credit variable as the response and I'm using this model with the intent of obtaining probabilities for defaulting on a loan.
