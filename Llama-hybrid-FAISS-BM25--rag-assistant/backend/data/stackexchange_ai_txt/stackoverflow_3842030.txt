C++ eof() problem - never returns true?

So I'm trying to read this file. Everything looks like it should work, but during runtime the program times out and stops working, and I have to close it. What is going on? I suspect that the oef() test is never returning true and it keeps looking for more in the file. I have no dragging empty lines in the text file. I've tried debugging this like crazy. I can't find anything wrong but it still refuses to work. Pet** petArray; ifstream textFile2; textFile2.open("pets.txt"); int i = 0; string temp; int tmpNum = 0; if (textFile2.is_open()) { while (!textFile2.eof()) { getline(textFile2, temp); petArray = new Pet*[arraySize]; if (temp == "Dogs" || temp == "Cats" || temp == "Iguanas" || temp == "Pigs") { if (temp == "Dogs") tmpNum = 0; if (temp == "Cats") tmpNum = 1; if (temp == "Iguanas") tmpNum = 2; if (temp == "Pigs") tmpNum = 3; temp == ""; } else { if (tmpNum == 0) { petArray[i] = new Dog(temp); cout Here is the format of the text file: Dogs d1 d2 Cats c1 c2 Iguanas i1 i2 Pigs p1 p2 Any suggestions?
