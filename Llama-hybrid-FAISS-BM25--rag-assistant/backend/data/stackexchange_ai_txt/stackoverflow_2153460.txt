No. Alt Text is shown as an alternative for the image when it cannot be shown. Here is an extract from the specification that is quite straight forward: Do not specify irrelevant alternate text when including images intended to format a page, for instance, alt=”red ball” would be inappropriate for an image that adds a red ball for decorating a heading or paragraph. In such cases, the alternate text should be the empty string (”"). Authors are in any case advised to avoid using images to format pages; style sheets should be used instead. Do not specify meaningless alternate text (e.g., “dummy text”). Not only will this frustrate users, it will slow down user agents that must convert text to speech or braille output. play terminals, users whose browsers don’t support forms, visually impaired users, those who use speech synthesizers, those who have configured their graphical user agents not to display images, etc. So it says pretty clear not to repeat. "Red Ball" in the first case can be replaced by "George Washington". Here is a good article how to use the alt-attribute properly: Alt attributes EDIT : Ok i think i got misunderstood. I did not say that he mustn't use an alt-attribute here. We are talkin about screen readers and accessibilty here, right? I agree the image is important to us . But is it to blind people? Or is it just decoration for the text? Remember the question was wether to repeat the name in the alt attribute. And i say "No". When images are not shown, the alt-text is displayed. I'd propably do it this way: George Washington The alt-Attribute is the alternative for when the image is not shown and not a description (we have description for this).
