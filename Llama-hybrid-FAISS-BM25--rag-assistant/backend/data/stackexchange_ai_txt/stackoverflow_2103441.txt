From an algorithm viewpoint, this is fairly simple. Each color represents a point in a 3D space, and the difference between colors is the distance between those points. Presumably the point here is to ensure that the colors are visibly different. If that's the case, deciding on the minimum distance is probably going to be fairly difficult. The problem is that (at least for people with normal vision) some differences are easier to see than others. For example, most people are more sensitive to small differences in shades of green than equally small changes in shades of red or blue. There are algorithms to take this into account, but they're based on average human vision, so none of them is guaranteed to be precisely correct for any one person. Just for fun, you might want to take a look at X-rite's online color vision test .
