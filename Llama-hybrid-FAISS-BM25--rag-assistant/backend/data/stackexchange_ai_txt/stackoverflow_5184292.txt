Regarding Ant scripts, the following is my all-in-one template of the Ant steps for building an Android app (this might be useful to others trying to translate the Eclipse build to Ant as it is much simpler and more transparent than the opaque version autogenerated with the android tools): Creating output directories if needed... Generating R.java from the resources... Compiling java files into class files... Converting compiled files and 3rd party libraries into ${dex.file} ... Packaging Android resources into ${resources.file} ... Packaging app and signing it with the debug key Packaging App without signing, so that it can be signed with the official publishing key ... All generated packages need to be signed with jarsigner before they are published. Removing all com.epicapplications APK files from default emulator ... Installing ${debug-apk.file} onto default emulator... What I am looking for is to be able to use all or fragments of this Ant build script, but still have the Eclipse integration for launching and debugging the app.
