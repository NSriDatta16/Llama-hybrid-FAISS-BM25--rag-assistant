Magento module - overridden a controller, adding templates

I am currently working on a Magento extension, and I have overridden a core controller, which works fine. I have now added a new action to my controller. Problem is that whenever I call the action a blank page is produced. If I echo something it is displayed correctly. Therefore I dug into the core of the Customer module and controllers. I saw there that methods like indexAction() implement the layout this way: loadLayout(); $this->_initLayoutMessages('customer/session'); $this->_initLayoutMessages('catalog/session'); $this->getLayout()->getBlock('content')->append( $this->getLayout()->createBlock('customer/account_dashboard') ); $this->getLayout()->getBlock('head')->setTitle($this->__('My Account')); $this->renderLayout(); } I transferred this to my own action and the layout is now rendered correctly. Now for the question: No matter what I enter into the ->createBlock('...') call, nothing is rendered into the content area. How do I specify the location of my own block to be rendered as the content of the page while still decorating it with the layout? I tried fiddling with the xml files in /design/frontend/base/default/layout/myaddon.xml but couldn't really make it work.
