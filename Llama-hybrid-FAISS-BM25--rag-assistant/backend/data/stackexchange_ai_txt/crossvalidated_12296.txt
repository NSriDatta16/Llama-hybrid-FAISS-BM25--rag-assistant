With only just these two cases, you cannot reliably estimate a treatment effect, but you can summarize your data as follows, assuming that the the number of deaths is a draw from a Poisson distribution. $$ \begin{align} &\Pr(\text{Deaths}_{it}) = \lambda_{it}(\text{Cases}_{it}) \\ &\ln(\lambda_{it}) = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i}t + \beta_{2i}t^2 + \beta_{3i}t^3 + \ldots \\ &\beta_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}\text{State}_i \\ &\beta_{1i} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11}\text{State}_i \\ &\beta_{2i} = \gamma_{20} + \gamma_{21}\text{State}_i \\ &\beta_{3i} = \gamma_{30} + \gamma_{31}\text{State}_i \\ &\ldots \end{align} $$ Where $\text{Deaths}_{it}$ are the number of deaths in $\text{State}_i$ in $\text{year}_t$; $\lambda_{it}$ is a state and year specific rate of death, and $\text{Cases}_{it}$ are the number of cases in a state in a given year; $t$ is the year of observation; and $\text{State}_i$ is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 0 for the first state and 1 for the second state. Using a Poisson regression in a general linear models package you can estimate the state specific differences in the average decline ($\gamma_{10}$ and $\gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11}$) and "acceleration" (the effect of the higher order $t$ terms), if you use orthogonal polynomials for $t, t^2, t^3, ...$. In R, you can use poly and the glm functions: glm(deaths ~ (0 + cases + cases:poly(year, 4) + state:cases + state:cases:poly(year, 4)), family="poisson", data=cfr)) With this data, including up to a quadratic term seems to amply summarize any trend.
