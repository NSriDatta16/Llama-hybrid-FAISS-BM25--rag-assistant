Encode URL with dot

I need to encode a url that contains a dot character ".". It's a ASP.NET MVC routing, but the url contains a ".". Is there a way? For example, I'm trying to get this url: "/Products/Beverages/Drink.Best/Teste" There's a "." in that... And I need to encode that... is it possible? Thanks!
