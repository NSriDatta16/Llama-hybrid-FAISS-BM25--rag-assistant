Can this be done using a Hibernate Filter?

In my application I have Documents and Comments . A Comment belongs to exactly one Document , a Document can have several Comments . I have a fairly complicated named query on my Documents : The result set of this query should now be filtered according to several criteria. Unlike all the examples I could find on Hibernate Filters these properties are not in the Document class but in the Comment class. For example I would like to be able to add a filter which only shows me the Documents from the result set which have Comments by a particular author or which have Comments that were added on a certain date. Or both aforementioned restrictions. Right now I do it like this: This is a very ugly way to achieve my goal. Can I do this with a hibernate filter? I understood that filter is only a thin wrapper for additional where arguments, in my case I would need some sort of join . If it can't be done using a filter can you point me towards a different solution, I think this is a fairly common problem and I think that writing a query for each and every possible combination of restriction criteria is far from elegant.
