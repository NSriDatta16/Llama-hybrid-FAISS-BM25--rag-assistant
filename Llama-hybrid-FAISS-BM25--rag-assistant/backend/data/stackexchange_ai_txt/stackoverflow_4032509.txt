Javascript - animation stops as new one is started

I have a UL on a page and on the click of a button I am appending an li and fading it in. This works fine for single clicks. However, when the button is clicked twice, the first animation immediately stops and the second completes. I have setup a test page to demonstrate this: http://anttears.co.uk/test (the test page has been tested in FF only) Putting a console.log in the setOpacity function for the value of elem seems to show the javascript working as expected - both li's reaching opacity=1. However, the first li seems to be a fragment dissasoiated with the actual DOM. I am deliberately trying to get this working without the usual libraries, as a learning experience. Any help greatfully appreciated... Ant
