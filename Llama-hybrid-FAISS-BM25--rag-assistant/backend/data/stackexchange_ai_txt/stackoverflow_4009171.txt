Class variable which is object of this class

The title can be confusing, but I'm wondering is it possible to create program like this one: class family_tree { private: string name, surname; family_tree father(); //fragile point! public: family_tree(); family_tree(string n, string sur"); void print(); }; What does the standard say about such declaration? What the good habits of programming saying about it? Is it dangerous? What is more I can't use the second constructor: family_tree father("A","B"); compiler: expected identifier before string constant expected ',' or '...' before string constant
