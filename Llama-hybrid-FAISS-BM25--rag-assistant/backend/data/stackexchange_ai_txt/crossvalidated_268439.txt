You got off on the wrong track as detailed here . Just because you have a binary $Y$ it doesn't mean that you should be interested in classification. You are really interested in a probability model, so logistic regression is a good choice. Get the nomenclature right or you will confuse everyone. To the main point, the theory of statistical estimation shows that in the absence of outside information (which would make you use Bayesian logistic regression), maximum likelihood estimation is the gold standard for efficiency and bias. The log likelihood function provides the objective function. You may have confused a loss/cost/utility function with estimation optimization. Get the optimum estimates using maximum likelihood estimation or penalized maximum likelihood (or better Bayesian modeling if you have constraints or other information). The a utility function comes in when needing to make an optimum decision to minimize expected loss (maximize expected utility). But I don't think you are asking about decision analysis. So stick with the gold standard objective function - the log likelihood.
