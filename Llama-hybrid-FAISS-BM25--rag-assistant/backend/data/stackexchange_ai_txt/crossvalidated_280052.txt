confidence interval for autocorrelation of t-distributed residuals

According to theory, R(1), the lag-1 autocorrelation of the residuals from a model fit to a time series of length n, lies in the interval ( z(0.025)/SQRT(n), z(0.975)/SQRT(n) ) 95% of the time when the residuals are uncorrelated and identically Normally distributed. What is the corresponding interval when the residuals are non-Gaussian, e.g., t-distributed with v degrees of freedom? It is simply a matter of calculating ( t(0.025,v)/SQRT(n), t(0.975,v)/SQRT(n) ) or is it more complicated than that? Thank you! Edit: Actually, based on doing some simulations, suggests that ( z(0.025)/SQRT(n), z(0.975)/SQRT(n) ) is the more likely to be the correct confidence interval. Perhaps R(1) is asymptotically Gaussian even though the residuals are not, due to the central limit theorem.
