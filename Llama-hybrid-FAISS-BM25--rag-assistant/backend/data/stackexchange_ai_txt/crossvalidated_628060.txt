Stationarity and structural breaks in STAR models

I have two theory questions about Smooth Transition Autoregressive Models that I can't seem to answer conclusively from reading the literature. It seems to me that a time series that switches regimes smoothly could well appear to have a unit root or a structural break by definition. Do the models (LSTAR and ESTAR for example) require stationary data? Must I test for structural breaks before estimating?
