How can I make this old JavaScript/ASP Classic code (clean) unobtrusive, using JQuery?

I'm a working on a old system that is using ASP Classic scripting. In the ASP Classic file I have this code fragment which renders a part of a table: 0 then %> , this);" title="Click to show bid history"> 0 The JavaScript I have for onClick event is as follows: function fetchBidHistory (pListedPlatesId) { var d = new Date(); var t = d.getTime(); $.get('/auction/includes/new-bidhistory.asp?lplateid=' + pListedPlatesId + "&xx=" + t, function(data){ $('#BidHistory').html(data).animate({opacity:1.0}, 400); }); } function showBidHistory(pListedPlatesId, pObj) { var lyrBidHistory = $('#BidHistory'); //Populate the DIV fetchBidHistory (pListedPlatesId); } As you can see I have managed to implement some JQuery into it. I am aiming to make the JavaScript unobtrusive as possible. Also I'm having trouble getting DIV#BidHistory to disappear once it is visible??? Is there a way to get this done? Any Ideas? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks
