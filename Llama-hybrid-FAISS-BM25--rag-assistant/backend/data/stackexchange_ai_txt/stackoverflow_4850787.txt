Are performance counters the best way to implement and average per second count?

I want to include some sort of performance counts in my application. Are Windows Performance counters (Perfmon) counters the best way to go. I am just worried that maybe it is too much overhead for what am I wanting which is just a simple average per second count. Is it better to just roll my own?
