ASP.NET Data Caching and how to invalidate

My web application is using the asp.net cache object to store data from the database. I am looking for an elegant to invalidate cache objects but haven't come up with anything elegant yet. It is easy to invalidate a single record or a list of all records in a single table, by keeping track of their cache keys. However I may have any number of lists of subsets of a table's data. I would like to invalidate only the cache records of the lists that contain a particular record, when that record changes. I don't want to have to invalidate all the lists of data for that table if only one of the lists contain that record. I have tried SqlDependency and not happy with it as I've run into a lot of issues. Do you have any idea how to attack this problem? Thanks in advance!
