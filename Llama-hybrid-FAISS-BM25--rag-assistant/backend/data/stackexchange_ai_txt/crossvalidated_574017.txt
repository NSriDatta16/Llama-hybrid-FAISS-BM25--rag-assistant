XGBoost and how to input feature interactions

I have a dataset with 3 features of interest. Within the boosting (and specifically XGBoost) framework, if I want to account for all possible interactions between the features, does this need to be included in the input matrix X? Or would I simply input the 3 features of interest, and XGBoost would consider the interactions. I have searched into this, but most of the results are regarding feature interaction constraints. But the fact that you can impose such constraints makes me think I do not need to explicitly include the interaction columns between features.
