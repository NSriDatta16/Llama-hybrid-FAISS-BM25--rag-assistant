Inconsistences when comparing linear regression models with advanced features in Python

Good morning ! I am learning how to do linear regression models with python and I encountered difficulties when widening a model to some advanced featues I have a set of data for housing sales depicted in the following graph : And actually with several features : \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline id & price & bedrooms &bathrooms& sqft_living& sqft_lot& floors& waterfront\\ \hline 7129300520 & 221900 & 3 & 1 & 1180 & 5650 & 1 & 0\\ 6414100192 & 538000 &3& 2.25 & 2570 &7242& 2& 0\\ 5631500400 & 180000 & 2 & 1 & 770 & 10000 & 1 & 0\\ \hline \end{array} And a few more like \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline view &condition &grade & sqft_above & sqft_basement & yr_built & yr_renovated &zipcode& lat\\ \hline \end{array} The original attempt I did a linear regression, (I don't perfectly understand how does this work, especially the itereations and passes, but here is what I coded) : sqft_model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='price', features=['sqft_living'],validation_set=None) I was then able to predict the future prices : plt.plot(test_data['sqft_living'],test_data['price'],'.', test_data['sqft_living'],sqft_model.predict(test_data),'-') An advanced attempt Now, going back to the original dataset, I built a model using the following features advanced_features = [ 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'zipcode', 'condition', # condition of house 'grade', # measure of quality of construction 'waterfront', # waterfront property 'view', # type of view 'sqft_above', # square feet above ground 'sqft_basement', # square feet in basement 'yr_built', # the year built 'yr_renovated', # the year renovated 'lat', 'long', # the lat-long of the parcel 'sqft_living15', # average sq.ft. of 15 nearest neighbors 'sqft_lot15', # average lot size of 15 nearest neighbors ] I then did : sqft_model_homemade = graphlab.linear_regression.create(test_data, target='price', features=advanced_features,validation_set=None) But when trying to plot it here is what it returned : plt.plot(test_data['sqft_living'],test_data['price'],'.', test_data['sqft_living'],sqft_model_homemade.predict(test_data),'-') This seems so incoherent. Can you help me understand if I coded a mistake in the second linear regression
