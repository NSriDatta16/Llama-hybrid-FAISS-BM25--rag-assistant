Am I geting a structure copy here?

Here is a fake code sample vector gFred; { // init gFred Fred &fred = gFred[0]; size_t z = 0; do { fred = gFred[z]; // do odd processing with fred z++; } while (fred.lastElementInSet == 0); } The thing that caught my attention was the fact that gFred[0] was being overwritten. This leads me to think that rather than init fred as a reference to a new element, fred = gFred[z]; What is actually happening is that gFred[1] is overwriting gFred[0]. I'm thinking the correct thing to do here, is whap myself upsida head a few times, and turn this into a pointer implementation and move on with my life. Have I diagnosed this correctly? or do I need more education?
