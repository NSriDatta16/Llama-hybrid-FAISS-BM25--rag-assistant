The directed acyclical graph that represents your structure is what leads to your result here. The structure says that the joint probability function can be factored as follows $$ f(x, p, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) = f(x | p, q) f(p, q | \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) $$ as a result, you have $$ f(x, p, q | \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) = \frac{f(x, p, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)}{f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)} = $$ $$ = \frac{f(x | p, q) f(p, q | \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)}{f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)} = f(x | p, q) f(p, q | \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) $$ Here the first step uses Bayes' Theorem and the second step uses the factorization of the network given the structure. In fact, it seems your structure allows even more factorization, as $p$ is conditionally independent of $\gamma$ and $\delta$, given $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and something similar holds for $q$: $$ f(p, q | \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta) = f(p | \alpha, \beta) f(q | \gamma, \delta) $$ Hope this helps!
