The decision function of an SVM is $$ f(x) = \mbox{sgn} \left ( \sum_i y_i\alpha_i K(x,x_i) +b \right ) $$ For a data point in your training set, $x_j$, this will look as follows: $$ f(x_j) = \mbox{sgn} \left ( \sum_{i,i\neq j} y_i\alpha_i K(x_j,x_i) + y_j\alpha_j K(x_j,x_j) +b \right ) $$ Now, observe that $\lim_{\gamma \rightarrow \infty} K(x_j,x_j)=1$ $\lim_{\gamma \rightarrow \infty} K(x_i,x_j)=0$ for all $x_i\neq x_j$ Therefore, for sufficiently large $\gamma$, the decision for a point in the data set will be made based on its own label only, as the summation over the rest of the points will become negligible. The data layout does not really matter. It will just require larger values of $\gamma$ if some points are very close to each other.
