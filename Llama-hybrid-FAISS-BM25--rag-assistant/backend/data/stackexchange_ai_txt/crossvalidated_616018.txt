You can make an estimate based on the base levels of each risk and the risk ratios of each risk. $$\text{All cause risk} = \sum \text{individual risks}$$ With your table you can compute the average individual risks, as you have the number of events among a group of a particular size. You may also compute how those individual risks change as function of the alanine factor. One problem, is that your table does not show the distribution of alanine. That is necessary in order compute the risks for the different groups. Example: Say you have a group of $n_1$ smokers and $n_2$ non-smokers among which $y_1$ die because of lung cancer and the risk ratio for this is $3:1$ . And $y_2$ die because of diabetes and the risk ratio for this is $3:4$ . Then the ratio of all cause death is dependent on the size of $n_1$ and $n_2$ . Example say, with the above ratios you have the deaths Group deaths + cause 20000 total 200 cancers 20000 total 105 diabetes 20000 total 305 total This could be a situation like Group. deaths + cause 10000 smokers 150 cancers 10000 non smokers 50 cancers 10000 smokers 45 diabetes 10000 non smokers 60 diabetes 10000 smokers 195 total 10000 non smokers 110 total Or just as well Group. deaths + cause 5000 smokers 100 cancers 15000 non smokers 100 cancers 5000 smokers 21 diabetes 15000 non smokers 84 diabetes 5000 smokers 121 total 15000 non smokers 184 total In the first case the all cause risk ratio is $195/110 \approx 1.77$ , in the second case it is $121/(184/3) \approx 1.97$ . So depending on the number of smokers and non-smokers in the experiment the table relates to a different all cause death risk ratio. The same principle is true for your case with alanine (and it will be even more complicated in your case since the example of smokers vs non-smokers is a dichotomous division and your case with alanine is probably some continuous distribution).
