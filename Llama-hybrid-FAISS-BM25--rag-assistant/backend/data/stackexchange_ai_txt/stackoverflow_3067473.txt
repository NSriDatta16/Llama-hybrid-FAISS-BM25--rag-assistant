Anyone having a similar issue with IE6 and responseText where responseText is a weird square looking character... it's the same problem! Just found this out after hours of searching. Solution is to send your response with no Content-Encoding. In PHP for example, use the following header: header('Content-Encoding: none'); Thanks to White Dragon for finally solving this for me.
