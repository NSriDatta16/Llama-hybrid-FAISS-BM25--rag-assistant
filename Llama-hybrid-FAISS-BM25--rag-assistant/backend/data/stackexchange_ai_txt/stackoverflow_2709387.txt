I think this might be as the PictureBox is not a control container. So this implies that when you drag the button picture box onto the main picture box, it is not actually a child of the picturebox, but rather of the form. You would notice that if you were to do he same with a panel (set the form blue, panel background image, and place the button picture box control on the panel) it would show transparent to the panel control. Why not rather set the Form BackgroundImage , avoid the Huge Picture Box , and set the small picture box on the form itself.
