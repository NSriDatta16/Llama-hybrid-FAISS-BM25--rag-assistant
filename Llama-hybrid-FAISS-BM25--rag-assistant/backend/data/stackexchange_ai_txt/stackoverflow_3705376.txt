Need help trying to EagerLoad some data in EntityFramework

I'm trying to do some eager loading on an EF Entity. so, if the entity is called Orders .. then I guess i would do the following... _someContext.Orders.Include("Whatever") .... But the problem is, I have a method like the following ... public IQueryable Find(Expression > predicate) { return CurrentContext.Orders.Where(predicate); } which works great .. but can i leverage the Expression predicate to include the Include("whatever") in there, instead of having to add another method parameter?
