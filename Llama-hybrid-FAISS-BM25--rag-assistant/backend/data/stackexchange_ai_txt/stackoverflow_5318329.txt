How Fragments handle touches?

I am playing with android's Fragments and I found something that didn't make a lot of sense to me. I am using the compatibility package and testing on a nexus one with 2.3.3 since I don't have a motorola xoom yet. My issue is: When I replace a fragment with another, the one in the back continues to receive the touches. Here's the code to reproduce. I have a list of items and when you press a row a new fragment will be created and shown. BUT if you touch the green fragment, it will be received by the ListFragment , increasing the amount of back buttons press I have to make to go back to the ListFragment . Can someone explain why? EDIT: As CommonsWare suggested, I deleted the code pasted here since I opened this as an issue in the android issue tracker and you can download the demo project from there.
