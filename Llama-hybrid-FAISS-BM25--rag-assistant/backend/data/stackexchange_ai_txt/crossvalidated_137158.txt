Christmas and other holidays will probably affect all variables strongly, so you could just fit a model for these type of day or come up with ad-hoc rules. These are more anomalies than seasonal factors. It's hard to model these dates and probably pointless. An idea to deal with this could be to compute the L1 trend filter of the yearly probabilities of each state and use it as a measure of local tendency. However, if your models are fit monthly you wouldn't have much data for this, it's just an idea of an "ad-hoc" limit/rule. You mention having seasonal factors affecting your probabilities. I guess something reasonable to asume is there is less involuntary churn in january & february (summer holidays where I live) and things normalize in march. Let's imagine thats the case. In that case, I would fit a model for these months (for each transition), that are somehow special using similar months to train the model. There you would have a similar framework to the one you currently have, having a model per transition per season. I like this set up, there are some trivial non-linearities that a single model would find hard to find. Regarding your questions: I don't think the markov chain helps here, the problem is having good estimates of the probabilities (I believe). I wouldn't go for the time series models. You have panel data, therefore you should be able to design features to capture seasonal effects o just fit models for different seasons in case this works with your data. It's hard to discuss it withouth knowing the data or business anyway, hope this helps!
