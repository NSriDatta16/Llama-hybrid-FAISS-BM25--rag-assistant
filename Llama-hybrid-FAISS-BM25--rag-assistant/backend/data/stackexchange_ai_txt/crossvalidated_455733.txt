No, they don't. But they're similar. In ML the learning bias is the set of wrong assumptions that a model makes to fit a dataset. That can be thought of as a measure of how well the model fits the training dataset. On the other hand, the regular statistic bias is mathematically defined as the average of the absolute error of an estimator. If this number is zero the estimator (or model) is unbidden, if it is positive then the estimator is positive biased, which means the on average the estimation (or predictions) will be always higher than the true value. They're different because a model can have learning bias (it doesn't fit perfectly the data set) but it is unbiased (the average absolute error is equal to zero, or very close to zero) .
