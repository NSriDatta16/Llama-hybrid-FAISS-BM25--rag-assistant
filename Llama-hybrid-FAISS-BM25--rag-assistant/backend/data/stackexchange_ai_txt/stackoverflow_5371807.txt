Your function hash_function isn't actually returning a value. You should pay more attention to your compiler's warnings! Apparently it happens to have the effect of returning the first character in the string. This is purely arbitrary. On another platform it might always return zero, or cause your computer to explode. (Probably not actually the latter.) As for making a better hash function: once you fix this bug, you'll no longer find that the hash value depends only on the first character. However, you will find e.g. that "Brian" and "Brain" hash to the same value. That's the next thing you should think about.
