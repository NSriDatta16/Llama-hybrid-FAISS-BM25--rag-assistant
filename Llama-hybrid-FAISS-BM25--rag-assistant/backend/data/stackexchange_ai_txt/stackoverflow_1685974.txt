How to capture blocks of repetating text using regular expression?

I want to select blocks of text within given string. These blocks of text have almost similar pattern. For example, in text given below I want to capture line starting with "client" i.e. I want to select information of 3 clients given in text below. Sometimes this information may not start with word "client", it may start with word "customer" or "project title" or "employer" words. 1. Client Name The XXX Company Title Application Dev Office Period September 2008 Till date Role Quality Analyst Lead Responsibilities Testing Client Name The XYZ Company Title Application web Period September 2009 Till date Role Quality Tester Lead Responsibilities Testing and destroying 3) Client Name The 1234 Company Title Application web RIA Period September 2209 Till date Role Quality Lead Responsibilities Developer I have created one regular expression for this and it is as follows : (\n|\r|\a|\f)(\s|\d|\.)*? (? (Client|Customer|Role|Organi(s|z)ation|Vendor|Company|Employer)) (\s|\S)*?(?=(\n|\r|\a|\f)(\s|\d|\.)*?(\k'id'))*? I have used (\n|\r|\a|\f) because when I load text from file into string variable, ^ is not able to identify these characters. Problem with this regular expression is that, it is able to identify information of first two clients, but its not able to identify last client's information. Anyone knows how to develope regular expression for this? I am using C# for this. Thanks in advance. ------------------ EDITED PART ------------------- I need to develop regex like, if client related information starts with word "client", then look if there r words like "role","enviornment", "vendor" are present.If such words are present, then only we can say that it is client related information. But in some cases this information can start with other words like "employer". In this case we still have to search for words like "role","enviornment", "vendor". That is the reason I created my regex like (? (Client|Customer|Role|Organi(s|z)ation|Vendor|Company|Employer)) If word "client" matches, then any of the words except "client" should match in subsequent text. If any of the words is found, then again start looking for "client".
