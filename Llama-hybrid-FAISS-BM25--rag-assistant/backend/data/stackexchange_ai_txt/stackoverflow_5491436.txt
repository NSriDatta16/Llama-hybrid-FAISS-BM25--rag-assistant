My experience is that using a good, clean 3rd party control set does increase productivity, especially if the control set includes features which are required by your project. For example, I'm currently using Telerik's WPF controls, and the Data Grid control alone has probably cut our total development time in half (for the specific project where it's needed), as it automatically handles things that are a pain to setup by hand using the standard DataGrid class. That being said, if we hadn't used that class, the difference would have been minimal. There still would have been an improvement, especially given some of the improvements for data input (ie: nicer numeric controls), but the change would have been far less dramatic. I would recommend, however, that you take the learning curve into account when choosing a product suite. Telerik's WPF products, for example, have a relatively low learning curve, as they are designed much like the standard WPF controls. My experience with DevExpress's WPF controls, on the other hand, are quite different - pretty much the opposite extreme. DevExpress tends to lend itself towards using their control suites nearly exclusively, and have a custom workflow in place. Once you learn this, it's quite nice - but they're different than using standard controls, and tend to be fairly pervasive in terms of where and how they're used. Infragistics and ComponentOne fall in the middle of these two extremes, from my experiences.
