If it seems like most of the outliers are to the far right you could decide on a threshold including most of the datapoints to the left and censor all values to the right of that threshold. It would be akin to trimming but without introducing a bias. I don't know how you would run such an analysis in a classical statistics framework but it is "pretty easy" using Bayesian statistics
