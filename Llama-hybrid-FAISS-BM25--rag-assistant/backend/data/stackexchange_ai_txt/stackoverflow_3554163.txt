As Gangadhar says, it's hard to know definitively which part of the netloc is the tld, but in your case I would modify Amber's code slightly. This will sort on the entire domain, by the last level first, then the second to last level, and so on. This may be good enough for what you need without needing to refer to external lists import urlparse def get_reversed_domain(domain) return urlparse.urlparse(domain).netloc.split('.')[::-1] sorted_list_of_domains = sorted(list_of_domains, key=get_reversed_domain) Just reread the OP, if the list is already just domains you can simply use sorted_list_of_domains = sorted(list_of_domains, key=lambda x:x.split('.')[::-1])
