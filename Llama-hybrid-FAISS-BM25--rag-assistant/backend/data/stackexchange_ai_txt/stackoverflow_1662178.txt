Drupal - After each user login, how can I redirect to a user-specific page?

What we need: redirect to each user's specific page after their login. What we have tried: Login Toboggan module: can be direct to each user's profile page, however we do not where to define specific node, i.e node 15 for user David. If you have experience on this, please advise. Nodeacccess: generic access control defined to each content type. Any other suggestions?
