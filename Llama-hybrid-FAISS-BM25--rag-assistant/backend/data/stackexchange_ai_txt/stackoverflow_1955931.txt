We had that same problem and ran into the same issues you ran into. We ended up switching our reporting to Analysis Services. There is a learning curve with MDX and Analysis services itself, but it's been great. Some of the benefits we have found are: You have a lot of flexibility for querying any way you want. Before we had to build specific aggregates, but now one cube answers all our questions. Storage in a cube is far smaller than the detailed data. Building and processing the cubes takes less time and produces less load on the database servers than the aggregates did. Some CONS: There is a learning curve around building cubes and learning MDX. We had to create some tools to automate working with the cubes. UPDATE: Since you're using MySql, you could take a look at Pentaho Mondrian , which is an open source OLAP solution that supports MySql. I've never used it though, so I don't know if it will work for you or not. Would be interested in knowing if it works for you though.
