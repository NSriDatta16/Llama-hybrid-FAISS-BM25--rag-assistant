When should we use jaccard score?

I am a newbie in Machine Learning, I trained a binary classifier for bank loan prediction through Logistic Regression. I measured the accuracy of it with two methods: accuracy score and jaccard index. Accuracy score returns a value of 0.91 whereas jaccard score returns a value of 33. Why is jaccard sore showing such a low value.(Ik it is a really stupid question, but it would be really good if you could help me out)
