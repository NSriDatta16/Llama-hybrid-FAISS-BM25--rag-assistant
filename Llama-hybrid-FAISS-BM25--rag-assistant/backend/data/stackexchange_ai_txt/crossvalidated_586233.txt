Because latent factor is not an observed phenomenon (at least in the current analysis) but is a construct or essense, it could be postulated literally for any correlation observed between phenomena. Including your example "job quality vs salary received" (everything depends on your imagination - what might be such a factor). Even in a linear regression between two phenomena, $X$ and $Y$ , the prediction $\hat Y$ can be interpreted as a latent variable within the observed $X$ in this instance, which is the cause of correlation between $X$ and $Y$ . Moreover, we could further assume that there is noise within $X$ besides the latent factor in it, and so to turn to an "errors-in-variables" approach in regression. Is it a completely theoretical problem? Mostly, it is a theoretical. Please glance on the picture in the footnote 2 in this answer . A correlation between two variables could be explained: a) there is one common factor, b) there are two independent common factors, c) there are two common factors, correlated (we can allow for correlated factors in a Factor analysis). Note that case (c) becomes close to declaring each variable its own "latent factor", in which case "latent" becomes indistinguishable from the "observed". So there is more dialectics than math. In a latent variable technique such as factor analysis we assume all the analyzed variables have to do with the latent factors, because the latents are extracted from their collection; but they are loaded by the latents by different amount, depending on the correlations. (A zero correlation in a collection of two variables - a toy example - produces loadings .707 by PCA but .000 by Exploratory FA by principal axes method, on both variables. That says that the method of extraction of the latents is important: PCA in this example clearly spoils the job while FA is adequate.) A good related question for you to check (nuances in terminology): What's the relationship between covariance, shared variance, and common variance? We can, but we do not have to assume latent factor to account (for) a correlation. For example, if we want to compute a distance between two respondents (x and y) by some correlated features and we want our distance to incorporate/express, rather than ignore, the condition of the correlatedness, we might: perform PCA (or factor analysis), to extract one or few latents, and then compute euclidean distance in the space of these latent(s) only; don't extract the latents, but compute the distance in the frame of original variables, but in oblique axes (angles between them to reflect the correlations): $d_{xy} = \sqrt{(x-y)'R(x-y)}$ (Butler's distance, R is the correlation matrix). These two are both reasonable, quite different solutions.
