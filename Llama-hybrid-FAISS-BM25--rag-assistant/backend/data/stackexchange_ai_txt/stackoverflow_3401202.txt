Custom Assembly in SSRS 2008

I created a custom assembly that I'm trying to run in my SSRS 2008 project. This is a simple static method in a class: namespace Utilties { public class Expressions { public static string SayHello() { return "Hello Test!"; } } } The project compiles into an assembly. Then I go to Report > Properties and add the assembly there and in the following location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies My understanding is that by default, the assembly already has execute permissions as I do not intend on adding Code support using CAS. I inserted a textbox in my report with the expression: =Utilities.Expressions.SayHello() But when I build, I get an error: [rsCompilerErrorInExpression] The Value expression for the textrun ‘Textbox16.Paragraphs[0].TextRuns[0]’ contains an error: [BC30451] Name 'Utilities' is not declared. Is there an additional step I'm missing?
