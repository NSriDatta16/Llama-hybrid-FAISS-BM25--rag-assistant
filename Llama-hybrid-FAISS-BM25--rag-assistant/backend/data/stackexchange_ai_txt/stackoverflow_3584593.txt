All this ways for terminating application are too complex and they useful in different scenarios, but not in yours. You may slightly redesign your application to solve you problem in more elegant way. In main method you may show login form and if users click "cancel" button, then you simply exit from your main method. Otherwise you show you main form: class Program { static void Main(String[] args) { if ( Login.Show() ) { //Show main form for your application } //otherwise you simply return from Main method } } This behaviour more clear and simple. And in most cases main form is too hevyweight, so your user should wait more time to see first window from your app.
