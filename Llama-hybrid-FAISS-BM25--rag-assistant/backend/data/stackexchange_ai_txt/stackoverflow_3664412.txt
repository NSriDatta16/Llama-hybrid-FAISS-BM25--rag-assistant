JQuery - Detect support for CSS 'display: table-row-group'

So, Internet Explorer table-row and table-row-group values for the CSS display property (amongst others). I'm reticent to use JQuery's browser detection features as these have been deprecated. How can I detect table-row-group support in JQuery without parsing the browser/user-agent string? That is, how do I detect the presence of the feature rather than the presence of a specific browser?
