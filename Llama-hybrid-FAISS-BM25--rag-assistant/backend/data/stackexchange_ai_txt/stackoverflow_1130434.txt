Mysql Storing Serialized Array

I have 3 Tables: Regions Table which has 1500 Towns in it. Categories Table which has 1800 categories. Companies Table containing businesses. What I need to do is grab a town, for example Brimingham and list in an Array which categories have businesses using our main Companies Table, so we don't have any categories stored in the array which don't have businesses in Brimingham. The problem I have is the size of the array being stored, when I populate all the towns with the serialized array I cant even open the table to browse. See below array example: a:9:{s:8:"Bailiffs";s:1:"1";s:20:"Business Consultants";s:1:"1";s:25:"Car Garages and Mechanics";s:1:"1";s:35:"Farming Livestock and Other Animals";s:1:"2";s:19:"Fashion Accessories";s:1:"1";s:6:"Hotels";s:1:"1";s:20:"Post Office Services";s:1:"1";s:13:"Schools State";s:1:"1";s:14:"Wood Craftsmen";s:1:"1";} Can anyone suggest an alternative solution? Cheers
