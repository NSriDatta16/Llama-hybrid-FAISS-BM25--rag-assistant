QSlider Value Changed Signal

I'm using a QSlider (v4.6) for input as well as to provide feedback to the user. For the feedback I will be calling the setValue method. I'm trying to find a signal that will fire only if the user modified the value. The valueChanged signal fires when the user changed the value as well as when I call setValue. sliderMoved only fires when the user drags the slider (not when using the keyboard). I checked the API docs and can't seem to find anything. Am I missing something? This seems something that would be common. If there is no other signal, how would you recommend that I simulate this functionality? Should I set a flag before calling setValue, disconnect and reconnect the signal every time I call setValue...?
