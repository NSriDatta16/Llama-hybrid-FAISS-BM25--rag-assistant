What are some deep learning models use in timeseries forecasting that include context from covariates?

I was going through the literature for time-series forecasting using DL and all the methods I read about only use the variable of interest at previous timesteps to predict the same variable at time step (t+1). I didn't find any method that includes covariates information in one way or the other except in the Temporal Fusion Transformer. Can anyone suggest to me some models/articles that include covariates information in deep learning models preferably? Thanks in advance
