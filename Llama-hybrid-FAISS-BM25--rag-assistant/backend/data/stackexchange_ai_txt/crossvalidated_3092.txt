I work in a related area using what is called the Population Approach, in pharmacometrics. Basically you have a sample of individuals from the general population, and a moderate-size sample of observations of each individual, plus demographic covariates for these individuals. To model them, we want to make levels of model. We want to make an overall model that applies to the individuals that we hope will be representative of the entire population. The parameters of this overall model are called "fixed effects". Below that level, we have a model of each individual, because we expect individuals to differ from each other. So we have additional parameters that are different for each individual, and these are called "random effects". A key part to be estimated in the overall model is a measure of the variability of the random effects. I.e. we know the individuals will differ, but we want to model that variability. A further level of modeling is the variability of individual observations. Applying this to your field is not something I fully understand, but I would recommend WinBugs as a modeling tool, and a book "Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice" by Gilks, Richardson, and Spiegelhalter. There are example problems in there that look like they might be applicable to your problem.
