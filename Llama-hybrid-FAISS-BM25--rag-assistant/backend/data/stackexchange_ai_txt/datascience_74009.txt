How does time-series classification work?

So I have the multiple time series data in this format -- id Week X1 X2 X3 y 1 201901 10. 34.9 52.8 0 1 201902 20. 44.1 12.6 1 1 201903 30. 54.2 84.3 1 1 201904 40. 64.4 77.1 0 2 201901 10. 64.9 62.8 1 2 201902 20. 54.1 22.6 1 2 201903 30. 34.2 54.3 1 2 201904 40. 44.4 17.1 0 I want to predict y for the next two weeks. How can I approach this problem? One way I thought is to train on the data set and then the test data would look like this - id Week X1 X2 X3 1 201905 20. 45.2. 33.2 2 201905 10. 65.2. 23.2 Is this the correct way to do such a classification? Or should I train the model for each time series independently. Thanks!
