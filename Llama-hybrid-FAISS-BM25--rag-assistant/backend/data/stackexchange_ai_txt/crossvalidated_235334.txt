Historically, and to the present, the upper or third quartile (for example) is the value exceeded by just 25% of values. (I only ever see informal use of "top" for this meaning.) By extension, the interval or bin between the upper or third quartile and the maximum is often also called the upper quartile, and sometimes the fourth quartile. More generally, $k$ breakpoints define $k + 1$ groups. The word "quarter" is also available and perhaps preferable. Some might quibble at this laxness of terminology and prefer (or even insist on) terminology such as bin or interval whenever bins or intervals are in question. More positively, disambiguation of two related senses is usually not too difficult. If there is talk of people in the top quartile of course performance or BMI or whatever, it is clear what is intended. Similar comments apply here to deciles and percentiles. Other terms in varying use are tertiles (rare?), quintiles (common), sextiles (rare?) and octiles (uncommon but not rare). The qualifications here are based on my haphazard reading and memory. Latin is no longer as familiar as its most enthusiastic proponents would like and these terms are challenging to many. More positively, there seems to be a growing convergence on quantile as a standard term and just to expect to see the numerical definitions being explicit. Thus I'd expect to see references to the $5, 1, 0.5$ % points or quantiles and similarly the upper $95, 99, 99.5$ % points or quantiles. In practice I see no use of, and in principle see no need for the use of, terms in Latin (or Greek or any other languages) for most such values or the bins they define. Concretely, anyone knowing how to interpret "the top half-percentile" is likely to find "above the 99.5% point" simpler to use. EDIT 5 October 2016 Aronson (2001) documented first uses of various terms for quantiles. The list here includes some earlier dates from searches of the Oxford English Dictionary and www.jstor.org on 5 October 2016. The dates refer to earliest citations of the terms with their statistical meaning and not to other meanings. The general term quantile itself is often attributed to Kendall (1940) but can be found in Fisher and Yates (1938).
