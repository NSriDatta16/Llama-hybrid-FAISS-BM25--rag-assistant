Client has a clear picture of exactly what he wants, and my job is to show him something that will attract his attention and give me additional time to complete the project. Each module requires one month of work, but after three months the client decides whether to continue the cooperation or not. The user interface is the only thing that interests him. I can not explain to him that I spent two months making engine if he does not see it on the screen.
