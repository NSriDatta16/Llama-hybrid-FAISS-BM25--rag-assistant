Isn't the result always the startPosition > 0 ? startPosition - 1 : numberOfPlayers - 1 , i.e. it's always one less than the startPosition except for the case when the startPosition is 0.. The even more "elegant" modulo could be something like (startPosition + numberOfPlayers - 1) % numberOfPlayers .
