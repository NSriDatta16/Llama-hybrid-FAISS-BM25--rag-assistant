Bad performance of ARIMA model on online buzz data, Any suggestions?

I was wondering if the ARIMA model is constrained to predict online buzz data (time series data). What I want to do: Use the past round 30 months data to predict next month; and I use Python Here are my steps for prediction My original data The number of data is 972 (unit = days). enter code here I detect the outliers based on z scores and replace it with moving average. I reset the time interval. The data was resampled and aggregated on a weekly basis. The number of data is 137. (unit = weeks) Examining the unit root by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF test) and difference if needed Run acf and pacf values, Divide my data into train and test set and the output of ARIMA model The predicted values are [ 24.23091639] [-14.00353408] [ 6.92498285] [ 6.87718253] The actual values are [[-145. ] [ 143. ] [ 11.42857143] [ 41.90670554]] It seems to have a poor performance on predicting but I have no idea how to make it more accurate. I have tried several ways including outliers detection, considering the seasonal effects (Too few observations to estimate starting parameters for seasonal ARMA). I'd like to ask the experts in the community, what would you do if you had this dataset? Of course, it doesn't necessarily have to be limited to traditional time series forecasting models; machine learning methods can also be used
