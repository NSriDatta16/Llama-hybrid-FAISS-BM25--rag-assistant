I'm a big fan of making lists! As soon as the urge takes you to re-write something - spend 10 minutes making a list of the things that need re-writing. Follow all of the alleys that take you further into the code that needs attention and list those, too. Hopefully within a relatively short space of time you'll have one of two things: A really long list that completely puts you off wanting to rewrite anything ever again. A list which actually isn't that long, so why not indulge yourself and go for a re-write?!
