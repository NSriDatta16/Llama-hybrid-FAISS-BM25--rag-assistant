You could just add to the DOM by overriding the "Submit" form button and pushing the resulting form data into a or that you display on the same page. This is, however, highly fragile as any reload will wipe out the data (since you can't save to disk via javascript limitations)... what you're saving to is the browser in-memory state of your page. If you actually want to save the work you had entered, you need local filesystem access or server access, there's just no way around it due to the sandboxing of browser javascript.
