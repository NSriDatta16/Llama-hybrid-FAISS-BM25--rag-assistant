The Pager was the culprit. The pre-1.4 Magento theme utilized some Pager logic in THEME/template/catalog/category/view.phtml. In 1.4.x, the Pager has been revised, and needs to have an explicit limit set for use on the category view page. The take-home message here is that if you find yourself instantiating the "product_list_toolbar_pager", make sure you set the limit to the same limit used on the toolbar.
