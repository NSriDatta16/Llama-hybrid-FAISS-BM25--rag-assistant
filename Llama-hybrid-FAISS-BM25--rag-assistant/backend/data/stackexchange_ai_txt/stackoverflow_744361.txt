It's impossible to say in general - the only way to find out is to build the app and test the performance. The bottleneck is likely to be the DB insert, but whether multi-threading will speed thibngs up depennds on a host of factors: are your app and the db server running on thge same machine? do they use the same disk? can one insert cause contention with another? You get the idea. Having said that, I have written servers in the finance industry where multi-threading the DB access did make a huge difference. But these were talking to a gigantic Sun enterprise server which had database I/Os to spare, so flooding it with requests from a multi-threaded app made sense.
