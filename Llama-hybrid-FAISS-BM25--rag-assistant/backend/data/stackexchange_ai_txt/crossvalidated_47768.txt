Differencing does not automatically de-trend a time series. For a counter-example, consider data generated by any process characterized by exponential growth (biological populations, share prices) or decay (radioactivity). Even if the original process is a stationary ARMA process plus a trend, differencing will still not have the effect of detrending the series. For example, let $x_t$ be such a series: $x_t = \mu(t) + y_t$ where $y_t$ is a stationary ARMA process. Let $z_t$ denote the differenced process: $z_t = x_t - x_{t-1} = \mu(t) - \mu(t-1) + y_t - y_{t-1}$. Then $ E[z_t] = \mu(t) - \mu(t-1) + E[y_{t}] - E[y_{t-1}] = \mu(t) - \mu(t-1) \neq 0.$ Differencing multiple times will likewise not yield a stationary series. In general you may need to do more complicated transformations than differencing (e.g., taking logs, apply a Box-Cox transformation) before you can treat the transformed series as a stationary ARMA process.
