Your particular query does not require clustered key on the date column. It would actually run better with nonclustered index with the leading date column because you don't need to do key lookup in this query, so the nonclustered index would be covering and more compact than clustered (it implicitly includes clustered key columns). If you have it indexed properly and it still does not perform it is most likely fragmentation. In this case defragment the index and try again.
