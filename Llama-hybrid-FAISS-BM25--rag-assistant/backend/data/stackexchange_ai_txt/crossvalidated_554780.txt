when does Poisson distribution approximate binomial distribution - what is n in an e-commerce setting

I am quoting from here : "As with many ideas in statistics, “large” and “small” are up to interpretation. A rule of thumb is the Poisson distribution is a decent approximation of the Binomial if n > 20 and np Here n is trials with a probability p. I try to translate this into an e-commerce setting where we have websites which users can visit. I would think that np is the visiting rate. So in the above example there are 4 visitors within 120 minutes on average. I am sorry I do not get my head around what n is in my setting? I would think it has to do with conversions? Thanks.
