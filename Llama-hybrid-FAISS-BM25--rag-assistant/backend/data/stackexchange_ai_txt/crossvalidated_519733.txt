A table like this is typically visualized in a calibration plot, also called a reliability diagram . (If you search for this term, you may want to exclude the term "chemistry", because a "calibration curve" is also used in analytic chemistry, and it's a different thing.) You start out by binning the interval $[0,1]$ , as in the "range" column. It's more common to use bins of the same size, e.g., $0.1$ or $0.05$ . You then put the predictions into the bins corresponding to the predicted probabilities of belonging to the target class. (This is important!) Now you have binned your instances. In the lowest bin $[0.00,0.01]$ , you have all instances whose predicted probability is at most $0.01$ . We can calculate the average predicted probability of these instances (which of course must be somewhere between $0$ and $0.01$ ). This is given in the "exp." column. We can also calculate which proportion of these instances actually is of the target class. This is given in the "act." column, and this is the answer to your "of what?" question. If your classifier is correctly calibrated, then these two columns should be identical.
