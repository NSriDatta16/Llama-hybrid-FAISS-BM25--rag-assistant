In Bayesian statistics, 'posterior' refers to the probability distribution $p(\theta|d)$ of a parameter $\theta$ conditioned on data $d$ . It is the result of the knowledge-updating procedure of Bayes' theorem: $$p(\theta|d) = \frac{p(d|\theta) p(\theta)}{p(d)},$$ where $p(d|\theta)$ is the likelihood function, $p(\theta)$ is the prior, and $p(d)$ is the normalization constant, also called the marginal likelihood.
