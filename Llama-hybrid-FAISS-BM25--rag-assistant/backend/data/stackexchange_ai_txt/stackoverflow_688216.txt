You might want to try Take Command Console , formerly 4NT, formerly 4DOS. Quick summary of points you might care about: Command line editing with filename completion, history, and cut & paste Integrate PERL, Ruby, REXX, Python , and any Active Scripting language Fast - 20-200% faster output display than the standard Windows console Integrated file explorer - examine directories, drag and drop files Upwardly compatible with CMD.EXE with literally thousands of additions Not free (except trial version) and not open source. I haven't tried it myself, but I was a 4DOS junkie back in the day, before Cygwin.
