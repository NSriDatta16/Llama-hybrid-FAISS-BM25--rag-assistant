This is (potentially) fine. You are describing a simple version of model averaging . Of course, whether it is actually better in your case is an empirical question. For what it's worth, "frequentist" doesn't really contrast with "machine learning". In statistics, frequentist would contrast with Bayesian , but that distinction is orthogonal to this question. You could contrast statistics with machine learning (many people do), but I think the distinction is somewhat forced and artificial, and at any rate, it's orthogonal to this question.
