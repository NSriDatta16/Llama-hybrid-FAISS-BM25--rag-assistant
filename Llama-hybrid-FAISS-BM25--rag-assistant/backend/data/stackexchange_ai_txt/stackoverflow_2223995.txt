How have you added them? It strikes me that they'd be perfect candidates for config values, and Magento wraps the whole per-store-setting thing there really well - take a look in a system.xml file for one of the built-in modules (or a downloaded one...they tend to be simpler) and how it builds the fields up and specifies at what 'scope' (global, store, store-view) settings can be applied. Then you can access the values from your code with Mage::getStoreConfigValue('your/config/key') and it will give you the correct value for the scope you're in, or the default if you haven't set one for a particular store.
