Using LINQ to Update A Property in a List of Entities

Say I have an entity that looks something like this simple example: MyEntity { int property1; int property2; int property3; } Now assume I have an IEnumerable list of these entites. Is there a LINQ query I can execute that would set the value of property1 to 100 for each entity in the list? I know I can do this via a foreach, but was wondering if LINQ could do this more elegantly.
