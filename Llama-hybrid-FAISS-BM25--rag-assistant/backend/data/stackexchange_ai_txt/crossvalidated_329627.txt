I agree with @Stephen that the interaction is unlikely to be useful. If you really think that the effect of IV1 will be different at different levels of IV2 (which is what an interaction tests) then you could stratify: That is, do separate regressions for the two levels of IV2. You can then compare the results (although you won't have estimates of the size of the interaction). Since your DV is ordinal, you should probably use ordinal logistic regression, at least as a starting point.
