Should I trust the $p$-value in statistical tests?

I got into a debate with my supervisor over a recent paper. The test of correlation in a sample of 77 participants yielded a p-value smaller than 0.05. After removing a few participants (because later we found out they are underaged), the p-value is 0.06 (r = 0.21). Then my supervisor says, 'you should report there are no correlations between these two variables, the p-value is not significant.' Here's what I reply: It makes no sense to tell people that the result is not significant in a sample of 71, but it’s significant in a sample of 77. It is important to link the results to the findings in the literature when interpreting a trend. Although we find a weak trend here, this trend aligns with numerous studies in the literature that finds significant correlations in these two variables. Here is what my supervisor reply: I would argue the other way: If it’s no longer significant in the sample of 71, it’s too weak to be reported. If there is a strong signal, we will see it in the smaller sample, as well. Shall I not report this 'not significant' result?
