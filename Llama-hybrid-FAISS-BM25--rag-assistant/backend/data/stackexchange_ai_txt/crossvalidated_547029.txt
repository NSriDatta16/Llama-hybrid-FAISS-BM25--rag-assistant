Show that solution for the maximum margin hyperplane is unchanged when w.x + b = (+/-) 1 is replaced by arbitrary constant $\gamma$?

How to show that solution for the maximum margin hyperplane for hard-margin SVM is unchanged when w.x + b = (+/-) 1 is replaced by arbitrary constant $\gamma$ ? In the derivation for the SVM, we generally assume that the margin boundaries are given by w.x + b = +1 and w.x+b = −1. Can we show that if the +1 and -1 on the right-hand side were replaced by some arbitrary constants + $\gamma$ and − $\gamma$ where $\gamma$ > 0, the solution for the maximum margin hyperplane will remain unchanged?
