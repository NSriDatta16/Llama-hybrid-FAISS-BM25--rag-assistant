Use RBF kernel with logistic regression?

There are some resources online (e.g. this one ) on logistic regression with polynomial kernels, such as $$h_\theta(x)=logistic(\theta_0 + \theta_1x1+ \theta_3x_1^2 + \theta_4x_2^2)$$ I'm wondering if it's possible to use RBF kernel $K_r(x,x')=\exp(-\frac{\|x-x'\|^2}{r})$ here. If so, what would $h_\theta(x)$ looks like?
