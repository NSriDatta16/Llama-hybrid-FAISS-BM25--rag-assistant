You probably have a permissions issue. Since you can access search results from admin, the search engine and -indexing is working. Drupal admin search returns all entries, regardless of their status (published, unpublished, draft) or their access (many flavours of content-access modules exist). First, verify that the nodes are actually visible on your site as "normal" user: anonymous or loggin in. If so, there is not an access-problem and nodes are published. Secondly, verify that you have no access-module, such as organic groups or domain running: that may be configured slightly wrong, or used in a strange way, and disable access to content under certain conditions. Thirdly, verify that you are not running any search-related modules. Maybe you installed a module that "enhances" or "overrides" search? Such a module would not change the behaviour of admin-search, but would change what is seen at the search results. If none of these apply, then please post more infomation.
