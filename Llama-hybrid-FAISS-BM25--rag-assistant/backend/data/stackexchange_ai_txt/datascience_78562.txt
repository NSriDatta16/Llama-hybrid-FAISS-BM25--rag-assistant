They are meant for different purposes and they are hardly comparable. RoBERTa is meant for text classification and tagging tasks. The idea is that you take a pretrained RoBERTa model and finetune it on your (potentially small) classification or tagging dataset. Some examples of tasks where RoBERTa is useful are sentiment classification, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). GPT-3 is meant for text generation tasks. Its paradigm is very different, normally referred to as "priming". You basically take GPT-3, give it some text as context and let it generate more text. The context should give GPT-3 the "pattern" of what it must generate. You don't finetune it, just give it some example of acceptable text generation pattern and then let it generate more alike.
