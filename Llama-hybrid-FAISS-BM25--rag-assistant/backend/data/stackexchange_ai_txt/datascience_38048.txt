How design a autoencoder architecture

I would like to build an autoencoder (CNN) to learn a representation of my data. I never built such a network and I have some experience in supervised learning (classification). I would like to know if some good practices in training a classifier is also right for an autoencoder: Does reference architecture exists like ResNet/Inception or something? If not, should I design manually layers? Does transfer learning/fine tuning works for autoencoder (or is it better to train from scratch)?
