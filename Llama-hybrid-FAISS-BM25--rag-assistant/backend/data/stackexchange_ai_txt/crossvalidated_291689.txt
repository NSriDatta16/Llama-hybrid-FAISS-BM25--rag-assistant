How do I account for covariates after doing a mann whitney test?

So I have ordinal data that is marked as strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and strongly disagree and two different groups which I am comparing. I have used a mann whitney to see if the groups are significantly different. Now I would like to see if this difference is still significant when adjusting for age, gender and BMI. Do I use ordinal logistic regression to adjust for these covariates?
