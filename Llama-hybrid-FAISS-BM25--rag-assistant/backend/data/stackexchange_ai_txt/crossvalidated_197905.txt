Algebraic classifiers, more information?

I have read Algebraic classifiers: a generic approach to fast cross-validation, online training, and parallel training and was amazed by the performance of the derived algorithms. However, it seems that beyond Naive Bayes (and GBMs) there are not many algorithms adapted to the framework. Are there any other papers who worked on different classifiers ? (SVMs, Random Forests)
