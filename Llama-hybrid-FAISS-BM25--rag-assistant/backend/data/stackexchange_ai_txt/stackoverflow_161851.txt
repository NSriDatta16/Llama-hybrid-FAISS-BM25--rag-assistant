Good question. I have similar problems, and I have taken the path of least resistance (for me, anyway). There are a bunch of other solutions, which others have mentionned. Many of them are better / more pure / more appropriate for others. I was already using Testdriven.NET/MbUnit to test my C#, so I simply added tests to each project to call the stored procedures used by that app. I know, I know. This sounds terrible, but what I need is to get off the ground with some testing, and go from there. This approach means that although my coverage is low I am testing some stored procs at the same time as I am testing the code which will be calling them. There is some logic to this.
