Magento - Adminhtml - Get id of order just created

I want to do some post processing on an order, made using admin panel. I have subscribed to the controller_action_postdispatch_adminhtml_sales_order_create_save event, and the correct function of this observer is being invoked. How can I get the id of the order just saved in the saveAction in my function.
