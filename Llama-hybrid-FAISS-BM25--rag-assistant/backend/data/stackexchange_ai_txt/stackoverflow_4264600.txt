algorithm for placing objects freely on a screen

with my application I have different objects (for simplicity let's say all rectangles) that can be of different sized and located freely on screen (drag/drop). The problem I have is that a user create the page on certain screen size but it gets viewed on different screen sizes. It's not a big deal if differences are small say 15" vs 14" laptops) but it looks quite messed up if created on say 27" mac and viewed on 14" laptop. I tried storing screen dimensions and then resizing/relocating object relatively but didnt work that well. Do you know of an algorithm to solve such a problem? if not do you recommend a method/idea of how I go about solving that?
