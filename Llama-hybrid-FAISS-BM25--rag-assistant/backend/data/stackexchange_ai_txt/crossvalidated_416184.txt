Why Does a Monotonic Transformation Of Dependent Variable Change Variance Explained In Random Forest

I am working with the Boston data set in R. I have read that random forest should be able to deal with untransformed data. In my example I do a log transformation of the dependent variable. My variance explained goes from 54% to 94%. Here is what the original dependent variable looks like. I run a random forest model without any transformation to the data set. Our dependent variable is crim. library(randomForest) randomForest(crim ~., Boston) #variance explained is 54% Once I do a log transformation of crim(to make the distro more normal) the variance explained jumps to 95%!! randomForest(log(crim) ~., Boston) #variance explained is 95% Since this is a monotonic transfromation. I did not think it would have an impact on a tree based model. Can someone provide some intuition on why this might be the case? Thank you
