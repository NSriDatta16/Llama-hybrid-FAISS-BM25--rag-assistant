A good way to organize/store a lot of datasets

In machine translation, we often have bilingual dataset, e.g. for German-English and French-English we will have something that looks like this: /en-de train.de train.en dev.de dev.en test.de test.en /en-fr train.fr train.en dev.fr dev.en test.fr test.en And then we have a third language pair German-French, and we'll have: /de-fr train.fr train.de dev.fr dev.de test.fr test.de But lets say we add Spanish-English and we'll get: /en-es train.es train.en dev.es dev.en test.es test.en /de-es train.es train.de dev.es dev.de test.es test.de /fr-es train.es train.fr dev.es dev.fr test.es test.fr And if we add even more languages, these pairs of languages goes even more tedious. What would be a good data structure / directory organization to store the train.* , dev.* and test.* files?
