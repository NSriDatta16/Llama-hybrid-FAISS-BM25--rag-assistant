I recreated your example and the button shows up on the edit form on a custom document library with a RegistrationId of 10001. So nothing seems wrong. The custom document library and the custom action are in one project and in one feature in my test environment and I scoped the feature to Site. How did you organize this? One thing: you are missing the closing tag of CustomAction in the xml. Is this present in your solution? Is there maybe other code present in your solution which can cause an exception or something?
