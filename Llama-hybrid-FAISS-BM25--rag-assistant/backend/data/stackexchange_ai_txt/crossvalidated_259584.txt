How to do a PCA when two subject groups may have different solutions?

I have two subject groups--one received a drug treatment and the other didn't. We collected a lot of behavioral observations on all the subjects. For the purposes of running stats, I want to reduce the number of behaviors using PCA. Preliminary analysis reveals some of the behaviors are affected by the drug treatment so the drug treatment subjects behave differently than the controls for some behaviors..so how do I run a PCA accounting for the fact that the principal components/loadings might be different for the treated subjects and un-treated subjects?
