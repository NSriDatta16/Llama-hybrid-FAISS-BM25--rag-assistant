K-Means Clustering for data points with multiple attributes

I'm very new to K-Means clustering. Every example that I have seen has a two-dimensional data set. I am working to classify recipes of varying ingredient composition into families. Each recipe is composed of a number of ingredients, and I want to group together the recipes that are similar to each other. Each recipe on average has 8 ingredients. Is there any way I can use K-Means clustering to group these recipes together? Or would you suggest another unsupervised machine learning method?
