Basically, yes. But in order to pass input from a convolutional, or max pooling layer to a fully-connected one, you need to "flatten" the input tensor. That is, either to flatten the tensor/multi-dimensional array from the convolutional layer or to use something like Global Average Pooling that will reduce the tensor to a vector. You can check code snippets in different frameworks, that will help you understand the process. Also, should be noted that fully connected layers are used not only as the last layer that outputs class probabilities in a CNN, check for example VGG networks, they have 2-3 fully connected layers at the end. And the last remark, to get class scores you usually (not always!) use Softmax, not simple sigmoid. Softmax ensures that the sum of the values in your output vector is equal to 1.
