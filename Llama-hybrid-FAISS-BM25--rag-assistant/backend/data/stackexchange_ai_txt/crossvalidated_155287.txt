Classifier for different classes of birds

Is it possible to distinguish between the different classes of birds? I do not aim to have a very specific classifier, but a classifier that is atleast able to distinguish between a parrot and an eagle. So if i have a four way training set, 1) Images of parrots 2) Images of Eagles 3) Images of Birds/{Parrots, Eagles} 4) Random Images. Is it possible to have a good classifier for this purpose ? Would neural networks work ? or a combination of SIFT features with an SVM ?
