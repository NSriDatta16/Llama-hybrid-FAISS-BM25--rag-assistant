In a recent paper, we found that PCA is able to compress the Euclidean distance of intra-cluster pairs while preserving Euclidean distance of inter-cluster pairs. Notice that K-means aims to minimize Euclidean distance to the centers. Hence the compressibility of PCA helps a lot. This phenomenon can also be theoretical proved in random matrices. Please see our paper. "Compressibility: Power of PCA in Clustering Problems Beyond Dimensionality Reduction" Chandra Sekhar Mukherjee and Jiapeng Zhang https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10888
