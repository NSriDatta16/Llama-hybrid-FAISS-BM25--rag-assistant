Why the prophet time series model uses MAP and not MLE?

I'm using prophet model for one of my time series analysis. I learnt that it optimizes the parameters by MAP approach. The fundamental idea of when to use MAP vs MLE is that when we have a strong prior probability. If we fail to have a prior probability then MLE is the parameter estimation technique that is used. Having said that, I would like to learn what and how the prior is estimated in a time series data and what do we use as an evidence for the posterior estimation.
