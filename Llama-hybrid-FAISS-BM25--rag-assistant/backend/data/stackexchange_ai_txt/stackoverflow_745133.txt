Flash - Scroll area with dynamically loaded movie clips

I'm building a Flash project that creates a menu system with dynamically loaded movie clips for the menu items themselves. I want a scroll bar to appear once the menu has enough items that it's larger than the menu area. I was thinking that I could just put a mask over the menu area and have the movie clip where the controls where loaded scroll up and down within the mask, but the dynamically loaded movie clips don't seem to appear in the mask. I have searched around the internet for this, but all the scroll bar tutorials that I can find deal with text areas rather than an area with dynamically loaded movie clips. Does anyone know of a good tutorial for this or have a suggestion as to an elegant way of doing this so I don't have to make a bunch of math hacks to make it work? Thanks
