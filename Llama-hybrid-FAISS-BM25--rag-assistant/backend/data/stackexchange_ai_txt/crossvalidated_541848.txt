I believe this setting falls under the category of combinatorial bandits. In such setting, the agent can select a subsets of all arms, i.e., the action set $\mathcal{A}$ is a subset of the power set $\mathcal{A} \subset 2^{[n]}$ , where $n$ is the number of arms. Set this paper: Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit: General Framework, Results and Applications for a comprehensive introduction to the topic of combinatorial bandits and related algorithms.
