The average of mean and standard deviation

I have the mean and standard deviation for body temperature ( in a group of people n=10 ), which measured using a thermometer in the left axilla, then in the right axilla Left mean = 36.4; SD= 0.2 Right mean = 36.7; SD= 0.18 If I want to get one mean and one standard deviation that can express the whole body temperature. Can I average mean left and mean right then SD left and SD right. i.e. (mean left + mean right )/2 (SD left + SD right )/2 is this correct? if not . What is the correct methodology to get one mean and one SD ( if any)
