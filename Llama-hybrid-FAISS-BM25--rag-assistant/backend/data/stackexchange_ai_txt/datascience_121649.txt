One idea for analyzing this data would be to explore correlations between the average rent value and brand affinities . This could involve using statistical methods like regression analysis to see if there is a relationship between the two variables. Additionally, clustering algorithms could be used to group postal zones based on their brand affinities , which could provide insights into consumer behavior and help identify potential target markets for different brands. Another approach would be to use machine learning models like decision trees or random forests to predict brand affinities based on other variables like the average rent value or demographic data . This could be useful for marketing and advertising purposes.
