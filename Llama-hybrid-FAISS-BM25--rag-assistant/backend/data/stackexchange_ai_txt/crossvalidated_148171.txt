Can we write the likelihood of a GLM in generality?

So I know we can explicitly write down the likelihood of any specified GLM model, for example the likelihood for the logistic regression model would be $$L(\mathbf{\beta};y,x)=\prod_{i=1}^np(x_i)^{y_i}(1-p(x_i))^{1-y_i}\,,$$ but now I would like to know is there a way (or a standard convention) for writing $L(\beta;y,x)$ in general for any GLM? Could I write in generality something like this $$L(\beta;y,x)=\prod_{i=1}^n[ N(y,x;\beta,\sigma^2)\times \eta(p)]$$ where $\eta(p)$ is the link function that relates $y$ and $p$? At the end of the day, I would like to be able to write down my likelihood as the product of normals (the linear part) and incorporate the link function into it somehow.
