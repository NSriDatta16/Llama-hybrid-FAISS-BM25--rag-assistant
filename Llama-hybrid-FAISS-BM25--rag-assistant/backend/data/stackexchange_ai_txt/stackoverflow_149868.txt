I am NOT a big fan of using NSCoding/NSCoder/NSArchiver (we need to pick a name!) to serialise an object graph to a file. Archives created in this way are incredibly fragile. If you save an object of class Foo then by golly you need to make sure when you load the data back in you have a class Foo in your application. This makes NSCoder based serialisation difficult from the perspective of sharing files with other applications or even forwards compatibility with your future application.
