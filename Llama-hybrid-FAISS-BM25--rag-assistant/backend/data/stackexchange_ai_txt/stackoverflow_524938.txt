We did this on a project already determining distance from Access Points, but without the signal triangulation (already covered on other answers here). I do have a recommendation from the "man, I wish I didn't have to go back and do this" department - it would be to spend extra time on 2 areas: An easy and repeatable method of calibration using Multiple Data Points . For example, the dropoff from being "very close" to "kinda close" will be a lot more than "really far away" to "really really far" away. It's not going to be a linear slope. Data Smoothing. As you move, the signal strength will vary unproportionally to your movement (due to obstacles in the path). It will make your results much more accurate if you take a rolling average of the last 5-10 samples of the signal strength rather than just taking the last sample.
