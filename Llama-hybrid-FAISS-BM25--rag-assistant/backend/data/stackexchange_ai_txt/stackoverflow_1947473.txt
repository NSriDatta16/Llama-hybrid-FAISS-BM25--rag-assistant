Since Hibernate 3 you can use formulas to map this types of readonly calculated fields. Example: @Formula("(SELECT b.BANK_NAME FROM " + " BANK_INFORMATION b, BILLING_AGENT_BANK ba " + " WHERE ba.CNPJ = COMPANY_CNPJ " + " AND b.BANK_ID = ba.BANK_ID)") public String getBankName() { return bankName; } This example is with a Annotated property, but you can do the same in the mapping file.
