The error is likely the g.insert(currentCar) line in the carEnters method, as g is a std::set , not a std::set . Either pass in a reference to the current car ( *currentCar ) or make the garage contain pointers to cars. In addition, you may wish to pass in g as a reference, in the form of... void carEnters(std::set & g) { } void carLeaves(std::set & g) { } Otherwise the set is being copied and you might not get the results you want. If you need explanation as to the why for any of these, add a comment. I used to do some TAing back in the day. :)
