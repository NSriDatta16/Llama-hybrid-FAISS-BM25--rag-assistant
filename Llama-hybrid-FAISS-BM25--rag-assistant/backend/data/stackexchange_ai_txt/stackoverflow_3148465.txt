mysql pagination with multiple tables

I have 2 two tables: organisations (id, name) organisationsmeta (id, orgId, metaKey, metaValue) Each organisation can have multiple associated meta rows. I'm using a Left Join right now since there can be organisations without any meta data. How do I construct the query to fetch 10 organisations (with all associated meta data), regardless of how much metadata each organisation have?
