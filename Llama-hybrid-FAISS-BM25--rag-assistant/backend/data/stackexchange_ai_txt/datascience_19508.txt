A simple approach might use document vectors or LDA representing the text of each section (possibly chunking longer sections) with a simple classifier trained on those vectors to predict section. These can be found in gensim or sklearn . A harder to implement but likely more powerful technique would be to train a recurrent neural network on the text of each section (again likely breaking it into smaller chunks) so that the representation your model learns is learned specifically to predict Abstract/Indices/etc ...
