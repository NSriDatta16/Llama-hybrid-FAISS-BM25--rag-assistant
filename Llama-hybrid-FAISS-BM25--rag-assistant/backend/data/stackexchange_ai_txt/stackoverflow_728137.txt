What is the best way to model user defined hierarchical relationships in a database?

Essentially, I want the user to be able to define a hierarchical model, but then I need to allow the user to store data within their defined model. Does this make sense? So the users will be able to create new "unit types" to be organised in a hierarchical way and decide how units of these types are allowed to be organised. A simple example: in my hypothetical interface a user creates three unit types, trunk, branch and leaf. The user then defines the relationships between them. A leaf can exist at any point in the hierarchy, a branch must have a trunk as a parent. The user can then creates instances of these unit types (as units) and can organise them according the rules defined in their model... is there a good way of doing this in the database?
