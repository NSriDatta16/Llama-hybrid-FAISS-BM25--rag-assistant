Time warping is used to align different time series, is more useful for data preprocessing rather than for what you want. "What I really want to do is to calculate a metric telling me to what extent there is a consistent '1 hour per day, once per week' pattern" I don't know if you have a specific reason to use a 'metric', if what you need if to find periodical patterns across people what you could do is apply different moving averages to every time series to extract different periodical patterns, then you could evaluate the cross-correlation between different people time series to evaluate which patterns are subjective and which can be instead considered true across people.
