Core Data max storage iPhone

Is there a limit to how much persistent storage a single iPhone app may consume? What does save set the error argument to if the iPhone hits a per-app limit? What if it hits the hardware limit? Is it possible to limit the number of objects stored for certain entities? If so, what's a good approach to doing this? acani, an iPhone app I'm working on, downloads the nearest 20 users from the server and saves them to Core Data. After using the app for a while, the users SQLite table could become rather large. How could I limit it? What should I limit it to? Once this table has reached capacity, how could I make it so that newly downloaded users replace the oldest downloaded users? Thanks! Matt
