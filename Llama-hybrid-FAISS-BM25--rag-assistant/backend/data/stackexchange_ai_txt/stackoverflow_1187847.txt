You should note that Microsoft's own UI guidelines suggest that you should not do this unless the event really does require immediate attention. Don't flash the taskbar button if the only thing the user has to do is activate the program, read a message, or see a change in status. It is strongly advisable, even within a cross platform app, that the current system's UI guidelines are followed. In this case it depends what you are trying to do but taking a guess: On Windows notification balloons are considered the best behaviour when used correctly . On OS X many applications use Growl . It appears someone may have done this via the cocoa-sharp project In Linux this will be very dependent on the underlying GUI framework, since GTK# is the preferred framework for mono here is the how they suggest you do it If you really do want to do the equivalent of the Flashing window icon the equivalent on OS X would be a bouncing dock icon (Again, people don't like this ). I don't know if that is wrapped by cocoa#. In Linux the behaviour is again fragmented since many frameworks simply don't have the taskbar concept and you would be expected to play nicely with whatever framework you were in.
