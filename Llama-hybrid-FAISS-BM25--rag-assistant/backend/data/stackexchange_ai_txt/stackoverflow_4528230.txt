I am the author of SimpleCaptcha . While I would recommend -- for humanity's sake -- using ReCaptcha where you can, I provided SimpleCaptcha because some organizations have policies which prohibit libraries like ReCaptcha. SimpleCaptcha is meant to be entirely stand-alone, with no external dependencies: as long as you are in a J2EE container, you should be good. Also, SimpleCaptcha is now available for either Java 1.5 or Java 6.
