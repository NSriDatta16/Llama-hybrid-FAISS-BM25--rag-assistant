Great model prediction, but no significant variables

I am performing a binary logistic regression. I have developed a simple model which I am testing using the SPSS application. This first determines the predictive ability of a baseline model without using the independent variables and then adds in the variables to eatablish if the "new" model increases the % prediction. The baseline model prediction % is already at 94.7%. The model with variables added pushes this up to 98.6%. This is great, but none of the preditive variables is significant which confuses me. Can you offer an explanation for this lack of significance?
