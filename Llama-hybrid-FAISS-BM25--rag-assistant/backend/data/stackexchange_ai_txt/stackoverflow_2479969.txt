Using google app engine instead of sending mail via gmail I haven't used gmail with PHPMailer, but I don't think it is foolish. But if you ask me you are better of using google app engine to send emails . I realize this isn't a php solution, but I think to achieve what you want the google app engine documentation will fit your bill. That way you don't have the hard limit enforced on you and it scales very well. P.S: Google has a very generous free daily quota : Mail API Calls 7,000 calls, 32 calls/minute Learn basics of deploying an application to google app engine Also a little youtube video from Slatkin( Send email via Python's app engine SDK Here you will find a little snippet which I directly copied from there documentation. from google.appengine.api import mail mail.send_mail(sender="Example.com Support ", to="Albert Johnson ", subject="Your account has been approved", body=""" Dear Albert: Your example.com account has been approved.
