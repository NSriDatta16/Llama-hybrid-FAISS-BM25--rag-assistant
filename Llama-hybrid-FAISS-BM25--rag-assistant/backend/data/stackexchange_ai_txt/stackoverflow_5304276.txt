How do I save the position of draggable & resizeable elements?

I'm building a site which allows users to create an html page which can then be saved and shared on another site. I want them to be able to resize and drag the page elements. I can do this using jQuery, but I'm not sure how I then save that so that when the page is viewed elsewhere, it looks the same. I haven't decided yet how to store the page info, but what I'm thinking is that I can store each element in the database along with its absolute position, and its contents. Does that sound like a good plan? If so, how do I get the position for the div to pass to the php so that it can be saved? Thanks.
