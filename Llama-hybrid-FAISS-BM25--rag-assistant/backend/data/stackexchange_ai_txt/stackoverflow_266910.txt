You can address this in a number of ways architecturally in order to funnel all changes through a central service so that they are not able to make inconsistencies, but regardless of how much effort you are willing to put into that (and creating a bottleneck or single point of failure may violate some other requirements you have) you will not be able to rely on the database engine itself to enforce it with a guarantee like you can with a FK constraint. I often had to deal with this in cross-departmental database situations where things could get out of sync because disparate systems were not fully integrated yet, or security concerns required them to have separate administrators. In these cases, I usually rely on exception reports generated hourly, which check on the status of things and only report if there is a problem. The SQL Server Agent jobs have powerful scheduling capabilities. I always used log tables and SQLAnswersMail to generate nice little HTML emails (where URL links in the emails could even take you to administration pages to correct the problems) to the various system administrators, but there are tons of ways to skin this cat.
