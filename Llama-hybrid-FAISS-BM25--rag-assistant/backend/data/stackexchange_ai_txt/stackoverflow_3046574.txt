Creating an application that can open files of a given format

I've got an app, written in Obj-C. The info.plist has a list of file types that the app can open. I'm pretty sure that this is working because when I try to drag a file of an unacceptable type, the app doesn't highlight, but when I drag a file of an acceptable type, it does highlight, and lets me drop. When I drop, the app starts up, correctly, however, then I get a dialog saying: The document "foo.tiff" could not be opened. DocView cannot open files in the "TIFF File" format. I DO have this in my info.plist CFBundleTypeExtensions tif tiff CFBundleTypeIconFile TIFFFile.icns CFBundleTypeName TIFF File CFBundleTypeOSTypes TIFF CFBundleTypeRole Viewer LSHandlerRank Documents/ Thanks.
