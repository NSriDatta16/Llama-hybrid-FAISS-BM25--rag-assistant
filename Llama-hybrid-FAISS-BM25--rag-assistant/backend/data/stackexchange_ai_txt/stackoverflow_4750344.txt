It sounds like you're just looking for a more elegant way to write your query. I believe that this is a more elegant way to write your combined queries: var deltaList = from contact in Contacts let contractors = contact.Contractors where contractors.Any(ctor => ctor.ContractorStatusTrackings .Any(date => date.StatusDate.Year >= 2010)) && !contractors.Any(m => m.ContactID == contact.ContactID) select contact.ContactID
