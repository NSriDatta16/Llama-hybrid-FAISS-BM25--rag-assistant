The answer I guess, is yes. Check this link for instance. Issuing an SSL Certificate to a Public IP Address An SSL certificate is typically issued to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as " https://www.domain.com ". However, some organizations need an SSL certificate issued to a public IP address. This option allows you to specify a public IP address as the Common Name in your Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The issued certificate can then be used to secure connections directly with the public IP address (e.g., https://123.456.78.99 .).
