It would be too big when your query starts to slow down. Do you need to keep the entire history in this table or are you only ever looking for the latest values? You could optimise things by archiving off records you don't need onto an archive table. Other than that, be careful how you plan your indexes. If you put indexes all over the place, inserts may take longer. If you don't have any indexes but need to sort and filter, the retrieval may be too slow.
