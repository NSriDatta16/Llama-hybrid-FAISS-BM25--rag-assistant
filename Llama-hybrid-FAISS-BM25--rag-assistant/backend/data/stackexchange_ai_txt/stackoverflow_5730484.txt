Ilya Kogan is correct, the issue is that you were not explicitly defining your variables. The only thing to add is that in VB it's a really good idea to use the Option Explicit statement, which requires that variables be defined. Even better, there's a setting you can turn on which automatically adds that to your code in every new project. I'm not sure what version of VB you're running, but here's the link to the MSDN article explaining how to enable this option (depending on what version of VB you have, click on "Other Versions" at the top of the page and select yours as the instructions vary): MSDN Option Explicit In the off chance you're running VB6, the sequence is a little different (and apparently not MSDN documented). Go to: Tools -> Options and check Require Variable Declaration.
