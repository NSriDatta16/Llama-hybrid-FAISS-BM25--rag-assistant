Background: If the target population is younger than 18, the convention is to avoid using their BMI. Because children are actively growing, the same BMI from different ages can indicate a different severity of being overweight or obese; so what we needed was actually BMI that is adjusted for sex and age. To work around that, researchers devised this thing call growth references. BMI data from different age and sex were collected from the children, and then based on the distribution in each age segment within each sex a probability curve was drawn. The many probability curves were then combined to return the growth reference charts . There is a set for boys and a set for girls; and there is a set for age 2-20 and a set for age Technical part: Software codes exist for researchers to convert children's BMI into these BMI z-score or BMI percentile. The most commonly used one is the SAS codes provided by CDC. WHO also provides syntax codes for their reference data and codes in the form of SAS, SPSS, Stata, and R . They all have a little bit of learning curve, read the tutorial carefully, make sure to prep the input data set correctly and to check the returned data to see if they are valid on the surface. Notice that neither of there requires you to upload your data to their server, you can do all these processes offline. Advice: Since you have individual data (about a couple hundred for each ZCTA,) I'd suggest compute all the BMI z-score or percentile for each child using the code above. Then, categorize them into the four levels of weight status. Run a frequency and percentage table for each ZCTA of interest, and then examine which one has the highest prevalence rate of overweight, obesity, and the combination of them. (I'm assuming a reasonably simple random sampling. If not, make sure proper sample weights were applied during the analysis.) I would strongly advise against using the mean BMI or mean BMI z-score as the benchmark of the whole community, because both are continuous and very much right skewed, technically a community of 500 can be "on average" obese with 499 residents having normal weight and 1 resident being astronomically overweight, or they have Godzilla as their neighbor.
