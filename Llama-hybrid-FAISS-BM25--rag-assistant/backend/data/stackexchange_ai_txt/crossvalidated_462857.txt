warning message glm.fit fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred in r

I was faced with the following error as I fitted a logistic regression. warning message glm.fit fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred in r I searched for the right answer in the community, but I am afraid that I could not find the solution. I also used the Stepwise method, unfortunately, I received such error: There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50) what should I do to address this problem?
