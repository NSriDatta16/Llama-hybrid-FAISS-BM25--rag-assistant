Any reason why you are not using ResizeContainer.RenderTransfrom instead of ResizeContainer.LayoutTransform? I.e. use ResizeContainer.LayoutTransform = scale; If you want the scale to be linear I think you should use double scaler = 1 - diff / ResizeContainer.ActualWidth; EDIT: There is a bug in the code that causes the scaled control to "jump" in size if you try to resize more than once. I suggest you do the following: Add a RenderTransform to your ResizeContainer grid: Change the code in your MouseMove event handler to the following: if (bottomResize) { double newBtmX = e.GetPosition(this).X; double scaler = -(initBtmX - newBtmX) / grid1.ActualWidth; initBtmX = newBtmX; transform.ScaleX += scaler; transform.ScaleY += scaler; } This way you change the scale by whatever small amount the mouse has moved while dragging. All child controls within the grid should scale as well.
