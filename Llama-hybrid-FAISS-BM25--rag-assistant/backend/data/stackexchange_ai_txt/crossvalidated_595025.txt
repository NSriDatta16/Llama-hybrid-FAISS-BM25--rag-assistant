What is the prior distribution in a multinomial logistic regression (UPG package in R, Bayesian statistics)?

In my thesis I want to compare the frequentist and bayesian approach, specifically in doing a multinomial logistic regression. I have had only a few lectures on Bayesian statistics during my bachelors, so I have watched lectures and read a lot of stuff in order to better comprehend this approach to statistics. I have already performed a multinomial logistic regression with the mlogit (frequentist) and vglm (frequentist) packages, but now I was trying to do this with the UPG package ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02506 ). It is working and although I still need to interpret the results, I have one question which I would really like to know the answer to: The Bayesian approach begins with the specification of the prior probability distribution. However, when I was working with the UPG package I did not include such a prior probability distribution. How does this work? Is this selected automatically or can I specify a prior probability distribution? Or is this not possible in a multinomial logistic regression? I am a bit confused since I thought that one of the advantages of Bayesian statistics is that prior knowledge can be included into the model. Any insight would be very appreciated! (Any other tips for papers/lectures etc. concerning a Bayesian approach to multinomial logistic regression are also very welcome, I do not fully comprehend it yet, especially the output of the UPG package)
