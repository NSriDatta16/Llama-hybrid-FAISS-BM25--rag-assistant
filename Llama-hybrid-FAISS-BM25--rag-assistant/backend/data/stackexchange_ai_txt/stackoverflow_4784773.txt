Something like the following: div.rsColumn{ display: inline-block; border: solid 1px #000; } What this code does is to loop over a DIV tag that contains output for each row in the recordset in a "column" type of output. The border styling is to show where your data blocks are, remove/update as necessary. You'll likely run into issues where the number of columns is too wide for you content area, and then you may want to move to float:left for the CSS selector rather than display:inline-block. And you may run into issues with column heights (trying to make DIV have the same height when the data output varies greatly (think product details that could be a single short sentence or twenty long paragraphs), that would be a CSS question to ask separately (or search first, of course). Note: the default Dreamwavqer code will run through a recordset loop code once even if the recordset has no rows in the result, so you'll need to wrap this code with a Show Region -> Show If Recordset Is Not Empty
