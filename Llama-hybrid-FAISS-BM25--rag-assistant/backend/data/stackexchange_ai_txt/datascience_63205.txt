How to find and calculate correlation in a data set which has category and continuous variables?

I am working on an Insurance domain use case to predict if an existing customer will buy a second insurance policy or not. I have a few personal details saved under different categories like Marital status, Smoker (Yes or No), Age (Young, Adult, Senior Citizen), Gender (Male/Female) and few are continuous variables like Premium Paid, Sum Insured. My target is to use this mix set of categorical and continuous variables and predict the class ( 1 - Will buy a second policy, 0 - Will not buy a second policy). So how can I find/compute the correlation in this dataset and pick only the significant ones to use in Logistic Regression formula for classification? Will appreciate if someone can provide articles, link to a similar piece of work done in Python.
