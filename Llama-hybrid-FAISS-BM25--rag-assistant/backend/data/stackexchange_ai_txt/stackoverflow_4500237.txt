Type selectors (e.g. body ) and pseudo-element selectors (e.g. ::selection ) do indeed have the same specificity , but specificity only comes into play when two selectors select the same element . The body selector doesn’t select selected text, or any text at all — it selects the element. It’s the element, and not its text, that has the background-color. Whereas ::selection selects an imaginary element that surrounds currently selected text on the page. So there’s no conflict between styles set on body and ::selection , because the selectors select different things. Example Imagine you had the following HTML: I am some body text. I am some text in a paragraph. And the following CSS: p { background-color: red; } body { background-color: white; } Both selectors have the same specificity, but the ’s background will still be red, because it’s not the element. The same is true if you replace p with ::selection — selected text’s background will be red, because text within the element is not the element. So, basically, what you said here: body isn't a match for selected body text except when the ::selection pseudo-element is specified as part of the selector
