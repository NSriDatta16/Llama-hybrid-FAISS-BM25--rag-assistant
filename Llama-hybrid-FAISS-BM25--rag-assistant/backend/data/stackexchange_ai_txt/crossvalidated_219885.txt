Over-parameterization in Bayesian Hierarchical Model

Can someone explain the influence of adding parameters to a Bayesian model? I have read from Kruschke that Bayesian analysis 'accounts' for model complexity by way of multiple priors, however I don't understand what this term implies in terms of the parameter estimates. For instance, I have parameter of interest, but also a few other parameters that I am trying to control for but that are not of theoretical interest per se. What would be effect of adding an interaction term between one of these block parameters and the parameter of interest on the estimate of the parameter of interest if (i) the interaction term is centered at zero or (ii) the interaction matters a lot.
