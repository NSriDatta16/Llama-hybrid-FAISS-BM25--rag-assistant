This sounds like a bug to me. A guiding principle of Lucene search says: "Search using the same analyzer that you used for indexing, unless you have a real good reason not to". After analysis and stemming, Lucene should return matches for search terms it has. In your case, "mortgage" was transformed into "mortgag" during indexing. The retrieval process should mirror that, and also transform "mortgage" into "mortgag", and then find the matches for "mortgag" (which represent "mortgage"). It seems that during retrieval you do not stem the query, which leads to erroneous results. If this answer is unclear, please edit your question and add a few lines of code describing how you create the index and how you search it.
