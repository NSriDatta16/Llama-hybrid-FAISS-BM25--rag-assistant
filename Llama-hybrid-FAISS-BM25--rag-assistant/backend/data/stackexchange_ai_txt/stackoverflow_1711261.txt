pgb's answer is correct. It's pretty simple, really. One caveat with this is that the code that uses the SharePoint object model must be running on the SharePoint server itself -- not a remote machine. If you're trying to interact with a SharePoint list remotely, you would probably want to use web services. SharePoint 2007 has decent coverage of list manipulation in its built-in web services, but if you want more specific functionality you can always roll your own. A good starting point for the roll-your-own option is here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms464040.aspx The SDK docs for the Lists web service can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/lists.aspx
