Clarification of some concepts with regards to unit root and auto-correlation

I am new to time series and would like confirmation to see if I am in the right direction w.r.t the below concepts. Auto-correlation tests of a time series does not necessary assess the stationarity of a time series. But for a stationary time series, ACF should converge towards 0. Serial correlation in the errors of a regression model picks up the composite effect of everything not accounted for by the explanatory variables, e.g. misspecfication, etc. Hence, even if the errors have no auto-correlation, i.e. iid, it does not mean that the endogenous variable is stationary. If that is the case, does that mean I have to perform tests for stationarity again e.g. ADF, on the endogenous variable to access stationarity? To test stationarity of a time series, one can use ADF. However, this is only for the presence of unit roots in the time series, and does not test for other forms of non-stationarity, e.g. trend stationarity. Hence even if a time series does not have a unit root, i.e. rejection of H0 of ADF - indicating stationarity, it may still have a trend, thereby non-stationary. In this case, do I need to perform KPSS on top of ADF for all time series I am trying to model? From what I have seen online, most only perform either KPSS or ADF. Do correct me if I am wrong, but one can perform the likelihood ratio test (H0: pi=gamma=0) to assess trends in a time series. Hence, for a given time series, ADF to test for unit root and thereafter, LR test for trend-stationarity.
