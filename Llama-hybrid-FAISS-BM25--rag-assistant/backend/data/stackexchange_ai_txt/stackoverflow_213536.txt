I'd say one of the big reasons is that by nature, personal projects don't get as much attention as your job will. I have a slew of personal/side projects I'm working on, but they get far less of my attention that my 'real' work does because, right now, that's what's paying the bills. If I were to take a month off and work only on my personal stuff, it'd probably be pretty cool / worth money.
