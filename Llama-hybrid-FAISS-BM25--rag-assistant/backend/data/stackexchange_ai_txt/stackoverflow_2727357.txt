What is the best way to configure a SQL Server for 50 developers?

If I am running an organization that has 50 .net developers and all are using SQL Server, what is the best way to make a single SQL Server available to them? Here is some of the concerns that I want to be careful about Should I configure database users per project or per user? or both? Should I provide single SQL Server instance? Edit: How can I track changes done by each user in database? There are some more concerns but I think getting answer of these two will be a good starting point.
