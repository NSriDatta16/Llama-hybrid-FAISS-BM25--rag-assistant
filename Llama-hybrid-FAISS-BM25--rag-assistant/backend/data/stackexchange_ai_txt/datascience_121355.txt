Best practise XAI: understand features which build up cluster and explain underlaying structure

I want to cluster my data and show which features were used to define the clusters to show the structure in my data. To explain the use case: Imaging I have data from many products and I want show the variation and structure within my data. As Input features I have an BERT embedding (created with the help of the description of the product), and other categorical and numerical data, as the price, production country, ... So far i have difficulties to find an suitable method, as most methods are not usable to cluster the data (unsupervised) and explain which features contributed to the cluster. First, I was thinking if I could recreate the embedding with all features but this wouldn't help for the explanatory part. So do you have any advice how to approach to this problem?
