Rails Paperclip conflict between aws-s3 gem and right_aws gem. How to solve?

for a new App I want to use paperclip to store Files to S3. I already have installed the aws-s3 gem for another app. That seems to cause some problems, because Paperclip should use right_aws but is trying to use the aws-s3 gem. But I don't want to remove the aws-s3 gem from my system. Is there a way to solve this conflict? Maybe by forcing paperclip to use right_aws? Or by changing the configuration? My setup # enviroment.rb config.gem 'right_aws' # my model with the attachment has_attached_file :thumbnail, :styles => { :thumb => "160x120>" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/amazons3.yml", :path => ":provider/:attachment/:id_:style.:extension" # config/amazons3.yml development: bucket: bucketname access_key_id: secret secret_access_key: secret test: bucket: bucketname access_key_id: secret secret_access_key: secret production: bucket: bucketname access_key_id: secret secret_access_key: secret # The Error in the console ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (5 for 4) from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/right_http_connection-1.2.4/lib/net_fix.rb:85:in `send_request_with_body_stream' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/right_http_connection-1.2.4/lib/net_fix.rb:85:in `exec' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/right_http_connection-1.2.4/lib/net_fix.rb:144:in `request' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/connection.rb:45:in `request' from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/net/http.rb:543:in `start' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/connection.rb:52:in `request' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/base.rb:69:in `request' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/base.rb:88:in `put' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/object.rb:241:in `store' ...
