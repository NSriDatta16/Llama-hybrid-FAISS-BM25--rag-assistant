I've seen a few desktop apps get around this by effectively embedding a browser into their program, so they can just open the in-app browser window to let you do the login and authorisation. This strikes me as a bit of a cheat or defeat of purpose because you still end up typing your ID and password inside the application anyway. One possibility I was thinking of was, your desktop application could embed a mini HTTP server inside it. So then it launches the default browser to perform the authorisation, with a callback URL something like http://127.0.0.1:8765/oauthorized and then just listen for it. Would that work? Not sure what you would do for console applications... spawn a copy of lynx ?
