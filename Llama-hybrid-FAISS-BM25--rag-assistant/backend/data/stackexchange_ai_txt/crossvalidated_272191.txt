I've seen people calling both activation, but the input of the activation function ($z_2$) seems more formal. For example in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (the following $a_j$ and $z_j$ are not the same as in the question) this batch normalization paper from Google (where the word "activation" is mentioned 42 times to denote the input of the activation function), and also this layer normalization paper by Hinton et al.
