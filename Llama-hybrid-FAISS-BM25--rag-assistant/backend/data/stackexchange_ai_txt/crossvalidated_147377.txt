Confidence interval syntax in frequentist probability

Let $\theta$ be an unknown population characteristic (say average height). A confidence interval written as $P(\hat \theta - \delta If we do, however, write the result, say for estimated $\hat \theta = 180$, $\delta = 13$, does the following syntax (which is the standard in the books I'm studying) make sense, since the numbers are constant and $\theta$ is an unkown characteristic (and therefore a constant in frequentist probability)? $P(167
