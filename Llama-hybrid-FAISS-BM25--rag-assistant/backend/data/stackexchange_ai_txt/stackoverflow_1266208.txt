I'm afraid I am having trouble understanding some your questions. Is it possible to change it into another data type, b/c I can't work with Loader? First, what data type would you like to change it to. Second, why can't you work with Loader? I've tried assign them .name property, but I was unable to call them later. Why did you want to call them and how did you try to? I need to work with every single loaded image as new object. Each loader object encapsulates a single image object. The image is actually inside the Loader (on the .content property). evilpenguin describes how you can store references to the loader objects inside an array so that you can access them later. That is the correct basic approach. The real question is: "What exactly are you trying to do?" You say: here I need to make every single image draggable. If it is that simple, then add events directly to the loader (which encapsulates the image). for each(var image:XML in loadedXML.image) { var imgLoader:Loader = new Loader(); var imgRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(image.@filepath); imgLoader.load(imgRequest); addChild(imgLoader); // NOTE: you may want to wait until it is done loading // before you add drag and drop behaviour although // that isn't strictly necessary makeDraggable(imgLoader); } function makeDraggable(loader:Loader):void { loader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDrag); loader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDrag); // NOTE: I'll leave it up to you to decide // how you want to implement drag and drop } Note: I've also changed your loop to use E4X which is a much nice way of dealing with XML in Actionscript.
