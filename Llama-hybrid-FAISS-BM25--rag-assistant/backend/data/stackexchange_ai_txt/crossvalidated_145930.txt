Multilevel regression modelling with replicate weights in stata

I'm analysing a data set to which I do not have full access but am allowed to submit a limited number stata commands. These data used a complex survey design which is obscured for privacy reasons. However, a series of 60 replicate weight variables have been created for weighting with the svr suite of commands. Is it possible to perform multilevel logistic regression with the svr suite? If so, what commands should I use? I'm fairly new to stata, but need to use it due to the privacy controls around these data.
