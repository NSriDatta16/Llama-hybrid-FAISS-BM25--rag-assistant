Embedding XULRunner application on Java

My goal is to get Limewire(JAVA) and Songbird(XULRunner) to run together. I was thinking the best way is to run the XUL application(songbird) inside a JAVA swing panel. Is there another way? Would it be better or possible to have the GUI entirely in XUL, and then access my JAVA objects somehow? How would I go about doing this? Thanks
