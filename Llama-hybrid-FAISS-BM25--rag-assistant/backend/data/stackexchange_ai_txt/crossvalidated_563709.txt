Wolfgang, my warmest thanks to you! I apologize, but I had an error in SE calculation in my earlier test data (fixed after comma-to-dot decimal separator conversion), which I posted yesterday. After re-calculating this dot-separated table with the following calculations (in parentheses values of A-1 -study for an example) : the original 'effect size' is observed cure rate in each study, thus it's a proportion (and the actual effect_size in the example is a derivative from observed cure rate, sharing the same CI-range). (A-1: cure_rate = 0.7913) 95 % CI for each proportion is estimated with Wilson's method (A-1: CI_low = 0.7342, CI_high = 0.8388 -> CI_range = 0.1046) SE = (CI_high - CI_low)/3.92 (A-1: SE = 0.1046 / 3.92 = 0.02668) So far so good, with these calculations rma(effect_size, sei=SE, data=metareg, method="DL") works perfectly and corresponds to that of RevMan's! However, although I don't need variance anymore, I'd like to know what's the problem with the following calculation of variance: variance = n * SEË†2 (A-1: 230 * 0.02668 * 0.02668 = 0.1637) I suppose that this formula corresponds to that what Wolfgang suggested above ( "SE variable appears to be sqrt(variance/n) so that would be appropriate if the effect sizes are just means and variance represents the variance of the raw measurements" ) and that the stated conditions are also fulfilled in this case, or aren't they? Here is the example data with correct SEs: metareg
