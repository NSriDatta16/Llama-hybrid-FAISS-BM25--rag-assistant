Concatenate the features, appropriately coded (dummy coded, etc), to the end of your tf idf vector. Since the TF-IDF features are high dimensional and you want to use a simpler model you may want to try applying dimensionalilty reduction on the tf idf matrix (say PCA). Then concatenate the other document features to the result. Note: you may need to consider standardization, normalization, depending on the machine learning algorithm you choose.
