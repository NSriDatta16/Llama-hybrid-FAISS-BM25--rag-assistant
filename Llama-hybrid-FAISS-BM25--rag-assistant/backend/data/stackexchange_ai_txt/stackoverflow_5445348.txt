Use localStorage instead. It will be much simpler to use (assuming you aren't going to store hundreds of thousands highscores on each client). Also, WebSQL has been deprecated in favor of IndexedDB (although the latter is not in shipping browsers yet). localStorage is simply a persistent object that holds strings, so you can feed it JSON with all your (small) data. localStorage['highscores'] = JSON.stringify(your_highscores_table); Reading: your_highscores_table = JSON.parse(localStorage['highscores']); Or you could split it using different keys rather than lumping everything in 'highscore' .
