It depends on how you model your data! "Plugged the data into Matlab" doesn't suggest whether you use a model that would account for the dependence or not. Neither does saying "logistic regression". It depends specifically on how you choose to model it. If your model accounts for the dependence, then it may not be an issue at all. If it doesn't account for the dependence structure (i.e. you fit a model that assumes that the dependent values are independent), then there will be a number of issues - standard errors will be based on a false assumption, and tests and intervals affected.
