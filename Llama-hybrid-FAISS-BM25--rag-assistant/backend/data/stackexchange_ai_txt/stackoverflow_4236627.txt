Wheel-style iPhone menu

I would like to make a wheel-style menu which allows the user to rotate the wheel (a UIImageView) to see various options. In the top half of the wheel there is also a selection indicator and the user can select a particular option by dragging the desired option around the wheel and position underneath the selection indicator (just like when using a UIPickerView). Following the SO post iPhone - How to build a roulette like wheel? I have been able to implement a wheel which tracks user touches and rotates the wheel accordingly. However, I need two additional functions: Implement inertial scrolling so that the user can do a swipe on the wheel and it rotates around and gracefully slows down / decelerates, a bit like the wheel on the "Wheel of Fortune" game show. When the wheel does finish decelerating and comes to a complete stop it will automatically stop on one of the options, so that a single option appears underneath the selection indicator (like a UIPickerView), rather than potentially having two options both half under the selection indicator. I am unsure how to go about implementing these features, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
