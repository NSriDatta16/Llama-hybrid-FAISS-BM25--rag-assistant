The concordance probability (c-index, AUROC) is just a restatement of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum U-test, so it is just using the ranks of predicted probabilities. As such, this is not a valid primary measure but should only be used descriptively. You can optimize the c-index by a model that is not the best model, and optimizing to c will not calibrate model predictions. The gold standard objective function, which uses full information and will lead to selecting an actual best model, is the log likelihood function. If you have too many parameters for the sample size to support you use a penalized form of the log likelihood, e.g. ridge, lasso, elastic net, Bayesian skeptical priors, etc. Note that whenever you use an ROC curve to choose a threshold on a predictor or on predicted probability, you are turning the analysis into a decision problem that is not using the appropriate utility/cost/loss function. See here for details.
