Variable standardization / scaling for PCA when all dimensions already have same scale

Often when PCA is performed on exam results where all variables (dimensions) have the same $0$ to $100$ scale, scaling is none the less applied. For different scales I can see the purpose of it, but not in this case. Why is it done?
