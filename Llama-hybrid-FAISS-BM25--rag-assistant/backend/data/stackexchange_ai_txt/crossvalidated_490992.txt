Can MAE be reported in percentage?

In Wang et al. "Predicting New Workload or CPU Performance by Analyzing Public Datasets" (2019), the MAE is measured in a standardized space (Mean=0, SD=1). This is discussed in 3.4 Metrics , page 9. Then right after Figure 6 on page 12, all the MAE references in the paper are presented in percentage, e.g. the average MAE is 5.5.%. Why is MAE reported in percentage? Does it have anything to do with standardization?
