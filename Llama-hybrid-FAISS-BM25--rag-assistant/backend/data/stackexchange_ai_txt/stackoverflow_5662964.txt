How should I store product information to display in Android listbox-based UI?

Hello there, I am new to Android development. I am developing an application in which I want to display information about a product. The user will select the product from a listbox and get the information on the following screen. My question pertains to the design of the information storage: should I store information of all products in the database or is it better to use an external storage system like files as information related to a product will be quite big. Please help me. Thank you.
