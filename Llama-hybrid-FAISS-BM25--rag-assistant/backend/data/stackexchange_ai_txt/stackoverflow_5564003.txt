Adding tags to photos on lovdbyless

I'm writing my student project now and use lovdbyless engine for the basic social network functionality. I want to add tags support to photos. I'm new to rails so the question is: Are there the correct steps of doing it? 1. Add migration which creates 'tags' table in the database with id and name attribute and 'tagsphotos' table which has tag_id and photo_id fields. 2. Create model for tags that have 'has_and_belongs_to_many' for Photos 3. Add 'has_and_belongs_to_many' for Tags in Photo model. 4. Now start using this things from controllers. Is this organization effective? Many thanks!
