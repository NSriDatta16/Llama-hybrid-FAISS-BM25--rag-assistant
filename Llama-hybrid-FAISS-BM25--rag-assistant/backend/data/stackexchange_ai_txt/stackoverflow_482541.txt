For transferring the frame data from cpu to gpu, you might want to look in to PBO s. Check this also. Also if you are using shaders anyway, you could ease the cpu burden by doing colorspace transformations in the fragment shaders (YCbCr to RGB). The "further processing" and "rendering" steps usually are pretty much the same thing, do cool stuff in shaders and blend it to framebuffer. If you want to mix and match videos and different effects, FBO s are useful too.
