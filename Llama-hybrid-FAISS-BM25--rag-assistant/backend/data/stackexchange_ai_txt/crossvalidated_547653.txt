What does the word "Monte Carlo" mean in "Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)"?

As far as I know, the Monte Carlo method may refer to: Monte Carlo test, which means a method that estimates a value by random sampling; Monte Carlo integration, which means a method that calculates the integration of a function by random sampling However, the MCMC is simply a class of sampling method that uses the Markov Chain. I have no idea what does the word "Monte Carlo" means in this name. If it is because: "Mento Carlo" simply means "Sampling"? or MCMC is often used for integration so this would be "Markov Chain (Sampling) and Mento Carlo (Integration)"? I am now talking about why a sampling algorithm is called Monte Carlo, and I think there is aparent difference from this
