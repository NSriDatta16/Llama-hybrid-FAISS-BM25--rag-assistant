First, keep two directory trees, source and build . Put source under version control. Don't put build under version control, rebuild it as part of installation. Second, read http://sphinx.pocoo.org/intro.html#setting-up-the-documentation-sources . Use the sphinx-quickstart to build a practice documentation tree. Play with this for a few days to learn how it works. Then use it again to build the real thing in SVN directories. Organize your documentation in a well-planned tree. Some sections need an "index.rst" for that section, some don't. It depends on how "stand-alone" the section is. Our top-level index.rst looks like this. ..

Sphinx has a very cool add-on, called automodule, which picks the docstrings out of Python modules. Update As of Sphinx 1.0, C and C++ are supported. http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
