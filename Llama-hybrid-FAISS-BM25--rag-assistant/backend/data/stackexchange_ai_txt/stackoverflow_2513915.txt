Perform a full checkout of your root directory, and create the tags\lib folder. Perform an add using Tortoise svn, but don't commit yet. Next, move each of the old lib folders under the new lib folder by using drag/drop with your right mouse button. When you drop the folder you'll have the option to "move" the files there using tortoise svn. Once all the folders are in the correct place, you can commit everything. That way you won't lose the history on the old lib folders, and your repository is nicely restructured.
