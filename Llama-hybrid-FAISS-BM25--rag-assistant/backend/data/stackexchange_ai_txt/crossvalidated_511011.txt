Time Series Regression with Washout Period

A classical time series regression model with an $\text{AR}(1)$ error has the following structure \begin{align*} \mu_t &= \boldsymbol x^T_t \boldsymbol \beta \\ y_t &= \mu_t + e_t \\ e_t &= \theta e_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t\\ \varepsilon_t &\sim \; \text{i.i.d.} \; N(0, \sigma^2) \qquad \text{for} \; t \in \{1, \dots, n\} \end{align*} The average response $\mu_t$ reacts immediately on changes in the predictors $\boldsymbol x_t$ . This is not realistic for my data set. Instead the average response should slowly approximate the new level $\boldsymbol x^T_t \boldsymbol \beta$ (maybe based on an exponential function). This would correspond to the following model $$ \mu_t = (\mu_{t-1} - \boldsymbol x^T_t \boldsymbol \beta) e^{-\lambda} + \boldsymbol x^T_t \boldsymbol\beta $$ The following simulation illustrates the new model ## parameters beta My question How can I estimate the parameters $\boldsymbol\beta$ , $\lambda$ and $\theta$ and do inference (testing, confidence intervals) for such a model?
