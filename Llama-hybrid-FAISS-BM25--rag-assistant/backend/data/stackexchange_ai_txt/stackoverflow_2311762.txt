Personally, if portability isn't an issue, I would totally use *nix commands like grep, locate, etc. anyday over trying to duplicate that functionality in PHP. It's about using the best tool for the job. In some cases, arguably more often than most people realize, it is much more efficient to leverage the OS for file searching, manipulation, etc. (amongst other things)
