I have some experience with Infobright Community edition --- column-or. db, based on mysql. Pro: you can use mysql interfaces/odbc mysql drivers, from R too fast enough queries on big chunks of data selection (because of KnowledgeGrid & data packs) very fast native data loader and connectors for ETL (talend, kettle) optimized exactly that operations what I (and I think most of us) use (selection by factor levels, joining etc) special "lookup" option for optimized storing R factor variables ;) (ok, char/varchar variables with relatively small levels number/rows number) FOSS paid support option ? Cons: no insert/update operations in Community edition (yet?), data loading only via native data loader/ETL connectors no utf-8 official support (collation/sort etc), planned for q3 2009 no functions in aggregate queries f.e. select month (date) from ...) yet, planned for July(?) 2009, but because of column storage, I prefer simply create date columns for every aggregation levels (week number, month, ...) I need cannot installed on existing mysql server as storage engine (because of own optimizer, if I understood correctly), but you may install Infobright & mysql on different ports if you need ? Resume: Good FOSS solution for daily analytical tasks, and, I think, your tasks as well.
