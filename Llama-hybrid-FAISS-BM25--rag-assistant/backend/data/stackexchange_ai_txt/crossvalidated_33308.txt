What is the difference between Informative (IVM) and Relevance (RVM) vector machines

I'm trying to understand if there is any specific difference between Informative IVMs and Relevance RVMs other than the terminology. I've not seen anything explicit. When I'm reading about vector machines, it is easy to see the difference of IVM/RVMs from Support (SVM) vector machines [colloquially, for classification, the SVM finds those points (vectors) that define the DMZ (de-militatized zone ;-) between the categories, while the RVM finds those that are the 'middle' of the crowd, and an associated crowd 'size' (e.g. in gaussian globs)], but I don't see any special difference between I/R vector machines beyond a choice of terminology by their proponents. Is there a difference?
