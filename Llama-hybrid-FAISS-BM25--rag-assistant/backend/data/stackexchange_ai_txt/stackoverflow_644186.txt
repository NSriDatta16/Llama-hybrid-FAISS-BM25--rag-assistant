If you think about it, a "Link" is simply a way of identifying a "Next", "Previous", "Child" or "Parent" relationship among data instances. So, among real world applications you'll find a broad variety of applications. Think of a simple List (e.g. Grocery List) for basic Linked Lists. But consider too the uses to which we can place Graphs (plotting distances between cities on a map, interactions among species in biology) or Trees (hierarchies in an organization or data in an index of a database for two very diverse examples).
