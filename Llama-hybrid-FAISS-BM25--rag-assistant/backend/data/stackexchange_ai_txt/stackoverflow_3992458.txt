I think you took the wrong idea away from your previous question. Strings tend to be sparse and not good for lookup, use numbers instead. You still don't seem to get the difference between declaring in a .h and defining the storage in a .cpp thus avoiding multiple copies. Even if you had multiple copies (with different constant names) you would still have the issue you mentioned from your previous question. has one fatal flaw. I cannot have static module level code that uses these strings since they might not have been constructed yet The only way to avoid this is to bring the constants into the same scope with what you currently have at static module level. Put all the related stuff in a class!
