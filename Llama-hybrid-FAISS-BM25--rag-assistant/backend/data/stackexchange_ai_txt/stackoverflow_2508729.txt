how to separate debug and release mode code

During debug mode or while I am doing testing, I need to print lots of various information, so i use this method: #ifdef TESTING // code with lots of debugging info #else // clean code only #endif // TESTING` Is this a good method, or is there any other simple and elegant method ? But this way, I am repeating the same code in two places and if anything is to be changed later on in the code, I have to do it in both places, which is time consuming and error prone. Thanks. I am using MS Visual Studio.
