Use continuous data for DV as forcing it to categorical (2 categories -addicted or not addicted) leads to information loss For 8 (or even 5) predictors, sample size is very less (You may need more sophisticated techniques to handle such data) Either try to gather more data (recommended) Or try to use dimension reduction techniques (such as PCA) for variable selection (Literature review may also help/support) Try using both of the above mentioned options
