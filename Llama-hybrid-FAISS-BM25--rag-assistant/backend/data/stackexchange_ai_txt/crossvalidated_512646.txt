How to merge/encode a categorical feature's unique values in a regression problem

A feature contains more than 10 unique values in my case, and I want to merge them to improve my model speed. The problem is I don't know how to merge them in a scientific way. Now, my idea is to merge them by violin plot(feature-response): if these unique values have similar distributions, then I can merge them together. However, if there are many unique values, it is hard to make the decision by eyes. an example of my case is the following picture. In a classification problem, I will set dummy variables and add them all in the random forest model, then I merge them based on the importance. But now my case is a regression problem, so I don't know what metrics can help me make the decision and how to calculate them. help me, please.
