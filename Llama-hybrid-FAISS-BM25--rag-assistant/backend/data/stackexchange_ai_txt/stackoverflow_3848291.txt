Different types of browser storage

From this slideshow http://slides.html5rocks.com/#slide8 and from Chrome: View > Developer > Developer Tools > Storage tab, I learned that there are at least 4 types of browser storage: Databases, Local Storage, Session Storage, Cookies (are there more?) What are the differences? When should I use one over the other? For example, if a site wants to store user preferences, which storage method should the site tell the browser to use?
