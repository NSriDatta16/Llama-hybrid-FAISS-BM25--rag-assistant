The performance of the gnome sort algorithm is at least O(f(n)) where f(n) is the sum for each element in the input list of the distance to where that element should end up. For a "random" list of length L , an element at the beginning of the list is expected to be an average of L / 2 distance away from its sorted location. An element in the middle of the list is expected to be an average of L / 4 distance away from its sorted location. Since there are L total elements, f(n) is at least L * L / 4 . Therefore, on average, gnome sort is O(n * n) . Sorry if this is hard to follow.
