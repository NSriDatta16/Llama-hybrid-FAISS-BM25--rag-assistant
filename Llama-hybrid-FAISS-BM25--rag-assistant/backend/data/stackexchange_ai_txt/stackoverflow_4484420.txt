That the only localization/internationalization issue is translating messages. I used to think that all other languages (and I had no concept of locales) were like English in all ways except for words and grammar. To localize/internationalize a piece of software, therefore, you only needed to have a translator translate the strings that are shown to the user. Then I began realizing: Some languages are written right-to-left. Some scripts use contextual shaping. There is large variation in the way that dates, times, numbers, etc. are formatted. Program icons and graphics can be meaningless or offensive to some groups of people. Some languages have more than one "plural form". ... Even today I sometimes read about internationalization issues that surprise me.
