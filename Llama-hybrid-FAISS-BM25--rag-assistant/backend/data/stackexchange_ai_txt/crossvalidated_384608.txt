Unlike linear regression, for example, where the goal is to make good predictions within the range of the predictors, the goal of time series forecasting is generally extrapolating and making predictions about future periods. Accordingly the one step ahead error is used and can be calculated by using the data prior to each point in time point to build the model and then calculating the error as the observed value - the predicted value. The optimization objective function is then to minimize the sum of squared errors across all points (only using points in time where an observed value is available)
