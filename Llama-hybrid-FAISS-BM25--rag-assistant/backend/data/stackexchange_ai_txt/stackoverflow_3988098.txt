I notice that you aren't doing anything about your table borders. Could this be the gap you are seeing? If your borders have any width for any reason then they could be showing which might be giving you the effect in question. I made a quick jsfiddle proof of concept based on what I assume your outputted HTML will look like in its simplest form. I'm not familiar with the RoundedCornersExtender control though and I suspect that is modifying the HTML of the main div. http://jsfiddle.net/tAgp3/1/ You can see that this simplified form works but I assume that the rounded corners is trying to do some nasty tricks with embedding extra DIVs with background to do rounded corners. These could be what is causing your additional padding. Again I ask if you can post the actual html outputted to the browser so we can see if this is the case or not.
