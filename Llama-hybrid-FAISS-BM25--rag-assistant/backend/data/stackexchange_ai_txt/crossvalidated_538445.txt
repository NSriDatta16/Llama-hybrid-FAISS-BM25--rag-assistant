Demand forecasting task without demand column

I apologize for the naive question in advance, I'm completely new to forecasting. I have a Machine Learning demand forecasting task for a healthcare service. I have some columns such as date, diagnosis, hospital etc and each row represents a particular time that this service was used. However, from a search on the internet, all the datasets of similar nature also include a demand (sales) column that is being predicted. How should I approach this forecasting problem if I haven't got such a column? My task is to make weekly and monthly forecasting models for this service in python.
