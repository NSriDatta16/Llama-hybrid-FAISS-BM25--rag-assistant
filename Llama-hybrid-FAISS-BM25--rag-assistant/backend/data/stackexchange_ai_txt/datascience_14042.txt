How to read data in DSX from Data hub object storage container?

I am creating a new notebook with DSX. I have a data set that I want to use. It is not CSV. I found that I could go to Data hub by clicking top-right tile near my logged in name, then object storage in dropdown and finally upload a text file. How do I read this file in my notebook? Do I need to create a connection ?
