Import a YAML (fixtures) file from another

for better organization (for eg: seed and test data), is it possible to split the yaml file and import the first one from second. Of course, the variables in file1 should be available to use in the second. I use Snakeyaml based parser i java, if that matters. thanks. Update 1: (example) Seed file: seed.yaml Priority(L1E1): level: 1 priorityCode: E1 description: Escalation test data file: test-data.yaml Request(RER1): priority: L1E1 title: Something So, I need to split the files, as they becoming huge. Also the variable/data (L1E1 in this case) defined in one file needs to be accessible in the second file.
