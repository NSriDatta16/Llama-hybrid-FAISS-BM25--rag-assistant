A 3-State tree control is a bit uncommon and might therefore be a bit confusing; consider that even simple 3-state checkboxes are relatively rare and users may not be accustomed to them. Maybe that's why you didn't find such a tree control. Thus, maybe you should consider using an alternate design that doesn't require 3-state controls. For example, the node could start in collapsed node. If the user expands it, and there is no data yet, show a single sub node with the text "retrieving data..." (and a progress wheel or other progress indicator, if you can) and start data retrieval. When the data arrives, replace this sub node with the actual data.
