Unless you need to be able to separate and use the logic of this code in multiple applications, there is really no need to separate it into that many projects. It adds complexity but doesn't really add value. I used to separate the general BL library from the DL library but realized I wasn't really getting anything out of it...and I was making some things more annoying in the process. What is most important in separating code is the logical separation, not the physical separation into separate dlls . Also, instead of breaking this up into separate web apps, put them in one. It will be a lot easier to develop and deploy. This allows you to use one web.config. If they are separate websites then create different web projects. If they are not, then don't. [Edited] One thing I meant to add, which is important, is this: The question of how you should design this is actually too general to really come up with a real answer. Those thoughts are just my general thoughts on project organization, which is what the question really seemed to revolve around.
