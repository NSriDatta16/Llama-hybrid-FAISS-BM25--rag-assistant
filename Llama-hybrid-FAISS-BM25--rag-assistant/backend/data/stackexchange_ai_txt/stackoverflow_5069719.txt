OpenCV uses VFW and only creates standard AVI files which are limited to 2Gb You can use ffmpeg to create either mp4 or extended openDML type AVIs The easiest solution is normally to pipe image frames to something like memcoder rather than having to deal with the details of the video library yourself - see http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/VideoCodecs
