What logic operator to use, AS3?

What operator or expression can I use that will fire on every number, including zero? I want a logic operator that will fire with ever number it receives. My animations pause at zero. This skips on zero if (numberThing> 0); This jitters 'fires quickly and goes back on count' if (numberThing== 0); alt text http://www.ashcraftband.com/myspace/videodnd/logicTest.jpg EXPLANATION I'm catching split string values in a logic function, and feeding them to a series of IF, ELSE IF statements. I'm using this with a timer, so I can measure the discrepancy.
