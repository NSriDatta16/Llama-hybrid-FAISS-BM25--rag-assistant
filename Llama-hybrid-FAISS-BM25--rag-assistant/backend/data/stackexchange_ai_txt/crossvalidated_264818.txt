How to do feature engineering of real time data?

I have made a good linear regression model with following step: Data Integration Data normalization/scaling(data preprocessing & feature engineering) Model Building(using linear regression with SGD using cross validation) Testing My question is if we use this model in production environment then how can we do feature engineering of real time data because this model is built with feature normalization and scaling so how real time data can be normalized and scaled to get a good prediction? We don't need explicit feature engineering for cross validation and testing step because this can be done in data preprocessing step before building a model. What about real time data feature engineering? you can have a look at the sample problem at sample linear regression in pyspark
