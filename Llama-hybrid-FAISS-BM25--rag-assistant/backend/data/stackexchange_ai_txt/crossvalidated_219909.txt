Find Bayesian estimator with random sample from poisson and prior distribution from exponential distribution

Let $X_{1}$ .....$X_n$ be a random sample from Poisson distribution, prior distribution with parameter $\pi(\lambda) = \beta e^{-\beta\lambda}$. Find Bayesian estimator I couldn't take integration joint density part, anyone has any clue? I really appreciate. Thanks
