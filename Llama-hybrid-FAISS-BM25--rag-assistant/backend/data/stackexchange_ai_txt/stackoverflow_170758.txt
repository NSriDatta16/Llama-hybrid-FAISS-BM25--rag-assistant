We use Perl, so Devel::Cover has been very useful for us. Shows per-statement coverage, branch coverage and conditional coverage during unit testing, as well as things like POD coverage. We use HTML output with easy-to-recognize greens for "100%", through yellow and red for lower levels of coverage. EDIT: To expand on things a little: If conditional coverage isn't complete, examine the conditions for interdependence. If it's there, refactor. If it isn't you should be able to extend your tests to hit all of the conditions. If conditional and branch coverage looks complete but statement coverage isn't, you've either written the conditionals wrong (e.g. always returning early from a sub when you didn't mean to) or you've got extra code that can be safely removed.
