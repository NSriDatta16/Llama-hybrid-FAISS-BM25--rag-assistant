I hope this might be helpful: for both FA and PCA ''The methods described in this chapter require large samples to derive stable solutions. What constitutes an adequate sample size is somewhat complicated. Until recently, analysts used rules of thumb like “factor analysis requires 5–10 times as many subjects as variables.” Recent studies suggest that the required sample size depends on the number of factors, the number of variables associated with each factor, and how well the set of factors explains the variance in the variables (Bandalos and Boehm-Kaufman, 2009). I’ll go out on a limb and say that if you have several hundred observations, you’re probably safe.'' Reference: Bandalos, D. L., and M. R.
