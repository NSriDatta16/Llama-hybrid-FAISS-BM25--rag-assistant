Forecasting hourly time series

I have the following time series: Data is aviable here data The time series represent an hourly eletricity load. It starts at 2018-09-13 19:00:00 and end at 2018-12-23 15:00:00. I want to predict the next 36 hours values. I tried several method but without success. This is my code: load.msts The result of prediction is: Then i tried: load.stlm The result of prediction is: I have also tried Facebook prophet: load.prophet.df Results: I think that the problem is related to the amount of data. I don't have enough data ( only one year of data). How can improve my forecasting? Thx
