I would go with option number 1: loading your java code in your database. I have had good experiences with this approach and you don't need that much experience to get a good solution working with this method. The only part where embedding Java in your database gets complicated (you'll have to set special permissions for your Java code) is when you need access to external resources (network, file i/o to name a few) and it is clearly not your situation in this problem.
