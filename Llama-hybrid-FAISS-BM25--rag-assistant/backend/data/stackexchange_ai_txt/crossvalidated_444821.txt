Is the objective of Principle Component Analysis mainly for prediction rather than interpretation?

PCA assigns more weight to the variable with high variation. However, the factor's variation is not the same as its importance. For example, suppose the true model is y=3x1 + 100x2, which shows that x2 has a large impact on y. However, even in the population, the variation of x2 is small, therefore resulting in x2 given less weight in the PCA. But it has nothing to with the importance of x2. Can we conclude that PCA is mainly for prediction and does a bad job in causal inference? Thanks
