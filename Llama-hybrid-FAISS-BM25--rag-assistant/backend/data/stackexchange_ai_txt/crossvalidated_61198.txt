Your linear regression model appears to be: $E[Y|Gender,Treatment] = \beta_0 + \beta_1Male +\beta_2Treatment +\beta_3Male*Treatment$ For simplicity, Male = 1 means a male participant, Male = 0 is a female; Treatment = 1 is experimental, and Treatment = 0 is traditional. In that case, you already have everything you need to know. If you are interested in absolute values, you can get these as follows: The expected value of your outcome among women who receive the traditional treatment is equal to $\beta_0$. The expected value of your outcome among men who receive the traditional treatment is equal to $\beta_0 + \beta_1$. The expected value of your outcome among women who receive the experimental treatment is equal to $\beta_0 + \beta_2$. The expected value of your outcome among men who receive the experimental treatment is equal to $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$. If you are interested in relative values, you can get those by comparing any two of the above four absolute values. So, the ratio of the expected values of the outcome for men versus women, for all those who receive the traditional treatment, is $\frac{\beta_0 + \beta_1}{\beta_0}$. By comparison, the ratio of the expected values of the outcome for women versus men, for all those who receive the traditional treatment, is $\frac{\beta_0}{\beta_0+\beta_1}$. EDIT: Based on your comments below, you seem to be interested in estimating the difference in test scores between the groups. To get the expected difference in test scores between any two groups, subtract the estimated average test score for those two groups: Δ=E(Y|X=x,Z=z)−E(Y|X=x′,Z=z′). So, for comparing men and women, when both receive traditional treatment, you use $(\beta_0+\beta_1) - (\beta_0) = \beta_1$. Therefore, $\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the expected difference in test scores between men and women, among those receiving the traditional treatment. Similarly, for experimental versus traditional, among women, you compare $(\beta_0 + \beta_2) - (\beta_0) = \beta_2$. So, again, $\beta_2$ can be interpreted as the expected difference in test scores between experimental and traditional treatment, among women. If you use the same process, you can also get the expected difference in test scores between experimental and traditional treatment, among men: $(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3) - (\beta_0 + \beta_1) = \beta_2 + \beta_3$. Similarly, the expected difference between men and women, among those with the experimental treatment, is $(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3) - (\beta_0 + \beta_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3$. You could get these last two by recoding and re-running your regression equation, but there's no need to since you already have all the information you need in your current regression model.
