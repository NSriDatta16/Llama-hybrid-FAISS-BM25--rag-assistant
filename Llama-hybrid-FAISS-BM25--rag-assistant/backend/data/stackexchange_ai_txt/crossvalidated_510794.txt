Logistic regression loss function not zero for perfect model

The definition of the logistic regression loss function I use is this: We draw the data i.i.d. according to some distribution $D$ , realised by some $\langle X, Y \rangle$ . Now if $h_w$ was the real data generating distribution, that is $\mathbb{P}(Y = 1 \ | \ X = x) = h_w(x)$ , I'd expect the loss function to be zero, but I do not think this is the case. Is that a calculation mistake or is it unreasonable to ask the loss function to be zero for a perfect hypothesis? If so, why? Calculation $$\mathbb{E}[\log(1 + exp(-Y\langle w, X \rangle))] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[\log(1 + exp(-Y\langle w, X \rangle))] \ | \ X = x]$$ $$= \int \log(1 + exp(-\langle w, x \rangle)) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\langle w, x \rangle}} + \log(1 + exp(\langle w, x \rangle)) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{\langle w, x \rangle}} d\mathbb{P}^X(x)$$ and this is not zero because the function we integrate is not zero almost everywhere.
