Is this for converting old pdb files to something that is usable on the pre or do you actually want to use .pdb files on the pre. In the last case I would seriously advise you to reconsider. The pre supports a number of nice (modern!) data storage options showcased in this sample application . If you just need to read an old .pdb file once for conversion, I don't know about anything in javascript that reads them, but jpilot-db does it in java.
