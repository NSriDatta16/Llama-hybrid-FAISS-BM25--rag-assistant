As far as I know, whether it runs in or out of browser it will need a web service or other means to hit a database. You cannot do it through the Silverlight application because of the sandbox security model used. In 4.0 there is the added use of COM so you may be able to use that to your advantage. Otherwise you would just be using a file stored in IsolatedStorage to persist data to, like an XML file for example. Maybe this is what you are looking for though?
