The reason why your query takes so long is because of your inner select, you are essentialy running 6,400,000,000 queries. With a query like this your best solution may be to develop a timed reporting system, where the user receives an email when the query is done and the report is constructed or the user logs in and checks the report after. Even with the optimization written by OMG Ponies (bellow) you are still looking at around the same number of queries. SELECT x.day_of_week, AVG(x.count) 'average_records_created' FROM (SELECT DAYOFWEEK(t.datetime_entry) 'day_of_week', COUNT(*) 'count' FROM VMS_LOGS t GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(t.datetime_entry)) x GROUP BY x.day_of_week
