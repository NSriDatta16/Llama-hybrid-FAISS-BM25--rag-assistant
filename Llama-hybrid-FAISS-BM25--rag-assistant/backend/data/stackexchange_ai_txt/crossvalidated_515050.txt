This is a one-stage Bayesian model, since the hyperparameter $\psi$ is fixed, rather than being another random variable. Consider the difference between $$\theta \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$$ $$\theta \sim \mathcal N(\psi_1,\psi_2)\qquad \psi_1=0\,,\psi_2=1$$ and $$\theta|\psi_1=0\,,\psi_2=1 \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$$ There is none! The conditional bar "|" is not used in a probabilistic sense there. This means that, if $$X|\theta\sim f(x|\theta)\qquad \theta|\psi\sim p(\theta|\psi)$$ then $$\theta|X=x,\psi \sim p(\theta|x,\psi) \propto f(x|\theta) p(\theta|\psi)$$
