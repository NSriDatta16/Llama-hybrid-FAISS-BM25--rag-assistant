I will try to refer to the points I have some opinion about: "What if it's not possible to label non-anomalous data to train the model?" In this case, you face unsupervised learning problem. there are plenty of reading material regarding this topic and plenty of approaches. here is one for example: https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-learning-for-anomaly-detection-44c55a96b8c1 this article may be good as well: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224375498_Anomaly_Detection_by_Combining_Decision_Trees_and_Parametric_Densities if you can distinguish anomalies by their distribution, it sounds that you do know the anomaly data, am I wrong? the issue with defining anomalies lower than 5th quantile, that it means that 5 % of your data that examined by the leaf will be considered as anomaly, so you if run you algorithm frequently, there is a good chance you will see a lot of anomalies. maybe try using confidence intervals. From what I have read, decision trees are not the classic method for anomaly detection. read about fraud detection, isolation trees, using SVM and there are more ways.
