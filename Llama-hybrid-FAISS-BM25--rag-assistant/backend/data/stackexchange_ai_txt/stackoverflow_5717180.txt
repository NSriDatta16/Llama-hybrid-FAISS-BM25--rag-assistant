Your connector configuration looks good, so I suspect there's something wrong with the generated keystore. Are you sure you generated it as instructed in Tomcat 6 SSL Configuration HOW-TO ? The command should look like this: %JAVA_HOME%\bin\keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA (Pay attention to the -alias tomcat parameter - I found some references which indicate that leaving it out would cause the "signed overrun" problem you're having.)
