You may find the strategy of Percolator useful. It takes two datasets, a decoy (all negative) and a target (positives and negatives), and uses them to create a very robust model. More modern versions include 3-fold cross validation. The way it works is to try to separate positive examples as a difference with the decoy database. Then, iteratively, trains a SVM using the good identifications as positives and all the decoy as negatives. Disclosure: I was working at that lab with both first authors, but not on Percolator.
