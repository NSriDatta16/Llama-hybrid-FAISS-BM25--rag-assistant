The timeit() function runs the code many times (default one million) and takes an average of the timings. To run the code only once, do this: t.timeit(1) but that will give you skewed results - it repeats for good reason. To get the per-loop time having let it repeat, divide the result by the number of loops. Use a smaller value for the number of repeats if one million is too many: count = 1000 print t.timeit(count) / count
