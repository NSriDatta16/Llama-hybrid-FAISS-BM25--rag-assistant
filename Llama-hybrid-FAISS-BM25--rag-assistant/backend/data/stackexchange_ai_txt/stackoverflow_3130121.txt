I would suggest using XAudio2 from the latest DirectX sdk to play your audio. I will take a little more work & code, but the end result will be better because you will be able to load the sound file separately from playing it. With 'PlaySound' you will notice a lag in the audio if you try to use it right after an event, like a mouse click or a monster dying / explosion and you won't hit this with XAudio2. I know this from experience. Since you are already using Visual Studio, I also suggest you try using VS 2010 if possible because the [Concurrency Runtime, Parallel Pattern Library and Agents Library]] 1 make threading and tasking take a little less code. There are samples as well at http://code.msdn.com/concrtextras and you may find something useful here as well. -Rick
