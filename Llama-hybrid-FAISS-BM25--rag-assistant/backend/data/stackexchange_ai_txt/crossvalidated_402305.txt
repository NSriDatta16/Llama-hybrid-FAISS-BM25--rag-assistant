One of the more obvious approach is to simulate with model parameters drawn from your prior beliefs, then draw your Bayesian inference and assess what proportion of simulations looks they way you'd like them to look. Alternatively, you could make frequentist style assumptions (at least with respect to the size of the quantity of interest - perhaps reflecting the uncertainty about nuisance parameters is rather useful) and then simulate your planned Bayesian analysis.
