You can try lying about your user agent (e.g., by trying to make believe you're a human being and not a robot) if you want to get in possible legal trouble with Barnes & Noble. Why not instead get in touch with their business development department and convince them to authorize you specifically? They're no doubt just trying to avoid getting their site scraped by some classes of robots such as price comparison engines, and if you can convince them that you're not one, sign a contract, etc, they may well be willing to make an exception for you. A "technical" workaround that just breaks their policies as encoded in robots.txt is a high-legal-risk approach that I would never recommend. BTW, how does their robots.txt read?
