Is there a way to run a java program against some data, then find out which branches were not taken? (code coverage)

I have some fairly complex java programs with lots of if/else statements where various components interact with each other. I have some test data which exercises the code as much as possible. Is there a way for me to run my code against this data and get information about which code paths were and were not executed? (by test files, I mean I literally have text based csv files with hundreds of thousands of lines. Think of these lines as a collection of parameters. I try to randomly generate these parameters to make sure all parts of my code are touched, but I'd like to be more sure since these programs have a high cost of failure)
