Phone number tagging with spaCy

I have to do a BIO tagging for a given set of sentences. For example: sentence = 'My name is XYZ, I live in United States of America, my Phone number is (123)123-1234" The phone number can be in any format. The expected result: But I get: Code: import spacy s= 'I live in United states of America, my Phone number is (123)123-1234' nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') doc = nlp(s) test = pd.DataFrame([(e.text, e.pos_,e.ent_iob_,e.ent_type_) for e in doc]) Can someone please help?
