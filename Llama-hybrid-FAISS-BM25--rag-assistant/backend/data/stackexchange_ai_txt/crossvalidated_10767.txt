Modeling relative contribution of a variable

I am overthinking this for sure, but I am stumped. I have a historical data set of projects with hours of contribution by various positions. There are six types of projects. How can I model the average contribution of each position for future forecasting purposes? Linear regression doesn't work because that models the independent contribution of each position. The end goal is to establish a formula that will allow me to say "when working on project type 1, if position A contributes 40 hours, then positions B and C usually need X hours a piece." The data look like this: Total Hours Project Type Position A Position B Position C 200 1 100 40 60 140 2 40 60 40 And so on for about 700 projects.
