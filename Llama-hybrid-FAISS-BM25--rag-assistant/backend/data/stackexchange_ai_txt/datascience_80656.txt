How to predict unknown unknowns in machine learning

I am dealing with a problem about classifying bird species through analysing MFCCs. I already built a dataset with 13 MFCCs for two kinds of birds. And I trained the data with Naive Bayes & KNN model. However, when I tried the model with prediction of third bird species, it is classified as the one of the two species. I am wondering how can I achieve to predict unknown species as unknowns? And I know my existing classification model may not work. So, what kind of model might be helpful? Does SSL useful in my case? Or treat these unknowns as outliers? But how can that be applied in MFCC?
