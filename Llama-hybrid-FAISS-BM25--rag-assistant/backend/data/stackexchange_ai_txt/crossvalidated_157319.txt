Test of significance for a nonlinear trend in time series analyses, ARIMA

I have water temperature data consisting of monthly means for 20 years. As one would expect there is a definite seasonal/cyclical pattern. I wish to model the time series data by fitting an ARIMA model. Two questions: Would this be an appropriate analysis for temperature data? How do I test if there is a significant trend (a p-value would be nice!) of increasing water temperature in this data which is clearly nonlinear?
