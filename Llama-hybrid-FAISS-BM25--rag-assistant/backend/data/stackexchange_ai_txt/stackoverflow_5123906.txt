Find all records of a certain type in Polymorphic table using ActiveRecord in Rails 3

I have a table Category that is a polymorphic model for a bunch of other models. For instance model Address has shipping, billing, home, work category model Phone has home, mobile, work, fax category model Product has medical, it equipment, automotive, aerospace, etc categories. What I want to be able to do is something like Product.all_categories and get and array of all categories that are specific to this model. Of course I can do something like this for each model in question: Category.select("name").where("categorizable_type = ?","address") Also pace_car - which is rails 3 ready, allows me to do something like this: Category.for_category_type(Address) But I was wondering if there is a more straightforward / elegant solution to this problem using Active Record iteself - without relying on a gem?
