How to get started in data-relation algorithms and mathematics?

I am very interested in the concepts and discussions taking place here. However, I'm not entirely sure what this field of study is called or what the many branches of study are being discussed here are. It all seems to be related to finding relations and patterns in data so we can use it in a meaningful way. As a developer, I find myself increasingly researching things like Statistical Graphing, Natural Language Processing, Bayesian filters or Probably, Bin-Packing problems, and many more. Unfortunately, I'm not sure where to go to learn these things and better contribute to the community here. What names can I use to research and learn the topics discussed here? What would the equivalent college courses for this type of study be called?
