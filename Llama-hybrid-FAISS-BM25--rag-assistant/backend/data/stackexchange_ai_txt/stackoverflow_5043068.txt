Navigation controllers are meant to organise other view controllers. You aren't supposed to lay them out yourself. You're supposed to create other view controllers, assign one of them as the navigation controller's root view controller, then write code to let the user navigate to the other view controllers from there. If you're trying to get the table view controller nib to show up, then you should probably be assigning the table view controller to the navigation controller's rootViewController property.
