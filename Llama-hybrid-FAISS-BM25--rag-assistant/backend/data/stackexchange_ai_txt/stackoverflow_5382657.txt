You should use HTML 5 not because it's new and shiny, but it is the future. If you don't plan for the future, your going to have to migrate sooner or later. It's not like HTML5 is in alpha version right now, it is being implemented heavily by browsers now. By making your site HTML5 compliant now, not only will you be ahead of the curve, but you won't have to catch up months/years from now. And I won't throw the new/shiny reason at you, however the specs offer very useful features such as Offline Storage, Native video and Audio, Geolocation, Better form elements etc etc. So not only will you be ahead of the curve, but you will be providing awesome new features for your users. Just for reference, here is a comparison chart on compatibility with HTML5 features in browsers today. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28HTML5%29
