I would discourage you from using a different database for storing the logging info versus your business data. When you want to do real-life reporting - for example, how many users of group X did activity Y - you will want to do joins between the "business data" and the "logging data". If that data is in a different database management system, you'll have troubles. Really, the tax for doing a single write to disk isn't that high (note that your HDD controller is smart enough to batch up the writes - the writes aren't blocking).
