I assume you mentioned 5 stars as the rating system you are using and not that you only wish to retrieve users with ratings of 5 stars. SELECT u.userName, avg( r.ratingValue ) as averageRating FROM userTable u LEFT JOIN ratingTable r ON u.userID = r.userID GROUP BY u.UserID ORDER BY avg( r.ratingValue ) desc This will get the average rating of each user and display their names. userName averageRating test1 4.5000 test2 1.7500
