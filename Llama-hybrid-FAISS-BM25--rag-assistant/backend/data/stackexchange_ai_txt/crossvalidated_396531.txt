With the data you are describing, where at each sample point only one of the vector components is observed, there is no information (meaning no information at all ) about correlations. So there is no way you can fit a Gaussian model with non-diagonal covariance matrix. If you tried with a bayesian model, with a (proper) prior on the covariance matrix, your posterior would be identical to the prior, confirming that there are no sample information.
