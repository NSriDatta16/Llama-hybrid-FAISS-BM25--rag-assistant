ExtJS method load() just doesn't work

I'm going through some beginners tutorials on ExtJS and when I try to load a .html file with some HTML code it doesn't work here's the test.html with the ExtJS code HTML Page setup Tutorial // Path to the blank image should point to a valid location on your server Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = '../ext-3.2.1/resources/images/default/s.gif'; Ext.onReady(function(){ Ext.get('div1').load({ url : 'htmlFragment.html', scripts : true }); }); and the htmlFragment.html is just as it says, a fragment of HTML code Hello there! This is an HTML fragment. both the file with the ExtJS code and the htmlFragment.html are in the same folder and I really see no reason for this not to work but it doesn't :( all the other ExtJS examples I tried, DOM manipulation and other basic stuff worked just fine I'm trying this on a Windows machine, and it doesn't work in any browser(FF, Opera, IE, Chrome)
