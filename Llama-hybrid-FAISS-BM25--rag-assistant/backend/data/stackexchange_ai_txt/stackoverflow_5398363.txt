Why does Android app run in small window on tablet emulator?

I have an Android App, it works properly on android phones. I've downloaded Android 3.0 sdk and created a tablet emulator at 1024x600, using Android 3.0. When I test my app it runs in a small window centered at the top, using about 1/4 of the screen. What do I have to change in the app, xml files, or manifest to get it to use the whole tablet screen? As a side note I also have icons for drawable-ldpi, hdpi and mdpi. Thanks, Gerry
