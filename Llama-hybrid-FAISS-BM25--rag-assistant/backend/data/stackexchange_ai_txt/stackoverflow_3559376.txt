NSDecimalNumber is an object wrapper for a number--you are treating it like a C value. Instead, try: float price = [sku.retailPrice floatValue] * (100 - [client.pricingDiscount floatValue]); NSDecimalNumber *showPrice = [NSDecimalNumber numberWithFloat:price]; It's confusing, but NSNumber and NSDecimalNumber are Objective-C wrappers for C types, typically used for storage in container objects such as NSArray (or Core Data). NSInteger and NSDecimal , on the other hand, are C types ( NSInteger just maps to int ). EDIT: falconcreek's answer is better for avoiding accuracy loss. When working with integers, though, you'll typically use unboxed C types.
