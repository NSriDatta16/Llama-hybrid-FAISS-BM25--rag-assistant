How to force iPhone/iPod touch to handle more than 5 touches at the same time?

I would like to develop a multi-touch (up to 8 fingers) application for iPhone/iPod Touch. But during testing on my 1st gen iPod Touch once I put the 6th finger weird things started to happen. I don't get Touch Began for the 6th finger nor Touch Ended/Cancelled for the first 5 fingers. Do you know of any workaround for this? Does it behave the same on your iPhones/iPods? Would it work on G1 on Android? Thanks
