There are three ways get the count: Fire a fetch request for the top category in question, and from that object get the count of entities in it's sub-categories relationship set. The downside of this approach is that it will cause CoreData to fetch the relationship property from the store, fetching every object associated with that relationship. e.g. NSManagedObject *topCat = [context performFetch:topCatFetchRequest]; NSInteger count = topCat.subCategories.count; Use raw SQLite API's to query the data store directly (note this is much faster). Probably the easiest, use NSManagedObjectContext countForFetchRequest: , which will return the number of objects matching a given fetch request.
