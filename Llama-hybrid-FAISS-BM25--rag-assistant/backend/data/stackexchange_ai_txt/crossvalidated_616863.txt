The group that has the mean that is in the "better" direction did better on average. The t-test lets you assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, and so if you got a small enough p-value then it is reasonable (in some sort of proportion to the smallness of the p-value) to think that one group did better. Seeing which group did better on average needs no statistics beyond the mean. Just graph the data. Never make inferences on the basis of data without examining the data in some sort of visual display.
