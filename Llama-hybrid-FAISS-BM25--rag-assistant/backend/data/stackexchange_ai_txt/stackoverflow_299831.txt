Where are the graphical page components for an ASP.NET MVC application?

This sounds really stupid, but I was told that you could drag-and-drop visual components (including JavaScript or AJAX components?) onto a web page view in ASP.NET MVC and then "customize" the components by editing code behind them once they were in place. Either I misunderstood what I was told or I'm blind and don't see how to do this, but the ability to do this would help a lot, especially since I can't really design things to save my life. EDIT 1: For clarification: The way I was told, it made it seem like you could go to a panel, drag a button over to a view area, and then the HTML/CSS to put the button there would be stubbed out. Then, you could open a code editor and tweak everything exactly how you want it to be.
