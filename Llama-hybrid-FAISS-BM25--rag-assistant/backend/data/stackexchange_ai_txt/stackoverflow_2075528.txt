IME its been a very long time since I've seen a true HTTP/1.0 request. (including mobile devices fuzzylollipop). I say a true request as MSIE still (pretends) to downgrade to HTTP/1.0 by default (unless yo sig in the config) when you connect via a proxy (all the outgoing requests are flagged as HTTP/1.0) - however it still includes HTTP/1.1 specific request headers and respects all the HTTP/1.1 responses. Curiously, IIS, in a mirror image, happily ignores the HTTP version (although I've not experimented much with this to see if only does this for MSIE user agents). So by curious coincidence, MSIE and IIS work much better with proxies than with standards-compliant tools. C.
