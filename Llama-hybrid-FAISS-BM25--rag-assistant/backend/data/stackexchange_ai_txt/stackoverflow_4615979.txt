Perl doesn't have macros. (A sufficiently demented programmer could fake them using source filters but that sort of black magic is best avoided.) use constant doesn't trigger an inline replacement the way the C preprocessor does. Instead, it creates a subroutine that always returns the same value. When you write use constant PI => 3.14; what Perl does is (essentially) sub PI() { 3.14 } The constant pragma can only be used to define values, not code. To reuse code define a subroutine instead.
