How to send info to LCD from web

I have seen applications capable of sending information to Logitech LCD panels and played with that a bit a few years ago. Currently, I have four small LCD panels. Two are CrystalFontz 633s, one came from a 1U EMC data storage box and one was taken from an old ethernet-based KVM, so I've no idea what it's capabilities are. Using either Flex Builder or Visual Studio, is it possible to create either a webpage or an offline app, such as for Adobe Air, Mac Widget, or Windows 7 Gadget, that can check for and feed text to a USB- or serial-connected LCD device? If it's an offline app, it would be very convenient to be able to talk to web-based php scripts and relay that data back to the LCD.
