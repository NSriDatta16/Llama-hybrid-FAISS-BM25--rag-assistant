As answered by others, there's a limit on url size with get, and files can be submitted with post only. I'd like to add that one can add things to a database with a get and perform actions with a post. When a script receives a post or a get, it can do whatever the author wants it to do. I believe the lack of understanding comes from the wording the book chose or how you read it. A script author should use posts to change the database and use get only for retrieval of information. Scripting languages provided many means with which to access the request. For example, PHP allows the use of $_REQUEST to retrieve either a post or a get. One should avoid this in favor of the more specific $_GET or $_POST . In web programming, there's a lot more room for interpretation. There's what one should and what one can do, but which one is better is often up for debate. Luckily, in this case, there is no ambiguity. You should use posts to change data, and you should use get to retrieve information.
