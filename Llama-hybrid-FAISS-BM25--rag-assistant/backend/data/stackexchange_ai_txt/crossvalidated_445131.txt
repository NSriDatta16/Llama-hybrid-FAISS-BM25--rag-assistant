Why can't regression via Maximum Likelihood shrink coefficients to zero?

Why can't regression via Maximum Likelihood shrink regression coefficients to zero as in LASSO? Does shrinking coefficients to zero not give higher L-likelihood? Does the answer to my question have to do with the fact LASSO is bayesian with Laplace priors and Maximum likelihood is frequentist?
