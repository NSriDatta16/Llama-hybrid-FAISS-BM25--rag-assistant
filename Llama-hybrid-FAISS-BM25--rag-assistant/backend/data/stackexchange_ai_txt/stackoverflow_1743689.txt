PDF allows for locking the document (source text will be encrypted, but readable), so the properties won't allow reader to print or copy from it. Anyway, I would discourage this use as it is pain in the ass to use such PDF. Personally, I would recommend you to look for other methods than actively making your document readers angry. PS: Harvesting emails from PDF is virtually unheard of.
