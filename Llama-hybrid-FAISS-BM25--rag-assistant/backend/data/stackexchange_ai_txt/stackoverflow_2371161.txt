Without any consideration of efficiency: (defn average [lst] (/ (reduce + lst) (count lst))) (defn moving-average [window lst] (map average (partition window 1 lst))) user> (moving-average 5 '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) (3 4 5 6) If you need it to be fast, there are some fairly obvious improvements to be made! But it will get less elegant.
