@Simone makes some good points, so I will just throw in a couple of complementary tidbits. Although normalization can help with things like speed, logistic regression does not make assumptions about the distributions of your predictor variables. Thus, you don't have to normalize. Second, while adding a squared term can lead to overfitting (and you need to be cautious about that) it is permissible. What that would mean is that the probability of success is higher in the middle of a predictor's range than at the extremes (or vice versa).
