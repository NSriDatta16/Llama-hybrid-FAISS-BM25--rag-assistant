How to map values reconstructed with a deep learning autoencoder back to categories

My colleague and I are working on a dataset full of categorical variables using an deep learning model with autoencoder of H2O package in python2.7 . As shown in the table below, we have used the autoencoder to reconstruct the data. The problem is that we don't really know how to interpret the results since we don't know the mechanism behind the Deep Learning autoencoder which predicts the categorical variables. Here is a sample of the original dataset with categorical variables: A sample of the reconstructed / predicted data follows: We first want to understand how the model is treating categorical variables. We also want to know how we can translate the reconstructed variables into the original categorical ones.
