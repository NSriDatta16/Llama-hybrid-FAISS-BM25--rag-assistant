I'm not gonna be that guy that lists off all the features of WPF. I'm trying to be tactical here. Here's my list: Full Trust Mode (i.e. file system access, full screen text entry) Direct access to the printer ItemContainerGenerator promoted from the SL Toolkit to SL. This class is so ridiculously important for building custom ItemsControls. Drag & Drop from the Desktop Better RelativeSource Binding Support ScatterView & other touch optimized controls Receive notification of assembly updates at runtime (so that users that don't close the browser can receive code updates).
