lag does not shift the data, it only shifts the "time-base". x has no "time base", so cbind does not work as you expected. Try cbind(as.ts(x),lag(x)) and notice that a "lag" of 1 shifts the periods forward . I would suggesting using zoo / xts for time series. The zoo vignettes are particularly helpful.
