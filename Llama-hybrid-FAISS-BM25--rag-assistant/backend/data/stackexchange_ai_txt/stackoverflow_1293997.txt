You can probably do that using jQuery, i.e. $(".thickbox").each(function() { this.href += "?height=200&width=300"; }); I've not tested this and it may be wrong, I'm not in a position to test it at the moment but hopefully it'll point you in the right direction if nothing else. If you have jQuery for Thickbox then you may as well leverage it for the manipulation ;)
