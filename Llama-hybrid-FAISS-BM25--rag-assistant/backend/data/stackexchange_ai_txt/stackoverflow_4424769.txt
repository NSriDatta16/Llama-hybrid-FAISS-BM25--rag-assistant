Developing for both ATI and NVIDIA is actually not too difficult so long as you avoid using any part of either vendor's SDK. Stick to OpenCL as it is defined in the OpenCL spec. ( www.khronos.org/opencl ) and your code will stay syntax portable. Due to differences in the underlying architectures, performance portability may be an issue. Local & Global worksizes really have to be determined independently for each card to maximize performance. Another thing to pay attention to is the types being used. Vector types (float2, float4) are especially useful on ATI cards, as each processing element actually contains 4 execution units (one for each RGB color channel, plus aplha).
