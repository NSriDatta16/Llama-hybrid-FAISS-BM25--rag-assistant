get data out between html tags

I have some HTML System.Web.HttpException: Path '/DynamicData/DimOrganisations/List.aspx' was not found. Generated: Tue, 29 Sep 2009 18:04:18 GMT I want to search through my HTMl for the tag p id="errorMessage" And then take out the data with the html. So run something to look for the tag and get the data out between the start and end tag. So by the end I get: System.Web.HttpException: Path '/DynamicData/DimOrganisations/List.aspx' was not found. Can anyone help. I am using C# 2008 Thanks Marc
