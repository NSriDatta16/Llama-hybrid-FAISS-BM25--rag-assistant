Large APK not visible via Market on different phones

I have a large application published in Android Market which for some unknown reason is not visible on all of the phones that I have tested it on. I have tested the same application on these same phones by installing via USB and there was no issues at all. I believe the issue where the different phones are not all able to see the application in Android Market has something to do with the size of the application (43 MBs) which is under the new 50 MB limit. I'm not using any unusual market place filters (I have listed the badging below). The full application is visible in Android Market on a Motorola Droid 2.0 (US), but not visible on a Samsung Galaxy S 2.1 (UK), HTC Legend 2.2 (UK) or HTC Desire 2.2 (UK). I do not have a maxSdkVersion set! To verify that the issue was due to the size of the APK, I created several different versions of the same APK, everything was the same except the versionCode in the manifest, which I had to change for Market would allow an update to be published, and the number of PNG files in the asset directory. I created an APK just under 25 MBs which was visible in Market on all phones, an APK just under 35 MBs which was visible on the Droid and HTC phones, but not the Samsung Galaxy S, and the full application 43 MBs which was only visible on the Droid. Any idea what could be the problem? Do different phone manufactures impose different APK size limits that can be installed via Market on their phone? All testing/installing via the Market was completed on the phones using WiFi, not 3G!
