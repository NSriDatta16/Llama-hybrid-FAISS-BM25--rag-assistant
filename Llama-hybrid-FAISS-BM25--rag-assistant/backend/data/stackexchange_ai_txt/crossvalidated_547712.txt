The adf.test() from the TsSeries package runs the test under the assumption that there is a constant AND a trend. After considering those in your data the time series would most likely be stationary. The adf.test() from the aTSA function uses all three DF type tests including the one for no drift no constant, which would most likely result in non-stationary in your case. But I do not know why the adf.test() function is limited to only one case (trend and drift).
