Let's say you get $x = \mu$. While you could say that's the most likely possible value for $x$ if it did come from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, you're not in a position to say that the probability that it did come from that normal is anything. To make such a statement would require something like a Bayesian point of view, and then you're dealing with inference conditional on your priors relating to what else it might be coming from . In the absence of that, you can talk about how relatively likely two values of $x$ would be. That comes from the ratio of how probable they'd be under the model, like so $f(x_1|\mu,\sigma)/f(x_2|\mu,\sigma)$.
