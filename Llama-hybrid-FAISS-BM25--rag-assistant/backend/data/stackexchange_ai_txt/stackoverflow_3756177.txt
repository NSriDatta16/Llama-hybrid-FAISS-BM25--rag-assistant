Here's what I'd do: First, the div #navigation that wraps around the ul #navlist is redundant. Just style the ul like you would the div and lose the div altogether. Secondly, I would make the ul float left. Then I would make the content div float left and lose the margins. Make sure #container is overflow:hidden; As long as you set the width of the ul and the content div, it should look good in all browsers. I'm actually baffled that it looks the way it does in Chrome... I'll update this answer as I examine it more. UPDATE The user agent in chrome styles the ul display: block; You should add a reset stylesheet to put all browsers on the same footing. Although, if you follow my above advice that will not be a direct issue. Let me know if you need set of reset rules I use.
