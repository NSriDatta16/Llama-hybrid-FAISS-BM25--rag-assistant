Great book for starting out: http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition Very thorough and up-to-date tutorial: http://www.railstutorial.org/ Great free screencasts once you know your way around Rails a bit: http://railscasts.com/ (or the text version at http://asciicasts.com/ ) Hint: concentrate on the most recent ones, as the further back you go the older the info is and the more likely it is to be outdated. These sceencasts aren't free, but they're very nice as well: http://peepcode.com/ http://envycasts.com/ (update: community wiki)
