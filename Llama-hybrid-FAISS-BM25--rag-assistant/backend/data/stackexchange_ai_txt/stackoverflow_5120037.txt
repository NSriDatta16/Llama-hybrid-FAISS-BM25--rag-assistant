How to alter a DOM Element during MouseUp Event without Disrupting Double-Click Event

I need to remove a CSS class name from the targeted DOM Element during a mouseup event handler, but doing so seems to prevent the double-click event from firing. I guess this is due to the fact that I'm altering the DOM element to which the double-click is attached to and JavaScript is cancelling the event queue because the element changed. The only thing I've come up with so far is to put the removal of the CSS class in a timeout of 300 ms or so... Here's some rough code. jQuery is just for convenience. var myElm = $(someElm); myElm .mouseup(function(e) { $(this).removeClass("abc"); }) .dblclick(function (e) { alert ('hi!'); }); It'll never say hi!. Anybody got an elegant solution for this?
