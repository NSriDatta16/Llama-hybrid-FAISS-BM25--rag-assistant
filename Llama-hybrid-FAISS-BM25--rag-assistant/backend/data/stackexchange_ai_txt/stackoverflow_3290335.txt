Is there a cross-browser css way to decorate only last word in a span block?

I need to show user's list which should look like in the example below: Helen Burns Edward Fairfax Rochester Bertha Antoinetta Mason Ad√®le Varens Is there a way to achieve this without using javascript? Each row should be one span, i.e. Helen Burns is not acceptable.
