Low memory with 640Kb of live bytes?

i've a problem with my application that need to display a lot of images and video. After running ObjectAlloc tool, i see that the live bytes is 640Kb and the overall memory is 31,54Mb when the application crash. In the organizer i get a "low memory" report so i guess the app crashed because low memory but the ObjectAllocation data don't make any sense to me... Any ideas? This is the Organizer crash log: Incident Identifier: CDCAF38C-CFFD-4316-9C4A-5C8E37794B49 CrashReporter Key: 65390aeb97b2b81076576c3e33b025feb5db9202 OS Version: iPhone OS 3.1.3 (7E18) Date: 2010-05-19 10:07:19 +0200 Free pages: 372 Wired pages: 12260 Purgeable pages: 0 Largest process: DTMobileIS Processes Name UUID Count resident pages ATreeTest 1150 (jettisoned) (active) DTMobileIS 3316 notification_pro 68 mediaserverd 464 (jettisoned) syslogd 56 (jettisoned) apsd 173 SpringBoard 2475 (jettisoned) (active) accessoryd 99 (jettisoned) notification_pro 64 ptpd 129 notifyd 64 CommCenter 167 configd 294 fairplayd 91 mDNSResponder 101 lockdownd 285 launchd 71 **End**
