Have nautilus open file into new gvim buffer?

Is there a way to configure nautilus to open a file into an existing gvim process in a new buffer instead of loading a new instance of gvim? I know I can drag and drop the file into gvim, but it would be convenient if I could just double-click a file to open it.
