Not a very elegant solution, but you may be able to subclass UITableView and watch for it in - (void)didAddSubview:(UIView *)subview; when it first shows up. This assumes that it is added directly to the UITableView and not one of its subviews or superview, and that you can recognize the added view as the index. It is also possible that after the first time it is added it will be hidden and shown instead of being removed and added again.
