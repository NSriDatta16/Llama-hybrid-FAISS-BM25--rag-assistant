I do not know how Action Script regexes work, but noting that attributes can appear anywhere in the tag, you can substitute for every . Something like this maybe: var pattern:RegExp = / "; str.replace(pattern, " Copied from Adobe docs because I do not know much about AS3 regex syntax. Now, manipulating HTML through regex is usually very fragile, but I think you can get away with it in this case. First, a better way to style the link would be through CSS, rather than using the tag: str.replace(pattern, " To surround the link with other tags, you have to capture everything in anchor text which is fraught with difficulty in the general case, because pretty much anything can go in there. Another approach would be to use: var start:RegExp = / /g; var str:String = " "; str.replace(start, " "); As I said, I have never used AS and so take this with a grain of salt. You might be better off if you have any way of manipulating the DOM. Something like this might appear to work as well: var pattern:RegExp = / /mg; ... str.replace(pattern, " ");
