Roles, not layers. Layers are completely dependent on the underlying implementation of the MVC pattern. For instance, a service layer may be a single layer on one implementation, but it could have a web service remoting layer and a database layer (for two differing service layers) on another implementation. The concept of layers is just to help you organize it, as is the pattern, but layers are not as easy to spot as patterns, and layers can change, whereas the pattern remains the same despite the layers changing due to different implementations.
