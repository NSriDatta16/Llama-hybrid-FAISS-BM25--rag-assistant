This is a bit far-fetched, but as there doesn't seem to be a simple way: You could use AspectJ to instrument the JAR with aspects that get hold of the return value of the methods you're interested in. According to Eclipse's documentation, AspectJ programs can be debugged like other programs. There are two options to weave your classes without recompiling the library : Post-compile weaving if processing the binary JAR is acceptable; Load-time weaving, which requires activating a weaving agent in the VM. See the eclipse documentation (link above) and also the AspectJ Development Environment Guide .
