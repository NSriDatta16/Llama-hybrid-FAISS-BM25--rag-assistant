UIImageView image not showing up on iPad Simulator

I have a Window in Interface Builder. I dragged a UIImageView onto the Window and selected the image that I wanted to be displayed from Image View Attributes -> Image View -> Image, and it was on the drop down list. I see the image on the Window screen. However, when I go to File -> Simulate Interface, it only displays a black screen. Am I doing something incorrectly?
