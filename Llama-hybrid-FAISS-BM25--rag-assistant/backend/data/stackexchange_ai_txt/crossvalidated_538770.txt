What are the conditions on standard GARCH coefficients

it is hard to find the full list of restrictions on GARCH(p,q) coefficients. Let me clarify. First, define GARCH(p,q) for a zero-mean returns time series as: \begin{equation} \label{eq:garch_pq} \sigma_t^2 = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^q\alpha_i r^2_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i \sigma_{t-i}^2 \end{equation} where $r_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t$ and $\epsilon_t \sim i.i.d(0,1)$ . Now, I can't find what the full list of restrictions are on the $\alpha_i$ 's and the $\beta_i$ 's. I've collected the following restrictions from various sources. Here is a list: $ \left(\sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_i + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i \right) $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for any $i$ $\beta_i \geq 0$ for any $i$ Are the above correct? What about $0 ? This is implied if the last two above are correct.
