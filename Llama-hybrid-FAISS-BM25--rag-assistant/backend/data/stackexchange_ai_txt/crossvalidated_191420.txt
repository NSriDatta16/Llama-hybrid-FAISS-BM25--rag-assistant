It seems there has been some miss understanding, since all the statements you made are wrong for the given Markov-chain. You can not say that the first and second states are recurrent because the third state is absorbing (i.e. once you are in the third state you will never leave it and therefore you'll never return to state one or two). The chain is not irreducible. A Markov-chain is called irreducible if all states form one communicating class (i.e. every state is reachable from every other state, which is not the case here). The period of a state is defined as $k$, if that state can only be reached every $k$-th step. For example if you have two states that flip to the other state with probability one and and you start at $t=0$ in state one, then at time $t=1$ you must be in state two for sure, then at $t=2$ you must be in state one again, at $t=3$ in state two again. So state one is visited at $t=0, 2, 4, ...$, therefore it has period $2$. All of these concepts are very well explained on the Wikipedia article on markov chains . I highly recommend you read the corresponding sections.
