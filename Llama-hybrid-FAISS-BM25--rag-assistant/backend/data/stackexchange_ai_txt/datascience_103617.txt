There are many options. One of the most common options is to input the image into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then after the CNN layers have a fully interconnected dense layer. The scalar values are concatenated at that fully interconnected, dense layer. Additional fully interconnected, dense layers can be added after. The deep learning model will automatically learn to weigh the importance of the scalar and image values through the training process.
