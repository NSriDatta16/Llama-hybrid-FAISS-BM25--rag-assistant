There is precedent for treating the number of prior convictions as a continuous linear predictor. Fox and Weisberg, in an appendix to An R Companion to Applied Regression , third edition, present a Cox proportional hazards analysis of the time course of recidivism, with the predictor prio , the "number of prior convictions" corresponding to your rec_count , treated that way. If a simple linear association isn't appropriate, one might consider a spline to capture nonlinearity. But as Frank Harrell says in Regression Modeling Strategies , 2nd edition, section 2.7.3, "For the case of an ordinal predictor, spline functions are not useful unless there are so many categories that in essence the variable is continuous." Don't know that 8 are enough values to be essentially continuous. He recommends, for more than 3-5 categories: it may be reasonable to stratify the data by levels of the variable and to compute summary statistics (e.g., logit proportions for a logistic model) or to examine regression coefficients associated with indicator variables over categories. Then one can attempt to summarize the pattern with a linear or some other simple trend. Later hypothesis tests must take into account this data-driven scoring (by using > 1 d.f., for example). His course notes , in the corresponding section, recommend using k -1 degrees of freedom in subsequent tests for a k -level ordinal predictor evaluated that way. The notes recommend using penalized maximum likelihood estimation (with the R ordSmooth function ) or Bayesian shrinkage (with the brms package ) as even better alternatives.
