Bayesian vs OLS . Degrees of freedom. do we need to bother about d.o.f for bayesian estimation?

Im new to bayesian and still trying to figure out the process in detail. I read somewhwere that one of the advantages of bayesian estimation is that it helps save on degrees of freedom and can be used when there are lesser number of data points and more number of parameters. Can someone through some light on this? i know its got something to do with MC MC but not very clear on how that helps.
