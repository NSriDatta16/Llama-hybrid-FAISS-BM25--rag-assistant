I have figured out the answer to my question. The concept in terms of the looking at the ratio was correct the entire time, but I was making a mistake in the math. The ratio is meant to be: \begin{equation} ratio = \frac{1-f_{zero}(0|z,\gamma)}{1-f_{count}(0|x,\beta)} \end{equation} Reference is here (download the paper). So, to put it in words, the numerator is meant to be the probability of exceeding 0 coming from the zero/not zero part of the model (here, a logit). And the denominator is from the poisson component (the count model). The key reason why this knowledge did not solve my earlier confusion is that I was calculating the poisson distribution element incorrectly. The Poisson probability mass function should be from here . I.e. it should be: \begin{equation} p(y|x,\beta) = \frac{e^{y*x\beta}*e^{-e^{x\beta}}}{y!} \end{equation} So to get probability of 0, it is: \begin{equation} p(0|x,\beta) = \frac{e^{0}*e^{-e^{x\beta}}}{0!} = e^{-e^{x\beta}} \end{equation} Before, I was mistakenly thinking that $\lambda$ in the Poisson distribution was simply $x\beta$ instead of $e^{x\beta}$ . Once I make this correction, the confusion evaporates, as you can see below. > # Probability of 0 in logit > p_zero_logit > # Probability of 0 in Poisson > lambda p_zero_poisson > # Ratio > (1-p_zero_logit)/(1-p_zero_poisson) (Intercept) 0.807471618908057 > > # Compare to model > predict(mod.hurdle, type = "zero")[2] 2 0.807471618908057 Now, the two match exactly. Thus, the confusion is resolved -- and the average of the response is simply this ratio times the average of the uncensored Poisson, as seen below: > # Recover uncensored Poisson > ratio uncensored_poisson_average > # Product to get full average > uncensored_poisson_average*ratio (Intercept) 2.09782687442114 > > # Compare to prediction from hurdle > predict(mod.hurdle, type = "response")[2] 2 2.09782687442114
