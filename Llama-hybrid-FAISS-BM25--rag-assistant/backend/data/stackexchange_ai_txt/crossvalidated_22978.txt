This inference is no different from any other inference we make. We assume a default (you could call it a 'null'). In this case, it's that the underlying distribution is Gaussian. We examine the data to see if they are inconsistent with our default hypothesis. If the qq-plot of our residuals looks sufficiently Gaussian for your satisfaction, then we stick with that assumption. In truth, no matter how non-normal our residuals appear, they could still have come from an underlying Gaussian distribution, but at some point, we just don't believe it anymore. Another way to phrase this is that we don't assume they're Gaussian because the qq-plot looks Gaussian, rather we don't stop assuming they're Gaussian because the qq-plot doen't look sufficiently non-Gaussian . Some people have trouble with this line of reasoning; which is perfectly fine. You might be interested in checking out the Bayesian approach to statistics.
