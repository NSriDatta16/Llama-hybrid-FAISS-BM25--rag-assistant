The other day, my tutor told me that whenever a mean value is reported, the standard error of the mean must be reported alongside. "Must"? I don't think so. Perhaps your tutor meant within some particular context. On the other hand, it's nearly always a good idea. the number of goals the team scores is the population. If you have the population, the standard error is simple to calculate. Am I right in saying the standard error would not need to be reported in this case? If it's known that you have the population, I wouldn't have thought it was necessary to say "the standard error is 0, since we have the population". I applaud the encouragement to include standard errors, but if the statement that it must always be done was intended to apply completely generally, it seems a bit overblown.
