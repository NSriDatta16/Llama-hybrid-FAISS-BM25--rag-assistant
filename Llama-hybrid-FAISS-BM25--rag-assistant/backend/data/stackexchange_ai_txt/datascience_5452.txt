I think most people are answering without having a good knowledge of excel. Excel (since 2010) has an in memory columnar [multi table] database , called power pivot (which allows input from csv/databases etc), allowing it to store millions of rows (it doesn't have to be loaded on a spreadsheet). It also has an ETL tool called power query allowing you to read the data from a variety of sources (including hadoop). And it has a visualisation tool (power view & power map). A lot of Data Science is doing aggregation and top-n analysis at which power pivot excels. Add to this the interactive nature of these tools - any user can easily drag and drop a dimension on which to break up the results adn I hope you can see the benefits. So yes you can't do machine learning, but I would question how much machine learning is done by data scientists day to day: eg when I want to analyse the prediction errors made in machine learning program I find it easiest to slice and dice the errors with excel.
