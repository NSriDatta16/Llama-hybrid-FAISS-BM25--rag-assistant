The following will do it in Firefox 3 and later: $(document).on("dragstart", function() { return false; }); If you would prefer not to disable all drags (e.g. you may wish to still allow users to drag links to their link toolbar), you could make sure only element drags are prevented: $(document).on("dragstart", function(e) { if (e.target.nodeName.toUpperCase() == "IMG") { return false; } }); Bear in mind that this will allow images within links to be dragged.
