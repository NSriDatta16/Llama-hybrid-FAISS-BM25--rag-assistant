Honestly, your question is based on a bit of a false premise. You're looking to avoid lock-in rather than trying to take full advantage of the platform you've chosen to use. The better way of approaching the issue is not to try to have your infrastructure be hot-swappable (e.g., avoid vendor lock-in), but to actually make a decision about the IaaS provider you want to use and leverage it as best as you possibly can.
