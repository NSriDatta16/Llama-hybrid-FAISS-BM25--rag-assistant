I am not clear on the 3 datasets you have mentioned. Are these train, test and validation sets? If you are doing CV for finding your hyper-parameters usually you don't need 3 sets. You can keep a final test set which will give the final accuracy of your model. Typically Leave One Out CV can be done using any statistical modelling software. If you are using R, the package E1071 can do this for you. Use TUNE.SVM/BEST.SVM to tune the model, the LEAVE ONE OUT CV can be chosen using TUNE.CONTROL parameter within which you will have to set CROSS parameter equal to NUMBER OF DATA POINTS IN YOUR TRAINING SET (tune.control(cross=nrow(dataPoints))) Thanks
