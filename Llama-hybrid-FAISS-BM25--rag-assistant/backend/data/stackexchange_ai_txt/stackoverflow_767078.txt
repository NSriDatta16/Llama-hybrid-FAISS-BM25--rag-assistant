I think that using MySQL is an overkill for the task of collecting the logs and summarizing them. I'd stick to plain log files in your case. It does not provide the full power of relational database management but it's quite enough to generate summaries. A simple lock-append-unlock file operation on a modern OS is seamless and instant. On the contrary, using MySQL for the same simple operation loads the CPU and may lead to swapping and other hell of scalability. Mind the storage as well. With plain text file you'll be able to store years of logs of a highly loaded website taking into account current HDD price/capacity ratio and compressability of plain text logs
