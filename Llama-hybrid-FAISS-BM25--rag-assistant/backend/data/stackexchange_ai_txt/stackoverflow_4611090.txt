I don't know of any automated tool to do that, but the difference between SQL Server and SQLite CREATE TABLE syntax is minor. The main incompatibilities are: There is no IDENTITY . The closest thing is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT . Foreign key enforcement is off by default (for backwards compatibility reasons). There's a pragma to turn it on. CLUSTERED is not supported. Tables do not have owners. Most importantly, the type system is different . In SQL Server terms, every column (except INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ) is a sql_variant . The declaration is just the preferred type of the column, not a restriction. The SQL server data types map to SQLite type affinities as follows: bigint, int, smallint, tinyint → INTEGER float, real → REAL char, nchar, ntext, nvarchar, text, varchar → TEXT Any type name that SQLite doesn't recognize has NUMERIC affinity. This works fine for money and numeric , but you'll probably want to rename image and (var)binary to BLOB .
