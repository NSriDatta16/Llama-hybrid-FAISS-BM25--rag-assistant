Bisymmetric covariance matrix in Auto-Regressive Model

When I learning Time Series, about the Auto-Regressive model (AR) of order $p$ : $$x_t=\alpha_1x_{t-1}+\dots+\alpha_px_{t-p}+w_t,$$ where $w_t$ is a time series of white noises. The textbook (Paul & Andrew, Introductory Time series with R) introduce an R code for fitting an AR model to a historical time series. By using a Global Temperature time series data from the book, (I think it is not necessary to give the data) it tells us to fit the AR model using the code ar(x) . So, I first put the time series data into Global.ts , then let Global.ar to store the AR model. By typing Global.ar$order it outputs 4 , which means this is an $AR(4)$ model. Now I want to calculate the confidence interval of these four coefficients, hence I typed Global.ar$asy.var to observe the $4\times 4$ covariance matrix. It is reasonable to observe this matrix is symmetric because the function $\text{Cov}(X,Y)$ is symmetric, but one can also easily observe it is bisymmetric (symmetric along both diagonals). Why is it bisymmetric? In particular, why is it true that the matrix will be symmetric along the other diagonal? These numbers are bisymmetric without decimal error, so I don't think it is a coincidence. What I thought is weird because, if it is bisymmetric, then the variance of $\alpha_1$ will be the same as the variance of $\alpha_4$ , similarly variances of $\alpha_2,\alpha_3$ must be the same, but normally one would expect the variances of four coefficients $\alpha_i$ are different. I've tried to prove this myself, but it is hard to get to know what is inside the implementation of the ar() function in R. Any help?
