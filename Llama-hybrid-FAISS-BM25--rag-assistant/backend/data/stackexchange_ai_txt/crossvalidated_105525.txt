Poisson probability of observing at least one zero out of k independent cases

I have a set of observations from a biological experiment. I have counted the occurrences of a particular event on each of the chromosome for $n$ cells and finally I have the final mean value for each chromosome. 2.2, 6.4, 3.4, 10.2, 4.45 So I have 5 chromosomes making on an average of above mentioned number of events. I have calculated the Poisson probability of any of the above chromosome becoming zero. I have used R function: ppois(q=0,lambda=wt[1:5]) and got probabilities 1.108032e-01 1.661557e-03 3.337327e-02 3.717032e-05 1.167857e-02 , which shows there is total probability of 0.15 so to observe any chromosome with zero event. Now I want to know at what values, these probabilities become zero or negligible. How can I proceed to achieve this?
