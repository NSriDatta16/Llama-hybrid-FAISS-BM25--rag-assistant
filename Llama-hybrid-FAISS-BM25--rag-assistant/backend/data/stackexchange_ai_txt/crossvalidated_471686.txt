Coarsened Exact Matching Non Homogeneous Treatment Effects

I am using the coarsened exact matching (CEM) package in R. I'm trying to understand the non-homogenous treatment effects. I've attached what an image of the linear model looks like and the model with random effects. 1 The package also use allows you to use the random forest option. Linear Model Random forest But how does one interpret the output? The random forest and effects models look the same as the output for the linear model (different values). How do I know what the different treatment effects are for different values of the other variable? They also offer a way to plot the SATT, but I think that's for the linear model and I also am confused on how to interpret that.
