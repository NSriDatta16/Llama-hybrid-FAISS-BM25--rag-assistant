PCA or no PCA. Which results are true

I am trying to correlate hundreds of geoclimatic variables with genetic data. When I do individual tests, I find several significant correlations. Then I went ahead and performed PCA on the variables and found that first 5 PCs explain most variance. The correlations between the PCs and the genetic data reveals very few (as compared to when using individual variables) significant correlations. So I am wondering which results are true.
