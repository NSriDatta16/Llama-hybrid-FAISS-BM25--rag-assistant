video tag on iPhone with menu on top

I have a simple list of videos in html5 on the iPhone the whole app is in html apart from some native Objective-C which sets up a UIWebView, there is a menu which is animated over the top using jQuery mobile. The problem I have is if I touch on a menu item, the video takes the event instead of the menu item. There is no problem if I view it in a normal browser on a pc or mac. VIDEOS VIDEO ONE VIDEO TWO VIDEO THREE &nbsp; VIDEO FOUR MENU EXPLORE GALLERY VIDEOS FEATURES NEXT STEPS SHARE Above is the markup for the videos, not very elegant I know. Any I was hoping that someone might be able to give me some ideas of where to look and what kinds of things can cause an item that appears underneath another item to take the interaction instead of the menu item which is sitting on top of the video items.
