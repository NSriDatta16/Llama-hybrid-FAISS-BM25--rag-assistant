Can I have a Tag inside a tag in Tumblr?

today I played around a little bit with Tumblr. I tried to add a preformatted text into a description paragraph block like so: {block:Description} {Description} {/block:Description} However, the element gets rendered just after the element and not within it which was my intention. Am I doing something wrong here or is it a bug?
