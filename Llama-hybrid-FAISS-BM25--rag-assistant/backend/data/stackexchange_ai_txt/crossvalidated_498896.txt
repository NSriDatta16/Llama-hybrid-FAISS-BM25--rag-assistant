Can I have heteroskedasticity in the residuals if the time series is stationary?

The time series is used in a regression (OLS) and then the diagnostics are been run. Or does stationarity imply homoskedasticity in all cases? I get heteroskedasticity through a breusch pagan test but I get stationarity from a Unit Root (Dickey Fuller Test). Is this possible? Are these two mutually exclusive?
