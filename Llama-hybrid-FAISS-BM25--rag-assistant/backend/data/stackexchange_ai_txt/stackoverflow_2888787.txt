Is it possible to create a stand-alone application that does not require a database for storing data? Yes, you could do some sort of custom file format for storing data. If the answer to #1 above is "yes", is it a good idea to do this for an application that could potentially need to manage a lot of data? It's not really a good idea, unless you really want to learn about storing data in a structured file. What data-storage options would you recommend for use with a C++ application? I'd look at SQLite . It is a database, but it doesn't need a separate engine.
