One submit button. I could foresee case I might use more then one, but in the general case just one. (Note, this looks like a web page question to me, so I'm answering with that assumption.) There are 3 ways that come to mind which you could handle the tracking changes: JavaScript: Put a onChange() function on the controls that update a hidden field. If that hidden has a value, then update the associated record. Requires JS on the browser, and doesn't tell you which fields to update, just which records. Lots of form fields: Put a hidden field out with each control and compare them all when they come back. This would be ugly, but it would allow you to know which fields to update (not just the record). It would also allow you to know if someone undid a change that started. Sessions: You could place the original values in session variables, then do the comparison when the values come back. This would be a little more elegant then lots of hidden fields, and less open to people playing with the posted back data (since you should never trust anything that comes back, even in hidden fields). Requires cookies on the browser and sessions on the server technology.
