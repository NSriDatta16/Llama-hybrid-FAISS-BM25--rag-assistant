Without writing any single line of code, if you use JConsole to connect to your JVM, under 'VM Summary' tab, it should say exactly which (server or client) Virtual Machine is being monitored. For example, Virtual Machine: OpenJDK Server VM version 1.6.0-b09 To remotely monitor your JVM using JConsole, simply enable the JMX (Java Management Extensions) agent by starting JVM with the following System Properties > java.rmi.server.hostname=[your server IP/Name] // without this, on linux, jconsole will fail to connect to the remote server where JVM is running > com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false > com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false > com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=[portNum]
