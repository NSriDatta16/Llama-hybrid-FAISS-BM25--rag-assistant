I don't think JAVA_HOME is a convention invented or supported by Sun. They probably remember the fiasco that was the CLASSPATH environment variable** all too well and prefer to stay the hell away from environment variables. ** This was encouraged as the primary way to set the JVM classpath in earlier Java SDKs and literature, and resulted in the user and various applications messing with the environment variable, overwriting each other's changes and depending on mutually contradictive contents.
