I disagree with the answer by @Mustafa S Eisa. First, logistic regression is not classification . Logistic regression is risk estimation, and for use it makes a difference if the positive class have an estimated probability of .55 or .95. In the first case, if you want a hard classification/decision, whatever way you choose the risk of error is large. Accuracy is not taking that into account, and is known to not be a proper score function . That is way what you have observed is to be expected, sometimes: Accuracy and crossentropy is not measuring the same kind of loss, and so crossentropy cannot be a surrogate for accuracy. There are many posts on this site about validating logistic regression that could be helpful .
