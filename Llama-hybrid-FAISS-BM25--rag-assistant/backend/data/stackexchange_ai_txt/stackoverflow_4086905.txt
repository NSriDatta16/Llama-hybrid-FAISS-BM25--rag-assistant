jquery image define area polygon

I am using Jquery image annotate library (http://code.google.com/p/jquery-image-annotate/) to apply tags to an image. It allows us to add tags by creating a small rectangular box that can be dragged and placed on an area in the image and then tagged. Works well. But, my requirement is to click on the image directly and define points which should be drawn as a polygon or a rectangle. How can i use jquery to do this? I have seen this in one of the examples in google maps edit tool.We can click on the map and define the points and when double-clicked it completes the shape and opens the edit box. Please let me know how do we achieve this. Thanks Vish.
