I believe they represent the same thing essentially, as the so-called: "Gini Coefficient" mainly used in Economics, measures the inequality of a numerical variable, such as income, which we can treat as a regression problem--getting the "mean of each group. "Gini impurity" mainly used in Decision Tree learning, measures the impurity of a categorical variable, such as colour, sex, etc. which is a classification problem -- getting the "majority" of each group. Sounds similar right? "inequality" and "impurity" are both measures of variation, which are intuitively the same concept. The difference is "inequality" for numerical variables and "impurity" for categorical variables. And both of them can be named "Gini Index". In Light, R. J., & Margolin, B. H. (1971). An analysis of variance for categorical data , it says that as the "mean" is an undefined concept for categorical data, Gini extends the "Gini Index" from numerical data to categorical data by using pairwise difference instead of deviation from mean. TL;DR which comes to the variation for categorical responses: $$\frac1{2n}[\sum_{i\neq j}n_in_j] = \frac{n}2 - \frac1{2n}\sum^I_{i=1}n_i^2$$ where $n_i$ is the number of responses in the $i$ th category, $i = 1, \cdot\cdot\cdot, I$ which is almost the same, but $\frac{n}2$ times the "Gini Impurity" nowadays, $$1 - \sum^{I}_{i=1} {p_i}^{2}$$ By the way, you said you can use ROC as method 2 to choose split point when growing a decision tree, I can't get it. Could you elaborate that? PS: I agreed with Pasmod Turing's answer, that Wikipedia can be modified by everyone, and the "Gini Impurity" seems like an incomplete item in the wiki. I also saw the disputes in the comments under his answer, I must say Machine Learning is originated from statistics, and statistics is the fundamental analysis tool for scientific research, thus, many concepts are the same thing in statistics, even though they have different names in different professional areas. Gini index certainly share the same name in decision tree and economics.
