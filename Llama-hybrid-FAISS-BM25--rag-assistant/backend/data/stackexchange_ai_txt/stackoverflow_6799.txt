I echo other voices in here. I have used Master Pages in 2.0 and the feature have been great to me. I have been embedding banners, standardized background, captures from Active Dir and other JavaScript features on it for use throughout the app, maintaining the look and feel consistency and without the need to duplicate the effort on multiple pages. Great feature.
