For your part (b), I don't see a contradiction. A Markov chain is said to be irreducible if it is possible to get to any state from any state. In fact, when you compute $P^{100}$ , you have shown explicitly that each entries are positive. It is indeed irreducible. For part (c), you should not compute $P^2$ , in fact, whether Monday rains just depends on whether it rains on Sunday. For part $(e)$ , let $Q$ be the event that it rains on previous Sunday, let $W$ be the event that it is sunny on Wednesday, $T$ be the event that it rains on Thursday and $F$ be the event that it rains on $Friday$ . \begin{align} P(WTF|Q) &= P(W|Q)P(T|W)P(F|T) \end{align} Try to compute this quantity.
