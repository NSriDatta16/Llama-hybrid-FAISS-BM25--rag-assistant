WinCheat / WinSpy-like tool for C++ Builder exes

I just came back to C++ Builder after 5 or more years away. I seem to remember a nice tool where I could drag its pointer over the GUI of my running application and get lots of info about what was pointed at - handle, size, text, parent, children, etc IIRC, if the exe include debug info I could also get the actual variable name as used in the source. Does anyone know what program I am talking about? Thanks
