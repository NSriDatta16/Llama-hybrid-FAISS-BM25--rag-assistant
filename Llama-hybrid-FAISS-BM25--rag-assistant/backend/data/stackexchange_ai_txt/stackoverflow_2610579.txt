Use SharePoint Search to crawl Project Server project metadata?

Our environment consists of Project Server 2007 and MOSS 2007. We have around 750 projects and lots of "Enterprise Custom Fields" set up to track all of the metadata associated with a project. Our main requirement is to be able to search/filter/group/sort all of these projects by metadata in SharePoint. Our current process involves syncing this custom metadata into a SharePoint list (which requires a LOT of maintenance). Instead, I would like to get rid of this sync and set up the search service to crawl Project Server metadata directly. Question: Is it possible to leverage SharePoint search to crawl/index these metadata fields in Project Server? How would I go about setting this up?
