What to do when an independent variable is not significant, but it definitely should be!

I would appreciate your help with this problem. I am trying to replicate this study which is about finding the optimal level of bank capital. All this is done using Stata. The only difference is that I have quarterly data, and the authors have semi-annual data. We have a problem with the following regression: Beta=alpha(i) + X(i,t-1)b + u(it) X(i,t-1) represents a very much documented important predictor of beta. The process of estimation is the following: Perform a unit-root test to make sure beta and X do not have a spurious link. We performed the test and we reject the H0, therefore all good up to here. Perform the regression using OLS, Fixed Effects and Random Effects. When we run the regressions, following every single step indicated in the study, we get that X is not significant. Not even at the 80% level! For any of the three methods. (Please see from the end of page 13 to page 15 for more details about the regression). Our panel data looks something like this: According to what is indicated in the paper, this is the regression we run: . xtset bank quarters, quarterly panel variable: bank (strongly balanced) time variable: quarters, 1998q1 to 2013q1 delta: 1 quarter -- . xtreg beta ib(first).year LD.leveragefull, fe vce(cluster bank) And this is what we get: Fixed-effects (within) regression Number of obs = 295 Group variable: bank Number of groups = 5 R-sq: within = 0.2965 Obs per group: min = 59 between = 0.0002 avg = 59.0 overall = 0.1387 max = 59 F(4,4) = . corr(u_i, Xb) = 0.0000 Prob > F = .

So the question is, what am I doing wrong? What can be the problem? How can I fix either the data or the regression in order to increase the significance of the results?
