Refactoring nested foreach statement

I have a method with a nested foreach collection (iterate a set of objects and then look inside each object). I saw in a book a good pattern to make this much more elegant but cannot remember/find the code example. How else could I make this more tidy? The code is just a typical nested foreach statement so I have not provided a code sample.
