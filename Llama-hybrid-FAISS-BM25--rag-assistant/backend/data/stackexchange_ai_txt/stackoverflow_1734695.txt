Enqueue a selector to the run loop - is [NSObject performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:] the way to go?

I'd like to have a method be executed after the current method has passed and the UI has been updated. For that purpose, I'm using [object performSelector:@selector(someSelector) withObject:someObject afterDelay:0.0] right now. According to Apple's documentation , this creates a NSTimer which will then trigger and append the selector to the current NSRunLoop. But I don't consider this very elegant. Is there an easy way to directly enqueue the selector to the current run loop, without having Cocoa create a Timer etc.? Would performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone: (if I'm on the main thread) or performSelector:onThread:withObject:waitUntilDone: with waitUntilDone:NO do what I want with less overhead? Cheers and thanks in advance MrMage
