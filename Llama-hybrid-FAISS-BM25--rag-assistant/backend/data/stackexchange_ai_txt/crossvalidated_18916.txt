How do I handle predictor variables from different distributions in logistic regression?

I am using logistic regression to predict y given x1 and x2: z = B0 + B1 * x1 + B2 * x2 y = e^z / (e^z + 1) How is logistic regression supposed to handle cases in which my variables have very different scales? Do people ever build logistic regression models with higher-order coefficients for variables? I'm imagining something like this (for two variables): z = B0 + B1 * x1 + B2 * x1^2 + B3 * x2 + B4 * x2^2 Alternatively, is the right answer to simply normalize, standardize or rescale the x1 and x2 values before using logistic regression?
