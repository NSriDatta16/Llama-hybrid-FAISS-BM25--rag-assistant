In my opinion you should do the following: 1) Try to minimize the bias as much as possible. This can usually be achieved by choosing a more complex model. This step is done to ensure that your model has enough capacity to solve the problem. This will, however, cause your model to overfit. 2) Regularize the above model to reduce its variance . This can be done through norm penalties (L1, L2, etc.), early stopping, or other model specific techniques (dropout for neural networks, pruning for decision trees, etc.).
