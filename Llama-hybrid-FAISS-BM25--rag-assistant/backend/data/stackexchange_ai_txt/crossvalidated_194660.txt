Forecast accuracy metric that involves prediction intervals

I'm in the process of generating a time series forecast for a company's product revenue and am looking for some way to show accuracy over time - e.g. after say 6 months they want to see how the actual revenue compared to the forecasted revenue generated 6 months ago. I'm generating a forecast using the R ets() package and making predictions for each month over the next 6 months, including prediction intervals. Are there any forecast accuracy metrics that take these prediction intervals into account? I know of the standard MAPE, MASE etc but these all apply to point forecasts. What I'm looking for is a measure that also takes into account how accurate the prediction intervals are - e.g. if we're generating 95% prediction intervals, but the actual value only appears in them 10% of time, I want to be able to identify this.
