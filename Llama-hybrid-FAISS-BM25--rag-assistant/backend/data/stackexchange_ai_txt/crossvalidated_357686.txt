Which model to use when dual-seasonality is present?

I have an hourly time series that contains 2 forms of seasonality: hourly and weekly. In other words, the hour of the day and the day of the week both have a large impact on the time series values. Is there a forecasting model (hopefully a pre-built one in R) that can handle a time series with multiple seasonalities? One R function I have tried was auto.arima with xreg being a day-of-week indicator matrix.
