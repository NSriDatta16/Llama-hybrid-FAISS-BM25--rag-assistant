Thanks for the replies... Parsing was not really the problem. I missed the following cURL parameters, curl_setopt ($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt ($curl, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1"); I was treating a boolean value (cURL response) as an XML file :) Thanks all...
