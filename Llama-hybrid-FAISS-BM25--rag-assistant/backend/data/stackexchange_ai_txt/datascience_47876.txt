How to decide the processing power required based on the dataset?

To train a machine learning model, the computer often needs more processing power. In this case, a powerful CPU is needed, since it is a large data set, it needs more memory, so rather than a CPU, GPU is the solution. Do we need to decide which processor to use before we proceed? For example, will a 30000 sample data set need this much processing power? Thanks in advance. If any part of this question is not clear, please comment it.
