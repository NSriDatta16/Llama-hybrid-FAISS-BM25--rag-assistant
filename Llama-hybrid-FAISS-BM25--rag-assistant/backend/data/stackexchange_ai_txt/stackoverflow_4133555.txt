Zero sized array allocation is covered in the ISO C++ Standard under 5.3.4, paragrahp 7 When the value of the expression in a direct-new-declarator is zero, the allocation function is called to allocate an array with no elements. This makes code that performs dnaymic array allocation easier. In general: If someone calls a function and asks it to return an array with n (0 in your case) elements, the code shouldn't be trying to read the returned array past the n-nth element anyway. So, I don't really see the catastrophic failure, since the code would have been faulty to begin with for any n. As you say: Because if size to be allocated is calculated at run time and if programmer assumes its allocated properly The calculated size would be "0", if he tries to access more than his calculated size then, well.. I am repeating myself ;)
