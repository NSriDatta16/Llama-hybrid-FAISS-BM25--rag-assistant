Unable to find reference to std library math function inside library

I've got several programs that use shared libraries. Those shared libraries in turn use various standard C libraries. ie Program A and Program B both use Shared Library S. Shared Library S uses std C math. I want to be able to statically link Shared Library S against the standard library, and then statically link Programs A and B against S so that I don't have to be dragging around the library files, because these programs are going to be running on an embedded system running BusyBox 0.61. However, when I try to statically link the programs against Shared Library S, I get an error message from GCC stating : ../lib/libgainscalecalc.a(gainscalecalc.): In function 'float2gs': [path to my C file].c:73: undefined reference to 'log' Can somebody please help me out ? The make commands I'm using are below : CFLAGS += -Wall -g -W INCFLAGS = -I$(CROSS_INCLUDE)/usr/include LIBFLAGS += -L$(CROSS_LIB)/usr/lib -lm gainscalecalc_static.o: gainscalecalc.c $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $ Edit: Linking against the shared libraries compiles fine, I just haven't tested them out yet
