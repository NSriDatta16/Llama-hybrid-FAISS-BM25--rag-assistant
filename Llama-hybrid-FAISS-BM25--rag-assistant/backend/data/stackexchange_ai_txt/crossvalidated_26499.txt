How to "undo" feature scaling/normalization for output?

I'm normalizing (or standardizing or feature scaling) my neural network training inputs and training targets. I just doing linear scaling and the formula I'm using is: I = Imin + (Imax-Imin)*(D-Dmin)/(Dmax-Dmin) where I is the scaled input value, Imin and Imax are the desired min and max range of the scaled values, D is the original data value, and Dmin and Dmax are the min and max range of the original data values. In my case I'm setting Imax to 1 and Imin to -1. I'm trying to predict a continuous real-valued output. How do I scale the output of my network back into the "unscaled" range?
