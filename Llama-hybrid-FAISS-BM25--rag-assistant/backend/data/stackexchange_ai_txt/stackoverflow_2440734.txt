If you want type sharing in WCF - like what you described and was in remoting, sharing (interface) declarations in common assemblies on the server and client - you can do it by using the NetDataContractSerializer . It helped others as well . It's use is discouraged - just like remoting -, contract based messaging seems to be all the rage right now. I should add that with a proper design you will still end up with a contract/message based application even with .Net Remoting . Your shared interfaces will become the operation contracts, while your shared data class definitions will describe the data contracts/messages you pass.
