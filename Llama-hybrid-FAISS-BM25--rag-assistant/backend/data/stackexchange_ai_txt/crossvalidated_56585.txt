What method should I use to identify which variables differentiate between objects of two different classes?

To illustrate the problem posed by the question: Consider the problem of differentiating between consumers who belong to two different segments. I could use a naive or a sophisticated approach as outlined below. The question is: what is the benefit to using the sophisticated approach? Naive Approach Compute the summary statistics (e.g., means, frequencies) of all the available variables (e.g., income, age etc) and then see how the groups differ on these variables by inspecting the table of summary statistics. Sophisticated Approach Use logistic regression to identify which variables (e.g. income, age, etc) predict class membership. Why use the sophisticated approach over the naive one?
