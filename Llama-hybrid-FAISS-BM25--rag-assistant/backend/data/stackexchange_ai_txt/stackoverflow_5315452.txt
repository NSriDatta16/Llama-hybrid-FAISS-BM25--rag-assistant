That is not possible. The structure won't remember if you used Url or Name to assign a value and because of that, the Serializer won't know either. The best way I can think of, to mimic that behaviour is to expose those fields as properties and when setting them remember which property was used for assignment (which requires some additional storage). You would then have to implement IXmlSerializable and provide your own Serialization that writes the XML, depending on the properties you used to set the data. I think it is better to ignore the duplicate fields using XmlIgnore or to use different structures for names and URLs.
