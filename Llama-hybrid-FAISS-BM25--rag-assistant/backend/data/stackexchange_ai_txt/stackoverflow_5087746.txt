It's telling your method where to start cutting off a piece of the paragraph and how many characters it should cut. 11,4 mean that it should start at the 11th character and chop of 4 characters from there. Keep in mind you start from 0. d i e d 2 7 - 0 4 - 2 0 0 6 : B l a c k L e c l Ã¨ r e 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 11, 4 - 11th character = 2. Then 4 characters from there = 6 | So 2006 8, 2 - 8th char = 0. 2 from there = 4| so 04 Basically, your method cuts those pieces and then creates a date with that. EDIT By cut, I mean that it returns a part of that string, but doesn't do anything to the original string. See here for reference : http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp
