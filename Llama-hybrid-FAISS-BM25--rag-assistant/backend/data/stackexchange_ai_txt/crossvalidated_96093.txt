Bayes theorem an experiment design

Let's say I design an experiment to test the hypothesis, "Agent Z causes cancer". Of $N$ people in the experiment group, $x$ get cancer. Of $N$ people in the control group, $y$ get cancer. The results are that $x > y$ and $N \gg x$. Pretty standard so far. I'm interested in a Bayesian interpretation of the results of this experiment, so I come up with the following statement about the "probability that my hypothesis is correct ($P(H_{\rm true})$) given the evidence ($e$)" $P(H_{\rm true}|e) = \frac{P(e|H_{\rm true})P(H_{\rm true})}{P(e)}$ I'm specifically interested in the quantity $P(e|H_{\rm true})$. What can be said about that quantity given the information available? Is there a general way to calculate or estimate it, knowing nothing more about the relationship between Agent Z and cancer? If not, what more would you need to calculate or estimate it?
