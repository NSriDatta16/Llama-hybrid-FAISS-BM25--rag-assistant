In the frequentist world of traditional statistics, penalized maximum likelihood is somewhat of an ad hoc procedure with limited inferential methods available after the fit. Likelihood ratio tests donâ€™t know about the penalization so are not really valid. Contrast this with Bayesian models where penalization uses shrinkage priors and the posterior distribution is a regular posterior distribution with all the simple inferential methods that provides. Bayes also gives you the ability to use more sensible shrinkage (e.g., horseshoe priors) than what lasso uses.
