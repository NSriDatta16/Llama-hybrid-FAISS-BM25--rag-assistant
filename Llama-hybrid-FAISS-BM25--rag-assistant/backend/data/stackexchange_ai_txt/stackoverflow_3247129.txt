Insert each word in the list in a trie , or hash table or any dictionary. Now, for each position in your grid, go horizontally, vertically and diagonally and see if you get matches in the dictionary. This should give you O(N^3) worst case complexity, where N is the size of the grid. Otherwise it's O(N^2*averageWordLength) I think.
