I'm not sure if there's a native way but here's a workaround which is claimed to work: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=269358 It's based on setting $ENV{HTTP_PROXY} to " http://login:password@proxyserver " where both login and password must be URI-encoded. Also, WWW::Mechanize is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent , and as such, what works in LWP should work on Mechanize (example from LWP Cookbook, PROXIES section ) use LWP::UserAgent; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->proxy(['http', 'ftp'] => 'http://username:password@proxy.myorg.com'); $req = HTTP::Request->new('GET',"http://www.perl.com"); $res = $ua->request($req); print $res->decoded_content if $res->is_success;
