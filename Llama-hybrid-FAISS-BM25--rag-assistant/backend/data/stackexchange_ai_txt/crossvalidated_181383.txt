Understanding the Beta conjugate prior in Bayesian inference about a frequency

Following is an excerpt from Bolstad's Introduction to Bayesian Statistics . For all you experts out there, this might be trivial but I don't understand how the author concludes that we don't have to do any integration to calculate the posterior probability for some value of $\pi$. I understand the second expression which is the proportionality and where all the terms came from( likelihood x Prior ) . Furthermore, I understand,we don't have to worry about the denominator since only the numerator is directly proportional. But moving on to the third equation , aren't we forgetting about the denominator of the Bayes Rule? Where did it go ? And the value computed by the Gamma functions, isn't that a constant ? Doesn't constants cancel out in the Bayes theorem ?
