It is not an option. You'll have to P/Invoke a function in DLL that was generated by MASM or written in unmanaged C/C++, using inline assembly or intrinsics. Or use the C++/CLI compiler and generate mixed mode code with #pragma managed. Beware that you now can no longer depend on the JIT compiler generating whatever platform code is suitable for the operating system. Use Project + Properties, Build tab, Platform Target to force the architecture to match your unmanaged code. Look at CUDA for managed GPU code.
