Not sure I understand correctly, so let me rephrase : You have webapps that need to execute Java code on the client. So probably via an Applet or maybe Java Web Start. For applets, you can specify the Java "family" as specified in http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/family-clsid.html For JWS, you can specifiy the Java version in the JNLP file. Soory, I dont have the docs at hand ... If I misunderstood your problem, please rephrase it and I'll try to have a second answer ...
