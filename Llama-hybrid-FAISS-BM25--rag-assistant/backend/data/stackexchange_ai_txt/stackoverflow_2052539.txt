Two important numbers: Number of "FoxPro" jobs listed in San Francisco's craigslist right now: 2. Number of ".NET" jobs listed in San Francisco's craigslist right now: 252. A lot of other points that have been mentioned are valid. However, you can spend as much as you want on hardware, but the fact is that if something breaks and you need help, you are going to have a heck of a time finding more people to help. Sounds like a good time to start talking about a migrationÂ¹ to newer, better-supported technologies. (And in 10 years when .NET is old hat, you can do it all over again :) [1] And evolve the system, don't rewrite it. I would guess your current system grew very organically based on needs at the time. There's no way that you'll be able to completely replace all of that (at least, not without a couple of years and a few miillion bucks).
