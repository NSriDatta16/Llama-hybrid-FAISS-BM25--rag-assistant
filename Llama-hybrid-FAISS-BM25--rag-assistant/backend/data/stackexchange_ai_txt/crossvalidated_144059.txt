Can percentages be averaged?

I've been sent two sets of timings for a task as carried out by several subjects: first using Method A, and the other using Method B. The experimenter has taken the mean timing for each method, worked out the percentage improvement (e.g. Subject 1 took 10 seconds on average using Method A and 5 seconds using Method B, showing a 50% improvement while Subject 2 took showed a 25% improvement), and then averaged those percentages (i.e. (50% + 25%) / 2 = Average 37.5% improvement using Method B). Is this valid?
