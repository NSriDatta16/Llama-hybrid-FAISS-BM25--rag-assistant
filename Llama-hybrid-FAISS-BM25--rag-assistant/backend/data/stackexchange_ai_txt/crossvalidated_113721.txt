Machine learning with categorical data: Can I delete examples?

I have a machine learning project that uses a bunch of features to predict a class that has categorical values. The possible values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. I'm interested whether the class has the value 1 or not. Therefore I added a new binary variable that is 1 when the class is 1 and 0 otherwise. So far so good. The problem now is that my data set is quite small ~200 observations and the features for the values the class has are very close to each other. That is, it is very hard to distinguish between 1 and 2, but it would be way easier to distinguish for example between 1 and 5. Is there anything I can do do improve my results? For example, I'm really not interested whether when the instance I'm going to predict has the value 3. I just want a classifier that is good in recognizing 1 events.
