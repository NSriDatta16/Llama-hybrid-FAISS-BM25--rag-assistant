Named entity recognition can be seen as a multi class classification problem. A large data set will be required to train a model(preferably bayesian) for recognising different named entities. You can use word embedding (like google word2vec) to for preparing your training set. Also, if you can try IBM Bluemix AlchemyAPI for named entity extraction if you want to get your job done.
