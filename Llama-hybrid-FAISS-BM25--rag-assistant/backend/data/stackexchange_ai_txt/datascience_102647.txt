Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera: You can follow the lectures for free or apply for a scholarship if you can't afford it. Even though some content is a bit old, still a very extensive source from fundamental concepts of machine learning to advanced optimization concepts and additional courses on CNN's and Sequence models. Also, there are several completely free courses on Udacity , from artificial intelligence, neural networks to more framework specific courses such as TensorFlow for deep learning, Machine Learning on Azure or AWS Deep Racer. Also, Sentdex has several tutorials on Data Analysis and Machine Learning. He has a nice style and usually goes through everything in detail. fast.ai is another comprehensive and completely free resource I can suggest. And TensorFlow (or Keras ) also have very accessible resources and tutorials within their documentation.
