When to use bootstrap vs. bayesian technique?

I have a rather complicated decision analysis problem involving reliability testing and the logical approach (to me) seems to involve using MCMC to support a Bayesian analysis. However, it has been suggested that it would be more appropriate to use a bootstrapping approach. Could someone suggest a reference (or three) that might support the use of either technique over the other (even for particular situations)? FWIW, I have data from multiple, disparate sources and few/zero failure observations. I also have data at the subsystem and system levels. It seems a comparison like this should be available, but I've had not luck searching the usual suspects. Thanks in advance for any pointers.
