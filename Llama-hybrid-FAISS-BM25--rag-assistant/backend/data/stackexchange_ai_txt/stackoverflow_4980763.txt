I store my dotfiles (and other configuration) on github too. My approach is to have all those files only inside the repo and symlink them into the place using a rake task. This has the advantage that your actual home directory is not inside a git repo and you don't have to deal with submodules everwhere, as this would probably become a mess to maintain (and hinders re-usability of your dotfiles and other stuff). For inspiration, my dotfiles repository can be found here: https://github.com/meineerde/dotfiles Generally, I would advise you to use more smaller git repos, one for each single project. Also you should try to keep your repository structures (esp. submodules) simple to ease maintenance. Just put your stuff side by side and create a new git repo for each new project. I would discourage using hardlinks (as proposed by Martinho Fernandes) as the link can easily be broken by certain filesystem operations and it's not really obvious that there are hardlinks.
