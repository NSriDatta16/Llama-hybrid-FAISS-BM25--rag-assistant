Don't prematurely optimize. Test it and see. Lazy loading can be turned off, and change tracking isn't a huge overhead. Yes, you can use POCOs if need be, but it would be a huge mistake to make such a decision on the basis of imagined performance problems. That said, I think it's a good decision from a dependency-management point of view to not make business logic dependent on persistent storage. You don't need to use POCO entities to do this, though; you can project onto business types with any kind of entity.
