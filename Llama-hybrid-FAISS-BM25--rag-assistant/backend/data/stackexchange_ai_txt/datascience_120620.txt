The weighted average ensemble model does not train on the whole data

I am using custom data generator. I want to apply weighted average ensemble. The training set has 1042 samples, and validation indicates 298 samples. The batch size is 64. when I run this : member1 = KerasMember(name="model1", keras_model=model_1, train_batches=train_batch, val_batches=val_batch) 2/2 [==============================] - 0s 48ms/step 2/2 [==============================] - 0s 65ms/step it shows 2/2 and 1/1 which I think is incorrect. and it should be 16/16 for training set. I checked train_batch = next(train_aug_gen) and val_batches= next(val_aug_gen) . len(train_aug_gen): 16 and len(val_aug_gen): 4 Why len(train_batch) is 2 ?!!! while train_batch is: ( , ) I appreciate if anyone can help me to solve this mistake. Thanks.
