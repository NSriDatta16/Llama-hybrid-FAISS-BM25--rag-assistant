The only alternative to database storage is file storage. And the most elegant way of storing stuff into a file is using an XML format, which can be parsed using XPath queries. See an example here http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_simplexml_xpath.asp . I never worked with the XPath on PHP and never worked with it raw (used the methods and objects which were implementig it). Sadly I can not give you more details as I am also looking into this. I really think there might be a matter of speed and overall security (Your database is protected by a user and a password while the XML file or any file isn't). a line can look like this John doe 0010 1111 the figures represent the Create Read Update Delete rights (1 has, 0 doesn't) so if a user has only reading rights the access key will be 0100 (considering CRUD order). Mainly all you have to do is load that info into the session once logged in. Hope it helps. Hope this helps.
