Yes, you've declared other base classes :) Just trust compiler :) When you writing in XAML, you are subclassing UserControl. If you want to subclass a Button, use instead and ": Button" in code-behind file. But I'm strongly encourage you to not subclass Button, its an overkill for you task. You can use MouseLeftButtonUp event instead of the Click event.
