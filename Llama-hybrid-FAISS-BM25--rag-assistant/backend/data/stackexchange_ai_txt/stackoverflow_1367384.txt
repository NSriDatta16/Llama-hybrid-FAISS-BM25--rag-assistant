Resize and crop images before displaying in UITableViewCells

i have an UITableView in my app and i have to load some images that have a fixed width but different heights. I download the images async using an NSOperationQueue and for resizing and cropping i tried to use the solution provided by Jane Sales in this post link text . i made a custom UITableViewCell class and in it i have a method that is called when the queued operation finishes to download the image. The method is called properly and the images are displayed. When i try to resize the images using the method proposed by Jane the problems appear. When it reaches [sourceImage drawInRect:thumbnailRect]; i receive an exec bad access error and i can't figure out why. I call the method like this: - (void) setupImage:(UIImage *) anImage{ UIImage *resized = [anImage imageByScalingAndCroppingForSize:CGSizeMake(64, 59)]; if(resized == nil) resized = [UIImage newImageFromResource:@"thumb2.png"]; [thumbnailView setImage:resized]; } setupImage is the function called when the NSOperationQueue finishes the download action of anImage . Could someone give me a clue why i receive the exec bad access error when i try to resize and crop the images? I tried using the same function outside the table view. 80% of the cases it works but there are cases when i receive the same exec bad access error. Thank you in advance, Sorin
