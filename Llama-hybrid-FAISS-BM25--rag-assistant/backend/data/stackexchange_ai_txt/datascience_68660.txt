Need an advice on research topic

I am about to choose ML research topic for my master thesis, but i am at a dead end. The problem is, that while reading research papers, i find solutions, but not an open problems. For now, a came up with such ideas: Research neural network quantization algorithms - i started to research this topic 3 months ago and it seems to me, that current papers reveals high accucary methods. I have not idea what can i to do in this field Implement online video-processing system using quantized neural networks. It sounds also good, but it could be done with few lines of Tensorflow Lite code. Intelligent Image Database - image database, that has image classifiers and detectors for automatic annotation. It seems to be a good idea, but i need to find here a research part. For me this tasks sounds like pure engineering task Make some signal processing research. It could be connected with first idea as optimal hardware implementation. But i don't know where to search for suitfull specific task for ML, because a lot of dsp problems are solved with classical analytical mathematical methods. As you can see, i always see some disadvatages in ideas. It stopping me from starting to work. Can you give me an advice how to develop one of this ideas to make it suitable both for engineering and research? Generally, how to search for research topics?
