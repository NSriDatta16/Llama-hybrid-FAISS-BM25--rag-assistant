When you're handling the various states of an enum (C#): enum AccountType { Savings, Checking, MoneyMarket } Then, inside some routine... switch (accountType) { case AccountType.Checking: // do something case AccountType.Savings: // do something else case AccountType.MoneyMarket: // do some other thing default: --> Debug.Fail("Invalid account type."); } At some point I'll add another account type to this enum. And when I do, I'll forget to fix this switch statement. So the Debug.Fail crashes horribly (in Debug mode) to draw my attention to this fact. When I add the case AccountType.MyNewAccountType: , the horrible crash stops...until I add yet another account type and forget to update the cases here. (Yes, polymorphism is probably better here, but this is just an example off the top of my head.)
