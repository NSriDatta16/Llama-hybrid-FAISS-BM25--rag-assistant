You have to figure out what it is you are really testing. The point is whether or not you are interested in the joint null hypothesis. If putting both $H_0s$ into the same joint null doesn't make sense, then you don't need to adjust for multiplicity. E.g. if you test whether one or more of $N$ drugs can cure condition $X$ then $H_0$ is joint wrt the $N$ drugs. If there are three tests "drug 1 cures X", "the population of rats in China increased over the last year", " an average Xbox 1 gamer has more skill than an average PS4 gamer" then the joint $H_0$ can still be put together, and it's easy to compute the joint (familywise) p-value but such $H_0$ is meaningless.
