Multi-video classification

I want to build a classifier which uses multiple videos. I know video classifiers exist, but they rely on a single video. The obvious solution is to create an ensemble classifier which uses the outputs of classifiers trained on a single video to provide multi-video classification. For example, training a MLP or XGBoost on the outputs of the pre-softmax layer. While this is ok, I was wondering whether there are any more elegant/specialized end-to-end solutions for this?
