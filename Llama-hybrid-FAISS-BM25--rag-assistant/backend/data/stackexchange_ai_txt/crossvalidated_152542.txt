Feature selection of non stationary data

I am working with EEG signals which are non-stationary. I have used spectrogram to analyse the data in specific frequecies. I have to select some features from the specific-frequency time signals inorder to reduce its dimension and use it for classification. I cannot use PCA as it works only for stationary signals. Is there a method of feature selection which can be used for these signals which are non-stationary in nature?
