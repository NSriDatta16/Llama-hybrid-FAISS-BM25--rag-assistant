Just taking seasonal differences may not be enough or even necessary to deal with seasonality. There may be some further stationary seasonal cycles. The framework of ARIMA time series models is a possible approach to analyze your data. For example, in R you can use the function forecast::auto.arima to find an ARIMA model based on the BIC criterion. You can call this function from the tsoutliers::tso interface in order to account for the presence of possible additive outliers or level shifts. Sample R code to apply this idea (for ease of reproducibility the output from dput(x) is posted at the end of this answer): require(forecast) require(tsoutliers) fit You can see that the chosen model includes an autoregressive and seasonal moving average coefficients or seasonal order. An additive outliers is also detected but for the illustration of dealing with seasonality should not make much difference in this case. As shown in the plot of the ACF and PACF of the residuals, the autocorrelations of seasonal order lie well within the confidence bands: par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar = c(3,4.2,3,3)) acf(resids, lag.max = 48) pacf(resids, lag.max = 48) I don't claim that this is the best model or the only approach to analyze your data. The point that I want to show you is that just by taking seasonal differences, seasonality may not be fully removed or addressed properly. x
