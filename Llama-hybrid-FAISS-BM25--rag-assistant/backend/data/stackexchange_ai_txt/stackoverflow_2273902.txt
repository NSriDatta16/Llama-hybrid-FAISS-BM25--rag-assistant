TransactionScope is not only for the databases. Every component that implements IEnlistmentNotification interface can participate in two-phase commit of the transaction scope. Here is an example of transactional in-memory storage: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Transactional_Repository.aspx Also, I'm not sure if there are components in .NET for transactional file IO, but it is pretty easy to implement such component - latest OS like Vista and Windows Server 2008 have support for transaction file IO.
