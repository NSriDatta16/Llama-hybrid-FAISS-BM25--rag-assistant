Image classification in python

I have a set of images that are considered as good quality image and other set that are considered as bad quality image. I have to train a classification model so that any new image can be said good/bad. SVM seems to be the best approach to do it. I know how to do it in MATLAB. But,can anyone suggest how to do it in python? What are the libraries? For SVM scikit is there, what about feature extraction of image and PCA?
