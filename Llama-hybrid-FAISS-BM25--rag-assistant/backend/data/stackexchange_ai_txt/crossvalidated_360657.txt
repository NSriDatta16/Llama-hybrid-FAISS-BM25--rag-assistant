List of machine learning classifiers that naturally assume data in normal distribution

I have searched about this question but no answer really made it comprehensive. To my knowledge, linear regression and most clustering algorithms naturally have the assumption that data need to be in normal distribution for better outcomes. My question is about other classifiers like SVM, NN, KNN, ... etc. Can someone provide us a good answer or direct me to an existing post that elaborate this? Thank you
