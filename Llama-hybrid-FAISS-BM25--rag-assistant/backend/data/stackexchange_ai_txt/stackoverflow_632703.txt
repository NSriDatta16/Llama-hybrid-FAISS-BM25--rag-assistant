Please, before suggesting some work-around-solutions, tell me: Are XML chunks valid at all? Not in their own right. You can include them (served as XML external parsed entities) in other documents through methods such as an entity reference, and you can parse them as chunks into existing documents using methods such as DOM Level 3 LS's parseWithContext() (which Java doesn't give you, sorry), but they aren't documents so any interfaces that require a full document cannot accept them. Transformer requires a full document as input because XSLT works on full documents, and would be confused by something that contained zero or more-than-one root element. The usual trick is to create a single root element by wrapping the document in start and end tags, but this does mean you can't have an XML declaration(*), as mentioned by Eddie. (*: actually it's known as the ‘Text Declaration’ when included in an external parsed entity, but the syntax is exactly the same.)
