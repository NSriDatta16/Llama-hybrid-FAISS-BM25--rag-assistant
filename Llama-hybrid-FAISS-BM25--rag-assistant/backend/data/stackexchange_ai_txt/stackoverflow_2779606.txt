You can use a far from elegant solution which is perform a polling to the processes in the system. Process[] currentProcessList = Process.GetProcesses(); List newlyAddedProcesses = new List (); while (true) { newlyAddedProcesses.Clear(); Process[] newProcessList = Process.GetProcesses(); foreach (Process p in newProcessList) { if (!currentProcessList.Contains(p)) { newlyAddedProcesses.Add(p); } } //TODO: do your work with newlyAddedProcesses System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500); currentProcessList = newProcessList; } If your application doesn't need a high accuracy you can setup a big sleep time between polls which would make it much less time consuming.
