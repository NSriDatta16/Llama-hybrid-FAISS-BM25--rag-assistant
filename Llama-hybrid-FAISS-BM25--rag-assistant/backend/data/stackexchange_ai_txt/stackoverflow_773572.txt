Performance asp.net and cookie

Writting an asp.net shopping cart. I am leveraging the session for state but I also want to store basic info in a cookie. This info would be the items / qty. I am aware of the cookie size limitations but here the question. Are there any sources of information on performance cost in terms of writting to a cookie as opposed to sql. In my current use case, I would at most be writting to the cookie on each page post (of course only the pages that had to deal with the shopping cart) Just trying to determine the negative sides to using a cookie.
