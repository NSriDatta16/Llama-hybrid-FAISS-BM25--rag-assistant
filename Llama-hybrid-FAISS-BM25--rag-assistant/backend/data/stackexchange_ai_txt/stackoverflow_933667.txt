Designing SQL alternative?

I'm thinking of designing & implementing my own SQL-equivalent (DDL+DML) that is... a pure relational algebraic language, and has an elegant Lisp-/Scheme-like syntax Assuming an RDBMS such as MySQL, where exactly would I need to start my language design work? On top of the storage engine layer such as InnoDB? I don't know what all RDBMS functionality generally sits atop a Storage Engine? My current intuitive understanding is that the bulk of the work needed to create an RDBMS (such as MySQL) would already have been done within the storage engine (specifically, in InnoDB), and all you would need to do is create a wrapper language around it. But I also know that if that were really true, why would MySQL be existing in the first place!
