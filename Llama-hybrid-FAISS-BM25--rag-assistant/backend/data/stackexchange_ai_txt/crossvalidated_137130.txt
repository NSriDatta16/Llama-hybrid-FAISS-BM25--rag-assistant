When is MCMC useful?

I am having trouble in understanding in which situation the MCMC approach is actually useful. I am going through a toy example from the Kruschke book "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS". What I understood so far is that we need a target distribution which is proportional to $p(D|\theta)p(\theta)$ in order to have a sample of $P(\theta|D)$. However, it seems to me that once we have $p(D|\theta)p(\theta)$ we only need to normalize the distribution to get the posterior, and the normalization factor could be easily found numerically. So what are the cases when this is not possible?
