You need a mapping between mnemonic instructions like MOV and opcodes see OpcodeMap . Besides that you need the information how many arguments (and width of operators) a instruction requires (encoded in bit fields, that will save you much time if you get this right). I doubt that the dragon book will help you much. The Art of ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING is a good reference.
