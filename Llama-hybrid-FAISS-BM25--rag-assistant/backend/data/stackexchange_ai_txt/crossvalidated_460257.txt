Where is BatchNorm performed in ResNeXT https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResNeXt neural network?

In the original paper that described ResNeXT (variation of Resnet) at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05431.pdf . On Page-5 top right column, it says: ReLU is performed right after eachBN, expect for the output of the block where ReLU is per-formed after the adding to the shortcut, following [14]. This sentence doesn't make sense, esp the part after comma "expect for the output of....". Could someone explain what this sentence means? Where is BN performed?
