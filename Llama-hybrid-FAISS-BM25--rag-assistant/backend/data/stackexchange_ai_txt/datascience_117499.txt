What kind of model can be suitable for predicting 100 values from 25 values by using a Neural Network in TensorFlow?

Previously I used Sequential model for this problem, but later I read from the TensorFlow website that it is not suitable to use it. I'd like to have a NN model to predict 100+ values from the given 25 values. The code below is my previous implementation. What kind of changes should I make to achieve better results? import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split import tensorflow X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split( inputdata, outputdata, test_size=0.2) model = tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential() model.add(tensorflow.keras.Input(shape=(25))) model.add(tensorflow.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(tensorflow.keras.layers.Dense(103)) model.compile(loss="mean_absolute_error", optimizer="adam", metrics=["mean_squared_error"]) model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=20) predictions = model.predict(predict)
