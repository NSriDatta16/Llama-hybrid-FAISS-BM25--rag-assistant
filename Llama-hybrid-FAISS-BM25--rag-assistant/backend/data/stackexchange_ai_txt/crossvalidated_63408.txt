The problem with studying the change of observables in time (such dataset is formally called "time series"), is that for each case observations in different points in time are dependent , which forces us at least to use tests that are valid for paired data (when comparing two data points), or VECM if you want to analyze all time points at once. In particular, significance test of regressions are invalid in such setup. When you treat each time point as a separate independent group, you are likely to greatly exaggerate significance. The question whether use statistical tests or not for census data depends on what is your hypothesis. If you want to infer for this particular group of people in this particular point of time (if the census actually concerns people), than there is no need for significance indeed. But very often we want implicitly to make an inference about some bigger population, e.g. whole Europe. In that case we need to treat our dataset as a sample. Or we want to make inference about our population in future ; in this case we would use VECM or similar technique valid for time series.
