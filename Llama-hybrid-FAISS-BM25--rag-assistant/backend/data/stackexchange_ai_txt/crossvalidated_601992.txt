Can we consider the loadings as a proxy for correlation, in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

In a PCA, the loadings can be understood as the weights for each original variable when calculating the principal component, or "how much each variable influence a principal component". Thus, can we consider the loading value of each variable as how correlated the original variable is with the respective principal component? If a variable has a high loading value in a principal component, it necessarily has a high correlation with that same component? And if this variable presents a loading value of 1/-1, will it necessarily present a correlation of 1/-1 with the same principal component?
