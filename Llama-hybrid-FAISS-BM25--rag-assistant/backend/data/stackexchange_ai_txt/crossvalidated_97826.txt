Is it legitimate to use factor analysis or clustering before regression

My goal is to make a logistic regression. The DV is a yes or no variable, and I already found 3 significant IV in my model. The problem is: I have 5 other categorial (yes or no) variables (they are nearly about the same topic) that I think they have an impact in the DV . Unfortunately, none of them were significant in my model. The question is: Is it legitimate to use a factor analysis or a clustering technique to construct one variable that summarize the information? and then use it as an IV in my model? if yes,can this variable be significant? and what kind of analysis do you suggest? Thanks in advance.
