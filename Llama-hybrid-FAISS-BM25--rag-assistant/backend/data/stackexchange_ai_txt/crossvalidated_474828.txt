As you said, a Binomial likelihood is most sensible. The prior is your prior and can be chosen to fit your beliefs. Naturally the Beta distribution is a sensible choice of prior for a proportion. This webpage I found explains Bayesian inference for a proportion very nicely, note that $U(0,1) = Beta(1,1)$ . https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/bayes_beta_binomial.html
