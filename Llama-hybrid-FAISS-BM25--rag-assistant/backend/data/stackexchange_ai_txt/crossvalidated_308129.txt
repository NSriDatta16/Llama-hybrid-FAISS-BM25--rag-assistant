Comparing heteroscedasticity tests in R

I've seen multiple explanations of comparisons of heteroscedasticity tests, but am still confused. (Part of the problem is that some of it is quite technical and has lost me.) I've collected a few heteroscedasticity test functions in R and compared the results, some of which baffle me. Here's a graph of a linear regression: To my untrained eye, the data look heteroscedastic. I've run a few tests for confirmation: > reg lmtest::bptest(reg,studentize=TRUE) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: reg BP = 174.53, df = 1, p-value lmtest::bptest(reg,studentize=FALSE) Breusch-Pagan test data: reg BP = 4163.8, df = 1, p-value car::ncvTest(reg) #original Breusch-Pagan Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 4163.766 Df = 1 p = 0 > res gvlma::display.gvlmatests(res) ASSESSMENT OF THE LINEAR MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USING THE GLOBAL TEST ON 4 DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM: Level of Significance = 0.05 Call: gvlma::gvlma(x = reg) Value p-value Decision Global Stat 3.378e+04 0.0000 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Skewness 4.505e+02 0.0000 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Kurtosis 3.318e+04 0.0000 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Link Function 1.504e+02 0.0000 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Heteroscedasticity 2.137e-01 0.6439 Assumptions acceptable. As I understand, the first three tests report heteroscedasticity with very low p-values, but the fourth rejects it quite squarely. How can the tests disagree so strongly? Here's my data: temp
