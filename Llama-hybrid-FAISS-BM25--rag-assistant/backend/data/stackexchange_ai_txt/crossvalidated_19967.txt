You've really been thrown in the deep end ! It doesn't seem like a time series problem, but does seem though it could naturally be modelled as a multilevel regression. As a first step (after the usual data exploration etc. of course) I would probably fit a generalised linear mixed effects model. To include a time compnent, you could then add a time variate (1=2003, 2=2004 etc). There are probably better ways to build time into it - I imagine others will have a better odea on that.
