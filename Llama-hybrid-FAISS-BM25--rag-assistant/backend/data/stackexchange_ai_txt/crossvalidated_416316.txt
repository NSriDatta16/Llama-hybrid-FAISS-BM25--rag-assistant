While a bit more general than statistics, I think there have been important advances in methods of r eproducible research (RR) . For example the development of R's knittr and Sweave packages and "R Markdown" notebooks, LyX and LaTeX improvements have contributed significantly to data sharing, collaboration, verification/validation, and even additional statistical advancement. Refereed papers in statistical, medical, and epidemiological journals rarely allowed one to reproduce results easily prior to the emergence of these reproducible research methods/technologies. Now, several journals are requiring reproducible research and many statisticians are using RR and posting code, their results and data sources on the web. This has also helped to foster data science disciplines and made statistical learning more accessible.
