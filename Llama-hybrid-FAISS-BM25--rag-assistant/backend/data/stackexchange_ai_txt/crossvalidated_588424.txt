Problems with zero probability events in Bayesian Networks

In the book Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles And Techniques by Daphne Koller , the author at one place ( Box 3c ), states the challenges in picking probabilities for a Bayesian network model. One of the challenges stated, is in assigning zero probabilities to events. Am finding difficulty interpreting the author's statement. Am quoting the exact text of the section below. Zero probabilities : A common mistake is to assign a probability of zero to an event that is extremely unlikely, but not impossible. The problem is that one can never condition away a zero probability, no matter how much evidence we get . What is meant by "condition away"? Please clarify this above point.
