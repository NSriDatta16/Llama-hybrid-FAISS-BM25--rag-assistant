Read Box and Jenkins book. They call it backcasting. Fit an ARMA model to the data by conditional maximum likelihood. Then use the data after the missing value and use the model to predict the value of the missing point like forecasting but going back in time instead. You could also forecast using the time points preceding and average the two.
