Have you tried Eclipse? I don't know if it's light weight enough for you but out of all the decent IDES I've used it's the fastest one in my experience. You should be able to download the standard eclipse distribution, then install the c++ and Perl tools. The C++ tools can be installed through the update manager from the Ganymede site that's included by default. Information about Perl for Eclipse can be found at this link. http://www.epic-ide.org/
