Custom block in magento

I have added this block in checkout.xml: Then, I have shown this in cart.phtml: echo $this->getChildHtml('shipping'); Then, I have made a page as shipping.phtml file in cart folder. This is working on my local PC, but when I follow this path on the server no block is showing. There is one difference between the two environments: on local I am doing all this step in the base folder, but on the server there is a customized theme folder in the default folder. Can anyone tell me where I am wrong? Thanks in advance.
