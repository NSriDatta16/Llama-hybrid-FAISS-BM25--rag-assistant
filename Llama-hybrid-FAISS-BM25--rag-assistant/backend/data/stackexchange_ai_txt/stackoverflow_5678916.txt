How to get get Uri of file in assets for argument in VideoView.setVideoURI()

I have been unsuccessful at generating a valid android.net.Uri , which references a mp4-file in my assets directory, which is required for the argument of VideoView.setVideoURI(android.net.Uri uri) . Does anyone have a code fragment demonstrating how I can construct the Uri?
