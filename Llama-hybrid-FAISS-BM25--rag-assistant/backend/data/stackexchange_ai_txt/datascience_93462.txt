Good questions! What is the difference between these files? Each of these files contains a different set of pre-trained word-embeddings. Both files can be thought of as dictionaries that map words to vectors of length D , where D is 50/300 in your respective files. The only difference between the files is that they contain different length word vectors. So your two files are essentially equivalent to this: word_embedding_50_dims = { : } word_embedding_300_dims = { : } Which we can generalize to word-embeddings of length D as being: word_embedding_D_dims = { : } what does the dimension represent in the GloVe pre-trained word vectors? As another answer pointed out, the dimension has no special meaning, it is a hyperparameter , chosen by the creators of GloVe. Note that this is not saying that the values were not chosen with a purpose , rather that it does not make sense to think of hyper-parameters as being interpretable in the typical sense of the word.
