Use XSL to keep only first paragraph of RSS field

I am trying to work with this RSS feed . I would like to use XSL to keep only the first paragraph of the description field. I have read up on how to target only certain children of an XML structure, but I think because the paragraph tags in the RSS feed are added as &lt and &gt they don't seem to work when doing something like this: Ideally I would like to select only the text between the paragraph tags and discard them completely. Any help would really be appreciated.
