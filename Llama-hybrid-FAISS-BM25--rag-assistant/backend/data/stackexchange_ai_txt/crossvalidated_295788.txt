The way you're applying logistic regression won't be of much value. Logistic or binomial regression would only be useful on your scenario if you were to regress a proportion, not a categorised variable. A typical regression analysis in companies like eBay, FB, or Google would be to use Binomial regression to predict/explain the conversion rate , i.e. the ratio of "conversions" per "views". If you had a metric similar to "views" that, combined with your bids metric, would be modelled as a discrete random variable that followed the Bernoulli or Binomial distribution, then logistic regression would be very much useful to regress the probability of conversion. Without such metric, you can still use a simple linear model, a log-log model, or a Poisson model (as mentioned in the comments section), though they will probably be less beneficial than a logit model.
