Wwise is probably the most complete solution for sound development in terms of workflow. The way it's designed really saves you programming time and gives you more possibilities to experiment and build complex sound structures. With Wwise, we were able to keep the project organized for our team. I personally really like their interactive music system. It's flexible and makes your music smoothly react to your game inputs. Also, Audiokinetic's support is very sharp too. Always fast and ready to help. I recommend.
