Usually it's the job of the merchant to classify his products in different sections. The way you could store tags in tightly related to the tool you are using to display / store them you are not going to manage it the same way if your are using a CMS like Drupal or if you are creating an application from scratch. What you could do is categorize yourself the products and add the tags as an additional classification tool. Tags are not really reliables. Sphinx and Apache Solr are customizable, again it depends on the tool that you are using but it's common to tweak the storage of the items that you are indexing.
