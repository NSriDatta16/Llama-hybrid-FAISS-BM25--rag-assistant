First of all, do not assume that 1 em will equal 10 pixels. An em unit is in direct correlation to the typography being used. If someone has a font size of 16 pixels, then 62.5% is indeed 10 pixels (16 * 0.625 = 10) but this will obviously change when someone has modified their default font size. Secondly, this is the first I've ever heard of using 62.5% for the base body font-size . I always use a font-size of 76% as based on Sane CSS Typography by Owen Briggs . Lastly, to answer your question, yes you could use a font-size of 6.25% and then use 12em instead of 1.2em , for example. However, I would highly discourage this methodology. In the world of typograhy, one em is intended to be the width of the capital letter 'M' . This method completely violates that common practice and will seriously confuse anyone that may maintain your CSS in the future.
