You *should" have a model, which you should think of as two separate pieces: 1) a domain sort of object which encapsulates business rules and logic (ie, Customer) 2) some data access sort of object which encapsulates data retrieval (ie, CustomerDao or CustomerRepository) Both of these should be injected into your view model constructor, as opposed to newing them up somewhere inside of the view model: class CustomerViewModel(Customer customer, CustomerDao){...} You should be testing even if it seems trivial; if it only needs one or two tests to prove it works, great.
