Regression following Principal Component Analysis

I am not sure if i did not add enough information or i am posting to the wrong section but if i am please let me know as it is my first time using the site. I have carried out Principal Component Analysis on my dataset and have reduced my dimensions. I would like to run some basic regressions using the first two components as explanatory variables. Does anyone know how I would do this and what code I would need to use. I am not the greatest on R as you may tell so any help anyone can provide would be gratefully appreciated. One of the replies had suggested using prcomp but as i used a correlation matrix and the princomp command would that still be appropriate? pro1.pca $scores[,1:k] round(pro1.pca$ loadings[,1:k],3) ## Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 ## Hazardous Drinker 0.292 0.381 0.423 0.478 ## Cardiovascular Condition -0.351 -0.238 0.599 -0.350 ## Fruit + Veg-5 or more 0.444 -0.039 0.139 -0.558 ## General Health Score 4+ -0.099 0.603 0.350 -0.148 ## Obese -0.457 -0.131 -0.196 0.281 ## health- very good 0.357 -0.289 0.273 0.461 ## Current Smoker -0.133 0.576 -0.294 -0.048 ## Meets Activity Levels: 0.480 0.005 -0.348 -0.149
