How can I access to a element of a svm.pred object?

I'm trying to predict the class of a sample (predict the quality of a wine, in levels of 4-5-6-7-8) with a SVM multiclass. When i predict a single sample in this way: svm.pred The reponse is this: svm.pred 3254 6 Levels: 4 5 6 7 8 How can I access to the number "6" to store it in a variable? Thanks.
