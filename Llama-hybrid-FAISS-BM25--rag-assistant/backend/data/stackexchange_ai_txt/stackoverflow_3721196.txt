Are there any means in Scala to split a class code into many files?

There are 2 reasons for me to ask: 1. I'd like a better code fragmentation to facilitate version control on per-function level 2. I struggle from some attention deficit disorder and it is hard for me to work with long pieces of code such as big class files To address these problems I used to use include directives in C++ and partial class definitions and manually-definable foldable regions in C#. Are there any such things available in Scala 2.8? I've tried to use editor-fold tag in NetBeans IDE, but it does not work in Scala editor unfortunately :-( UPDATE: As far as I understand, there are no such facilities in Scala. So I'd like to ask: someone who has any connection to Scala authors, or an account on their Bugzilla (or whatever they use), please , suggest them an idea - they should probably think of introducing something of such (I was fascinated by C# regions and partial classes for example, and plain old includes also look like a convenient tool to have) to make Scala even more beautiful through laconicity, IMHO.
