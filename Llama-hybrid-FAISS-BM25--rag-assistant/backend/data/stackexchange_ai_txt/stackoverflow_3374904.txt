SQL 2008 HierarchyID support in NHibernate

Searched various NHibernate lists and haven't come up with a definitive answer. The SQL2008 dialect doesn't appear to have support for the HierarchyID data type - new date and time types only. Does anyone have a good implementation or an effective workaround? I'd really like to leverage HierarchyID in a new app of mine. Support for this interesting and powerful data type is sorely lacking in MS's own tools so I'm not shocked that NHibernate doesn't have support. There are some approaches out there that I haven't delved into yet. Wondering if anyone has some experience in what works, what is more performant, etc.' Full disclosure: I'm working with Castle ActiveRecord but this seems like an NHibernate issue.
