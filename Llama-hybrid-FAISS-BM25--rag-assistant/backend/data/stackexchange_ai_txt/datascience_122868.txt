I think this is not possible since a RF is an ensemble of potentially many decision trees (DTs). Basically, each DT has its own "decisional path" which is kind of "averaged" in the RF. So you loose the interpretability of DTs, which may haved allowed you to understand at which value of a given feature the decision, at a given point, is made. Anyway, what you still get by a RF is an estimate of the importance of each feature which can help you understand which of them is more important (impactful) in the decision process.
