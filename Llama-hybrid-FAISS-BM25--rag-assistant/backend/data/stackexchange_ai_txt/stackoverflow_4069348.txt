How do I customize the helper using draggable in jQuery-UI

I want to make a custom element with text taken from the element "being dragged" using a helper function. My problem is that ui is undefined, so I don't know how to get a hold of the source of the drag. $('.draggable').draggable({ helper: function(event, ui) { var foo = $(' DRAG TEST '); return foo; } });
