The likelihood function $p(x|\theta)$ is a function of your data. This means that your $x$ is fixed and you want to check which value of $\theta$ is the most probable for your data, i.e. which value of $\theta$ maximized your $p(x|\theta)$ . $p(x|\theta)$ is the conditional distribution of $x$ , and yes it can be seen as a function of $\theta$ , but not as a distribution of $\theta$ . For the predictive distributions of $x$ , you have two cases, the prior and the posterior predictive. The posterior predictive is defined as $$p(x|Data)=\int_{\Theta}p(x|\theta)p(\theta|Data)d\theta$$ In this case, you can consider your $x$ as a random quantity, because you define a (marginalized in terms of $\theta$ ) conditional distribution for $x$ . However, I believe that you cannot consider $\theta$ fixed because it doesn't take certain values. You have to let $\theta$ take values all over the domain that the posterior distribution of $\theta$ is defined. As you said it tries to average over all possible values of $\theta$ , so I assume that also $\theta$ has to be random.
