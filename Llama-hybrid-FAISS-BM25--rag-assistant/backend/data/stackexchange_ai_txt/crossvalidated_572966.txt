MCA vs PCA - results for one factor are the same, but negative!

quick question regarding principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). I am trying to extract scores to create index variables from ordinal data. I first used PCA, but then have since used MCA. The results are nearly identical, except the scores for one factor/index variable is negative in the MCA compared to the the PCA. Essentially the scores are multiple by -1 for this index variable. This then means when I go to use these in a Cox regression, I get opposite hazard ratio for this index variable (reflected across HR=1). Any idea to why this is? Or which one is correct? Doing a bit more reading on it, I see that the assignment of positive and negative signs can be arbitrary. But since I need to use these scores to create an index variable, whether it is negative or positive has an impact on the direction of the results. How do I know which it is?
