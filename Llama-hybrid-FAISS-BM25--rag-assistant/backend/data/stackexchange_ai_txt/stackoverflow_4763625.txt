Drupal multi-site setup with sub-directories

I have a multi-site setup with a single codebase. Is it possible to have my sites directory set up like this with sub folders: mysite.com in /home/drupal/sites/mysite.com othersite1.com in /home/drupal/sites/cluster1/othersite1.com othersite2.com in /home/drupal/sites/cluster1/othersite2.com othersite3.com in /home/drupal/sites/cluster2/othersite3.com othersite4.com in /home/drupal/sites/cluster2/othersite4.com I'm trying to find a way to organize all my sites. thanks
