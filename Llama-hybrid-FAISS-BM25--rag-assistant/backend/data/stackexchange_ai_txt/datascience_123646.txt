a way to automatically split a video into chapters?

Given a video with audio, we can use ASR to get a script of the sentences and timestamps. We are looking for a way to group the sentences into chapters. There are several companies that are doing it nicely - Google on YouTube , Assembly AI , but we couldn't find any good resource or paper that explains the research behind how they do it. BertTopic seems to give us just a topic for each sentence, but not a way to split the video. it also doesnt account for timestamps. Wondered if anyone has any links or any other ideas? Thanks very much! Lior
