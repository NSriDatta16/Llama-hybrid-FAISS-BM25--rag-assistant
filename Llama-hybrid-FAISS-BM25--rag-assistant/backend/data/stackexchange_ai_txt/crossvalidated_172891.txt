How to report a convergence on a random walk on Markov Chain Monte Carlo

In our psychology experiment we have found Markov Chain transition probabilities to be a good way to analyse data, and the convergence of two Markov Chains on a random walk (we used 10,000 walks) to be a statistic that describes the data nicely (they converge around step 60). I can't find how one could report this in a psychology paper though. Any help or nice examples? Many thanks!
