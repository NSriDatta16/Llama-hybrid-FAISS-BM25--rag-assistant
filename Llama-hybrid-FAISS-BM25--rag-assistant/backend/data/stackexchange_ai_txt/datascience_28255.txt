Best way to generate artificial handwritten text?

I would like to train a generative model that generates artificial handwritten text as output. which architectures would you recommend to use? Training input could be either images of handwritten letters, not words, or maybe sequences of points for each letter. I thought of using some kind of combination of GAN+LSTM/GRU. Already found: http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/12/handwriting-generation-demo-in-tensorflow/ https://distill.pub/2016/handwriting/ Would appreciate any further recommendations.
