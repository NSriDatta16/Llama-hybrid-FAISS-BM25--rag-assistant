Speaking to the title of your question: we never accept the null hypothesis, because testing $H_{0}$ only provides evidence against $H_{0}$ (i.e. conclusions are always with respect to the alternative hypothesis, either you found evidence for $H_{A}$ or your failed to find evidence for $H_{A}$). However, we can recognize that there are different kinds of null hypothesis: You have probably learned about one-sided null hypotheses of the form $H_{0}: \theta \ge \theta_{0}$ and $H_{0}: \theta \le \theta_{0}$ You have probably learned about two-sided null hypotheses (aka two-tailed null hypotheses) of the form $H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}$, or synonymously $H_{0}: \theta - \theta_{0} = 0$ in the one-sample case, and $H_{0}: \theta_{1} = \theta_{2}$, or synonymously $H_{0}: \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} = 0$ in the two-sample case. I suspect this specific form of null hypothesis is what your question is about. Following Reagle and Vinod, I term null hypotheses of this form positivist null hypotheses , and make this explicit with the notation $H^{+}_{0}$. Positivist null hypotheses provide, or fail to provide evidence of difference or evidence of an effect . Positivist null hypotheses have an omnibus form for $k$ groups: $H_{0}^{+}: \theta_{i} = \theta_{j};$ for all $i,j \in \{1, 2, \dots k\};$ $\text{ and }i\ne j$. You may just now be learning about joint one-sided null hypotheses , which are null hypotheses of this form $H_{0}: |\theta - \theta_{0}|\ge \Delta$ in the one-sample case, and $H_{0}: |\theta_{1} - \theta_{2}|\ge \Delta$ in the two-sample case, where $\Delta$ is the minimum relevant difference that you care about a priori (i.e. you say up front that differences smaller than this do not matter). Again, following Reagle and Vinod, I term null hypotheses of this form negativist null hypotheses , and make this explicit with the notation $H^{-}_{0}$. Negativist null hypotheses provide evidence of equivalence (within $\pm\Delta$), or evidence of absence of an effect (larger than $|\Delta|$). Negativist null hypotheses have an omnibus form for $k$ groups: $H_{0}^{-}: |\theta_{i} = \theta_{j}|\ge \Delta;$ for all $i,j \in \{1, 2, \dots k\};$ $\text{ and }i\ne j$ (Wellek, chapter 7) The very cool thing to do is combine tests for difference with tests for equivalence. This is termed relevance testing , and places both statistical power and effect size explicitly within the conclusions drawn from a test, as detailed in the description of the [tost] tag. Consider: if you reject $H_{0}^{+}$ is that because there is a true effect of a size you find relevant? Or is it because your sample size was simply so large your test was over-powered? And if you fail to reject $H_{0}^{+}$, is that because there is no true effect, or because your sample size was too small, and your test under-powered? Relevance tests address these issues head-on. There are a few ways to perform tests for equivalence (whether or not one is combining with tests for difference): Two one-sided tests (TOST) translates the general negativist null hypothesis expressed above into two specific one-sided null hypotheses: $H^{-}_{01}: \theta - \theta_{0} \ge \Delta$ (one-sample) or $H^{-}_{01}: \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} \ge \Delta$ (two-sample) $H^{-}_{02}: \theta - \theta_{0} \le -\Delta$ (one-sample) or $H^{-}_{01}: \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} \le -\Delta$ (two-sample) Uniformly most powerful tests for equivalence, which tend to be much more arithmetically sophisticated than TOST. Wellek is the definitive reference for these. A confidence interval approach, I believe first motivated by Schuirman, and refined by others, such as Tryon. References Reagle, D. P. and Vinod, H. D.
