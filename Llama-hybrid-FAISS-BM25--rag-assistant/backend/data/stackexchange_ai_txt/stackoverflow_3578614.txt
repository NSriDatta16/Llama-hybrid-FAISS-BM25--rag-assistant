WCF Ajax Call not working with Jquery $.ajax

I have the following jQuery (service name altered): var url = "http://localhost/services/MyService.svc/addentrant"; var stuff = $("#signup-form").serializeArray(); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: url, contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", data: stuff, timeout: 10000, success: function (obj) { alert('yay!'); } }); The above makes a request to a WCF service hosted in Sitefinity on my local IIS7.5 server. Below is the relevant web.config: ... ... ... Finally, the interface and implementation of MyService: [ServiceContract(Name = "MyService", Namespace = "http://myservice.com/services/2010/")] public interface IMyService { [OperationContract, WebInvoke(Method = "POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest, UriTemplate = "addentrant")] void AddEntrant(string firstName); } ... [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)] public class MyService : IMyervice { ... public void AddEntrant(string firstName) { Entrant entrant = new Entrant() { FirstName = firstName, }; context.Entrants.InsertOnSubmit(entrant); context.SubmitChanges(); } } I think that's everything. Anyway, the $.ajax call returns a success, but the web service method was not being called (I had a breakpoint set). I opened up Fiddler and found I was being given a 405: Method Not Allowed . I've seen that before, but only when I had forgotten to set up the method to allow POST requests. I'm very confused as to why it is doing this now. Also, oddly enough, if I clone the ajax request captured in Fiddler, I get the following: OPTIONS /services/MyService.svc/addentrant HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Origin: http://localhost:6339 Access-Control-Request-Method: POST Just the header, no request body to speak of.
