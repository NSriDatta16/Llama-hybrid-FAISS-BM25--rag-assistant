I think you misinterpret what session hijacking means. Your first idea doesn't seem to prevent session hijacking at all. When you session hijack, you are stealing someone's session ID and pretending to be that session id. The user isn't able to change any actual session data, so it doesn't really matter if you encrypt/hash anything, as they won't be able to access it. What you might want to do is store the IP and User Agent string in the session, and check it before declaring the user logged in on each page load. If the IP and User Agent doesn't match, chances are you should prompt them to log in. (Well, at least make sure the User Agent is the same)
