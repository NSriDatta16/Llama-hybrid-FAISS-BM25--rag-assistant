I think the criterion for parametric and non-parametric is this: whether the number of parameters grows with the number of training samples. For logistic regression and svm, when you select the features, you won't get more parameters by adding more training data. But for RF and so on, the details of model will change (like the depth of the tree) even though the number of trees does not change.
