Why are you using the script component for this? Also, i'm not sure that a NVARCHAR(MAX) really qualifies as a BLOB column. If you want to do it as part of a data flow task, on your Data Source, set the data access mode to 'SQL Command' then use the following command text: select left(OrganisationProviderID,20) as OrganisationProviderID from src Then link this to your destination component.
