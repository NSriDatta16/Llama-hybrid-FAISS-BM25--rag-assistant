If you're after a single book, I can highly recommend "The Art of Prolog" : Coming to Prolog from something like C/C++ isn't just a matter of learning a programming language. It's a wholly different way of thinking about programming. Prolog is about asking the computer questions (or 'queries' if you like). Computation is almost a side-effect of the computer trying to answer your question. There is no meaningful equivalent to loops or conditionals because a prolog programmer wouldn't think in those terms. A good Prolog program looks like a description of the problem that you're trying to solve decomposed into recursive cases and subproblems rather than lists of instructions organised into functions or classes. The best way to learn Prolog is to set aside all your previous programming experience. Actually thinking about C and C++ will make Prolog harder to learn and use. Try to adopt a beginner's mind and maybe an approach more like an algebraist than a programmer.
