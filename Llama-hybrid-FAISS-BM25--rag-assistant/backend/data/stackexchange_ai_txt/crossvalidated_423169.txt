Gamma GLM - Derive prediction intervals for new x_i

In a Gamma GLM, the statistical model for each observation is assumed to be $Y_i \sim Gamma(shape, scale)$ , where $E(Y_i) = \mu_i = f(X_i\beta)$ , and $f$ is the link function. I've used MLE to estimate $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{scale}$ , and wish to produce a 90% prediction interval on a new point $Y'$ given $X'$ . I can produce the confidence intervals on $E(Y|X') = \mu'$ by using link function $f$ on the normally distributed confidence intervals for $X\hat{\beta}$ . Let's say $\hat{\mu'} = 10$ and 90% confidence intervals are [5, 30]. However, we want the intervals from the distribution of $Y'$ , not $\mu'$ . Intuitively, these intervals should be much wider than the confidence intervals for $\mu'$ I think they should also be wider than the 5th and 95th percentile of a single Gamma distribution with $\mu=\hat{\mu'}$ , since the uncertainty around $\hat{\mu'}$ should translate into increased uncertainty around the final distribution, sort of like an vague prior on a bayesian posterior distribution. What is the correct way to model prediction intervals on the new point $Y'$ ? The below schema shows how uncertainty on $\mu'$ translates into many possible gamma distributions and a wide prediction interval for $Y'$ References: https://www.rocscience.com/help/swedge/swedge/Gamma_Distribution.htm https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html
