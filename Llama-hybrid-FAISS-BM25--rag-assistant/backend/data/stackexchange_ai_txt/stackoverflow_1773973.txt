Blitting multisampled FBO with multiple color attachments in OpenGL

I have a frame buffer object in an OpenGL program with multiple colour attachments, and am trying to upgrade it to a multisampled FBO. As I understand it, a multisampled FBO is only able to use render buffers, specifically ones created using glRenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT . If I want something rendered to this FBO in a texture, I need to create a second FBO with textures for its attachments, then blit the multisampled FBO to the regular FBO using glBlitFramebufferEXT . The very, very sparse examples I've seen assume a single colour attachment. What do I do when I want to blit multiple colour attachments?
