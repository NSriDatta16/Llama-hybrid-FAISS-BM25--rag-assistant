Inconsistent ajax (XDR) response from IE

I'm making an ajax request from an iframe that is injected onto every page via an IE plugin. I'm using IE's cross domain request because jQuery's ajax fails for IE. This works 75% of the time on IE8 & 9. The other 25%, the xdr.onload doesn't even fire. The server php is doing its job...the log looks identical for when onload does and does not fire. Also, xdr.onerror doesn't fire either. Any ideas? thisURL = "http://example.com/getmsg.php?cmd=getMessage&iid=ddeb2c1228&uurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F&t=" + Math.random(); // Use Microsoft XDR var xdr = new XDomainRequest(); xdr.open("GET", thisURL); xdr.onload = function() { // this is sometimes called, sometimes not in IE alert('INCONSISTENT ALERT'); callback(xdr.responseText); }; xdr.send();
