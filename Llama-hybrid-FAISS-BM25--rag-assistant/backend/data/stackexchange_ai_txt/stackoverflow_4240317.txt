You could store the items to an XML file in the IsolatedStorage, just like you would do for any other file. When the application is loaded, you need to set the actions in the Application_Launching event handler (in App.xaml.cs) - for example, you could create a List that will be bound to a ListView element that will get contain elements from the loaded XML file.
