Progress Reports

I'm not talking about the kind you get in college, but rather implementing progress reports on the Job for developers. My thoughts in organizing a development team is encouraging and, to some extend, requiring regular progress updates were developers would report on what they did in the last hour or few hours and how long tasks took. Below I listed a few of the pros that come to my mind Allowing me to go back and see were I might have made a mistake and allow myself a starting point when working to solve a problem that I created. Gives teams a good understanding of were they are on the project and regular updates For future projects, the ability to go back and see how long a certain task took and create an accurate estimate Encouraging a greater amount of communication among a team What I would not want to see happen is it become a way for breathing down a developers back, and I think it could easily become a distraction if one felt pressured submit updates every hour. What are you thoughts? Pros and Cons. Have you ever experienced this first hand? How did it make you feel?
