If an assembly is loaded from the GAC the strong-name verification is skipped because the assembly has already been verified. Another advantage of the GAC is file protection (admin-only). NGEN has its own storage for native images. It makes a little sense to use NGEN without putting an assembly in the GAC first. In such a case loading the assembly would cause to verify its SN signature, which means that the cryptographic hash is recreated each time the assembly is loaded. The best practice when using ngen is to put assemblies in the GAC as well.
