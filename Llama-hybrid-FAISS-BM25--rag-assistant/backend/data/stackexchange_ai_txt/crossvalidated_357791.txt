One way is to get the correlation matrix of returns then analyze its eigenvalues, e.g. look at the largest eigenvalue, which can be that one number you're interested in. See http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001316448104100102?journalCode=epma or similar writings. If you're familiar with PCA, then it's the first principal component and associated with it explained variance.
