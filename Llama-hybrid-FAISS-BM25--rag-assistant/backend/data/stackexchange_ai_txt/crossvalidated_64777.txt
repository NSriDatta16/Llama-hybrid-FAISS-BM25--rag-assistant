Have you thought about modelling this problem with decision bayesian networks ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_diagrams )? If you can define some utility function that you can optimise, given the decision you make, that is, which chemicals should be tested. This is a kind of a problem, when you take decisions under uncertainty, which looks like the situation you describe. I know it's quite abtract response, but maybe it will guide you into the right direction.
