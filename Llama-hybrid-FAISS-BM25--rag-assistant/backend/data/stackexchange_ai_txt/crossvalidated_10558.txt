If you are willing to learn to understand the diagnostics, X12-ARIMA provides a boatload of diagnostics that range from (ASCII) graphs to rule-of-thumb indicators. Learning and understanding the diagnostics is something of an education in time series and seasonal adjustment. On the other hand, X12-ARIMA software is a one-trick pony, while using stl in R would allow you to do other things and to switch to other methods (decompose, dlm's, etc) if you wish. On the other-other hand, X12-Arima makes it easier to include exogenous variables and to indicate outliers, etc.
