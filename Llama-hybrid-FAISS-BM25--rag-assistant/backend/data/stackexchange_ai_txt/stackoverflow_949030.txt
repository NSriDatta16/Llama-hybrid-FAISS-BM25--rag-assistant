Real world examples of code the student can imagine themselves doing out of their free time. I remember a teacher telling me to use const values it was the tax of something. I only had to use the value in two places. She asked what if i need to change it i said its only in two places and i'll change it by hand also i couldnt imagine the gov ever changing the tax %. I cant think of an non complex example where i would use a const so i wouldnt try teaching them to use that but for arrays i would simply write a guessing game then when the player wins the game, it plays back all the guesses in the same order to them. There is no easy way to do that w/o arrays and i could see how keeping track of someones steps/guesses would be useful (bragging rights to how quickly a person guessed it).
