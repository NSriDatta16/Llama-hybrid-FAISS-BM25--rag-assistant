Correct, the Wald statistic (reported as a "t statistic" by lme4 ) is, in general, at best only approximately t-distributed for linear mixed models (LMMs). It is only exactly t-distributed in certain very special cases, for example, mixed-model ANOVA with nested random factors and balanced data. For generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a non-normal response, the distribution of the Wald statistic might not even be very t-like at all. For example, see this thread on logistic regression, where we show that the tails of the sampling distribution can tend be be thinner-than-normal rather than thicker-than-normal. (That thread does not focus on mixed models, but the same issue arises there.)
