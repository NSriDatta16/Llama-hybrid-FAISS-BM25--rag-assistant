I ended up not using any of these methods. I am on Heroku, and the amount of images/files I need to serve isn't large enough to warrant cloud storage. What I did was create a file in tmp using one method and linking to it with link_to_remote to generate the file. Another link was made to an action which uses send_file with the path of the file I created in temp. The problems I was having was due to doing the generation and file serving being IN THE SAME method, which I will try to figure out and possibly post another question on.
