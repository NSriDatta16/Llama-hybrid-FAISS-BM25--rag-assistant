c assignment, averaging integers

I worked on this yesterday about 5 hours and got the code to work using help from this site, but I think the way I did it was a cheater way, I used a scanf command. Anyways I want to fix this the correct way. Thanks guys! Oh the code compiles but the average that gets spit out is wrong. I would like to conceptually understand what I am doing wrong as well as finish the assignment. #include #include double get_number(int num); main () { double n1,n2,n3; double average; printf("\nCompute the average of 3 integers\n"); printf("--------------------------------\n"); n1 = get_number(1); n2 = get_number(2); n3 = get_number(3); average = (n1 + n2 + n3)/3; printf("The average is %0.2f\n",average); } double get_number(int num) { double value = 0; int c; printf("Please input number %i: ", num); while ((c = getchar()) != '\n') { if ( (c '9') ) { printf("Incorrect character entered as a number - %i\n",c); exit(-1); } else { c =value; } } return(value); }
