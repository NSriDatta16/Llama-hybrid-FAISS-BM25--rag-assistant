Nah, you're doomed. Even if you pop the page up in some different browser and hid the back button, there's always the Backspace key. The problem with marketing guys and analyst types is that some of them do not understand the fundamental concept of the web being stateless. They do not understand that the page is totally, totally unaware of the browser using it and absolute control of the browser is totally outside the capability of web pages. The best way to discourage your users to hit the back button is to make sure that your page loses all its data when they press back, e.g., the comment page is the only point where the data can be saved, and if they do press the back button they have to do everything all over again (think along the lines of pragma: nocache). Users will complain, sure, but they are the reason that this godforsaken requirement exists, right?
