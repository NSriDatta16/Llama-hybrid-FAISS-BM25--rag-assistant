Jet has been deprecated but there's a replacement in the form of ACE (Access Database Engine). However, regarding using it from LINQ. The answers to this question have various suggestions and I've also read somewhere that it might be possible to use LINQ to DataSet to do it. Here's a blog post about it: Querying DataSets â€“ Introduction to LINQ to DataSet but I can't find the link to where I read that someone had had success in using it to access an Access DB. I'd suggest though, that if there are no clear cut solution for using LINQ, the pragmatic approach would be to just stick to normal ADO.Net and wait with using LINQ until you're sure that you're using a datasource that supports it fully.
