Can't See Product Options on Magento 1.4.2

I did a fresh install of 1.4.2 to test it. All of my sites are currently on 1.4.0.1. When I add products I cannot see attributes as product options on front end. I've tested the system attributes and my super attribute extension. I've tried on simple and configurable products. It all seems to work on backend but they do not render on front end.
