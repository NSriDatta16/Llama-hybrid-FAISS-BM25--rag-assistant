How to start a COM server implemented in python?

I am using python for making a COM local server. In fact, the whole COM part is implemented in a dll and my python script is calling that dll thanks to ctypes. It works ok when I run the script manually. I would like to see my server automatically ran when a COM client request it. I know that it is possible by giving the command line as value of the LocalServer32 registry key. Unfortunatelly, I can't manage to see windows running my python script properly. I've tried to use python and pythonw with a similar problems. It seems that windows is adding a "-Embedding" flag to the command line and I guess that it can be a problem for python. Any ideas? Does anybody how to avoid the "-Embedding" flag in the command line?
