How to parametrize a posterior to use it as a prior in Bayesian statistics?

In my problem, I have two sets of parameters, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ , and two datasets $d_1,d_2$ that constrain them with a known likelihood function. There is a certain 'hierarchy' in the model: the likelihood is separable and one only depends on $\theta_1$ : $$\mathcal{L}(d_1,d_2|\theta_1,\theta_2) = \mathcal{L}(d_2|\theta_1,\theta_2)\mathcal{L}(d_1|\theta_1).$$ I want to sample from the joint posterior $$p(\theta_1, \theta_2 | d_1, d_2).$$ Unfortunately, due to the high cost of evaluating $\mathcal{L}(d_1|\theta_1)$ , it is not practical to directly sample this posterior. I am lucky: the likelihood of $d_1$ is only a function of $\theta_1$ . Because of that, I want to split up this posterior in a hierarchical way like so: $$p(\theta_1, \theta_2 | d_1, d_2) \propto \mathcal{L}(d_2,d_1|\theta_1,\theta_2)\pi(\theta_1,\theta_2)\\ =\mathcal{L}(d_2|\theta_1,\theta_2) (\mathcal{L}(d_1|\theta_1)\pi(\theta_1))\pi(\theta_2).$$ This suggests doing the sampling in two steps: first sampling from $p(\theta_1|d_1)=\mathcal{L}(d_1|\theta_1)\pi(\theta_1)$ and subsequently using this as a prior on the full posterior. Computationally, this would be much preferred. However, in practice, my $p(\theta_1|d_1)$ is not analytically calculable, so instead it is sampled, with e.g. MCMC. But if you only have samples, how do you use this as a prior in an MCMC run of $p(\theta_1,\theta_2|d_1,d_2)$ ? You have to parameterize this prior somehow, right? A simple way would be to assume that $p(\theta_1|d_1)$ is a multivariate Gaussian, with a mean and covariance matrix derived from the sampled MCMC chains, but this is not always a reasonable assumption. If parametrizing is indeed necessary, how do you do this if the posterior is non-gaussian, for example a banana-shape, in some parameters?
