Processing xml files with Hadoop

I'm new to Hadoop. I know very little about it. My case is as follows: I have a set of xml files (700GB+) with the same schema. some title some abstract 2000 E123456 some name1 some name1 email1@domain.com some organization1 some organization2 some name2 some name2 email2@domain.com some organization1 some organization2 medicin inheritance some reference text1 some reference text2 I convert the data within the xml files into a relational database containing the following tables Articles Authors Tags References I have a set of tools that work on the tables for generating a list of statistical reports and doing some other staff. Because of a tool that uses a full text search on the References table, I stored it in a Lucene Solr index. My question is: can I use Hadoop for: Storing the data that is in the xml files Making some kind of separation between the entities listed above(Authors,Articles,Tag and References) Running my tools that perform a very complex set of queries on the data and if that can be done using hadoop, will it be in a good performance? If Hadoop is not a good candidate for case, will be any other nosql database like MongoDB or Cassandra a better solution (because my big problem with the relational system is the very bad performance with the complex algorithms I'm using to do my job)?
