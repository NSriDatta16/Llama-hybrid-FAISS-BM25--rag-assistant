PHP Link in echo

I have the echo below and I need to link in it but I get an unexpected T_STRING on that line with the link and it says expecting ',' or ';' The code is: echo " You Are Now A User Of ClipBoy! Drag the image below to your bookmarks bar for easy access to your site! To get to your site go to http://themacsplash.com/ClipBoy/userfiles/$myUser "; How would I fix this?
