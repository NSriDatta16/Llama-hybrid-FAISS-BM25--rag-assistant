Computers are all about making copies of software. Once you let random people download it from your website, the genie is already out of the bottle. Quit worrying and learn to love The Bomb. I'm not a proprietary software fan, but if I somehow found myself in your shoes with your values here's what I'd do: Use a license manager. Nothing stupidly fancy like a dongle. Just something that makes folks check back in with you and pay. Host both the full installer and a torrent on my own website. Encourage everybody around the internet I can find who might be interested to also host the installer and/or the torrent. Issue periodic upgrades, both to get more money from honest customers and to obsolete the inevitable cracked copies.
