Separation of concerns What if you want to change the storage of 'Users', from say SQL to a flat file? Then context would not be needed, and you'd have to change every use of it, instead of just your IRepository implementation. Also, ideally you would have your IRepository injected. So you're MainViewModel doesn't care how it gets it's Users .
