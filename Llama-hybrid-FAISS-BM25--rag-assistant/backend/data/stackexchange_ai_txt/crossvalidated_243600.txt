This approach wouldn't use a contingency table, so it may not be the sort of answer you're looking for, but for a research question such as you describe, "Is the effect of smoking on cancer occurrence different for males and females?", logistic regression would be one way of finding an answer. With the logistic regression you'd have an outcome, whether or not the person had cancer , and two predictors, their gender and whether they smoked . By testing for an interaction between the two predictors, you could see whether the difference between non-smokers and smokers in the probability, or more accurately the log-odds , of getting cancer varied between the genders. With more complex contingency tables logistic regression would still be a possibility, although it may get a little more complex as well.
