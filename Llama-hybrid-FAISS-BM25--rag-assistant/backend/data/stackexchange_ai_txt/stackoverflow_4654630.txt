Designing/Writing queries can be done in either of the tools. Main point is data storage. MS Access is not a real database engine. Try to do away with Access as a database. As a professional I will always chose SQL Server over Access. If I don't have full blown SQL Server then I will try to live with "SQL Server 2008 Express with Advanced Services".
