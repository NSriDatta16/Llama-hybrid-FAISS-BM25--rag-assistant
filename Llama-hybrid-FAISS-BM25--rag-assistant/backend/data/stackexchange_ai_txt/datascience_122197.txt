What are the preprocessing steps for text classification after removing stopwords?

I am working on an NLP project where I have text that I need to categorize based on topics (The data is 2 columns, text and topic). Something that I am stuck on now is the preprocessing part. What are the steps and in what order? So far, what I have done is remove stopwords. I have heard of TFIDF, Count Vectorizer, BOW, Tokenization, and Lemmatization/Stemming. However, I am confused about when to use them and in what order. Could someone please explain what can I do after removing stopwords? And do I need to one-hot encode the labels (topics) in order to pass it on to the model? Thanks in advance.
