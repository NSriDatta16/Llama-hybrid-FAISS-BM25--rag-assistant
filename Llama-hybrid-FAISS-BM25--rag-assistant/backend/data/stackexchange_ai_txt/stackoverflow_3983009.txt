SQL case in select query

I have following query Select a,b,c, case totalcount when 0 then 0 else abcd/totalcount end AS 'd', case totalcount when 0 then 0 else defg/totalcount end AS 'e' From Table1 In this query, I have same case statement in select query...Can i make it into single select statement. "totalcount" is some value... abcd and defg are two column values from table1. If totalcount is zero, i dont want to divide, else I wish to divide to get an average value of abcd and defg.
