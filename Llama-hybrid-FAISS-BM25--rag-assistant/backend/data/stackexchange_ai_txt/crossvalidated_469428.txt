Granger on vector error-correction model

Say I have an vector error-corretion model for $3$ time series $x,y,z$ . $$x_t=\alpha_1 +\sum_{i=1}^{p}\theta_{1i} y_{t-i}+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\delta_{1i} z_{t-i}+\beta_1 ECT_{t-1}+e_{1t}$$ $$y_t=\alpha_2 +\sum_{i=1}^{p}\theta_{2i} y_{t-i}+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\delta_{2i} z_{t-i}+\beta_2 ECT_{t-1}+e_{2t}$$ $$z_t=\alpha_3 +\sum_{i=1}^{p}\theta_{3i} y_{t-i}+\sum_{i=1}^{p}\delta_{3i} z_{t-i}+\beta_3 ECT_{t-1}+e_{3t}$$ where $ETC$ denotes error term and $e_{it}$ is the stochastic error term with mean zero and constant variance. I am going to run Granger causality test on it in R . But I not fully understand should I estimate $\alpha, \theta, \delta $ coefficients before Granger causality test or Granger causality test can receive variable coefficients. How can I apply the Granger causality test on these equations, this case?
