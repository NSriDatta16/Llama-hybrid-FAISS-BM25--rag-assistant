Obfuscating a Magento module

I've been asked to protect a Magento module through obfuscation. I never used PHP obfuscation packages but I know how they work and I forsee some issues in obfuscating a module that is very string and xml dependant: /etc/config.xml registers harcoded class names and paths auto-loading is heavily used and paths are important I cannot imagine how to automatically obfuscate a class name that will be called later by Mage::getModel('my/module'). I'll have to exclude from the obfuscation process Magento function calls ( ex. $order->getItems()). Any recommendations?
