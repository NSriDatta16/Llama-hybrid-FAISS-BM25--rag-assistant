Use VIM Visual Block to concatenate blocks

I try to use VIM build my SQL query by concatenate block of strings. For example, I have the following strings in three tabs in VIM: # block one where c = '123' where c = '2345' ... # block two set b = 12 set b = 345 ... # block three update myTable set a = 'abc', update myTable set a = '23423', ... each block contains 100 lines (fragments of SQL query). I would like to concatenate those blocks in to one complete SQL query: block one + block two + block three (100 lines) like this: # sql queries update myTable set a = 'abc', set b = 12 where c = '123' update myTable set a = '23423', set b = 345 where c = '2345' ... Just ignore the first line #..., it is just for explanation. I think that Visual Block can be used do that: Yank all the lines in tab "block two"; Paste buffer to tab "block three" at the beginning; Yank all the lines in tab "block one"; Paste the buffer to tab "block three" at the beginning. However, I tried to the tip in Visual Block Mode (first two y and p examples), I could not get my expected result. The paste does not concatenate the buffer strings to the block. Not sure what I did wrong. Or any other alternative ways?
