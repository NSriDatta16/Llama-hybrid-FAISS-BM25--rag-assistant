Pre-PCA pooling in R

I was just wondering if it is possible to pool the data into groups before doing prcomp() in R? I have i.e. 100 individuals (rows) and 50 measurements(cols) with individuals being grouped in separate populations (20 in the first, 30 in the second, 15 in the third...etc). Now PCA can give scores of individuals or measurements on PC axes, but I need to see what PC score is associated with populations. On the graph I can only plot individual scores but I need just let`s say 5 or 6 populations and their corresponding score. Any ideas?
