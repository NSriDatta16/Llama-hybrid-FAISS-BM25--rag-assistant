I would say very often people align themselves with one of three different approaches: frequentists, which make use of tests such as the F-test bayesians, which make use of bayesian inference information theory guys, which use the BIC and AIC, just like other examples cited above. Frequentist analysis is probably both the most straightforward and the most criticized for its shortcomings. Information theory on the other hand, underwent a boom recently, drawing the attention of more and more people as time goes by. I think you should try to understand a bit and draw some ideas from each of the three approaches. If you have no idea about what the data should contain, then the frequentist approach is a good way to start; on the other hand If you have some information on the underlying model, take a look at bayesian inference. And I would always keep the number of free parameters low, and that's what AIC and BIC try to balancing information with parameters.
