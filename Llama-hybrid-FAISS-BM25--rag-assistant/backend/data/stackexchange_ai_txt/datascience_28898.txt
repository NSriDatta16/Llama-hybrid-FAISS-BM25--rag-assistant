From Tensorflow Github : Dilated max-pooling is simply regular max-pooling but the pixels/voxels you use in each "application" of the max-pooling operation are exactly the same pixels/voxels you would select with dilated convolution. Dilated convolution/pooling are useful for connectomics and 3D shape datasets (3D deep learning). So, similarly as in convolution every nth pixel is selected for the operation. Edit Selecting points like this: making pooling for them like this: Picture sources: https://www.quora.com/Is-a-pooling-layer-necessary-in-CNN-Can-it-be-replaced-by-convolution https://www.quora.com/What-is-max-pooling-in-convolutional-neural-networks Edit2: 2 x 2 max pooling with 3 x 3 dilation: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (5) 0 0 [6] 0 0 (3) 0 0 [6] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (3) 0 0 (4) 0 0 (2) 0 0 (4) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (1 0 0 (2) 0 0 (2) 0 0 (1) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (3) 0 0 [4] 0 0 [6] 0 0 (3) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 becomes 6 6 4 6
