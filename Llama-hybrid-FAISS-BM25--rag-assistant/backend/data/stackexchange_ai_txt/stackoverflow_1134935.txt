Supersampling by either rendering to a larger buffer and scaling down or combining jittered buffers is probably your best bet. Combining multiple jittered buffers should give you the best quality for a given number of samples (better than the regular grid from simply rendering an equivalent number of samples at a multiple of the resolution and scaling down) but has the extra overhead of multiple rendering passes. It has the advantage of not being limited by the maximum supported size of your render target though and allows you to choose pretty much an arbitrary level of AA (though you'll have to watch out for precision issues if combining many jittered buffers). The article "Antialiasing with Accumulation Buffer" at opengl.org describes how to modify your projection matrix for jittered sampling (OpenGL but the math is basically the same). The paper "Interleaved Sampling" by Alexander Keller and Wolfgang Heidrich talks about an extension of the technique that gives you a better sampling pattern at the expense of even more rendering passes. Sorry about not providing links - as a new user I can only post one link per answer. Google should find them for you. If you want to go the route of rendering to a larger buffer and down sampling but don't want to be limited by the maximum allowed render target size then you can generate a tiled image using off center projection matrices as described here .
