In response to your comment to Adam's answer, regarding having 10 imports for 10 classes, firstly don't forget that there's no need to have one class per module in Python. Modules should be organised by functionality, so you can group related classes in a single file if that makes sense. If you still wanted to make all the classes importable in one go, you could import them all in the __init__.py file itself using the from submodule import Class syntax, then just import the containing module - import mainmodule and refer to mainmodule.Class1 etc, or even use from mainmodule import Class1, Class2, Class3 to import the classes directly into your namespace and refer to them directly.
