No, it's not possible to do what you're trying to do in any elegant fashion. The closest thing you'll be able to do are to create a macro or an inline function which delegates to your function. However, both of these alternatives are rather ugly, so I'm not going to post any code samples. Just bite the bullet and specify the whole name, or refactor your code so that the static methods are just global functions.
