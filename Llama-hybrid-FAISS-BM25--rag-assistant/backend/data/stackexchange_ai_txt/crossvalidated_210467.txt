You are basically describing a Bayesian Optimization (updating the distributions of parameters as you observe fitness values). The GPyOpt devel branch has a tutorial on how to fit SVM with it. Constraints should be relatively straightforward to add. However, all this might be an overkill. If you are simply interested in how search might improve fitting you might just as well start simple with something like a genetic algorithm.
