How can I incorporate a known measurement error per group into a GAM?

I am trying to investigate surface changes using a time series of 3D point clouds. Due to data volume, I am segmenting the point cloud in small (eg. 50cmx50cm) areas and for each compute a generalized additive model (GAM) that models elevation data as a function of time and space. After accounting for time, slope and the measurement error, the resulting elevation data should be normally distributed. I'd like to infer knowledge about whether and how the surface changed over time. Other ideas about how to approach this are very welcome, especially regarding computation time. I thought about using MARS, but did not find a way of incorporating a random error with a known distribution. mod.gam The area of interest was surveyed every hour. Every survey has a measurement error, whose mean and variance can be estimated. How can I include this error? I thought about including an offset(error) term in the model, but that does not seem to influence the standard error calculations. Then I was thinking of adding it as a random effect smoother that depends on the survey like this: mod.gam Would that be an adequate approach? How can I specify the mean and variance of the random effect?
