This is more of an opinion than an answer, but I think having one axis measuring two different things is generally confusing and not a very good practice. For instance, there's no way to know by looking at the plot which scale corresponds to the bar plots and which to the points with error bars. And the viewer is left wondering which metric he / she should be paying attention to. I would either choose the metric that's more relevant to what you're trying to convey and plot only that one, or if you feel both need to be presented then consider creating two separate plots, possibly stacked vertically.
