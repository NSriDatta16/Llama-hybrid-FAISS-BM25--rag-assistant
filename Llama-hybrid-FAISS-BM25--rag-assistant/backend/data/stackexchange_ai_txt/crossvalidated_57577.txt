Correlogram in R like in Stata?

In STATA I can create a "Correlogram" to find the appropriate lag order in case of time series. E.g. I know I can use the acf or Acf of the forecast package to calculate the ACF and PACF and to plot it. But how can I get the significance values? I mean the values in the column Prob>Q? Is this implemented in any package/command?
