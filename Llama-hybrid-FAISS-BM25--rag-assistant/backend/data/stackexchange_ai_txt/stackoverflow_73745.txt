Long term source code archiving: Is it possible?

I'm curious about keeping source code around reliably and securely for several years. From my research/experience: Optical media, such as burned DVD-R's lose bits of data over time. After a couple years, I don't get all the files off that I put on them. Read errors, etc. Hard drives are mechanical and subject to failure/obsolescence with expensive data recovery fees, that hardly keep your data private (you send it away to some company). Magnetic tape storage: see #2. Online storage is subject to the whim of some data storage center, the security or lack of security there, and the possibility that the company folds, etc. Plus it's expensive, and you can't guarantee that they aren't peeking in. I've found over time that I've lost source code to old projects I've done due to these problems. Are there any other solutions? Summary of answers: 1. Use multiple methods for redundancy. 2. Print out your source code either as text or barcode. 3. RAID arrays are better for local storage. 4. Open sourcing your project will make it last forever. 5. Encryption is the answer to security. 6. Magnetic tape storage is durable. 7. Distributed/guaranteed online storage is cheap and reliable. 8. Use source control to maintain history, and backup the repo.
