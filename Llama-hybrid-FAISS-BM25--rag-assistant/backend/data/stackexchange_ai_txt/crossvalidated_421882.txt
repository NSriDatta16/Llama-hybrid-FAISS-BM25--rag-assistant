My initial reaction is to use a logistic regression. First, you would need to restructure your data. In the cake example, you'd create a new dataset with three variables: (1) dropout indicator, (2) cake, and (3) blindfold indicator. Each row represents a unique person x cake x blindfold combination. A) Do dropout rates differ by cakes? You can just compare the residual deviance between the null model and a model with the cake variable. If the results are significant it means that there is at least one cake with differing dropout rates. mod B) Differences based on interaction Here, you could do something similar by comparing a model with just the main effects and a model with the interaction terms. mod2 If you're interested in comparing specific combinations of cake and blindfold status, you could use the multcomp package in R. UCLA has a great tutorial.
