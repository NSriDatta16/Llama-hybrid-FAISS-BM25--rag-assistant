Gaussian sampling in high dimension

I have a covariance function $f(x)$, where $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is a point in three-dimensional space. I need to generate a Gaussian field with given covariance function on a 3D grid of points, that is very large (the storage of full covariance matrix is impossible, so a Cholesky decomposition is fail). What is the best approach to deal with this kind of problem? Thanks,
