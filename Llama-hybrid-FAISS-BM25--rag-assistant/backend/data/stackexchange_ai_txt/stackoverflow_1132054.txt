Suggestions for a productive hardware setup with excellent virus protection

This question is a little opinion based, but I think it can be based in fact and I would prefer answers backed up with a link to a reputable company if possible. The problem is at my job, we have "okay" hardware for the developers, laptops running Windows XP (I know) with dual core 2.3 Ghz processor, 2GB of memory and 60 GB hard disk @7200 rpm however, the amount of virus scan and security agents and big brother software on these make them unusable when scans are running. My company insists on running full disk virus scans every monday and "smart scans" every other day. I appreciate the concern for viruses as much as the next guy, however it is hindering our work and we are looking for a new setup that allows the developers to work unimpeded by scans, yet provides virus protection et al that the company is looking for. Any suggestions?
