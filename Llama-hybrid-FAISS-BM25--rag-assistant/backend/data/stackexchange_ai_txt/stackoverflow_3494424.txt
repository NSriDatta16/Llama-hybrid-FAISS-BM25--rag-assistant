jQuery find does not seem to work

I have a DocumentFragment stored in "selectedContents", and I am trying to find "span" elements in it, with the help of jQuery. It has two child nodes, where the first one is a text node, and the second one a span. When I try $(selectedContents.childNodes).find('span') , it returns an empty set! However, when I print the "$(selectedContents.childNodes)[1].localName" it says "span"! Is there anything wrong in my find? Please help. Thanks Srikanth
