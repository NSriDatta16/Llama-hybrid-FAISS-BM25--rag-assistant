My advice would be that if the application is in pure winapi, keep it that way. Starting a .NET framework runtime just for one dialog with draggable items is as bad as hosting a WebBrowser control and using JQuery for that one functionality - it's at least thedailywtf.com-worthy if you ask me (but then again, you're not asking me ;) ). Otherwise you will put yourself (and potentially others) into some maintainability nightmare and the quickest way will become the most problematic one. Edit: Maybe those two articles will help in implementing drag-drop - they're about row reordering in ListViews, but will probably help in getting the idea.
