In batch normalization, shouldn't using DropConnect harm test accuracy?

In my understanding of batch normalization, mean and variance are calculated over the entire batch and then added to the population average. This average is then applied to the test set to estimate the mean and variance of the overall test set. However, DropConnect removes connections during training as a form of network regularization. The model calculates batch statistics through a network that is missing usually half its connections. At test time, all connections are used. Shouldn't this affect the mean and variance of the population and/or the test set, throwing the estimated mean and variance off, or will the network stabilize itself over time?
