Swap related memory problem in Ubuntu

When I run a top and get it to show swap usage, I get the following output. However, I have disabled swap with swapoff -a prior to starting firefox. What is shown in the SWAP field here then? When I do cat /proc/meminfo , I get a nonzero value for a field named SwapCached . What is this? My guess it this is the aggregate of all the SWAP values shown in top . How are these related to total memory used by a process? PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ SWAP COMMAND 1604 dumrat 20 0 287m 62m 26m R 1 3.1 0:05.03 225m firefox-bin 1415 dumrat 9 -11 94264 4668 3552 S 0 0.2 0:00.10 87m pulseaudio
