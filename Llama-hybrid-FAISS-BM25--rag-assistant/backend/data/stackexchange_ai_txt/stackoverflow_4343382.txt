I really like the elegance of jsonpath, an equivalent to xpath, but for json. http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/ There you can do an expression like: var units_sold = jsonPath(tpsResports, '$.[*].personnel_info.productivity.units_sold'); // units_sold is array of found values... (I didn't double check my expression, it may be wrong for what you want in your example)
