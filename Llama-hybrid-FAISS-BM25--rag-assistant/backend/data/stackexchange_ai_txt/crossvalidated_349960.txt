Logistic Regression accuracy degrades with added features

I have a logistic model. As I add features, my accuracy degrades, even on the training set. I would imagine, since I am using cross-entropy loss, that adding even irrelevant features should improve the accuracy of the model, since it acts to drive the predicted probability of the true class higher. How is it that this can happen?
