Combine features with nonlinear responses

I am predicting values with 3 features with responses like this: A close to linear predictor A feature thats only predictive beyond a threshold A feature with non-linear response like this What machine learning algo would be suitable to combine these features to construct a composite predicative feature? I care more about predicting the extreme values and not so much about values around the mean for my dependent variable. Any suggestion will be appreciated.
