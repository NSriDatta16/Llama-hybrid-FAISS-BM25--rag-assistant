Reduce SQL Server table fragmentation without adding/dropping a clustered index?

I have a large database (90GB data, 70GB indexes) that's been slowly growing for the past year, and the growth/changes has caused a large amount of internal fragmentation not only of the indexes, but of the tables themselves. It's easy to resolve the (large number of) very fragmented indexes - a REORGANIZE or REBUILD will take care of that, depending on how fragmented they are - but the only advice I can find on cleaning up actual table fragmentation is to add a clustered index to the table. I'd immediately drop it afterwards, as I don't want a clustered index on the table going forward, but is there another method of doing this without the clustered index? A "DBCC" command that will do this? Thanks for your help.
