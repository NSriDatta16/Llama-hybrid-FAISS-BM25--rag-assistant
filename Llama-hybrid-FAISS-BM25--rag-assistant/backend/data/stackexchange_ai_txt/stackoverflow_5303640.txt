There aren't really any other GUIs for developing SSIS packages interactively. You have software from Pragmatic Works that integrates with SSIS adding template and reusability, but it's still SSIS in the core. You can also develop SSIS packages programatically using C# - but these packages probably won't work well opened in SSIS - as they just have the control/data flow definitions and then saved to dtsx. See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mattm/archive/2008/12/30/samples-for-creating-ssis-packages-programmatically.aspx for SSIS Programatically, and http://pragmaticworks.com/Products/ for Pragmatic Works possibilities.
