Parent node receives unwanted mouseout from child nodes

I have the following divs: item 1 item 2 I'm attaching event handlers to the #scrollable div - mouseover , mousedown , mouseup in order to implement a scrolling effect with the mouse dragging the div. The problem is that I get mouseout for the #scrollable div whenever the mouse moves between the two divs while remaining inside the div. So the mouse is inside the @scrollable div but just move from item1 to item2 - and this breaks my dragging. Is there a way to circumvent this behavior ?
