Using a linear autoencoder instead of PCA could also be useful in a large-scale learning scenario. Since you can use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the AE, there is no neeed to load all the training samples in the main memory at once, which can be problematic with large-scale problems. The linear AE may also come handy in online-learning scenarios, where the training examples arrive over time, as this could be easily handled with SGD. Another option would be using an Incremental version of PCA (e.g., that of Scikit-learn): http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_incremental_pca.html
