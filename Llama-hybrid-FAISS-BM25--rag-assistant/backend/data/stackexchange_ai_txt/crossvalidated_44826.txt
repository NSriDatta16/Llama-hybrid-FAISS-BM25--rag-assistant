Well, I answered my own question. Running demo(ROCR) shows the code required to make the plot, but it's a little difficult to scrape out and parse. I made a function for single-run, binary classifiers: density_plot I'm curious to see if there's a more elegant solution, that perhaps supports multiple-runs (like the rest of the functions in ROCR )
