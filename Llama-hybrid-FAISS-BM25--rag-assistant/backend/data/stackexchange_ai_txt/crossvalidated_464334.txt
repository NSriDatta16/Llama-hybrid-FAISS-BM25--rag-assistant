Analyzing the effect of terms on the continuation of an on-line discussion

The Data I am analyzing approximately 200 million online "threaded" posts (think USENET NEWS, Google Groups, Reddit, etc.). The posts have a tree structure like so: +-B---E +-J | | A-+-C---F---H-+-K---L | +-D---G---I Where B , C , and D are replies to A , J and K are replies to H , etc. I have created a data set that considers each post as a member of one linear "thread" of one conversation. For example, post H has 3 parent posts [ F , C , A ], and three child posts [ J , 'K , L`]. The number of parents is the post's depth. Therefore my data table looks like this: +----+-------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+ | | | | | | | any >= current | | id | depth | had | num of | this had | parent had | post had | | | |children | children | search term | search term | had search term | +----+-------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+ | A | 0 | 1 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | B | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | C | 1 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | D | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | E | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | F | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 1 | | G | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | H | 3 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | | I | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | J | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | K | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | | L | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | +----+-------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+ Where depth is the number of parent posts, had children is 1 if the post had any children, 0 if not, num of children is the number of children (when this is 0, had children is 0, otherwise 1), this had search therm is 1 if one or more occurrences of the search term were found in the post, 0 otherwise, parent had search term is the same but for the directly proceeding parent if any, and any >= current... is 1 if the current post or any parent post had the search term. Note 1: I am doing this for approximately 150 terms or groups of terms, but am asking for advice on any one single search. The Objective I would like to know if the presence of a term (or set of terms) has a statistically significant effect on the presence of children (does it increase the probability of the conversation continuing or decrease it?). Note 2: With roughly 200M posts I am analyzing only the first 115 depths which, given the data set, all have a minimum of 100 posts with and 100 without the search term so that N for each depth is at least 200. Methods For each depth, I treat the mean value for had children as the probability that a post at the given depth would have children. I do this per depth because the probability of children changes non-linearly with depth 1 . I compare the mean had children for posts with the search term to the mean had children of posts without; however, the presence or absence of the search term in the parent seems to also potentially influence outcomes. To do this, I do a simple mean comparison at each (using python's scipy.stats.ttest_ind() and a Bonferroni corrected confidence value for 0.99 2 ) For plotting, I am plotting depth on the x-axis and % seen on the y-axis and corresponding +/- standard error or the mean (inner shading) and the confidence interval for 0.999: Questions Does this approach seem sound for determining if the presence or absence of some search terms (e.g., vulgar/insulting vs. laudative/encouraging) have a statistically significant effect on the continuation of a discussion? If no, what are your concerns or suggestions? Is it necessary to identify and regress out confounders (e.g., the depth effect or the 2-person-conversation-effect [see footnote 2) for this to be meaningful? What other considerations do you think are important? Footnotes 1 The probability of children (both presence and number) for any post goes down from depths 0 to 1, then goes up for all data sets I have. It appears that this is almost exclusively due to two posters continuing a discussion. See figure: 2 I chose the ultra-strict Bonferroni correction because for the terms I am most interested in, the significance seems to survive given the sample size. I will probably relax it a bit for some less polarizing terms.
