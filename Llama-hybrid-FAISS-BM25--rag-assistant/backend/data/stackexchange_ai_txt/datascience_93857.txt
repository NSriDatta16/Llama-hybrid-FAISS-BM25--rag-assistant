How Many Features Are Used in Random Forest When max_features is not an integer?

In the RandomForestClassifier function in sklearn.ensemble , one of the parameters is max_features , which controls the size of the random subset of features that are considered at each node splitting. I would think this needs to be an integer, since of course the size of a subset needs to be an integer. But one of the options here is "log2" , which sets max_features to log_2(n_features) . I was wondering how that works, considering log_2(n_features) will not be an integer unless n_features is a power of 2. Thanks.
