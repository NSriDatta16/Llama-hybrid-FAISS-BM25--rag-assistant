WPF: Drag and drop virtual files into Windows explorer

I'm developing an application similar to dropbox and i show the remote files on a WPF listview. I want to drag those elements and drop it into windows explorer. I've seen code like this: var dataObject = new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, files.ToArray()); dataObject.SetData(DataFormats.StringFormat, dataObject); DoDragDrop(dataObject, DragDropEffects.Copy); But as you may think, those file are not at the local system yet, before copiying them I need to connect to server, donwload and unzip the files. Like a ftp client does. I dont how to do it but i was wondering if there is any "drop" event or similiar that i can handle. Thanks!
