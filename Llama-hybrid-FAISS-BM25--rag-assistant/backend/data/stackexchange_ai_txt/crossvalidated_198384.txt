There's this useful blog post by Hyndman, which talks in detail about different specifications of ARIMAX and similar time series. He's somewhat biased, in my opinion, but has a point. I find it useful to think in terms of the long run averages. Consider a simple AR(1) model: $$y_t=c+\phi y_{t-1}+e_t$$ The long run average is well known: $$E[y_t]=\frac{c}{1-\phi}$$ Similarly, for ARX(1) model with one exogenous variable you get: $$y_t=c+\phi y_{t-1}+\beta x_t + e_t$$ $$E[y_t]=\frac{c+\beta E[x_t]}{1-\phi}$$ So, one way to look at this is to say that $\beta$ of your exogenous variable impacts the long run average.
