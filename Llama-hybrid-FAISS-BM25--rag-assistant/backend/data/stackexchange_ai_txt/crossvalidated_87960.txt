If you have both IVs in your model then 1) You are testing which has the higher odds ratio after controlling for the other one 2) Your two IVs may be colinear and 3) Your data may be dependent. If, instead, you test the two IV's separately (still in logistic regression) then you are seeing which has the higher odds ratio on its own. However, "better predictor" is a bit ambiguous. Do you mean "if we choose the best cutoff for (score 1 or score 2) how well does it predict success?"
