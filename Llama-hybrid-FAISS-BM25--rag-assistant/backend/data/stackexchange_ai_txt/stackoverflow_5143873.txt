Dismissing the keyboard in a UIScrollView

Alright, I have a couple of UITextFields and UITextViews inside a UIScrollView , and I'd like to set the keyboard to disappear whenever the scrollview is touched or scrolled (except when you touch down inside the text field/view, of course). My current attempt at doing this is replacing the UIScrollView with a subclass, and setting it to call a removeKeyboard function (defined inside the main view controller) inside the touchesBegan method. However, this only removes the keyboard for a normal touch, not when the view is simply scrolled. So, what's the best way to remove the keyboard inside a UIScrollView ? Thanks in advance for your help.
