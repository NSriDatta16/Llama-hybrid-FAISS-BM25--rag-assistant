Expected remaining life with constant probability of death

In a famouse paper by Olivier Blanchard ("Debt, Deficits, and Finite Horizons" The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 93, No. 2. (Apr., 1985), pp. 223-247.) he claims the following: "If the probability of death is constant, the expected remaining life for an agent of any given age is given by $ \int_0^\infty t p e^{-pt} dt = p^{-1}$ " However, he doesn't give the justification why he used this formula. I am trying to derive why it is so but cannot build a model that will result in such an integral. I guess he must be using some kind of discounting with continuous compounding because of the term $p e^{-pt}$ but cannot figure it out. Can anybody explain why the expected remaining life with constant probability of death $p$ results in such an integral? P.S. Integration and the result is correct. I am interested in where did this integral come from?
