You question is unclear. If you want to estimate a new total percent by including the additinal data you are getting you must have quantity associated with your percentage so that you can create a meaninful weighted average. If you want to determine if the new set of data has a different distribution than the historical data there are several tests mostly doing obtuse calculations on cummulative actual vs. expected percentages of values falling underneath a particular value. There is a lot of literature on the subject on comparing the distributions of two populations. For paired samples Wilcoxon-Rank is a standard method if you can make no assumptions about the distribuion of the data. For non paired data non-parametric statistics exist but they require some in depth study.
