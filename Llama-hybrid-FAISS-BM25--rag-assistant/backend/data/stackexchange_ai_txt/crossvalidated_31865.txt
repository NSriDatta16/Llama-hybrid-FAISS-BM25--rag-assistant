As @MichaelChernick says, there is probably no good answer to reliably estimate the user's loyalty, for users who have not used any service very often. (Arguably it would be reasonable to classify those users as not very loyal. You might decide that a user must use your service a minimum number of times before you're prepared to consider them a loyal user.) One approach to dealing with these issues might be to use a Bayesian method. Compute the average loyalty, across all users. For a user who has no uses, the average loyalty is your best estimate. As the number of uses increases, your estimate should start to move in the direction of your $L(A)$ value. In particular, the following might be a reasonable estimate: $$L_\text{est}(A) = \frac{n}{n+n^*} L(A) + \frac{n^*}{n+n^*} L^*(A), $$ where $n=N(A)+N(B)$ is the number of times this user has used a service, $n^*$ is the average value of $n$ across all users, $L(A)=N(A)/(N(A)+N(B))$ is your naive (uncorrected) loyalty ratio for this user, and $L^*(A)$ is the average value of $L(A)$ across all users. If you know something about the characteristics of the user, and you think these characteristics will have a significant effect on user loyalty, you could perhaps take the average over all other users who are similar to this user, rather than over all users.
