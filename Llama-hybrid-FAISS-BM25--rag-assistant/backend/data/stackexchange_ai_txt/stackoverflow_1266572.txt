From the first paragraph of the Description section: Each programmer will, of course, have his or her own preferences in regards to formatting, but there are some general guidelines that will make your programs easier to read, understand, and maintain. And from the third paragraph of the Description section: Regarding aesthetics of code lay out, about the only thing Larry cares strongly about is that the closing curly bracket of a multi-line BLOCK should line up with the keyword that started the construct. Beyond that, he has other preferences that aren't so strong: It's just a convention among Perl programmers for style. If you don't like it, you can choose to ignore it. I would compare it to Sun's Java Style guidelines or the suggestions for indenting in the K&R C book . Some environments have their own guidelines. These just happen to be the suggestions for Perl. As Jon Skeet said in a deleted answer to this question: If you're happy to be inconsistent with what some other people like, then just write in the most readable form for you. If you're likely to be sharing your code with others - and particularly if they'll be contributing code too - then it's worth trying to agree some consistent style.
