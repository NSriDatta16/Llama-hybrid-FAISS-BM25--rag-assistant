If you have similar content in various languages, you can build similar-looking page trees in each language, differentiated only by the "language" string in the URL. You can put language-specific links on your pages linking to the "sibling" page of each page in each other language. So it's an organizational aid for you and it's also nice for sophisticated users who can then choose to go to the site in their favorite language. Beyond that, it's just a naming convention. You can go with it or not, as you prefer.
