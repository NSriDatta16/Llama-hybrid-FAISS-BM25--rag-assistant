If you really need to do object oriented programming in Clojure there are a couple of ways to do so. The first way is to use the deftype , defrecord and defprotocol family of macros. The second way is to use multimethods, combined with a map or record type for data storage. The third way is to use the universal design pattern as outlined by Steve Yegge , or a more Clojure specific introduction can be found in Chris Houser and Michael Fogus' book The Joy of Clojure . The third approach is very similar to what you would expect to see in JavaScript, and the first approach, while not thought of as OOP in a traditional sense, is the most common in "modern" idiomatic Clojure.
