A really introductory book is Will Kurt's Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way . This approaches the logic of Bayesian statistics at a very high level - going through the basics of probability, and how prior information can combine with data to affect posterior probabilities. As an ecologist who didn't have a robust statistical training in gradschool, I still get bogged down by equations. I found Gelman's book way too difficult for my beginner level, but Will's book is finally helping me wrap my mind around the basic concepts. It has fun, practical examples that would have been a nice per-requisite to read before my grad program. I plan to work my way through John Kruschke's "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" as a next stepping stone.
