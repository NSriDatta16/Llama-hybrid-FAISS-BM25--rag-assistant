Greg is actually not entirely correct. When you go to a category within the Magento admin, then click on the products tab for that category, you'll see a listing of all the products, and there will be a "Position" column where you can enter in numbers for ordering. On the frontend, you'll see that there is a "Position" sort order option. That's what this is for. There is no "Bestseller" ordering.
