Part of the uiview doesn't call touchesBegan for view on top of uisplitview

I'm writting an ipad app with a uisplitview. Once a user taps on a button, I display another view in full screen by removing the uisplitview from the stack and pushing the new view. The problem I have is that the new uiview only gets touchesBegan for 3/4 of the screen. It seems like that is the same area used up for the uidetailview in the uisplitview. I've been trying to figure this out for a few days with no luck. the uisplitview gets synthesized and it gets added in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions like this: [window addSubview:splitViewController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; then, when the user touches a button, I do this: NewViewController *newViewController = [NewViewController alloc]; UINavigationController *navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:newViewController]; navController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFullScreen; navController.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical; [self.navigationController presentModalViewController:navController animated:YES]; [newViewController release]; [navController release];
