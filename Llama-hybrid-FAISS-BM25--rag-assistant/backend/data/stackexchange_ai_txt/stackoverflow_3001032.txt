PHP 2d array question

So i have a 2 dimensional array that is used over several pages (session) $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [0] = $filename; $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [1] = $size; $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [2] = $floor; $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [3] = $phone; $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [4] = $network; $_SESSION ["Table"][$_SESSION ["count"]] [5] = $totalprice; This is used with a form so i can give in multiple input wich gets stored. But my question is how exactly can i calculate the AVERAGE of $total price of all given in results? Meaning for example i have 5 rows so this would mean 5 total prices. How exactly can i acces this value and count everything up / 5? This will happen in a other page so i would like to use sessions for this. /5 simply by count($_Session["table"]) , but really not sure about the other values. Kind Regards.
