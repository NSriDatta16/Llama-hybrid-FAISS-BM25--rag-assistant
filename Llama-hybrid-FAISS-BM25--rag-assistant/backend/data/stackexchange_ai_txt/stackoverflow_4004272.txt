Inertness how to go around base constructor

Let's say I have a father and son who should be both non abstract and i wont to go around the father c'tor what I have done is this : public class D { public D(int x) { } public D() { Console.WriteLine("D:constructor"); } } public class E:D { public E() : base(1) { Console.WriteLine("E:constructor"); } } Is there another way more elegant to go around the father constructor ? EDIT: this is just a sample I do have a reason for the inertness is at a god practice or just cause the c'tor is different i should build another design?
