Does PCA preserve observations (rows) of the data?

Say I have a data matrix of size $N \times P$ where $N$ is the number of samples and $P$ is the number of features. Now, if I do principal component analysis, I get another data matrix of size $N \times K$ where $K$ was chosen according to some criteria. My question: if I pick a row (sample) from the $\text{PCA}$ matrix, does it still point to the same sample as in the original data matrix? In my study the data on each row is from one subject, so I want to know if the correspondence still exists if I use $\text{PCA}$ for feature selection. (I think this is correct but better safe than sorry...!)
