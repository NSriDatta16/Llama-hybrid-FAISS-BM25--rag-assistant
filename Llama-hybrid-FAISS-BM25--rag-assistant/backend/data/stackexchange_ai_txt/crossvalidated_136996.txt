It isn't really possible to turn ordinal data into normally distributed data. However, PCA typically decomposes the correlation matrix (you can also decompose the covariance matrix, but this is less common). So you can create your own correlation matrix by using Pearson product-moment correlations between the continuous variables, and other types of correlations, as appropriate, between the ordinal variables. Two possibilities might be Spearman's rank correlation , or the polychoric correlation , if you believe that your ordinal data come from a categorization of an underlying normal distribution. As far as the interpretation of your PCA goes, I don't see any immediate issues. There wouldn't be any need for back-transformation, for example. PCA will give you a set of eigenvectors that tell you how your original variables are related to the principal components (your new variables), and a set of eigenvalues that tells you how much your data spread out along each of the new variables / how elongated (as opposed to spherical) your data cloud is. To understand PCA better, it may help you to read this excellent CV thread: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues .
