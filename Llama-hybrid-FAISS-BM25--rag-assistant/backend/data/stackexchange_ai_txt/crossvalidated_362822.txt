So this does not go unanswered here, based on comments from @GGA and from the OP's further research, are some references which the OP edited into the question as an update. Upon feedback from GGA and extensive search, we can mention as potentially suitable approaches: a Bayesian method proposed by Menten and Lesaffre to conduct a Bayesian network meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies (Menten and Lesaffre, BMC Med Res Methodol 2015), and two different Bayesian methods proposed by Nyaga et al (Nyaga et al, Stat Methods Med Res 2016; Nyaga et al, Stat Methods Med Res 2016).
