What is the difference in what AIC and c-statistic (AUC) actually measure for model fit?

Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the c-statistic (area under ROC curve) are two measures of model fit for logistic regression. I am having trouble explaining what is going on when the results of the two measures are not consistent. I guess they are measuring slightly different aspects of model fit, but what are those specific aspects? I have 3 logistic regressions models. Model M0 has some standard covariates. Model M1 adds X1 to M0; model M2 adds X2 to M0 (so M1 and M2 are not nested). The difference in AIC from M0 to both M1 and M2 is about 15, indicating X1 and X2 both improve model fit, and by about the same amount. c-statistics are: M0, 0.70; M1, 0.73; M2 0.72. The difference in c-statistic from M0 to M1 is significant (method of DeLong et al 1988), but the difference from M0 to M2 is not significant, indicating that X1 improves model fit, but X2 does not. X1 is not routinely collected. X2 is supposed to be routinely collected but is missing in about 40% of cases. We want to decide whether to start collecting X1, or improve collection of X2, or drop both variables. From AIC we conclude that the variables make similar improvement to the model. It's probably easier to improve collection of X2 than start collecting a completely new variable (X1), so we would aim to improve X2 collection. But from c-statistic, X1 improves the model and X2 does not, so we should forget about X2 and start collecting X1. As our recommendation depends on which statistic we focus on, we need to clearly understand the difference in what they are measuring. Any advice welcome.
