How to get Code Coverage working on a VS 2010 project?

When I turn on Code Coverage in my test settings, on a project that references the Unity DI container I get the following error: Cannot initialize the ASP.NET project '{Project Name}'. The event log specifies the following reason: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Practices.Unity, Version=2.0.414.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. Strong name signature could not be verified. How do I get around this issue? I am running Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate on a Windows 7 X64 machine.
