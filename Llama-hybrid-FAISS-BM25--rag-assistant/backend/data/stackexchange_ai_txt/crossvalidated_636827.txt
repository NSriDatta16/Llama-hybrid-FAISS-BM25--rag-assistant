I don't see any way that you can calculate heterogeneity or bias; I'm not sure this even really qualifies as "meta-analysis". You don't have any effect size measures to combine. And I'm not sure whether it is a good idea to average across different studies. And, as I understand it, "publication bias" is when studies that are statistically significant are more likely to be published than those that are not. But it seems like the studies you are combining are purely descriptive and, therefore, this doesn't arise. If you have (or can get) the raw data, why not just do a regression where locomotor behavior is the dependent variable and location (wild vs. zoo) is the independent variable? Failing that, you might just call it a quantitative review and look, informally, at each study and its results, and calculate descriptive statistics and make some graphs.
