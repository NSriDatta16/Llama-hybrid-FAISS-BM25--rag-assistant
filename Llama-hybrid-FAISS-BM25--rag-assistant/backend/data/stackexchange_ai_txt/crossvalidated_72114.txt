The answers of jbowman and Glen_b already cover the whole story. Conclusion from t-test: Your tree provides predictions that are not systematically biased. This is nice to have but not sufficient to make your tree a good model (see jbowman's example). A t-test is about averages, not about individual values. Conclusion from negative R-squared: Predictions from the tree are typically worse than simply using the average response as prediction. Thus, the tree is a very bad predictor.
