What comes first: outlier detection or model selection?

I'm fitting a GLMM (mixed logistic regression) in R. I have five covariates. For model selection, I'm using glmmLasso() (in R) to determine which of the five covariates and their interactions should be put in the model. Should outlier detection be done before or after model selection? What techniques would you recommend for outlier detection?
