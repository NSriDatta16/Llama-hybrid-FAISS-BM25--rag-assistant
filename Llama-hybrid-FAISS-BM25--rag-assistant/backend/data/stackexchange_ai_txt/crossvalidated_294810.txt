You haven't fully specified the regression model in question, but I suppose you'd use a logistic-regression model of the form $\operatorname{logit} P(Y = 1) = β_0 + β_1X$, where $Y$ is Within Timeline and $X$ is the timeline duration in days. Then you would be concerned mostly about $β_1$, and the null hypothesis that $β_1 = 0$ could be interpreted as: the duration of a lead's timeline is unrelated to the probability of the lead opening an account within that timeline. The alternative hypothesis is that there is some nonzero (but still, possibly, arbitrarily small) association between these variables. I should add that logistic regression, and dummy-coding the outcome, seems rather coarse for your purpose. You want to know how the timeline duration relates to the actual time it took for the lead to open an account. So it would probably be more informative not to dummy-code, and use a model that allows you to predict a lead's actual time based on their timeline duration. For example, you could try linear regression with the logarithm of the outcome variable.
