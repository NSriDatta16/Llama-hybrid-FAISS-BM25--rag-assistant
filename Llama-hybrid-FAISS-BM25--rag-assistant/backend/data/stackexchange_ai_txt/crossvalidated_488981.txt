The real answer is because most people peddling machine learning are deceptive con artists. The curse of dimensionality precludes most complex regressions that have any sort of chaotic relationship, since you are trying to build a surface of best fit over an N-1 dimensional space. See Page 41 of David Kristjanson Duvenaud's PhD thesis. Tools like Facebook Prophet provide a great delusion to the user since they just ignore all mathematical verification and give users "what they want". Classification models are typically easier because the surface has more potential fits that yield meaningful separation in the data. Most regression fits are not "meaningful". It is likely when 2 people see the same thing, they are actually identifying it with different separation procedures in their "neural nets". You should think long and hard about your assumptions and try to poke holes in any failure you can imagine, because mathematical proofs are still few and far between in this protoscience. EDIT: I've wrote a fairly simple proof of why the SMOTE algorithm actually makes no sense. I would suggest it be immediately abandoned as a legitimate method in Machine Learning.
