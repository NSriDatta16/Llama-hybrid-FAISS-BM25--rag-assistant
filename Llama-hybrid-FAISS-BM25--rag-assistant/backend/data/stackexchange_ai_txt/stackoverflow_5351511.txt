If you have a less time consuming task and which requires user attention (because you can not access the status bar contents), then you should use dialog, ex, enter the login name and password etc. Drawbacks of dialog : You can not handle any configuration change, like orientation, language change etc. No way to maintain state, like can not navigate to another screen and come back Performance wise, only thing is dialog is created all the time Can not access full screen Won't be able to start it using any intent
