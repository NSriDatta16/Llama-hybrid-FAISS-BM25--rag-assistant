I would fit a linear regression model for the expected conversion rate in the four groups of users (treated new, treated returning, control new, and control returning) like this: $$E[Y \vert Returning, Treated] = \alpha +\gamma \cdot Returning + \beta \cdot Treated +\delta \cdot Returning \times Treated$$ with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors . This setup assumes that each observation is a distinct user. Binary $Y$ indicates that they converted during the test period. $Returning$ means that this user has some experience with the site/app from before the test starts. The effect of treatment for new users is $\beta$ . For returning users, it is $\beta + \delta$ . The null hypothesis that $\delta = 0$ is a test of primacy/novelty effects. Primacy usually means that $\delta . Novelty means that $\delta > 0$ . You could also use one-sided hypotheses here if you are interested in distinguishing between them. People balk at using a het-robust linear probability model (LPM) rather than a logit/probit, but in a fully saturated model with robust SEs, the estimates of the average marginal effects will be identical, but the effects are easier to interpret with the LPM. Interactions can get tricky in nonlinear models. Kohavi, Tang, and Xu (2020) has some nice practical references on novelty/primacy, though the book itself does not get as technical as what I wrote above.
