How to know when images in an html fragment have been loaded after jquery's .load()?

If I load an html fragment that contains images with jquery's .load() , the images aren't yet loaded when my callback is called. Since I need to do some calculations based on the dimensions of the images, I need to know when they've actually been loaded. Is there a nice way to do this?
