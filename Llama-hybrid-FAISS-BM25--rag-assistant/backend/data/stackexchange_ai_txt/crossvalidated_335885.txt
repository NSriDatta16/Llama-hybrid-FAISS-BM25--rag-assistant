How to build a Machine Learning Model for Forecasting under a constraint?

I have a Dataset of daily ATM demand, and i'll build a Machine Learning Model based on Neural network to generate the ATM's cash demand forecasting of the next month to know when we will have the next ATM replenishment. but the plus is that i want to generate this replenishment forecast under a constraint which is: Use all the replenishments per month exist in the policy signed by the bank with the money transportation company or the cash center, or minimizing the extras replenishments, if there is an over demand. I want to know if there is a solution for this Machine Learning problem? Thank youu
