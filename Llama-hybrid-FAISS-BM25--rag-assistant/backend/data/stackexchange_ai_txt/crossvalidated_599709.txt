Background The CAPM is a one-period model that states that each asset's expected return is positively linearly related to that asset's beta risk. The intercept term is the risk free rate and the coefficient on beta risk is the market risk premium. The market risk premium is the expected return on the market (all assets including stocks, property and bonds) minus the risk free rate. Tests of the model using data over multiple time periods must necessarily involve many compromises. Nevertheless, there have been many studies since the 1990's that show the CAPM failing badly. Hence the rise of factor models such as the Fama-French three-factor model. See the references in https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2224400 for examples. Turning to the specifics of your question, unfortunately you have not specified the regression equation you are estimating and the data used. Is it a time series study for a single asset or is it a cross-sectional study? I assume it has stock excess returns as the dependent variable. In this case, it is quite common to observe an insignificant coefficient on beta risk because expected stock returns are often found not to be significantly positively related to beta risk.
