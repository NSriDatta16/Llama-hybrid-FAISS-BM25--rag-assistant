Covariance of the means of $x_t$ and $y_t=(x_t-\bar{x})^2$

Given a sample of a real-valued time series, $x=\{x_t\}_{t=1,...,T}$ , let $\bar{x}$ be the sample mean of $x$ and set $y_t=(x_t-\bar{x})^2$ . Then, $\bar{y}$ estimates the variance of $x$ . Question: What is the covariance of $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ ? Can I simply take $\frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t=1}^T (x_t-\bar{x})(y_t-\bar{y})$ ? [ Note: I ignore the $\frac{1}{T-1}$ bias correction as it does not arise in MLE or GMM applications. ]
