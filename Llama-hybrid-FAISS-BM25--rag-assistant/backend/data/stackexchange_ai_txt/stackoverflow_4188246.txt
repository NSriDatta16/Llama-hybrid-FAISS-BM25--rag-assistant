It sounds like you're having trouble w/ the CSS for the options. If that's the case, try changing to the following style rule: .product-options dd select { width:auto; } That will make select boxes take only the minimum necessary space to display their options. Be aware that the previous rule ( width:99% ) is there for visual consistency so your options may look ragged this way. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
