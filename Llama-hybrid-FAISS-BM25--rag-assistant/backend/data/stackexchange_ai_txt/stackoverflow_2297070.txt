How can I set the language (and culture) used by the django template system in webapp?

I'm writing a Google App Engine application using the WebApp framework. I'd like the various django filters to use the user-agent requested language (and culture) and not the default (English). I'm mainly interested in timesince , timeuntil , and date . Side-question: how can I enable the filters provided by django.contrib.markup inside WebApp?
