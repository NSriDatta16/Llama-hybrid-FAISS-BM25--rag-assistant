Ambiguity about the confusion table: is it simply a calculation error or a technical consideration?

This table is the one from the paper entitled as: S. Wu, T. H. Falk, W. Y. Chan, ``Automatic speech emotion recognition using modulation spectral features", Speech Communication, vol. 53, no. 5, pp. 768-785, June 2011. For example in Table 2, for their algorithm namely MSF, the average percentage among 7 emotions is 79.9 but it is noted here as 81.3. Also, this case are happened for other results and tables which makes this paper hard to compare with other methods. As I want to cite this paper and compare it with our own algorithm's results for speech emotion recognition, we are in doubt to put the 79.9 or 81.3 in the table?
