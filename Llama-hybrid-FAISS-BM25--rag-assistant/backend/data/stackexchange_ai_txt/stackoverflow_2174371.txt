HABTM Relationships and the Join Table

I'm trying to connect the values of two join tables that I have and show the results based on a conditional relationship...and i'm having some problems I have a Users Model(:name, :password, :email), and Events model(:name, :etc) and Interests model (:name) I created about 5 records in each model. Then I created two join tables -> UsersInterests and EventsInterests; each not containing a primary key and only comprised of the user_id/interest_id and event_id/interest_id respectively. Then I added to the model files the HABTM Relationship users => has_and_belongs_to_many :interests events => has_and_belongs_to_many :interests interests => has_and_belongs_to_many :users has_and_belongs_to_many :events Now I wanted to create a controller that finds only the events where the users interests correspond with the events interests From working on this for a while I've figured that I need something in the area of @Events = Event.User.find([condition]) [condition] = where users.interest == event.interest or something like that... I'm kind of lost..How do you state the find condition?...I know how to do the inner join in sql but I'm looking for the elegant Rails way to do this... any tips guys?
