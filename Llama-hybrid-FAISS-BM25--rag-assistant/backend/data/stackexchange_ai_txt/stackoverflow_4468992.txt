How to monitor exceptions or errors generated by other Java applications?

I want to find or develop an application that can run as a daemon, notify the administrator by email or sms when the Java applications running on a host get any exceptions or errors. I know JVMTI can achieve part of my goal, but it will impact performance of the monitored applications(I don't know how much will it be, it will be acceptable if it's slight), besides it seems to be a troublesom job to develop a JVMTI agent and I'm not sure what would happen if several applications running at the same time using the same agent. Is there any better solutions? Thanks in advance.
