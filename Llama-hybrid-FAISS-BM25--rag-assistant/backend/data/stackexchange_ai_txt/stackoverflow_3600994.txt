You might consider creating a web application that connects to a database to do this. One nice thing about this is that you can separate you business and data layers, which is usually a good practice. You will also have one central location where information comes in through which should simplify your life. Once you have a clear separation between business rules and data storage you can do most of the equations you are talking about in C# (or your language of choice) and then store the end result in your SQL Server database (or your DB of choice).
