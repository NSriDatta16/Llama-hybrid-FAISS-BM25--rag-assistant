Modelling Data with Many Zeros - Principal Component Analysis vs Zero Inflated Models

I have a data set (many continuous predictors, single response variable that is also continuous) with many zeros. I first used PCA and found the results to be very helpful. I further thought that the PCA scores remedy the zero problem by assigning the many zero values with numbers - but then I thought perhaps these PCA scores may not be relevant since they are based on a data set containing many zeros. PCA scores are orthogonal, they condense the data by many variables and also remove problems such as co linearity - but is it better to try some form of Poisson Regression or Zero Inflated Models?
