You're on the right track. For $0\le a \le 1,$ let $p(a)$ be the chance of losing when it's your turn and $a$ is the largest value drawn so far. In order to lose (a) you have to draw a number $x$ between $0$ and $a$ , making certain your chances of losing, or (b) you draw $x \ge a$ then your opponent, faced with the new value $x,$ must win, which she does with probability $1 - p(x).$ We have to average these possibilities over all the possible values of $x,$ giving the recursion $$p(a) = \int_0^a \mathrm{d}x + \int_a^1 (1-p(x))\,\mathrm{d}x = 1 - \int_a^1 p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x.\tag{*}$$ At the outset, $a=0,$ it's your turn, and therefore you want to find the chance of winning, which is $1-p(0).$ Let $P(a) = \int_a^1 p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x.$ This is a differentiable function with derivative $P^\prime(a) = -p(a).$ In these terms $(*)$ becomes $$-P^\prime(a) = 1-P(a).$$ Since $p(a)\lt 1$ for most $a,$ $P(a) \lt 1$ for all $a,$ allowing us to divide both sides by $1-P(a),$ giving $$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x} \log(1-P(a)) = \frac{-P^\prime(a)}{1-P(a)} = 1.$$ Integrating both sides and using $P(1)=0$ gives the unique solution $P(a) = 1 - \exp(a-1).$ Taking the derivative yields $$p(a) = -P^\prime(a) = e^{a-1}.$$ The solution therefore is $1-p(0) = 1-e^{-1} \approx 0.632.$
