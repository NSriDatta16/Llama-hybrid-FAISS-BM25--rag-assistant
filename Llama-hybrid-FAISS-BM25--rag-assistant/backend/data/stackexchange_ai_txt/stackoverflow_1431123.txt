Naming and organizing images

What's the general rule of thumb while naming dynamic / user-uploaded images. For instance, profile pictures. Is there a benefit for filenames to be human-readable (joshmason_profile.jpg) and not something random (sjdir2311.jpg)? And how do you organize them? All in a single folder with filenames in database? or dynamically generated folders (say one for each user)?
