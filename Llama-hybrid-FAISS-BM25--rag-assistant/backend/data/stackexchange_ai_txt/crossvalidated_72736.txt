As you say, the data is not stationary, we can find the stationary transformed data by differencing, and checked by the unit root test (e.g Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Elliott-Rothenberg-Stock test, KPSS test, Phillips-Perron test, Schmidt-Phillips test, Zivot-Andrews test...) We can talk about ARMA model only after confirming the stationarity. It is a classical way to identify the ARMA(p, q) by the ACF plot and PACF plot. ARMA(0,1) and ARMA(0,0) can be told here. Another method to identify p, q is about the EACF, but it is not widely used for univariate time series. Empirical studies show that AIC usually tends to overfitting. The advantage of using AIC is for automatic algorithm to find the best model, but it is not usually recommended in traditional time series textbook.
