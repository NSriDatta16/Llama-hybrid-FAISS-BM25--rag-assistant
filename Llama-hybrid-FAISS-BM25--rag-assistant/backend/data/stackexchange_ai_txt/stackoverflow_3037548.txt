The app needs to be compiled with the correct GCC flags which will insert the profiling instructions into the code. It isn't something you can turn on and off. ie your code is modified at compile time to output the coverage info. So, if you compiled the app with the correct flags it will emit coverage data, if you didn't, it won't (and you certainly wouldn't want it to for an app you were going to distribute).
