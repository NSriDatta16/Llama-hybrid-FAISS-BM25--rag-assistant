First of all I would clarify where exactly you make the distinction between machines learning and hazard models. From my understanding the ml literature distinguishes between parametric and non-parametric models (among others). And second, what do you need the model for? Is it for scientific research or something else? In any event choosing the appropriate model to describe you data is first of all depended on what you need the model for. To your question: It depends on how much you know about the data generating process. If for example you take the famous coin flip or die roll, you have a very good idea about the process that generates the expected outcome of an experiment. In that case you really want to use a parametric (bayesian or frequentist) estimation because they will give you a very good estimation of the unknown parameter. Furthermore these models are very well understood, which has many advantages. If you don't know the data generating process, or you are uncertain of it, you don't have much of a choice, will need to estimate the parameters that describe the data from the data itself. If you decide for such an approach, you must accept that these models have drawbacks (depending on the specific model etc.) From my understanding the less you know about a process, the more you will need to estimate from the data itself, which will certainly come at price.
