PHP multiuser login class or script

I am looking for a simple but secure login script with mySQL PHP: sessions, MD5 that I can use with my exsisting database. Cookies to store password + password recovery by email. Change login/pass. I do not need registering, I register the user myself with temp login/pass. table agents agent1 agent2 table albums album1, owner: agent1 album2, owner: agent1 album3, owner: agent2 ... login.php agent1 logs in and has access to his albums: - album1 - album2 agent1 can edit his albums: edit.php?ref=album1 but NOT edit.php?ref=album3 by changing the ?ref variable
