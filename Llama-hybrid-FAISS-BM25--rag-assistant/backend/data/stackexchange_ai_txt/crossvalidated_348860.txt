Performance required for histology data?

The question is as follows: How accurate does computer vision be for it to be practically useful for analyzing histology images? Reason I'm asking because I have seen hundreds of papers like Hierarchical Approach for Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Classification . They are all quite similar in that they propose a novel adaptation to an existing machine learning technique (such as deep learning) and get "very good" results. Abstract of the linked article claims 95% accuracy on the validation data. But what accuracy (wrt detection and classification) is good enough for histology? I'm not asking about cv in general, only about cv as applied to medical image analysis. What is required for it to replace human image analysis?
