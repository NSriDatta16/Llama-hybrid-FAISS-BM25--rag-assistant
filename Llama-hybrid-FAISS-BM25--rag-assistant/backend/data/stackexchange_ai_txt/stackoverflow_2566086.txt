Don't use regex to parse HTML. PHP provides DOMDocument that can be used for this purpose. Having said that you have some errors in your regular expression: You need parentheses around the alternation. You need lazy modifiers. You can't type 'header' to match 'Information'. With these changes it would look like this: .*? \n\t+ .*?( | ) Your regular expression is also very fragile. For example, if the input contains spaces instead of tabs or the line ending is Windows-style, your regular expression will fail. Using a proper HTML parser will give a much more robust solution.
