This kind of problem can be handled using Bayesian analysis, but it requires a bit of care. The tricky bit here is that there is a distinction between the conditioning event "ate leafy greens" and the other conditioning event "information showing that eating leafy greens causes green poo". You already know you ate leafy greens in both scenarios, so that conditioning event is not what is changing your probability. Rather, it is the additional information you have obtained from your internet search that is telling you that leafy greens cause green poo, and therefore lead you to reduce your inferred probability of disease. To simplify this analysis, I will assume that the only relevant conditioning event from the previous day is that you ate leafy greens (i.e., the event "ate leafy greens" will be equivalent to "everything I did yesterday). This removes explicit conditioning on the remainder of what happened that day. I will use the following events: $$\begin{align} \mathcal{D} & & & \text{Disease}, \\[6pt] \mathcal{G} & & & \text{Green poop}, \\[6pt] \mathcal{L} & & & \text{Ate leafy greens}, \\[6pt] \mathcal{I} & & & \text{Information showing that } \mathcal{L} \text{ causes } \mathcal{G}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ The circumstance you are describing is that $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{G} \cap \mathcal{L})$ is high but $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{G} \cap \mathcal{L} \cap \mathcal{I}) $ is low (i.e., the addition of the new information lowers the probability that you have a disease). There are many reasonable ways that you could be led to this outcome, but a general structure would look like the DAG below. Disease can cause green poo, but it can also be cauesd by eating leafy greens. (The joint path for the latter depends on the fact that the causal pathway from leafy greens to green poo is not known unless you obtain the information to that effect.) In this case, the effect of gaining the information that relates eating leafy greens with green poo is that it "opens the pathway" at the bottom of the DAG, and thereby provides an alternative reason to believe that green poo could occur in the absence of a disease. This leads you to lower the conditional probability of disease accordingly. It would be possible to formalise this analysis further by giving some appropriate probability values to the various events of interest, but I will not pursue that level of detail. Hopefully this structural discussion assists you in understanding the nature of the inference you are making. Suffice to say, your reduction in the inferred probability of disease is a sensible conclusion from the additional conditioning information you obtained.
