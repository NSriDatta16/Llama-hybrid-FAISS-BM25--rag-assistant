Natural language processing to recognise numerical data

My requirement is to recognize and extract numerical data from a natural language sentence (English only) in response to queries. Platform is Java. For example if the user query is "What is the height of mount Everest" and we have a paragraph as: In 1856, the Great Trigonometric Survey of British India established the first published height of Everest, then known as Peak XV, at 29,002 ft (8,840 m). In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon recommendation of Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India at the time, who named it after his predecessor in the post, and former chief, Sir George Everest.[4] Chomolungma had been in common use by Tibetans for centuries, but Waugh was unable to propose an established local name because Nepal and Tibet were closed to foreigners. (Pasted from wikipedia) For a user query "Height of mount Everest" from the paragraph I need to get 29002 ft or 8840 m as the answer. Can anyone please suggest any possible ways of doing it in Java? Are there any open source libraries for the same?
