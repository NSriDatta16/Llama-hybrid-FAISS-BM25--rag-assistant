This is all about dependencies. I was able to get this working by adding server control project to the solution. Building the server control project. Then adding a dependency on the server control project to the web project. Next, I built everything again then right-clicked in the ToolBox and chose "select items" , pointed it to the "/bin/debug/servercontrol.dll." Finally, I dragged the new toolbox item out. I am sure that one or more of these steps in unnecessary, but it got everything working together.
