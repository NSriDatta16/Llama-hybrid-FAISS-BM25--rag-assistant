Early Django Admin Logout

I'm working on a Django 1.2.3 project, and I'm finding that the admin session seems to timeout extremely early, after about a minute after logging in, even while I'm using it. Initially, I had these settings: SESSION_COOKIE_AGE=1800 SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE=True I thought the problem might be my session storage was mis-configured, so I tried configuring my session to be stored in local memory by adding: SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache" CACHE_BACKEND = 'locmem://' However, the problem still occurs. Is there something else that would cause admin sessions to timeout early even when the user is active?
