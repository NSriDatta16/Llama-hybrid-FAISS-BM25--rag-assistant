I couldn't find any direct way to solve this, so here is what I have ended up with: I placed a grid on top of the FlowDocumentReader. This grid has a sold color, opacity of 0 (transparent) and Visibility=Collapsed. The purpose of this grid is to serve as a drop target. When FlowDocument within the FlowDocumentReader received the DragEnter event, I switch the grid's visibility to Visible. The grid starts receiving drag events and the cursor stays in the "drop here" form. When grid receives Drop or DragLeave events, its visibility is turned back to Collapsed to allow the FlowDocument receive mouse events
