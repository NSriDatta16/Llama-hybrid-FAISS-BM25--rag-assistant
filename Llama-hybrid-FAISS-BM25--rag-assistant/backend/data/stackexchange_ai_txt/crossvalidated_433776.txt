When you include a random intercept in the model you say that there is variability in the value of the outcome at baseline between individual patients , you do not say something about the average of the outcome in different groups of patients. That is, it can well be that because of randomization the three arms have the same average at baseline, but still, individual patients vary around this average. If you would have no variability at baseline, it would implicitly mean that all patients have exactly the same value at baseline.
