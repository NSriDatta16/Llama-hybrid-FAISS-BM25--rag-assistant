My suggestion is not a tool, but a best practice: testing. Such bugs are usually very easy to find with rigorous testing of the code, beginning at the lowest-level of unit testing. The code you show would never produce the correct result - it's not something that sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. Having a unit test for that piece of code can save hours of debugging later when it's integrated with other parts of the system. Unit testing can be supplemented by coverage checking: either using an automatic tool, or just manually scanning the code and writing tests that target each part - this is actually a great way to re-read your code (another debugging tool) and is surprisingly effective.
