You were asking about embedded FTP server in another question . There are instructions for embedded usage. When embedding, you do not need any configuration files, you can use API to give server all the required information. You do not need to know Spring configuration (unless you use Spring framework elsewhere in your project). The ftp library should take care of configuration automatically.
