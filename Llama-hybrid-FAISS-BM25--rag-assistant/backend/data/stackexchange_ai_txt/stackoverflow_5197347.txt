I think you're reinventing the wheel a bit. Oracle allows as fine a granularity of record access as any RDBMS, and more than you probably need. Why aren't you using that power to lay out data privileges? Anyway, for the CRUD operations, yes, you can override NHibernate's default SQL generation by specifying a stored procedure for the Insert, Update and Delete operations. Querying MUST be on NH's terms; you're bypassing 90% of NHibernate's power by forcing lazy-loading of every field and child of an object through calling a retrieval stored proc. So, you'll need to at least rework your security to allow SELECT permissions for authenticated users on schemas/tables as necessary.
