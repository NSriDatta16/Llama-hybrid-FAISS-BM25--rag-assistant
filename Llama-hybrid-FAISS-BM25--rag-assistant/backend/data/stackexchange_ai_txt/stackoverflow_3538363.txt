The problem here is that you're creating the DIV after you've tried to make it draggable. jQuery events only work on the elements which exist at the time that the Javascript is run - there are ways around this using the live and delegate functions - but it doesn't look like your plugin allows for that. So if that code needs to remain the same, move the bit which creates the DIV above the draggable function - and it'll work.
