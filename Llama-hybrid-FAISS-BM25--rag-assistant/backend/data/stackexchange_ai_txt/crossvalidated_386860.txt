Does any `R` package offer `gnorm`, `hnorm`, and similar? What about other languages?

R typically offers functions prefixed by d , p , q , and r for pdf, cdf, inverse cdf, and sampling. These are somewhat useful for inference -- especially MCMC since you're usually sampling and computing densities. But, for everyday fitting via likelihoods or empirical Bayes, I wish they would have included functions prefixed with g for the gradient of the log density w.r.t. the parameters and h for the hessian. Does this functionality exist in any R package or any other scientific computing language?
