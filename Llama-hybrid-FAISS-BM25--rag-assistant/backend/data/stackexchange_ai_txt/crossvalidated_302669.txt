I do not recommend such approach. It might fail due to canceling effects between words. Also, the words in your sentence might have different status (i.e., importance) from each other. Hence, merely averaging the word vectors can be risky. Alternatives to the method you have suggested are Paragraph Vectors. Create a dov2vec model and create paragraph vectors (in your case, passage vectors) Geometry of sentences . Assign weights to each word and weight-average them. It is shown that GloVe performs better than word2vec in this task.
