Classification problem on potentially more than 1 labels

I just started to learn Convolutional Neural Network, and like to predict a Pokémon type by its apperance (the input is image). However, while many Pokémon has only one type, some Pokémon have two types (no Pokémon has more than 2 types). I'm not sure the proportion, but it is something like 60% for only one type vs 40% for two types, I guess. In this case, how should I classify it? Should I mark all the output probability that has > 33% as predicted types, or is there anything better way? Also, is the convolutional neural network suitable in these cases?
