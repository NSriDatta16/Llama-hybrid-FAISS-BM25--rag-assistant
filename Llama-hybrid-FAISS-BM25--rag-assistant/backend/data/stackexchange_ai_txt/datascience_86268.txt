You should make the "abdomCirc" as Multiple separate features (e.g. one for each month). Then handle NaN as it should be i.e. Remove columns that are having more NaN than a Threshold Try to fill NaN for cases where only a few are missing. If we can't accommodate the above solution because of NaN counts, then we should accept that we don't have enough data and ignore the feature-set (i.e. abdomCirc) altogether. Otherwise you may be at risk of finding a pattern that doesn't exist because of very small amount of available data points for abdomCirc . I initially thought about using a python list for these features. However, I do not know if a machine learning model can handle this data type None of the Model will accept this data i.e. a List
