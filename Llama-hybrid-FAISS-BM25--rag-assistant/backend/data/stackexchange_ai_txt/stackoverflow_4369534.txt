What is the easiest way to eat soup with chopsticks when the soup was put in a bowl with a ladle? Put the soup in a cup and discard your chopsticks, because chopsticks are a poor choice for aiding in the consumption of soup. A cup (ubiquitous) eliminates external dependencies except for "mouth" and "opposable thumbs", both of which come with the standard library of humans. A more elegant solution would be to encode that Java object with a JSON Serializer or XML serializer. Protocol Buffers or any other intentionally cross-language serialization technique would work fine plus Protocol Buffers can efficiently encode binary data.
