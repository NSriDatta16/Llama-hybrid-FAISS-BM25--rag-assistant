how to make an object snap to another ojbect then follow its path with pure actionscript

I am currently trying to create an app using flash AIR. I would like to find some more information on how to make an object snap to another ojbect then follow its path, eg. a person object is already on the stage, then drag an arrow to the object which snaps to it, then on play button it follows the arrow path. all in pure actionscript, no guide layers. Any help is really appreciated. Or examples if there are any around. Regards Mark T
