I wouldn't recommend having the application report log data back to the developerâ€”at least not without disclosing this to users/clients first. It would be a safer practice to log errors/events/debugging data to an array initially as Anurag suggests, and then periodically send the log data to the web server where it can be stored locally and cycled. Then if the client is having problems , they can pull up the logs themselves for debugging and, either, send it to you manually, or explicitly tell the application to transfer the logs to you, the developer. Logging to the console is generally used during development anyway. And a debug flag should be used for that so that it won't be turned on at all times.
