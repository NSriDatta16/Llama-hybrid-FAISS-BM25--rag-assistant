First of all, the conditional probability that they wrongly guess they are in the treatment group, conditional on getting better, is: $$\mathbb{P}(\neg T \land \neg C | B),$$ which is not the same as: $$\mathbb{P}(\neg C | \neg T \land B).$$ (The latter probability is the conditional probability that they guess their group wrong, conditional on getting better and being in the treatment group.) Now, perhaps you are actually interested in the second probability, in which case you should state its conditioning information correctly. Assuming you are interested in the latter probability, using the values in your table you have: $$\begin{align} \hat{\mathbb{P}}(\neg C | \neg T \land B) &= \frac{\hat{\mathbb{P}}(\neg C \land \neg T \land B)}{\hat{\mathbb{P}}(\neg T \land B)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{0.037253}{0.037253 + 0.041909} \\[6pt] &= \frac{0.037253}{0.079153} \\[6pt] &= 0.4706455, \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ which is not exactly equal to one-half. Now, getting an answer near to one-half is about what you would expect if you assume that the patient does not have any information on what group they are in (i.e., assuming it is entirely a random guess). So the result of this calculation is not something that would worry me in this analysis. Of course, you should bear in mind that the values in your table are presumably just sample proportions not the actual probabilities. There are more sophisticated estimators for unknown probabilities than just substituting sample proportions into Bayes rule. If you genuinely want to model this situation using Bayesian analysis you would impose a prior on the probabilities of the outcomes of interest and derive the posterior inference for the unknown probability. Nevertheless, for a quick and nasty analysis, I see nothing alarming in the outcome from the numbers you have here.
