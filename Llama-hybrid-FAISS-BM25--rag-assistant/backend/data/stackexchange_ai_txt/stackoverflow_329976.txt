The only database I know that does this is SQLite, depending on the settings you configure with PRAGMA full_column_names and PRAGMA short_column_names . See http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html Otherwise all I can recommend is to fetch columns in a result set by ordinal position rather than by column name, if it's too much trouble for you to type the names of the columns in your query. This is a good example of why it's bad practice to use SELECT * -- because eventually you'll have a need to type out all the column names anyway. I understand the need to support columns that may change name or position, but using wildcards makes that harder , not easier.
