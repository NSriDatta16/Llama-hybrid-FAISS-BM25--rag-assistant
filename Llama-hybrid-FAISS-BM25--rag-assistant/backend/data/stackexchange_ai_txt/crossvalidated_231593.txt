How do you use Bayesian methods to analyze the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample?

The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) comes with weights generated with the replication weight method . There are software packages such as the survey package in R that allow you to compute standard errors using these weights. But what if I want to study ACS PUMS data using Bayesian methods and compute credible intervals? How would I do that in a way that takes into account the sampling design, which is purposefully obscured in the replication weight framework (insofar as I understand it, and I admit I have not studied it closely).
