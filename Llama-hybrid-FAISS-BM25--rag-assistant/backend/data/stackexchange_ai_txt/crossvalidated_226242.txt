Approaching a time series before building a predictive model

I have a big task at hand - building a predictive model that predicts the amount of fires in a certain region of a certain city tomorrow based on historical data. Currently the problem was narrowed down to constructing a time series of amount of fires per date and inspecting it. What should I do to the time series to pick the right predictive algorithm? I have done an autocorrelation check which showed little to no autocorrelation. My question is purely about approaching the problem. What actions should one take first when inspecting a time series?
