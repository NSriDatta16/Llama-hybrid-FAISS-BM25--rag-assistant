Depending on the storage engine you're using, yes it is most probably being loaded from a data cache and not a query cache. MyISAM provides no storage engine level caching for data, and only caches indexes. However, the operating system often serves up data from its own caches which may well be speeding up your query execution. You can try benchmarking the query in a real scenario, just log that specific query to the database every time its executed (along with its execution time).
