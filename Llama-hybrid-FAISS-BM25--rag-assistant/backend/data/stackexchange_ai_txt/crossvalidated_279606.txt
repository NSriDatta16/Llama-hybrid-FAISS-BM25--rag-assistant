Use the logistic regression. Assume that Hatchlings($Y_i$) follows binomial distribution with probability $\pi_i$ with number trials = EggsLaid ($N_i$). $i$ indicates hatch. $Y_i$ ~ $Bin(\pi_i, N_i)$ $\log(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}) = X_i\beta + e_i$ $e_i$ ~ $N(0, \sigma^2)$ Poisson regression is not good because in your case $Y_i \le N_i$. But Poisson distribution has no this limitation.
