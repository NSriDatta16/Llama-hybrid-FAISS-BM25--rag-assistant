E4X filter by text content?

I'm trying to filter some XML in JavaScript using E4X and have some specific needs. Given the following: var xml = This is some text that I have. ; I want to search the document for paragraphs starting with "This is some text". Currently I can the following to get at the paragraph: xml..div(p.text().toString().indexOf("This is some text") === 0) However, the "real" XML is much more complex (think: a regular web page). There is no guarantee that there will be a div directly parenting the paragraph(s) in questions. There may be other paragraphs before/after the paragraph(s) in question within the same parent element. Any ideas?
