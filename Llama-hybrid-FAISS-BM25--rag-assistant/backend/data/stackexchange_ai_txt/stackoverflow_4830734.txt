RRDTool data source type selection

I have a question related to RRDTool DST. I need to create a database in such a way that even the data is the same (for example, I have six entries per hour with the same value). RRDTool must calculate the AVERAGE of this data. I'm creating database with following command: rrdtool create test.rrd --step 15 DS:na:GAUGE:15:0:U RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:1:244 RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:24:244 RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:168:244 RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:672:244 RRA:AVERAGE:0.99:5760:374 And I'm updating database with following command: rrdtool update test.rrd 1296231519:0.6039 After making 10 entries with the same value (changing timestamp but the same value), I do rrdtool dump test.rrd test.xml , but I don't see any data... It does not contain the 10 entries. After making 10 entries with a different value (changing timestamp and changing value), I do the dump of database and there are the 10 entries I have done. What I'm doing wrong? Maybe DST 'GAUGE' is wrong on creation of rrd?
