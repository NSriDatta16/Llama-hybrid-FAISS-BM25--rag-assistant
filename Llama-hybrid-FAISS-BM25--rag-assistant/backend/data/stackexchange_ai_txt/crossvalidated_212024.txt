There are a few options: A very fast method that kind of breaks GPs but seems to work well in many practical cases are local expert models such as robust Bayesian Committee Machines (paper here , very easy to implement!) A more mathematically beautiful approach is to use hierarchical matrices eg HODLR matrix approximations (paper here , fast code available here ) Low rank approximations eg FITC, Nystrom, etc. Work well when the model requires only a few degrees of freedom (many implementations out there like GPy so just google) Stochastic Variational Inference scales based on the number of iterations applied in an iterative method (paper here , code here ) I just named a few approaches above but there are also spectral methods, KISSgps, etc. In fact it is one of the most heavily researched areas in Gaussian Process literature! Good luck and let us know which works best for you :)
