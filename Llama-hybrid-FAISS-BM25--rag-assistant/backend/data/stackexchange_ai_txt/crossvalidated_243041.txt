Yes, there is a connection, depending on the GP covariance function and the kernel of the smoother. It's discussed in chapter 2 (section 2.6) of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning . Note that even a simple covariance function, such as the squared exponential, results in complex equivalent kernels due to the spectral properties of the function. Other things to note are: in the multivariate setting, the N-WKR boils down to univariate regression in each dimension (see this answer), whereas GPs can model the full multivariate covariance. there is no equivalent to the GP mean function the kernel in N-WKR needn't be a valid GP covariance function, and there may not be an equivalent covariance function for every kernel there is no obvious equivalent for e.g. periodic covariance functions as a kernel smoother in GPs you are free to combine covariance functions (e.g. through multiplication or addition), see e.g. the kernel cookbook
