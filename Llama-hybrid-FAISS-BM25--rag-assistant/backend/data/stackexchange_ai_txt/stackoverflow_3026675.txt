My two cents: If you want the buttons you create in a loop to all behave differently, think about what is different about the buttons themselves and check for that. For example: If each button is generated from a different data item, set its DataContext and use that to find the original data item. If each buttons is numbered, set the DataContext to the button number. If each button has a different meaning, set the Click to different event handlers. You can create an array of these. Or have a different object attached to each button as a CommandParameter. Your code will be most meaningful if you distinguish your behavior based on something that is salient to the end-user. Example: for(int i=0; 0 { MessageBox.Show("You clicked button " + ((Button)sender).DataContext); }; dockPanel.Children.Add(btn); // Or you could use Canvas & Canvas.SetLeft } I would recommend you strongly consider using DockPanel instead of Canvas for this. Unless you need arbitrary positioning by the end-user (drag and drop), Canvas is almost never the right panel to use. If you use a DockPanel you won't have to set the left coordinate - it will automatically do this for you.
