I have a few projects where the customer wants all the historical data (going back over 19 years). Quite a bit of the really old data is malformed and is going to be a nightmare to import into the new system. We convinced them that they won't need records going back any further than 10 years, but like you said it's all relative to the type of data you're housing. On a side note, data storage is extremely cheap right now, and if it isn't affecting the performance of your application, I would just leave it where it is.
