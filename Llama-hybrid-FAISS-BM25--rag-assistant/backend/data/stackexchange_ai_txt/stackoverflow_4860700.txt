JS : Custom design for Dragging, Dropping & Sorting

How to resolve the custom Drag, Drop & sort? Basic Example Let suppose we have a Calculator and the user is able to drag,drop & remove a block of calculator's buttons OR any individual button. (I have made it very successful) My Requirement : I need to develop a custom application for any kind of element.Let suppose if user want to inherit Drag & Drop feature in "Currency Converter keypad" instead of calculator, then he should be able to do it without much of technical knowledge.
