Why WHATWG disallows nested forms in HTML 4 and HTML5?

Why does the WHATWG disallow nested forms in HTML 4 and HTML5? EDIT : Problem is originally described at How do you overcome the HTML form nesting limitation? In short author says: You are making a blog app and you have a form with some fields for creating a new post and a toolbar with "actions" like "Save" , "Delete" , "Cancel"... The only problem is that pressing "Delete", will submit ALL the form fields on the server even though the only thing needed for this action is a Hidden input with the post-id. So, it is a question about an elegant solution (without JavaScript) for several buttons in a form to submit different sets of input fields (like several forms could allow) and to line up UI into single entity ("form") from user perspective. Comment from that discussion : it's almost impossible to completely separate the elements' screen position from their position in the document. EDIT : I found interesting note https://web.archive.org/web/20170420110433/http://anderwald.info/internet/nesting-form-tags-in-xhtml/ - that (X)HTML disallows nesting forms like "form > form", but allows "form > fieldset > form", W3 validator says it is valid, but browsers have bugs with such nesting.
