Binding a wpf listbox to a combobox

I have created a very basic wpf application that I want to use to record time entries against different projects. I havent used mvvm for this as I think its an overkill. I have a form that contains a combobox and a listbox. I have created a basic entity model like this What I am trying to do is bind the combobox to Project and whenever I select an item from the combobox it updates the listview with the available tasks associated with that project. This is my xaml so far. I dont have any code behind as I have simply clicked on that Data menu and then datasources and dragged and dropped the items over. The application loads ok and the combobox is been populated however nothing is displaying in the listbox. Can anyone tell me what I have missed?
