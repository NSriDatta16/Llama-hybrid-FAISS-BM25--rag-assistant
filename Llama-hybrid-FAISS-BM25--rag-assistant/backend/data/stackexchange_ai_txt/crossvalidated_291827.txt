Variable transformation on Kaggle titanic problem

I was checking Kaggles Titanic problem and a common feature processing is playing with Parch (number of parents) and Sibsp (number of siblings/spouses). First they take it as they come. Then they mix the two in TotalFamily (Sibsp + Parch) Finally they transform the categorical TotalFamily in a binary variable TravelsAlone ( TotalFamily = 0 ) This seems to improve performance, I'm trying to understand why: one variable is better than two? aren't we loosing relations doing this? is it because a binary variable is better than a categorical? are these good rules of thumb regardless of the algorithm picked (ensembles, svm, etc). Please avoid "check for yourself and see" answers , as I said, after seeing a lot of people doing the same transformations I think there's a rule of thumb somewhere and I'm trying to find it.
