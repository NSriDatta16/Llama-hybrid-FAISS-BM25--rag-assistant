Storing files (videos/images/music) in CouchDB/Cloudant vs CDN (CloudFront)?

I am new to CouchDB/Cloudant and CDN (CloudFront). I am about to build an application using CouchDB as database. This web application will handle a lot of files. I know that CouchDB can store files in the database as attachments. But then I have heard about leveraging CDN to store and distribute the files all over the world. My questions: How is storing files in CouchDB compared to CDN (CloudFront)? How is Cloudant's service compared to CDN (CloudFront)? Is Google storage also a CDN? What is the difference between Amazon CloudFront and S3? Do I have to choose to store files either in CouchDB/Cloudant or CDN, or could/should I actually combine them? What are best practices for storing files when using CouchDB?
