It would be better to create a Job, and then start that from within your procedure. Otherwise you'll need to start your SSIS package using xp_cmdshell, which many consider bad to use (security risks). EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_start_job N'YourJobNameHere'; try looking at Running SSIS package programmatically which covers all of the following methods: Run package programmatically using SSIS Object Model Start DTEXEC.EXE process. DTEXEC is command line utility for executing SSIS packages Use SQL Agent. You can configure an Agent job to run your package Use some other utility to start DTEXEC for you Create a custom application that will run the package EDIT based on OP saying they can't pass a value into a job if you won't have multiple people trying to run this package at one time, you can insert your values into a special table that the stored procedures (within your package) can select out and use. If you have multiple people trying to run the package at the same time, you can create a queue table, where the job pulls the needed parameters from this queue table and then runs the package, when it is finished it pulls the next set, etc.
