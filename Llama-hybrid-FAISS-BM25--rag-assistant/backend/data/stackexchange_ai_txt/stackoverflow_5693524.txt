Messages are translated directly into C function calls, so your code does this: words = objc_msgSend(NSArray, @selector(arrayWithObjects:), @"aa", @"aah", ...250,000 more arguments...); When a function is called in C, its parameters are first pushed onto the stack. It's unlikely that you're running out of stack space at just a few hundred words, but entirely possible at 250,000 words. So, you're probably running up against some compiler limit on either the number of parameters or the total size of the parameter data. There are definitely better ways to do what you're doing. At the very least, use @smorgan's suggestion and read the list from a file. Better would be to use a memory-mapped file so that you don't have to keep the entire thing in memory all the time -- let the OS handle loading and loading parts of the file into memory for you.
