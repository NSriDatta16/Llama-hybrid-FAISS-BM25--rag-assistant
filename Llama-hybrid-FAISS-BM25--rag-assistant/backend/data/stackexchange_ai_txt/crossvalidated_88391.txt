Bayesian parameter estimation homework problem

For BPE approach,for p($\theta$)~U(0,1) show that p(x|D)= $1/n+2[(x+ \sum_{k=1}^n(x_k)!)$ $ (n+1-x-$($\sum_{k=1}^n(x_k)$!]$/$[$(\sum_{k=1}^n(x_k))$! $(n-\sum_{k=1}^n(x_k))$!] I have tried using the following equation p(x|D)= $\int p(x|\mu)p(\mu|D)d\mu$ I have substituted for the 2 terms but unable to reach the required solution
