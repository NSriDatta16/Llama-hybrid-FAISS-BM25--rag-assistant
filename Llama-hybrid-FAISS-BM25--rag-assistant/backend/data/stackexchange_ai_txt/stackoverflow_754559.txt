I recommend your management read Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash , by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck. They highly discourage the idea of rating developers based on metrics. Their preference is to reward teams, not individuals. Where that method isn't considered practical, I'd recommend (and so do they ... I think ...) peer reviews. Don't couch it in blunt terms like, "How do you rank your teammates?", though. Ask instead: Who do you go to when you have a problem you can't solve? Who has provided the best creative input to the project? etc. The answers to these sorts of questions can provide much better guidance as to who's putting the most into the team.
