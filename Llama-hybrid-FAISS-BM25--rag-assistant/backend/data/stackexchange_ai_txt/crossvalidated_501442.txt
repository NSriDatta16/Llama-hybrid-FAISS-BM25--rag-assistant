The desired inequality can be obtained by two applications of the Data Processing Inequality (DPI). First consider the Markov chain $Y\rightarrow X\rightarrow U$ . Then the DPI implies that $\mathrm{MI}(U,Y)\le\mathrm{MI}(X,Y)$ . Next, rewrite the original factorization as: $$P (x, y, u, v) = P (u) P (x|u) P (y|x) P (v|y)$$ In this form, we see that we also have the Markov chain $U\rightarrow X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow V$ . For this chain, the DPI implies that $\mathrm{MI}(U,V) \le \mathrm{MI}(U,Y)$ . Combining the two inequalities, we obtain the desired result: $$\mathrm{MI}(U,V) \le \mathrm{MI}(X,Y)$$ This answer is based on @Robby's answer above. However, I still have trouble to find conditions under which $\mathrm{MI}(U,V)=0$ imply that $\mathrm{MI}(X,Y)=0$ .
