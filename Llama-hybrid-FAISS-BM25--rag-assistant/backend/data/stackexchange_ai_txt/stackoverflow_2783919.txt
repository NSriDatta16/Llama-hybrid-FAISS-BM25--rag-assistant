you need to use: sqlcmd Utility The sqlcmd utility lets you enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files at the command prompt, in Query Editor in SQLCMD mode, in a Windows script file or in an operating system (Cmd.exe) job step of a SQL Server Agent job. This utility uses OLE DB to execute Transact-SQL batches. Then use CREATE DATABASE (Transact-SQL) to do the attach and sp_detach_db (Transact-SQL) to do the detach. The sp_attach_db (Transact-SQL) is going to be removed in a future version of Microsoft SQL Server.
