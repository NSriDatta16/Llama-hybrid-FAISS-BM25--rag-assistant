In SAS, how do you copy & paste from the output window?

Sometimes, I just want to do a copy & paste from the output window in SAS. I can highlight text with a mouse-drag, but only SOMETIMES does that get copied to the clipboard. It doesn't matter if I use "CTRL-C" or right click -> copy, or edit -> copy Any other SAS users experience this, and do you know a workaround/option/technique that can fix it? Sometimes, I can fix it by clicking in another window, and coming back to the output window, but sometimes I just have to save the output window as a .lst and get the text from another editor.
