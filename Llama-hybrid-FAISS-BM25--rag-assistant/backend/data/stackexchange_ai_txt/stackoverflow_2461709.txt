Hmm. Here's the list. 301 sounds okay (emphasis mine): The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs . Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned by the server, where possible. 302 doesn't fit n my opinion: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI However, my favourite is 303 see other : The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource . This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. But that might be so rare (I've never seen it used in the wild) that some clients may not understand it - which would render your desire for maximum compatibility moot. 301 is probably the closest choice.
