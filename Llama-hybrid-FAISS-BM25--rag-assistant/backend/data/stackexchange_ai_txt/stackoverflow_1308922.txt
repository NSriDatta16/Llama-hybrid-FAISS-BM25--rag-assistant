You can create a local (read-only) mirror of the complete repository using svnsync . The necessary steps are explained in the svn-book . The basic steps are: # Create a local mirror repository. svnadmin create local_mirror # Create pre-revprop-change hook. echo > local_mirror\hooks\pre-revprop-change.cmd # Associate local mirror with remote repository. svnsync init local_mirror repo_url # Sync the repositories. svnsync sync local_mirror While using another VCS like git would work too, this allows you to use your svn tools as usual. Besides, in order to estimate the size of the repository you will need the same storage algorithms. Each VCS has its own way of storing stuff if you use another than svn the size of your local repo will most likely not match the size of the original repo.
