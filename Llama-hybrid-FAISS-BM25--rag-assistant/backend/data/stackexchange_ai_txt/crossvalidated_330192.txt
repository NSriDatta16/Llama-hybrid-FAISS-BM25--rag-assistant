How to check if dataset has been used for a Neural Network

I'm participating in a research by applying some computer vision processing on some images, and I got asked how I could put a watermark on the images in case someone else uses the dataset for purposes not intended on the paper. Example: Our dataset mustn't be used to create a Convolutional Neural Network with Caffe. What's the best way to test a dataset has been trained with that data? For example any kind of general test, or applying a watermark in every single image.
