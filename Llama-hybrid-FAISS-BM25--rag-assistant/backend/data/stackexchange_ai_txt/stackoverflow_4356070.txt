How to change the imagealpha for a multi-select drag and drop operation in Flex

Here's the code that allows multi-select list to drag into a tree area. What I would like to do is to change the alpha of the image that gets dragged around. I've done some research but most of the discussions out there talk about how to change the dragged image. What I want to do is simply change the default alpha of the dragged item from 0.5 to say 0.2. Also this solution should be able to handle multiple select dragging. Thank you. Below is a simple example of drag and drop that I would like to modify to allow for the alpha change of the draged item. Johnny Rocket's Jet Pizza Steve's Greek Sonsie The Border Cafe ; insert.@label = items[i]; insert.@type = "restaurant"; tree.dataDescriptor.addChildAt(p, insert, r+i); } } /** * Called when the drag operation completes, whether * successfully or not. The tree is cleared of its * selection. */ private function onDragComplete( event:DragEvent ) : void { tree.selectedIndex = -1; } ]]>
