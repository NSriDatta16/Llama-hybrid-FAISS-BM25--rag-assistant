I would like to provide another view to the problem: In real world, it is less likely to encounter the this question, because what to do is depending on business needs . The essential question in real world is what to do after getting the prediction? Suppose business wants to trash "low quality" wine. Then, we need some definition of "how bad is bad" (say quality below $2$). With the definition, binary logistic regression should be used, because the decision is binary. (trash or keep, there is nothing in middle). Suppose business wants to select some fine wine to send to three types restaurants. Then, multi-class classification will be needed. In sum, I want to argue that what to do is really depending on the needs after getting the prediction, instead of just looking at the attribute of the response variable.
