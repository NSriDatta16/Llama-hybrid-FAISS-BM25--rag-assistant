For simplicity, and to focus on your main question, I will initially set aside the fact that you are looking at three different viruses, and just focus on one. Evidently you have count variables that count the number of positive and negative outcomes on your viral test. The normal thing to do with this type of count data is to model the positive counts (or equivalently, the negative counts) and include an offset term for the exposure variable, which is the total number of animals exposed (i.e., the sum of the positive and negative counts. Since you have not stated which is your exposure variable, I will just refer to this variable as exposure (i.e., this is the variable that counts the number of animals exposed at each site). On this basis (and looking at only one of the viruses), a simple formulation of a logistic regression would be something like this: #Create exposure variable data $virus count_virus_1_positive; data $exposure count_virus_1_positive + data$count_virus_1_negative; #Fit logistic regression model MODEL This kind of formula would give you a base model, and then you can alter it to add additional explanatory variables, or mixed effects, if you prefer. In any case, by including the exposure variable as a logarithmic offset term in your (logarithmic) link function, there is then no need to look at both the positive and negative counts; your model will estimate the rate of positive tests for that virus conditional on the explanatory variables in the model. The exposure size enters into the model as a fixed offset term, and there is no double-counting of this offset. Now, since you have three different viruses, you will have to decide if they are all of interest as response variables, or if the latter two are merely useful explanatory variables for the first virus. If they are all of interest then you will need to shift to a multivariate logistic regression (or some other multivariate model) with three binary response variables. Since this part was not the main focus of your question, I will leave it at that.
