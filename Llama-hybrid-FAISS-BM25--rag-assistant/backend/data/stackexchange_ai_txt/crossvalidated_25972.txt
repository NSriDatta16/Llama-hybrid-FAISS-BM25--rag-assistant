Unconditional inference in the multinomial model

Consider a multinomial $2\times 2$ table $\begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ with theoretical probabilities: $$\begin{pmatrix} \theta_{11} & \theta_{12} \\ \theta_{21} & \theta_{22} \end{pmatrix}.$$ The conditional distribution of $x_{11}$ given $x_{11}+x_{12}=n$ is binomial with size $n$ and proportion $p=\dfrac{\theta_{11}}{\theta_{11}+\theta_{12}}$. Therefore we have a straightforward way to perform statistical inference on $p$ by conditioning on $x_{11}+x_{12}$. Is it possible to do an unconditional inference on $p$ ? Parenthesis : I have noted that adopting the Bayesian approach with the Jeffreys (Dirichlet) prior of the unconditional multinomial model is equivalent to adopt the Bayesian approach with the Jeffreys (Beta) prior of the conditional binomial model.
