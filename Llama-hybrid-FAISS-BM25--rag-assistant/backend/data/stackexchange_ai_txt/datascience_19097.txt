Deep learning models for classification, able to classify small image patches?

I am currently working with classifying patterns, and though at good place to start would be using already established models such as VGG16, INCEPTION models and so on.. Problem that my images are pretty small.. They are in shape of (8,15,3)... Any well established models able to handle this?
