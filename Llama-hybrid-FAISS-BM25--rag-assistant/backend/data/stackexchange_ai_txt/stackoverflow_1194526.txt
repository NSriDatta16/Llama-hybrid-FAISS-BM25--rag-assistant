Independently from if the class was autogenerated or not: the smell is not awful but sweet. I'd never ever add behavior to a data class but create a/many separate class/es for behavior. The intention of this class is to provide the xml coded information as a java object. And the class shouldn't do anything else. That keeps the code clear and understandable. You could rename the 'Person' class to 'FullPersonName' (or something else that describes the real content of the data class) and reserve the 'Person' class name for another class, that describes 'a Person' with 'a FullPersonName' (=composition). Edit: This might be controversial. Gene Garcia adds Data classes to his 'smells' list and suggests moving behavior into it. The Clean Code authors encourage the readers to keep the concern separated and to not create hybrid classes. Me, I like clean code.
