In reply to your title "When do we combine dimensionality reduction with clustering?" rather than the full question. One possible reason is obvious: when we want to secure agaist outliers. K-means algo, if without initial centers hint, takes k most apart points in the cloud as initial centers, and right these are likely to be outliers. Preacting by PCA neutralizes outliers which lie along junior components - by projecting them onto the few senior components which are retained in PCA.
