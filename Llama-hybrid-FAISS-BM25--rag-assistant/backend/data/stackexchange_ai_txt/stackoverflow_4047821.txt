"Why is this and is there a way around it?" Although the front end uses Javascript heavily it is only essential in a couple of places. Configurable products is one. The one-page checkout is another but that at least can be disabled in System > Configuration > Checkout > Checkout Options. Buttons with event handlers can be rewritten as a matter of theming, in some cases their destination URL is not the same as their form submission so a little forethought is required. In some cases buttons are not in the form element they are submitting, that is why they use script. I will assume when considering accessibility you are not concerned about luxuries like image zoom and search suggestions. I notice HTML5 provides the datalist element for input suggestions but some sort of script would still be needed to update it beyond the initial suggestion. Overall Magento is quite functional without Javascript, just not as out-of-the-box. An 'accessible' theme would make a valid extension should someone want to develop it.
