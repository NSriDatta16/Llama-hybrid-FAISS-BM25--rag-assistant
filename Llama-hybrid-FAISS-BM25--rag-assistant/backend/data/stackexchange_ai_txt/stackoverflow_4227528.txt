Why does git-svn clone set 'master' to a random branch?

I'm trying to move our existing svn repository to git. We don't need to do any syncing between the two (so no git svn fetch es or dcommit s) -- we're just moving over and that's it. I issued this command to create the git repository: git svn clone -s https://server/repos/my_repo This ran fine. However, when I cd 'd into the new my_repo directory, the files that were in there were part of one of the branches (not the trunk). Doing a git branches -a yields: * master modelExperimentalTrunk modelExperimentalTrunk@719 dRefactoring reorganise stableV396 tags/v1.0 trunk I am on the master branch, but the files that are in my sandbox are actually from the dRefactoring branch (one of our more obscure branches). Questions: Why was the master branch not connected to trunk ? Is there a way to reconnect it to trunk ? Or can that be done during the git svn clone stage? Also, given that this is going to be on a server, is there any way git svn can create a --bare repository?
