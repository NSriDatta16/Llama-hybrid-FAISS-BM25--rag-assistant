Look at http://www.autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf as you are analyzing time series data that has autocorrelation possibly (probably !) vitiating your conclusions. Did you verify that your final model's residuals were free of structure i.e. were white noise and uncorrelated with lags of your predictor series suggesting sufficiency? I will start by analyzing the 173 model residuals that you posted in order to assess that they are free of structure , both stochastic and deterministic . The plot of the data not only reveals anomalies but can hide/obfuscate latent deterministic structure like day-of-the-week effects. The ACF of these 173 residuals is here suggesting randomness BUT that is only true if there are no latent deterministic factors (pulses and seasonal pulses ) present in the data which would lead to an underestimation of the ACF as the variance of the errors is enlarged (over-estimated). Determining parameters (p, d, q) for ARIMA modeling discusses Prof. Keith Ord's "Alice in Wonderland effect" . A routine analysis suggests 6 very strong seasonal pulses reflecting omitted day-pf-the week effects shown here and here . The idea that latent deterministic effects provide down-sized estimates of the ACF is the "small print" that many ignore but not all ! Thus there is sufficient information now that the residuals are not free-of-structure thus model conclusions may be flawed. After clarification from the OP about his original data , I will follow this up . AFTER RECEIPT OF ORIGINAL DATA: and here . The analysis showed that X2 was not significant ( NOT CLOSE TO BEING SIGNIFICANT ) with daily indicators being detected AND two counter-weighting level shifts . The model is here The residual plot here with an ACF here The Forecast Plot is here (using ARIMA forecasts for X1)
