Logistic regression is emphatically not a classification algorithm on its own. It is only a classification algorithm in combination with a decision rule that makes dichotomous the predicted probabilities of the outcome. Logistic regression is a regression model because it estimates the probability of class membership as a (transformation of a) multilinear function of the features. Frank Harrell has posted a number of answers on this website enumerating the pitfalls of regarding logistic regression as a classification algorithm. Among them: Classification is a decision . To make an optimal decision, you need to asses a utility function, which implies that you need to account for the uncertainty in the outcome, i.e. a probability. The costs of misclassification are not uniform across all units. Don't use cutoffs. Use proper scoring rules. The problem is actually risk estimation, not classification. If I recall correctly, he once pointed me to his book on regression strategies for more elaboration on these (and more!) points, but I can't seem to find that particular post.
