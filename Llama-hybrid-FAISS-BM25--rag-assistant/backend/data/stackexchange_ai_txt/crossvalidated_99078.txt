The "orthodox" solution would be a 2x2 ANOVA , with team vs. individual as within (repeated-measures) factor, and nationality as a between factor. You would be interested in the interaction between these factors. Your idea is that the behaviour on one factor - team/individual - depends on the level of the other factor - nationality. Conceptually, the ANOVA can be seen as the generalisation of the two-sample t -test to three or more (in your case, four) groups. It checks if all group means are identical by comparing within- and between-group variance, and typically, all main effects and their interactions are evaluated at the same time. Traditionally, the interaction would be followed up by a test by factor - here, an unpaired t -test of team minus individual scores for the two nationalities. Pragmatically speaking, your readers will probably expect to see the ANOVA in this case, you'll probably hardly get around it. Either way, don't forget to provide an inference for a measure of effect size, such as a point estimate and confidence interval for $\eta^2$ (eta squared) for your main effects and interaction.
