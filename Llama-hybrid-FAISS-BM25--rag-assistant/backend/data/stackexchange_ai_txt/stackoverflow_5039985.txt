Is there a way to use UIView animations with custom ease equation

UIView provides a few easing options ( UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn , UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut , UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut ) for its animation, but I want more control over the easing. Is there a way to provide it a custom equation, or in any way get more control over it? That is, aside from using touchesBegan: etc. to roll my own animations.
