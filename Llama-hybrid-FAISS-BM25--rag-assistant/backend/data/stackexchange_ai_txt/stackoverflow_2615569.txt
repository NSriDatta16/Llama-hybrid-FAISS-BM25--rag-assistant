Esteban, take these steps: I'll talk in mercurial-speak, but this is all do able in git too. clone their project make your clone of their project a subrepo in your project That gives you the best of all worlds. You can edit code in your project and their project without paying attention to which is which, and when you commit the changes to your code go into your repo along with a pointer to a new changeset in your clone of their project. Then when you want to update your clone of their project you can do so in place and merge simply. So this is pretty much what you said in '1' but there's no need to do a fork or host that repo publically. Just edit their clone as a subrepo of your project and never push (which wouldn't work anyway since you don't have write access to their repo). Your option two's primary drawback is that as they modify and improve their project on which you depend you'll have a hardtime pulling their improvements in and merging them with yours.
