It sounds like the distinction you're actually asking about is online learning vs. batch learning, although this terminology is somewhat overloaded so we have to be careful. There is another sense of online learning where it simply means "showing the algorithm the training examples one-by-one and never more than once." That usage is also legitimate but its not very relevant to your question so it won't be the sense in which I use "online learning" in this answer. The type of online learning you would be interested in is when an agent continuously learns from a potentially changing environment. The canonical example is the multi-armed bandit problem . Here, an agent is sitting in front of a number of slot machines (one-armed bandits) all with different payoffs and has to decide which lever to pull. In some variations, the payoff of each slot machine can even change over time! The agent has to start by exploring to discover which machine has the highest payoff, then shifts to exploiting what's its learned. However, if the payoffs are changing, it has to continue to spend at least some of its time exploring. Any agent which stops learning in a changing environment is doomed to get stuck in a sub-optimal strategy. There are many potential algorithms for this problem. In industry, most machine learning models have a very different life cycle: they are trained on some carefully curated training set, tested and validated, then released into production where they never learn again but only spit out responses based on what they learned in their youth. This approach has a lot of benefits too, namely that humans are in the loop and can prevent broken models from being released and try to optimize each model (with hyper-parameter selection, for example) before each release. This works because the environments are changing too slowly for it to be necessary for the model to have learned from the day before. Although sometimes you see an A/B test or HFT algorithm that runs online learning in production. I wouldn't describe either as "real" or "true" machine learning; batch learning meets the definition of "learning from experience" just as well, and they have different use cases, strengths, and weaknesses.
