Wald test and Likelihood ratio test, where do the confidence intervals on the regression coefficients come from?

So I'm trying to build my own Wald test and likelihood ratio test code within a machine learning pipeline. I can get the final fitted logistic regression coefficients from liblinear. I'm coding in MATLAB. How would I get the variance of the regression coefficients and also the confidence intervals of the regression coefficients? Clearly for a variance and confidence interval, you need a sample of multiple sets of coefficients. But I thought you only get a single set of coefficients at the end of the log likelihood optimization. Basically trying to replicate the results in the following link http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/nested_tests.htm
