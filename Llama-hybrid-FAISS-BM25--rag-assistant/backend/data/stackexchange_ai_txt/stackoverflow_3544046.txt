Here's a general solution: ^(?:[a-z]{3}(?![a-z]{3})|[0-9]{2}(?![0-9]{2}))+$ It's a simple alternation--three letters or two digits--but the negative lookaheads ensure that the same alternative is never matched twice in a row. Here's a slightly more elegant solution just for PHP: /^(?:([a-z]{3})(?!(?1))|([0-9]{2})(?!(?2)))+$/ Instead of typing the same subpatterns multiple times, you can put them capturing groups and use (?1) , (?2) , etc. to apply them again wherever else you want--in this case, in the lookaheads.
