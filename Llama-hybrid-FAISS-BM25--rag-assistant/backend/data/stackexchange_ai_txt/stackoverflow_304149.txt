I don't have MSSQL handy, but check the syntax for the CASE statement in case I got it wrong and also I'm not sure if the TOP 1 should go outside the case as I put it here or if it should go inside (ELSE TOP 1 name). The idea is: SELECT TOP 1 CASE WHEN myexpression = 'true' THEN 'my message' ELSE name END FROM people; Here myexpression has to be either constants or related to the tables present in the query, for example CASE WHEN address LIKE '%Michigan%' where address is another field in the table people. PS: Found the MSSQL CASE syntax here :-)
