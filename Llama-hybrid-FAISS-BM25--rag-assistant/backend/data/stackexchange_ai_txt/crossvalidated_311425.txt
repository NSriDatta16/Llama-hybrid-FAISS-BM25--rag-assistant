Scaling WAIC for Multiple Endogenous Response Variables

I'm trying to think about WAIC under a multivariate model scenario. Suppose I have one model composed of two relationships: y1 ~ x y2 ~ y1 This is one model. Now, I have a second model y1 ~ x y2 ~ y1 + x I would like to construct a WAIC to compare the first case to the second. However, given that y1 and y2 are likely on different scales or might even share different error distributions, their WAIC values could be on radically different scales. How, then, to combine? Intuitively, scaling WAIC values for each relationship seems like the answer. But how? Given that we're often interested in $\Delta$WAIC scores, simply centering and summing seems intuitive, but, is there a theoretical justification behind that intuition? Or is something more exotic needed? I know this might be an odd question, but is there any literature on rescaling WAICs or perhaps likelihoods to combine multiple pieces into a more holistic score for model comparison in this type of scenario? I've been sifting through the Structural Equation Modeling literature and have not yet found something adequate to translate into a Bayesian framework.
