Best K in K-fold cross validation

I'm using $k$-fold cross validation technique for generating train, test and validation indexes for a neural network. My sample size is 230~700. What is best $k$ for cross validation here. Now I'm using 10-fold cross validation but I think it is too high. What is your idea?
