I used to work for a large commercial site just over a year ago, and IE5.5 on a Mac usage was below 0.5% - and that was in an organisation where many of the internal users used that browser (the main reason we had to support it) I would say, unless the demographic you are targeting are especially likely to be using it, I really wouldn't bother.
