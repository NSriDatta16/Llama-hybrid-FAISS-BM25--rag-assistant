Just to chime in, as I just stumbled on this this question just now. There is a difference between the Eclipse Foundation and the Eclipse IDE. The Foundation is the umbrella organization, while the IDE is one of the projects developed through the foundation. So, the important thing to know is that just as Apache started with the web server and branched out to become a Foundation hosting a number of projects, so has the Eclipse Foundation now expanded beyond its "roots" in the IDE. So in this context the JGit code provides a Java API for git commands, while EGit uses JGit to provide git support for the Eclipse IDE. Personally, I also find this a little confusing at times, and sometimes it almost seems that having so much going on has in some ways degraded the focus of these organizations; however I can also see the utility in having one umbrella organization instead of 20 similar but different organizations.
