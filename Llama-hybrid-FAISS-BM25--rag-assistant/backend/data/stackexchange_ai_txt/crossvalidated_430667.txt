Recurrent Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning

I am new to this and I have been trying to understand the relationship between these two for a while (also referring to this question about RRL , but it seems to me RRL is a subset of DRL algorithms, because in my understanding DRL is combination of neural networks with reinforcement learning and RRL uses a neural net with a certain feedback loop (LSTM layer?), which qualifies it for the "definition" od DRL as well. Is my understanding correct? If not, can you please explain?
