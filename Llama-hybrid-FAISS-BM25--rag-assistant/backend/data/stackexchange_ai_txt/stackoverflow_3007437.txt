That's easy: a non-standard one. A constructor that modifies its const parameter would be very difficult to predict by the developer. You'd need it to be documented and the developer would need to know to look at the documentation for a very common use....something most won't do. A non-standard constructor though begs attention. Besides, this is how the standard does it with auto_ptr. Why? So you can't accidentally put it in a container. Another good reason to use the non-standard version.
