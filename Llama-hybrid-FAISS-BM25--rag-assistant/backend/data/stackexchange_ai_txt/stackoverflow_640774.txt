This time I've read the question properly and realised coonj wants to get the HTML from the clipboard including tags. I believe this is reasonably difficult. You need to read the clipboard using Windows API calls. And then, parse the resulting CF_HTML string which has some wacky headers added on top of the HTML. Microsoft Knowledge Base article with Windows API code to read the CF_HTML from the clipboard (function GetHTMLClipboard). You will then probably want to ignore the wacky headers. Microsoft documents the format here . An example CF_HTML fragment is shown below. You could probably come up with some guesswork method of skipping the first few lines. Version:0.9 StartHTML:71 EndHTML:170 StartFragment:140 EndFragment:160 StartSelection:140 EndSelection:160 The HTML Clipboard The Fragment It might also be worth thinking whether there's any other way of solving your problem. E,g, Will the browser always be Internet Explorer? Can you get what you need by walking the HTML tree using the COM object model? EDIT: coonj has tried this now and says "the GetHTMLClipboard function seems to work with both Firefox and IE, and it doesn't look like it is throwing those headers in there"
