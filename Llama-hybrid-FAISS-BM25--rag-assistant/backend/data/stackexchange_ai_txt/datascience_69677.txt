What could be the reason of having a lower RMSE than MAE?

I used some machine learning algorithms in my dataset and I found that my RMSE goes low than the MAE. What are the most common reasons for that type of typical scenario. Since from my understanding the RMSE is normally higher than the MAE. But if I am wrong is it actually possible to have a lower RMSE and higher MAE? (for example: RMSE: 26, and MAE : 36)
