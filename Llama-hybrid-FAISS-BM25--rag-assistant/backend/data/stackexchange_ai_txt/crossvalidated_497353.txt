Categorizing Date in a registry data base of cancer

I happen to work with a breast cancer database which is not available online. I want to follow these steps and report the results: Remove data of people who are young( less than 18 yo) and who are old(more than 65 yo) Replacing illegible data with NULL values Imputing those NULL values with MICE Feature selection using Rapid-Miner Predicting death caused by breast cancer with SVM and Kaplan-Meier Most of the features are categorical but some of them are numerical, I have solved some of the numerical ones except the dates which could help in the prediction. For example: Surgery : Yes or No and if Yes when "Date is here" I want all my features to be categorical because I think this way I would have better results. If you think otherwise please tell me and If you have any suggestions explain it to me, and also if you think i can skip all the dates and just continue without it let me know I would be appreciated by any suggestion for all of those steps and if you have any method that I can be used for categorizing dates please HELP me out Thank you all
