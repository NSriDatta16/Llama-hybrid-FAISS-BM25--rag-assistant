I think you are mixing up different things a little bit. This is exactly what you need, even the example is with GDP. Relative change can be computed with two differnt ways. Discrete or with log, both have advantages and disadvantages. For average growth rates you should take the geometric mean. If you take the arithmetic mean and compute the mean of this you will get wrong results, there are a lot of examples, especially if you have negative changes in between, where you can clearly see, that the geometric mean is correct and the average of the simple averages is wrong. And for the second part of your question see the related/linked posts, especially this one: Elasticity of log-log regression and this one: Interpretation of log transformed predictor or maybe also this one: How to interpret regression coefficients in a log-log model
