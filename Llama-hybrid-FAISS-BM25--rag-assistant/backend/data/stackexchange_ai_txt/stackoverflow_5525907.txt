Do you really have to interrupt execution when an error occurs? An alternative approach would be to log errors. After tying the knot, you can check whether the list of errors is empty. I've taken this approach in the past. -- I've wrapped a writer in a writer transformer. You'll probably want to implement it differently to avoid ambiguity -- related to writer methods. type RenameM = WriterT [RenameError] (RWS Symtab String Symtab) rename1M (Use name) = do symtab_entry This does not produce laziness-related nontermination problems because the contents of the symbol table are not affected by whether or not a lookup succeeded.
