C#: Split string and assign result to multiple string variables

I have a string with several fields separated by a specific character, something like this: A,B,C I want to split the string at the commas and assign each resulting field to its own string variable. In Perl I can do that elegantly like this: my ($varA, $varB, $varC) = split (/,/, $string); What is the simplest and most elegant way to achieve the same result in C#? I know that I can split into an array: string[] results = string.Split(','); But then I would have to access the fields via their index, e.g. results[2]. That is difficult to read and error-prone - consider not having 3 buth 30 fields. For that reason I prefer having each field value in its own named variable.
