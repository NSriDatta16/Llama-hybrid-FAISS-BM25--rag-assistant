Sklearn Python - Difference in results between accuracy_score and roc_curve function output

I am using logistic Regression for my analysis. My Accuracy score and AUC score are different X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =train_test_split(x, you, test_size=0.3,random_state=0) LogReg=LogisticRegrssion() LogReg.fit(X_train,y_train) y_pred=LogReg.predict(X_test) accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred) accuracy_score=0.84 When I plotting Roc and Auc curve y_scores_lr = LogReg.fit(X_train,y_train).decisio n_function(X_test) fpr, tpr, _=roc_curve(y_test, y_scores_lr) roc_auc_logreg =auc(fpr, tpr) roc_auc_logreg=0.87 Why there is a difference in results between accuracy_score and roc_curve function output, where I am making mistake that both of these are not matching. Any help on this to correct any error. Thanks in advance.
