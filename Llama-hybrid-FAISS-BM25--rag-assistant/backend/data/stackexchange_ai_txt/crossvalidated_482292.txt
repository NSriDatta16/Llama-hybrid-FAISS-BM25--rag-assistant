I'm a little confused about what your data is but, based on the above information, it does appear to be stationary. This is because there is relatively little persistence in the ACF, meaning that the autocorrelations do not consistently remain close to 1 (see here for a textbook example of a non-stationary ACF). However there is really no substitute for performing a proper statistical test. ADF is a good start here. Broadly speaking, the theory behind it is that you re-write a time-series model in such a way that the first term on the right-hand-side contains all the (autoregressive) parameters of your time series model. As you probably know, non-stationarity occurs when the sum of the parameters in a model is 1, so you then perform a regression on this rewritten model to test whether that first parameter is equal to 1. Below I provide an example using an AR(2) model. Let's assume the model you are trying to specify for your data is AR(2): $$y_t = \psi_1y_{t-1} + \psi_2y_{t-2} + \epsilon_t $$ Now add and subtract $\psi_2y_{t-1}$ to the right-hand side to get: $$y_t = (\psi_1 + \psi_2)y_{t-1} + \psi_2y_{t-2} - \psi_2y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $$ Now note that the 2nd and third terms can be rewritten as a differenced term and that we can rewrite $\psi_1 + \psi_2$ as $\beta$ . Then what we get is: $$y_t = \beta y_{t-1} - \psi_2\Delta y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $$ As explained above you then run an OLS regression that tests whether $\beta = 0$ or not. A more generalised form of the ADF test can be found here , though hopefully the above has provided some intuition. In terms of your results, I would recommend running the ADF test with multiple lags to see if there is a consistent pattern in your results. If you want to choose the k for the optimal number of lags, the typical approach is to calculate the AIC or BIC for different numbers of lags and choose the k that results in a model with the lowest AIC or BIC.
