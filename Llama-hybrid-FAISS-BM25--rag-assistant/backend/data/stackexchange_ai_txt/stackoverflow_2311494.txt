The general way is "measure everything". This, in particular might mean: Ensure time on all servers is the same (use ntp or something similar); Measure how long did it take to generate request (what if request generator has a bug?); Measure when did request leave the client machine(s), or at least how long did it take to do i/o. Sometimes it is enough to know average time necessary for many requests. Measure when did the request arrive. Measure how long did it take to generate a response. Measure how long did it take to send the response. You can probably start from the 5th element, as this is (you believe) your critical chain. But it is best to log as much as you can - as according to what you've said yourself, it takes days to produce different results. If you don't want to modify your code, look for cases where you can sniff data without intervening (e.g. define a servlet filter in your web.xml).
