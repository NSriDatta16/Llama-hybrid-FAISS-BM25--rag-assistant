wmode="opaque" causes selection on textarea to behave wierdly after mouse is pressed and left stage

I m using textarea in flash 10 cs5 as3. The problem is when i try to select a text and go out of stage and leave the mouse then again move mouse on text then selection of text will move with the mouse. Here is what causes that: * click somewhere on the text and drag the mouse in order to select the text * then go out of the swf * leave the mouse * now move mouse on textarea -> the selection of text will move with the mouse... How to stop this behavior???? I tried to implement mouseleave on stage but the problem is i m not able to detect mouseleave event when mouse is pressed and it leaves the stage. This is because of wmode="opaque" parameter. I found out that it doesn't do this when wmode="window". Is there a solution for this?
