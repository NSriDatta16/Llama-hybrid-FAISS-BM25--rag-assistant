Embedding image in QWebView with JavaScript

I am writing a small application with Qt 4.6 (64-bit Arch Linux, though that shouldn't matter) which lets the user edit a document using a QWebView with contentEditable turned on. However, for some reason embedding an image does not work. Here is a code snippet: void LeafEditView::onInsertImage() { // bring up a dialog, ask for an image QString imagePath = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(this,tr("Open Image File"),"/",tr("Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)")); ui->leafEditor->page()->mainFrame()->documentElement().evaluateJavaScript("document.execCommand('insertImage',null,'"+imagePath+"');"); } The test image does in fact exist and yet absolutely nothing happens. Bold / italics / underline all work fine via JavaScript, just not images. Thoughts?
