The power spectrum is the frequency-domain counterpart of the time-domain autocovariance function. According to the frequency-domain view, a white noise process can be viewed as the sum of an infinite number of cycles with different frequencies where each cycle has the same weight. The power spectrum is not used to predict a time series. It is used to examine the main characteristics of the series and propose a time series model accordingly. For example, it can be used to detect if seasonality is present in the data, if so, the spectrum will show peaks at the seasonal frequencies. In principle, the same information can be obtained from both the spectrum and the autocovariance function, but in some contexts it is more convenient to work with the frequency-domain representation. For example, if you are interested in looking at the seasonal frequencies that determine the seasonal pattern observed in the series, the spectrum will show you the cycles that lead that component. If you want to analyze the frequency of some phenomenon such as the business cycle, the spectrum is a straightforward way to get a graphical view to it.
