Practical applications of dimensionality reduction methods: Filtering, Wrapper, Embedded models

Filtering is basically sorting some features and picking top performing ones. Where wrapper in wrapper we go through unused/used features add/remove some of them and test performance over validation. I am expecting wrapper to perform better learning. Where filtering is simple to implement and less costly. And there is another one, that I have no idea: Embedded. Can someone provide some real-life examples and use-cases of these methods? It would be perfect if someone give some detailed information about embedded method.
