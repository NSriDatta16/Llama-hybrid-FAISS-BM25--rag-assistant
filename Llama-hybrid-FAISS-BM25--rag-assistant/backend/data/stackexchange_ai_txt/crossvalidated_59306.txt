Nevermind, I found svm.cpp in the svmlight package and read the svm_predict function. It is written for the general case for n classes but for the simple case of two classes their logic boild down to >> sv=model.SVs; >> svc=model.sv_coef; >> sv546=sv(1:546, :); %Since model.label is [1, -1] and model.nSV=[546; 246] >> sv246=sv(547:end, :); >> svc546=svc(1:546); >> svc246=svc(547:end); >> weight_for_minus1=transpose(svc246)*sv246; %Since model.label is [1, -1] and model.nSV=[546; 246] >> weight_for_plus1=transpose(svc546)*sv546; >> 'now multiply weight_for_minu1 and weight_for_plus1 with the 997-dimensional feature and select whichever is positive'
