Firstly we are going to formalize the hypotheses that you are testing $$H_0 = \{ \text{using condition #1 gives the same results as using condition #2} \}$$ versus $$H_1 = \{ \text{using condition #1 gives different results than using condition #2} \}$$ (I corrected your $H_0$, I think you want to formulate it like this) Then you can formulate your hypothesis in terms of smaller hypothesis $$H_0 = \cap_{i,j \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}} \{ \text{time series $i$ from condition 1 and time series $j$}$$ $$\quad \quad \quad \quad \text{ from condition 2 are comparable}\}$$ Is that correct? Further, in this formulation there are only 5*5=25 smaller hypotheses to test, not 120... With respect to our question,I would say no because significance implies that you are controling the probability for an type 1 error. Instead you are controling the FDR which is another concept.
