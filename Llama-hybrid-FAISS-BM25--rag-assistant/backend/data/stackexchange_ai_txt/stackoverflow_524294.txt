I would definitely recommend the "Head First Design Patterns" book. My suggestion is to read through that book atleast once. And once you get a feel of design patterns, use the "Gang of Four Design Patterns" book for quick reference/refresh. And here are a few links from my bookmarks: http://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-and-tips http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/Patterns.aspx Hope it helps.
