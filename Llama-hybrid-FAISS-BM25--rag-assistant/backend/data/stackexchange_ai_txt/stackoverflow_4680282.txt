COM Interop on Windows Mobile 6

I have an application written in C++ and MFC (VS 2008 SP1) which is running on Windows Mobile 6.1. Now I need to integrate functionalities into this application which is only available through a .NET library from a third-party supplier. My idea was to create my own wrapper/facade .NET assembly around this .NET library which exposes the functions I need for my project and to make this assembly COM-visible for my C++/MFC project. When setting up a project in VS 2008 for this wrapper library (C#, "Smart Device" project type, type "class library", target framework .NET 2.0 (or 3.5), target platform "Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK") I noticed that the options in the project properties to make the assembly COM-visible and to register for COM-Interop are disabled (grayed out in the dialog masks in VS). (When I create a "normal" (not for Smart Device) class library project for framework 2.0 the options are available.) Questions: 1) Is COM-Interop supported on Windows Mobile at all? 2) If so, is this special direction of COM-Interop I need (make .NET assemblies COM-visible to native applications) supported on Windows Mobile? 3) If so, am I doing something wrong by setting up the project? 4) Do I have any other options to solve the problem described in the first paragraph above? Thank you very much for help in advance!
