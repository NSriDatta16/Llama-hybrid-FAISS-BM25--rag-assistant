Generate random variable in real-time without state

I want a function which takes, as input, the number of seconds elapsed since the last time it was called, and returns true or false for whether an event should have happened in that time period. I want it such that it will fire, on average, once per X time passed, say 5 seconds. I also am interested if it's possible to do without any state, which the answer from this question used. I guess to be fully accurate it would have to return an integer for the number of events that should've happened, in the case of it being called once every 10*X times or something like that, so bonus points for that!
