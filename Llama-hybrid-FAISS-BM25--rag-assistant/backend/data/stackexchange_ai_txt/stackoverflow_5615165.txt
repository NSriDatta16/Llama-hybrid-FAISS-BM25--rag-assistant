Should a button consume mouse events?

Right now, my scrollbar is made up of 3 buttons (its children). The buttons currently consume mouse down, up, click, and drag. The scrollbar then hooks into these 3 buttons and does what it wants them to do. Therefore, I do not use the new bubble-up-the-stack feature of my GUI in this scenario. I'm still not quite clear on when I should use this and when I should listen to child events. Is my current technique a good way to do it, or should my button instead not consume these events and receive events intended for the buttons and do stuff based on that? Thanks
