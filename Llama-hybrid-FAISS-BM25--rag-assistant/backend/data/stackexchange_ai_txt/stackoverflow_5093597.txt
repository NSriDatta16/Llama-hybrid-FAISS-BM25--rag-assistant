If the data is text and you need to access it as an integer, a conversion will be required. The only question is which code does the conversion. Depending upon the file format, you could look for classes or libraries that already handle them. Otherwise, keep your code well organized so you don't have to pay attention to the conversion too much. Some options: // Could throw exceptions var x = Convert.ToInt32(text); var x = Int32.Parse(text); // Won't throw an exception, just check the results int x = 0; if (Int32.TryParse(text, out x)) { ... }
