Regression for scattering kernel (physics)

In my kinetic theory research (physics), I encounter the modelling of the scattering kernel $B(X,X')$ via the relation $f(X)=\int B(X,X')f'(X')dX'$ where $X$ and $X'$ are random variables with distribution $f$ and $f'$. We can say that the above equation connects the distribution of input $X'$ and output $X$. I already have the data $(X,X')$ and want to model $B(X,X')$ or at least predict the distribution of $X$ for some special distribution of $X'$. In this case, which regression models or machine learning algorithms are recommended to perform this task?
