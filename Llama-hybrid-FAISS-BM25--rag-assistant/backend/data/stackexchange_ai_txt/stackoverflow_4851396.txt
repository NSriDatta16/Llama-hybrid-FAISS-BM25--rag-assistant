This answer is not specifically for Abraham's Twitter-OAuth API, but applies to Twitter's OAuth API in general. That page only gives you your access token and access token secret to your own apps. This is fine if you don't need your app to be authenticated as any other users, so no need to request request tokens and no need to exchange the request token for access token, you just use your access token However, if you want to authenticate as other users, you will have to go through all the required steps, which is explained in short here: You request the request token. It is only used for signing in, and cannot be used to access user's data. You will get the request token and request token secret. When requesting the request token, you can specify a callback URL which Twitter will send your users to when it is authenticated successfully. You need to keep the request token and secret until the authentication is done. After that, you redirect the user to http://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token= followed by OAuth token. After the user signed in to Twitter and allowed your application, Twitter sends the user back to the callback URL. You exchange the request token for the access token, and you can then discard the request token because you won't need it anymore. You can keep the access token as long as you need it. If you don't keep the access token, you will need to request the request token and exchange it for access token again, and your users will have to sign in again. So basically, if you are creating something that the user needs to sign in using Twitter, you need to do all the steps above to get the user signed in. If you are just using Twitter's API for yourself, you don't need the authentication step. Use your access token. You can check for the tweet's ID by checking for the id_str key on the returned response. If the status isn't posted, Twitter will return an error object. You can specify the default OAuth callback in the application settings page, which will be used when you don't explicitly specify a callback. This is required because if you somehow forget to or did not specify a callback URL, Twitter will still know where to redirect your users to. However, Twitter encourages that you should explicitly specify a callback URL . There are many benefit from using a callback URL, such as being able to specify any URLs as the callback. I used to benefit from this one because my Twitter client runs on two different domains, I could redirect the users back to the right place.
