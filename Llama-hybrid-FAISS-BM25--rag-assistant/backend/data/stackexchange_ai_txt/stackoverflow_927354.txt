Explicit data types are huge for efficiency, and storage. If they are implicit they have to be 'figured' out and therefore incur speed costs. Indexes would be hard to implement as well. I would suspect, although not positive, that having explicit types also on average incur less storage space. For numbers especially, there is no comparison between a binary int and a string of digit characters.
