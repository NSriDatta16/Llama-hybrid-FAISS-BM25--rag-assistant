How do you organize your personal workspace for your code projects in your home folder? As far as UNIXy stuff goes, I place project folders under ~/dev. I'll usually end up checking out something from Subversion into those project folders. And what gives you the most flexibility to work on multiple projects at once? For Web projects, maintaining a set of Apache name-based virtual hosts is extremely handy for working on multiple projects simultaneously. http://foo.localhost/ can point to ~/dev/foo/public, http://bar.localhost/ -> ~/dev/bar/public, and so on. GNU Screen is also key for my local development workflow. If I need to switch gears to another project, I'll just Ctrl-a,c and have a new isolated terminal to use.
