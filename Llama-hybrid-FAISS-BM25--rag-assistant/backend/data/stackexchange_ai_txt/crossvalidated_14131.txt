Full disclosure: I haven't used monomvn before, but glancing at the help files, it doesn't appear that it's really meant to directly impute missing data. Rather it seems intended be a way to estimate the multivariate normal distribution of data with lots of missing values, which is an important difference. If your goal is data imputation, perhaps you should investigate some other imputation method. I'm most familiar with imputation using random forests, but there's an enormous amount of literature out there on this topic. Maybe one way to get started would be to try running findFn("impute") from the sos package.
