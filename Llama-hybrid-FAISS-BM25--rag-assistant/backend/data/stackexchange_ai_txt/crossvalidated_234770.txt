I am still confused about the size of the filter, how convolution it works Here is a great illustration from Stanford's deep learning tutorial (also nicely explained by Denny Britz ). The filter is the yellow sliding window, and its value is: \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} Another neat visualization of convolutions (and deconvolutions a.k.a. transposed convolutions): https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic to get the image shape , the longest maximum sentence in this case is 56 so 56 + 2 * (5-1) = 64 .., what does it mean number 2 ?? where number 2 is obtained? Padding on the left and on the right of the sentence.
