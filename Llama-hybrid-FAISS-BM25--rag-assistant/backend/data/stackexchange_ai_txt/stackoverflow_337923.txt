I think it actually depends on what are you going to do inside your doSomething function. If you are going to access MyObject properties using this keyword then you have to use that. But I think that the following code fragment will also work if you are not doing any special things using object(MyObject) properties. function doSomething(){ ......... } $("#foobar").ready('click', function(){ });
