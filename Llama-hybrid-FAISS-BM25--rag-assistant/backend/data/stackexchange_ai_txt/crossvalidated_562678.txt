There's no problem with your proposed logistic regression - each dummy variable coefficient is just the log-odds of that email resulting in a success (assuming no other regressors). It doesn't really matter if your "control" is actually a control or just another email. I'd be more concerned with comparing various subgroups within each sample. As the number of subgroups grows, the probability of seeing a false positive (e.g. just by change, some subgroup will have a higher success rate on some email).
