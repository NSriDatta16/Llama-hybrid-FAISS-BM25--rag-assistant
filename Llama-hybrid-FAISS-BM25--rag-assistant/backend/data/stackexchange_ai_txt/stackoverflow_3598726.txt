Your data model is fairly complex, so I imagine your application will have to handle a significant number of business rules and interaction possibilities. Sinatra is meant for handling lightweight software architectures. If you choose Sinatra you'll probably encounter design and organization issues you'll have to handle by yourself. Rails implements the MVC pattern and can help you organize your code by offering a lot of useful mechanisms. You still can build a "full-stack" web app with Sinatra but you'll have to do a lot by yourself especially if the amount of functionality you'll provide is high (or will grow). I think Rails fits naturally better in larger architectures. PS : ActiveRecord is available both in Sinatra and Rails.
