After all the good tips given here on escaping your user data before putting it in database, you must as weel think at the second side of the problem. Escape the ouptuts That means every output of your application should be escaped based on the rule of this output format. For example, when you echo something for an HTML page you must escape it via htmlentites, so that any HTMl contined in your data will not be html in the output. And for a csv output you should escape quotes or commas, for JSON you should escape things as well, etc every output has his rules. This thing is sometime used to store data which is potentially dangerous (js code, Html code) in the DB, by only preventing SQL injection before insertion. And then ensuring it is properly escaped before any output. Another way of thinking is to prevent any js or HTML code before the database storage, but you should still escape the output (in case of). Talking about frameworks you should get a look at Zend Framework on the Zend_Filter, Zend_Validate, and the escape functions on views.
