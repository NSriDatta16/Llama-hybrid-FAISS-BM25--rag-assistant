When we use mysql_query() you have to connect before to the DB with mysql_connect() and mysql_select_db() . Everytimes you make a mysql_connect() it cost. So you will make one time mysql_connect() and save the $link . And use this link for every mysql_query("...", $link) In object it's the same but it's more elegant you juste create an instance of the class (so it create a connection to the DB) and use the object has a link. If you change the DB password, you will change it one time, just in the class. If you change MySQL for PostgreSQL, you will rewrite your code one time, just in the class. It will not affect the rest of your app.
