Let's say that in this way. The easiest way to ascertain the relation among different features and the outputs is to use covariance matrix. You can even visualise the data for each class. Take a look at the following image. Suppose that the vertical axis is the output and the horizontal axis is for one of the features. As you can see, having knowledge about the features informs us of the changes in the output. Now, consider the following illustration. In this figure, you can see that considering this typical feature does not inform you of the changes in the output. Another approach can be using PCA which finds the appropriate features itself. What it does is finding a linear combination of important features which are more relevant to the output.
