A couple of weeks ago, I suggested a solution on SO using genetic algorithms to solve a problem of graph layout. It is an example of a constrained optimization problem. Also in the area of machine learning, I implemented a GA-based classification rules framework in c/c++ from scratch. I've also used GA in a sample project for training artificial neural networks (ANN) as opposed to using the famous backpropagation algorithm . In addition, and as part of my graduate research, I've used GA in training Hidden Markov Models as an additional approach to the EM-based Baum-Welch algorithm (in c/c++ again).
