When one does not know the transformation in advance, you can hope to get lucky by trying one transformation in addition to the identity transformation (leaving things alone). Trying a total of two transformations is probably not very harmful to statistical inference. But in general we don't know enough about the transformation and all this brings arbitrariness to the analysis and uncertainty in how to control type I error and confidence interval coverage. For these and other reasons I am recommending more and more that semiparametric models be standard choices. For this problem the proportional odds (PO) ordinal logistic model, with no binning of $Y$ , is a good choice. This is a generalization of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Kruskal-Wallis tests. The PO model is transformation-invariant except when using it to estimate $E(Y|X)$ . It is robust and competitive with normal-theory methods even if normality holds. The R rms package orm function efficiently handles ordinal models for continuous $Y$ . Here is an ordinal analysis using the R rms package. I have included an interaction between cohort and sex.
