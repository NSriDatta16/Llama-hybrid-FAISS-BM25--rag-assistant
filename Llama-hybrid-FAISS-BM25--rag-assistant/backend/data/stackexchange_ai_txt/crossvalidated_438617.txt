When should one use Bradley-Terry instead of gradient boosted trees for pairwise ranking

Both the Bradley-Terry model and Gradient boosted trees can be used to learn a ranking from pairwise comparisons (e.g. with libraries choix and XGboost ). How do they relate to each other? Is there any situation in which one might be preferable to the other? I would say that gradient boosted trees are more general than Bradley-Terry, so the only advantage of using Bradley-Terry might be in terms of training time / possibly robustness to overfitting, but I would like to hear other opinions on this.
