I'd recommend the Range object's AutoFill method for this: rngSource.AutoFill Destination:=rngDest Specify the Source range that contains the values or formulas you want to fill down, and the Destination range as the whole range that you want the cells filled to. The Destination range must include the Source range. You can fill across as well as down. It works exactly the same way as it would if you manually "dragged" the cells at the corner with the mouse; absolute and relative formulas work as expected. Here's an example: 'Set some example values' Range("A1").Value = "1" Range("B1").Formula = "=NOW()" Range("C1").Formula = "=B1+A1" 'AutoFill the values / formulas to row 20' Range("A1:C1").AutoFill Destination:=Range("A1:C20") Hope this helps.
