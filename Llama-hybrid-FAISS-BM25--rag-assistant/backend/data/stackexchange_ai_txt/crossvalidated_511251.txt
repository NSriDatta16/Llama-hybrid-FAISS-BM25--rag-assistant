I have a set of variables that are correlated to the magnitude of my target variable but not with respect to the direction

If I am expecting to predict returns by using say for instance average price volatility and volume in a time window, then these variables would not help predict the direction but would help improve the accuracy with respect to the magnitude. How do i combine these variables along with others which help predict direction in a regression model
