There is the WM_DROPFILES Message . I guess that you could use CreateToolhelp32Snapshot to locate the window that is IP Messenger and then build the DROPFILES structure to send with the WM_DROPFILES message. The final link would be to Codeproject, with some help on creating the DROPFILES structure: How to Implement Drag and Drop Between Your Program and Explorer . Instead of using CreatToolhelp32Snapshot you could be using FindWindow function. Here you will get the HWND for IP Messenger directly, instead of CTh32S , which will only locate the HANDLE for the process. When this is done you create the DROPFILES structure. Read the comments on the CodeProject link in the "Initiating a drag and drop" section for more info of how. And finally you send it with sendmessage SendMessage(ipMessHWND, WM_DROPFILES, (HDROP)&myDropFiles, 0);
