Here is a partial, negative answer: Without additional information there is no hope to answer your question. Let us only consider one location with $100$ customers - let's label them $\#1, \ldots, \#100$. Customer $\#1$ spends on average $\$1$ and customers $\#2, \ldots, \#100$ each spend $\$100$ on average. Consider two scenarios: In scenario $X$ the costumer $\#1$ is a regular and he visited our location $900$ times in our data set. Costumers $\#2, \ldots, \#100$ each visited only once. Their total spendings are $\$900 + \$990 = \$1890$ in $1000$ visits. We thus should expect an average spend of $\$18.90$ per visit. In scenario $Y$ each costumer visited our location $10$ times. Their total spendings are thus $10 \cdot (\$1 + 99 \cdot \$100) = \$9910$ which yields an average of $\$99.10$ per visit. With the data you seem to have available, these scenarios are indistinguishable... Since you seem to be interested in real life applications rather than made up scenarios, there might still be some hope. For example, you might be able to take data of similar locations into consideration which would allow you to guess some additional information.
