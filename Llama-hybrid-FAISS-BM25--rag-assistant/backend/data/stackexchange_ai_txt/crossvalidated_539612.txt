What are the meanings of Node Classification, Link Prediction, Graph Classification in Graph Neural Network?

I am currently studying Graph Neural Network but I have some difficulty in understanding what I can do after having studied Graph Neural Network. From having gained a bit of understand in Graph Neural Network, I can do Node Classification, Link Prediction, and Graph Classification but I don't really understand what those 3 terms mean. It is like I can study and understand how node embedding works with math but don't really understand where to use it. While studying this topic, all the contents explains where I can use it but those explanations are not really clear to me. Hope somebody gives me clears examples of the three terms in my question.
