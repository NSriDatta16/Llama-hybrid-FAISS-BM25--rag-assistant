Sitecore: Forcing pasting as unformatted text

Is there a good way to force pasting as text inside Rich Text Fields inside Sitecore? I know there's a "Paste as Text" button in the Rich Text Editor itself, but content authors are almost definitely going to just hit Ctrl+V or Right-Click->Paste to put the text in, and if that content came from Word, all hell breaks loose with the markup. The workaround we have so far is to paste into notepad and then to copy that text and paste it into the Rich Text Field, but that solution is inelegant and I hate it. Thank you for your time.
