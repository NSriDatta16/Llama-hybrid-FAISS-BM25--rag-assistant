SIP Subscribe Receives 486 BUSY HERE

I am trying to SUBSCRIBE to a watcher list and the server frequently responds with 486 BUSY HERE. However, the RFCs describe 486 as a possible response for an INVITE, which make more sense for this response. At other times, the server does respond correctly - with a 200 OK, followed by a NOTIFY request. I am working with an ALU IMS core. Has anyone seen this issue?
