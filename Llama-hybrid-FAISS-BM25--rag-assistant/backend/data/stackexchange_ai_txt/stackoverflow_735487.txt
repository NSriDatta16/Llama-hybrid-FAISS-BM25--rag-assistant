Autogrows on the database? Check for messages in the SQL error logs. Page splits due to inserted records? Check table fragmentation with DBCC SHOWCONTIG Antivirus scans? Don't. Out of date statistics? Don't rely on auto-update statistics on tables that change a lot. Don't rule out a problem on the client end, or the networking between them. Run profiler with a filter on duration, only capturing events with duration > 10 seconds, look for patterns in parameters, clients, time of day.
