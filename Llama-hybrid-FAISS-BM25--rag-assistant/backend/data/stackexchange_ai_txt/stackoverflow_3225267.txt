how to create a "nested split" of sorts

This seems like it should be fairly simple, but for some reason I can't think of the right way to do this: I have a string h that looks something like one(two(three four) five six) seven . I'd like to split this up into an array of hashes so that the output is something like {'one' => {'two' => {'three' => nil, 'four' => nil}, 'five'=>nil, 'six'=>nil }, 'seven'=>nil} We can assume that there are equal numbers of parenthesis. Is there any easy way to do this? In a language that encourages use of for looks, this would be relatively simple; I don't think I've been using Ruby long enough to get a feel for the Ruby way of doing this sort of problem. Thanks!
