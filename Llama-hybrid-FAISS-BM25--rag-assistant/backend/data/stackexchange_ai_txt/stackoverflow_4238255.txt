jQtouch webapp behaving working fine on mac Safari but won't work on iPhone Safari

This is my first web app and I developed this one by following Jonathan Stark's Building iphone apps with HTML, css and javascript. Everything was testing ok on my mac safari, even when I select Develop > User Agent > Mobile Safari... You can view the above site in your safari and see it's working fine. However when I finally (thought I had) finished everything and view stuffs from my iPhone safari, the whole world collapsed... Things are so messed up. I'm using jQtouch and I somehow get an idea that it might because I'm pulling data from JSON files... Because if I pull data from the local storage (like favorites and combination), it's working fine without any issue. However if it's pulling data from JSON, then it'll turn into a mess... My JSON file is located here: http://hongteetrading.com/demos/pronouncecn/lib/names.json The javascript used for pulling data: $.getJSON("lib/names.json",function(data) { $.each(data.names,function(i,val){ if(val.spelling==id){ ... } I guess there could be any better ways of doing it? Or what kind of data-interchange formate you're using with jQtouch?
