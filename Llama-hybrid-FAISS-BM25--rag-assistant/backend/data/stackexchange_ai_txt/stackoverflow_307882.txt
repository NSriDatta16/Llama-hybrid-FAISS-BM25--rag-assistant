jQuery draggable table elements

jQuery's draggable functionality doesn't seem to work on tables (in FF3 or Safari). It's kind of difficult to envision how this would work, so it's not really surprising that it doesn't. div.table { display: table; } div.row { display: table-row; } div.cell { display: table-cell; } $(document).ready(function(){ $(".row").draggable(); }); Foo Bar Spam Eggs Foo Bar Spam Eggs I'm was wondering a) if there's any specific reason why this doesn't work (from a w3c/HTML spec perspective) and b) what the right way to go about getting draggable table rows is. I like real tables because of the border collapsing and row height algorithm -- any alternative that can do those things would work fine.
