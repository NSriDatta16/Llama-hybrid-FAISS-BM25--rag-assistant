How can I embed a PDF in an email?

I've already referred to this SO post . I've been embedding images using an AlternateView for PNG files. Now I'm wondering how to do it with PDFs. Should it work, for the LinkedResource, to just say: Dim document As New LinkedResource(pdfFilePath, "image/pdf") I'm just trying to figure out how to get the PDF to be embedded like I could with an image, or is that not possible and I'll have to do it as an attachment?
