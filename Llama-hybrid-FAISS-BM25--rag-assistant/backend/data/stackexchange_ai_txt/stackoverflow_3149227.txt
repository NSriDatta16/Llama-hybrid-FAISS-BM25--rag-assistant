Every ORM that claims linq support, supports linq to a degree, however the completeness of the implementations vary greatly, sometimes because of the way the ORM is implemented, sometimes because of the quality of the Linq implementation. Even the Linq implementations between Linq to Sql and Entity Framework v4 vary greatly, if you then look at NHibernate's or LlblGenPro's implementations you will find there are queries that are possible in sql that each doesn't support in the same way, if at all, or that the support with different levels of efficiency. You really need to evaluate the particular ORM's Linq implementation against the type of data retrieval you tend/want to do.
