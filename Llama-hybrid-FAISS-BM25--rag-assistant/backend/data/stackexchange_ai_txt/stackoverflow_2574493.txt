There are two ways to capture network traffic directly from an Android emulator: Copy and run an ARM-compatible tcpdump binary on the emulator, writing output to the SD card, perhaps (e.g. tcpdump -s0 -w /sdcard/emulator.cap ). Run emulator -tcpdump emulator.cap -avd my_avd to write all the emulator's traffic to a local file on your PC In both cases you can then analyse the pcap file with tcpdump or Wireshark as normal.
