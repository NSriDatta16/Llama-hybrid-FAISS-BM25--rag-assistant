How to create an index of a several variables that best summarizes them?

I want to describe the "influence" of some internet content, where "influence" is loosely defined as its virality/popularity among the audience. For each link, I have information such as the number of clicks, views, favorites, shares, etc. I'd like to turn them into a single index. Intuitively, some factors should be weighted more than other (e.g. shares should be more "influential" than views), but how should I calculate their weights? PCA seems like an option, but are there other good methods (especially in the case where the 1st component of PCA summarizes a lower percentage of the data)?
