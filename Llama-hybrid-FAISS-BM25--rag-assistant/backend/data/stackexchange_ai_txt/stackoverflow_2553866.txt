If scrolling in UIScrollView is enabled then touchMoved events are not propagated to the scroll view contents. How to workaround that depends on what you want to achieve. In my application I needed just to drag an object inside UIScrollView and I did the following in contentsView touch handlers for that: In touchesBegan: event I checked if I tapped object to be dragged. If YES - then disabled scrolling in UIScrollView Then as scrolling was disabled my contents view started to receive touchesMoved event and I could "drag" my object there. In touchesEnded: I reenabled scrolling. If you want something more complex you can subclass UIScrollView and try to override its touch handlers (see also hitTest:withEvent: method)
