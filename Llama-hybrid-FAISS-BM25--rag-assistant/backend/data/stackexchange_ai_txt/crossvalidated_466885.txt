What to do if you have two training samples with same features but different labels?

I'm curious to know what can be done in the case where two training samples have the same description but different labels. For example, the sample below: `hasFur, hasTwoEyes, hasFourLegs`, `dog` `hasFur, hasTwoEyes, hasFourLegs`, `cat` `...other samples`, `labels I think that a model like Naive Bayes wouldn't work too well if there were a few training samples that had matching descriptions with different labels. Would it be better to remove these samples assuming the sample space is enormous? In addition, I read on Stackoverflow that SVM could perform better using regularization techniques. Note: The example is unrealistic but I am using it since I haven't run into any real world cases.
