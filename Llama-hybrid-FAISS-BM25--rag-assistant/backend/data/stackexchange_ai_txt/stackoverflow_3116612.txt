I dont see anything wrong with those two approaches . However setting the innerHTML is better from performance point of view . In some cases creating the elements dynamically is the only option , you might want to take a look at documentFragment to avoid a lot of reflows ( again for performance reason ) . ECMA specifies addEventListener to add listeners dynamically to your elements . You would also want to read about event bubbling .
