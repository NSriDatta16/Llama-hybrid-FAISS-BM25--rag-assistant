Conflict vs Overlap in Snorkel Label Analyzer

I am currently working on a weakly supervised approach to labeling training data. Snorkel helps make the process a lot easier by providing methods to facilitate labeling, modeling, etc. Snorkel Tutorial Following along the tutorial I wrote similar labeling Functions as follows, @labeling_function() def dips_contains_fondue(x): return Dips if "fondue" in x.text.lower() else ABSTAIN where Dips and ABSTAIN are variables with numeric values. Using their LFAnalysis API gives a matrix with all sorts of useful information. Adding more LFs and computing over my sample data, this is the output of LFAnalysis, I understand the following, Coverage: % of samples for which at least one LF votes positive or negative Polarity: tells you what values the LF returns. But I am unable to distinguish between overlap and conflicts. More intuitively, what does it mean when they are equal, or more generally how is the calculation done? This is the API doc , but I am afraid they don't show details on the computation.
