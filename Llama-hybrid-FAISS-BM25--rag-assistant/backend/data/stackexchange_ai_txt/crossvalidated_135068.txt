Forecasting from different time horizon

I have a time series of log returns (from 01-01-2007 to 31-12-2012). I need to predict the t+1,t+2, ....... t+1510 log stock returns. Basically, what I need is to predict the 1 day ahead return for every single day. So I would like to predict the return on the 02-01-2007, the 03-01-2007........till the 01-01-2013. I have therefore done the following coding using fGARCH in R : AIG But this gives me the prediction on a single forecast horizon (so it gives me the forecast 1, 2,3.....1510 days from the 01-01-2007) not the forecast on the 02-01-2007, 03-01-2007,...........01-01-2013. Please can anyone help me to find a different way of coding. Thank you.
