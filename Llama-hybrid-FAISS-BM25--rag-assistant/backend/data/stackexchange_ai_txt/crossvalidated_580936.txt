Diagnose singular fit error in linear mixed effects model

Below is a snippet of real data that I am analyzing for a project. I typically use Bayesian models and am not that familiar with LMEMs but I've been asked to fit them here. I know there is no association between the response and the predictor, but I want to understand if any variation in the predictor is explained by a group factor--or at least develop an intuition for why LMEMs won't work here. Here is a reproducible example. library(lme4) response This produces the following result: boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: response ~ predictor + (1 | group) Data: testdat REML criterion at convergence: 156.7178 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev. group (Intercept) 1.255e-18 Residual 9.844e-01 Number of obs: 55, groups: group, 2 Fixed Effects: (Intercept) predictor -8.244e-18 1.760e-01 optimizer (nloptwrap) convergence code: 0 (OK) ; 0 optimizer warnings; 1 lme4 warnings I'm not worried about alternative ways to analyze the data, but I would appreciate help developing an intuition for why the LMEM failed to fit these data. The real dataset has many more groups (~20) but about the same mean number of samples per group (~23).
