Multiple testing and logistic regression

I want to perform a number of univariate regressions with different symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sneezing) as the response variable and one categorical variable (which is always the same each time) as an explanatory variable - age group (0-4, 5-14, 15-64, 65+). In total there are 18 symptoms so hence, I want to do 18 regressions and want to correct for multiple testing using Holm's method. For each regression I get 4 p-values - one overall age group p-value and 3 p-values comparing individual age groups to a reference age group (15-64). I am unsure about how to calculate confidence intervals and adjusted p-values using Holm's method in this scenario. Does anybody know how to do this?
