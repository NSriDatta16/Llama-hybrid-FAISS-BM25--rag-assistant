UIWebView 's cannot (or will not) use the HTML5 appcache. They just don't. Maybe in iPhone OS 4.0. But what you can do is fetch all the files yourself with network calls (or just have them in your app bundle) and load up the webview with a local URL pointing to your local HTML file, which can have relative URLs to local assets. There is no super simple "it just works" way to make this happen, however.
