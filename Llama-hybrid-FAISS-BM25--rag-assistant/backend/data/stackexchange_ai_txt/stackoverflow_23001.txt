Any good tools to automate SQL Server management tasks?

I know I could write scripts and create jobs to run them, but at least some of what I'm wanting it to do is beyond my programming abilities for that to be an option. What I'm imagining is something that can run on a regular schedule that will examine all the databases on a server and automatically shrink data and log files (after a backup, of course) when they've reached a file size that contains too much free space. It would be nice if it could defrag index files when they've become too fragmented as well. I guess what I'm probably looking for is a DBA in a box! Or it could just be that I need better performance monitoring tools instead. I know how to take care of both of those issues, but it's more that I forget to check for those issues until I start seeing performance issues with my apps.
