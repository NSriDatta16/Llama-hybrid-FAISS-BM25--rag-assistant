Since your matrix has nonnegative values, it might make sense to use nonnegative matrix factorization. There exist toolkits that are able to perform it for sparse data (for example this one and BTW the results can also be constrained to be sparse). Actually if you dig into NMF you'd see that basic algorithms for that problem use direct matrix manipulation, which means there shouldn't be problem with sparse matrices. If you run into problems with scalability, you can always try to sample a training set and then evaluate results of dimensionality reduction on the rest (just like you'd do in supervised learning, where you train and then are more interested in the test set error).
