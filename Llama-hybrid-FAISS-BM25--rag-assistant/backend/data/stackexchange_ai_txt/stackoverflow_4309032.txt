Caliburn.Micro & Infragistics XamDockManager + TabGroupPane

I'm trying to get the Infragistics TabGroupPane to integrate with Caliburn.Micro as per the standard WPF TabControl. I've tried adding a new convention in the bootstrapper (a modification of the standard WPF one) but have not had any success. My TabGroupPane is defined as: When an item is added to the collection an exception is thrown "InvalidOperationException: A TabGroupPane can only contain 'ContentPane' and 'ContentPanePlaceholder' instances". Also, if my TabGroupPane is inside a DockManager: It doesn't appear to be found by Caliburn at all. Has anyone else done this before? Cheers! Update I have created my own dock manager class, a blog post explaining it or just the code on bitbucket . Hopefully this will be useful to someone!
