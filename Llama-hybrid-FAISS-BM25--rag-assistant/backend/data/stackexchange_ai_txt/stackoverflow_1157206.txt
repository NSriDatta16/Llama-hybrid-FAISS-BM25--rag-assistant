In order to actually get the machine code for your functions in an automated way during the build process, I suggest putting them in a seperate .c file, then compiling this to position-independent code in an object file: gcc -Wall -c -fPIC functions.c -o functions.o Then use objdump to dump out the dissassembly: objdump -d functions.o Throw away everything except the hex codes, put them into a C structure with xdd -i. Note that you will have some pretty severe restrictions on this code if you don't want to deal with relocation - no access to variables with static storage duration, no access to external functions. It would be best to check with objdump -r to make sure there are no relocations needed.
