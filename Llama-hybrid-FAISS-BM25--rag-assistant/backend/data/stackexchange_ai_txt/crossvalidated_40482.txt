How to compare dependent variables with different units using Grammar of Graphics paradigm?

My data analysis workflow is through R and ggplot2 , in part because ggplot2 discourages me from making 'bad' (misleading, etc.) plots. However, I sometimes would like to make plots that compare multiple unlike dependent variables against a common independent variable, like below: . This is usually done by adding multiple axes. ggplot can't add multiple axes. I realize that I have several ways around this: I could move out of ggplot for this type of plot, or I could probably hack something within ggplot. My question is how I should deal with with this. The ggplot way to deal with this is by facetting, but often I want to facet by other variables. (For instance, with the pictured example, I might have collected the data at multiple locations and altitudes). Is Grammar of Graphics just a bad paradigm for this kind of dataset, or is there some presentation option that would work well?
