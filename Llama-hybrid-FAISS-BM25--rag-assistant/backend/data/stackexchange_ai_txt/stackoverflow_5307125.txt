you can change the hash tag to whatever you want, but a constant character or string is required for it to work as intended: /* Provides the deep linking value without the query string. */ public static function getPath():String { var value:String = SWFAddress.getValue(); if (value.indexOf('?') != -1) { return value.split('?')[0]; } else if (value.indexOf('#') != -1) { return value.split('#')[0]; } else { return value; } you'll also have to change all instances of "#" in SWFAddress.js and SWFAddressOptimizer.js to match your new character or string value. keep in mind that it's not encouraged to change this value, and replacing it with a simple value (like "3") will likely cause problems.
