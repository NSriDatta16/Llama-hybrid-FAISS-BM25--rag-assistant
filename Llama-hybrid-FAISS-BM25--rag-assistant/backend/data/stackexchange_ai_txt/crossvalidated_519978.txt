Why permuting a predictor gives a measure of the importance of the variable?

I am reading the vignette for the R package randomForestExplainer. This package allows us the compute the importance of variables in a random forest model. The result of the function accuracy_decrease (classification) is defined as mean decrease of prediction accuracy after X_j is permuted Questions: What is the point of permuting the predictor? Why permuting the predictor changes the accuracy? Why the change in the accuracy when we permute the predictor gives us a measure of the importance of the variable? Related question
