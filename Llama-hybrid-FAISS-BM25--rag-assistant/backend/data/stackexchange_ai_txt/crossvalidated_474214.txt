Do we estimate parameters of a prior?

I had a course of Bayesian statistics, but I don't understand it at all. I calculated a posteriori distribution and Bayesian decision rules of something like that, but I don't understand what is this all about. For example in Bayesian statistics we assume that we've got a random variable $$X \sim p(\theta)$$ and $\theta$ is also a random variable: $$ \theta \sim p(\lambda).$$ We can also assume that $\lambda$ is a random variable as well $$\lambda \sim p(\mu)$$ and so on, so on, but we must stop at one point and assume that the parameter is just a number/vector of numbers. Let's assume that $$\lambda \sim p(\mu)$$ and $\mu$ is just a number/vector of numbers. Could you explain me if we estimate $\mu$ somehow or we have to just assume its value (for instance that $\mu=5$ )?
