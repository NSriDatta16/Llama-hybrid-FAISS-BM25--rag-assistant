Use a UNION ALL with two queries. Each table's query will just have NULL in all the columns for the other table. For example: SELECT 'event' as type, datetime, location, organizer, NULL as notes FROM events UNION ALL SELECT 'user_note', datetime, NULL, NULL, notes FROM user_notes ORDER BY datetime DESC The type field can either be a string or an integer to easily distinguish which table the row came from.
