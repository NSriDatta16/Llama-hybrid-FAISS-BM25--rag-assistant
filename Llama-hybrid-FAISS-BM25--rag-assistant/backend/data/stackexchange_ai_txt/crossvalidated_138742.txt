"Feature" and "independent variable" are different terms for the same thing. "Feature" is more common in machine learning, whereas "independent variable" is more common in statistics. So yes, in this case, TV is both a feature and an independent variable. Some more mostly equivalent terms are "covariate", "predictor", and "regression input". Editing four years later to add: some psychologists and other social scientists reserve the term "independent variable" for a variable that has been randomly assigned or otherwise manipulated by the experimenter. "Predictor" or another word is then used for the other variables. But statisticians don't usually restrict the word like this.
