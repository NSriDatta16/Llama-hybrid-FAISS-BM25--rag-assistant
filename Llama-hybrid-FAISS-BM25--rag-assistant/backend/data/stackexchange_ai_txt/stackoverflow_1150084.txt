Drag rectangle on JFrame in Java

I want to draw rectangle based on mousedrag event. if user dragging the mouse, then the rectangle on the applet should increase or decrease basing on current mouse coordinates. i have the following code. in the following code i am using SelectionArea class which extends a canvas on which i am performing drawing operation. i am using image variable in this class for double buffering to reduce flickering and to save the applet's previous state(i.e drawing content of applet) but the code is working fine if i draw first rectangle. if i start to draw second rectangle the previously drawn rectangle is disappearing. i want the previously drawn rectangle to be on the screen plz tell me how to solve this.
