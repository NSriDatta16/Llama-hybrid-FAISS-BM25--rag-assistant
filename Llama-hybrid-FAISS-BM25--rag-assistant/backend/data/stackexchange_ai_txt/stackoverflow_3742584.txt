powershell - check if pdf is encrypted

Using powershell I need to loop a series of pdf file and make some operation on them using pdftk. I'd like to know if exists some method to detect if pdf is encrypted or not. In this way, if the pdf is encrypted I don't work on it and my loop skips to the next file. Thanks for the attention. edit. While I wait for some answer I've found that itextsharp has an isencrypted method. After I load the assembly [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom("c:\my_path\itextsharp.dll") what do I have to do to use the above method?
