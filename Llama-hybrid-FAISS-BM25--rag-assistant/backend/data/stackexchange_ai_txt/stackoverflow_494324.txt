HTML fragment links work with CSS positioning?

Last night I decided to add HTML fragment links in my computer listing page. However, no matter the pattern of linking, or whichever browser I use, those fragment links are simply not navigatable. http://icelava.net/mycomputers.aspx#SEPHIROTH http://icelava.net/mycomputers.aspx#DIABLO UPDATE on Answer: the links now flow correctly to the fragment locations after my mistake with the tag attribute has been highlighted. I did not find any real answer, but from what I have read, there are hints to suggest that my use of CSS positioning to form the two-column layout with two DIVs may be giving the browser trouble in figuring the vertical location of the fragment links. #ContentCol { margin-right: 130px; padding: 3px; } #RightSideCol { background-color: #fff; float: right; padding: 0px; width: 126px; } If that is the case, what would an appropriate approach be to allow HTML fragment links?
