Random Forest different results for same observation

Hi I am fairly new to Random Forest estimation, but I could not find a questions similiar to mine. I was surprised that the predictions are different using the same predictors. I would have expected the same. I understand, that the model would be different with each estimation, but getting different predictions for the same predictors? library(randomForest) set.seed(100) df The results for the last Observation on the Volvo142E are similiar but not the same. Why?
