If you have IP in code which must be protected at all costs, then you should make your software's functionality available as a service, on a secured remote server. Good obfuscation will protect you up to a point, but it's all about the amount of effort required to break it against the 'reward' of having the code. If you are talking about stopping your average business user, then a commercial obfuscator should be sufficient.
