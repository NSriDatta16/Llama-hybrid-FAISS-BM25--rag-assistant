Performance tuning CakePHP application

I just got this quite large CakePHP app (about 20k lines of code), which isn't very clean and there is no documentation at all. The app is running in production, but it has really major problems with performance. Server is Quad core with 8GB RAM, but the app can serve only about 3-4 requests/s, which is very very bad. Each request takes about 20-30% of all four CPUs. When I try even little load test like ab -n 100 -c 10 ... , it goes up to 7000ms average response. However, I never made it over 800MB RAM, so there is at least 6GB free RAM for some tweaking. The problem is, that I haven't been yet able to create working development instance, so I have to tune it in production ... What do you recommend for easy boosting the performance, without too much digging into source code?
