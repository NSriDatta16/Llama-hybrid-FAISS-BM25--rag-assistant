[Updated the answer based on input from @whuber below.] Although, based on an initial look it might seem that the variance of the error decreases with as the value of $cont2$ increases, this is one of those cases where hetero-scedisticity cannot be reliably inferred. It could be that, due the nature of sampling, you have more data points around small value of $cont2$ (which makes it look like there is more variance around there). Also, isolated large values of $cont2$ will have higher leverage and thus lower prediction error.
