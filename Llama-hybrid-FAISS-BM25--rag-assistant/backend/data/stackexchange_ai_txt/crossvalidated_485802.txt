Predictive power of a data set

I am reading a book on machine learning for undergraduate. I am actually confused on linear regression flexibility as the say: Occasionally, linear regression will fail to recover a good solution for a data set. While this may be because our data doesnâ€™t actually have predictive power , it might also just indicate that our data is provided in a format unsuitable for linear regression. I read some questions here related to predictive power and I noticed that it's all about the model produced. What do we mean when we talk about the predictive power of a dataset? I think of it as there is no relationship between features (as linear regression is intented to learn the relationship between the inputs X and the output Y ). But I am not convinced of this answer yet.
