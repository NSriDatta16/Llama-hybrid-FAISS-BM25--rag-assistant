As hinted in a comment, programmatically resetting USB ports is an OS-specific feature . In Windows the easiest approach is probably by leveraging WMI aka Windows Management Instrumentation . You can get several snippets that "mess" with USB ports, in various languages, by searching the web with "WMI", "USB" and such keywords. This MSDN article is of broader interest than just USB controllers but provides a good overview of the CIM model and WMI interface. Edit: Indeed if this question pertains to Windows, I just discovered it is a duplicate on SO: Connect and disconnect usb programmaticaly without unplug and replug Windows power-off a usb device in software BTW, both these links were identified automatically by SO, in the " Related " list on the right of the page ==> We need to remember to check thislist more systematically ==> In many cases, this list is damn good
