If it's a personal site, do whatever pleases you. If it's a business site, consider the financial impact of each decision, comparing revenue lost from visitors on unsupported browsers compared to the development costs of supporting them. First gather browsers statististics: if it's an existing site, you should have them already. If it's a new site, you'll need to look for statistics from similar sites. Of course, you don't need an all-or-nothing approach. You could support older versions of IE, but with limited functionality. Decide the maximum amount of resources you want to devote to IE6 and see what you can do under that restraint. You could also try grouping IE6 into the same category as mobile devices and other user agents with limited standards support. Not only do you not have to drop IE6 support, you've got even more browsers covered. I'm not saying this will be easy, or even possible, since IE6's behavior may be too different from the other low-web-tech user agents.
