From playing around with LSTM for sequence classification it had the same effect as increasing model capacity in CNNs (if you're familiar with them). So you definitely get gains especially if you are underfitting your data. Of course double edged as you can also over fit and get worse performance. In my case I went from 1 LSTM to a stack of 2 and get pretty much instant improvement.
