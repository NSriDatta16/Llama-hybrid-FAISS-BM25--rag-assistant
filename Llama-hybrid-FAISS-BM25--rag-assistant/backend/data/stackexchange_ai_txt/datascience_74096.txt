To chime in my own two cents; One can also very easily shift his/her target column up by a couple of observations to create the same effect as a delay; Say you want to predict some time series, but you want to predict the value that lies "3 time steps in the future" from the last observation you are feeding into your time series. You can simply create a column in your dataframe: FUTURE_PERIOD_PREDICT = 3 df['future'] = df['current'].shift(-FUTURE_PERIOD_PREDICT) Of course, this method will generate 3 nan at the end of your dataset which will have to be dealed with somehow. I think a delay parameter in the tf.keras API would be more elegant than this "workaround"
