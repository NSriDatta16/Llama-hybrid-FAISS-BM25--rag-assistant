Power transforms suggested by the error variance being linked to the expected value can be useful Detrending or not and should I always take log first? and here When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? BUT more often there may be points in the error variance changes deterministically Removing Variance in Time Series After Applying Log Transformation . Daily data should be modelled (read " generally stay clear of simple 365 period arima stuff " ) when human habits create daily effects, monthly effects , lead and lag effects around holidays , day-of-the-month-effects , week-of-the-month effects . week-of-the-year effects et al. After identifying level shifts and or local time trends then study the residuals for an ARIMA modification. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=user%3a3382%20daily for a number of interesting example where daily data is analyzed using a hybrid approach of time effects and memory.
