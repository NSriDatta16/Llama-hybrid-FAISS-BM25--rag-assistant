Flex 4 app, coldfusion help

I have some* experience using the flex framework for building web apps. But I have no experience with server side languages, I have heard the saying "choose one and stick to it" several times in reference to programming. I have chosen coldfusion. Now I have no clue what to do or where to start. Now to the details: It will be a site for food showcases. Food menus sorted by cultural origin, vegetarian or meat kind, etc. Things like that. I intend to build a web site that enables subscriptions, and keeps them updated whenever updates are made. And a commenting system to encourage user feedback. And I would like the site to have a database of food items (as mentioned earlier); from my research coldfusion will enable me to do this. I would like resources that I could go to, and do more research myself. And all recommendations that can be provided. Whether you think I dont need coldfusion, and if I can get this done with just flex and as3. I appreciate all feedback, thanks for taking the time to read and respond. * = not much experience, still a "beginner"
