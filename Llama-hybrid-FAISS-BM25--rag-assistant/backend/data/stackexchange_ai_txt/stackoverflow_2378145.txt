My company does Business Web Applications. Most of the times we use a SOA Architectre with ADF or PHP frontend, so it does not matter how things are named, because most of the HTML is rendered from components (It reduces the freedom you have in free HTML, but makes it faster to develop). Also our Teams are not organized by Topics, they are put in different technical areas, like Database, GUI or Performance. The big advantage is, that you can reuse some of the Web-services in different Applications, without having to contact to original developer.
