A better (and quicker) approach might be to reduce down the SELECTed set before applying the ORDER BY. I use this kind of approach: SELECT * FROM Locations WHERE abs(Latitude - 51.123) ...where (51.123, 0.123) is the centre latitude / longitude point you're searching relative to, and the values of 0.12 and 0.34 are used to narrow down your search to a lat/long square-on-a-sphere of an appropriate size (i.e. a square of n kilometres by n kilometres at that point on the Earth's sphere, where the size depends on the average geographical distribution of your locations). I use the degree length formulae from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude to work out what these values should be given the search point's position on the Earth's sphere.
