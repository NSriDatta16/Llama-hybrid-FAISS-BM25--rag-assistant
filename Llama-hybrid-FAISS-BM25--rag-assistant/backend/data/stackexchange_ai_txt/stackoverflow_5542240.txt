Based on a suggestion from MSalters, and an answer from C++, statically detect base classes with differing addresses? , here is the closest thing to an answer I can come up with. It's probably gcc-specific, and requires knowing some member of the base class: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Winvalid-offsetof" // To suppress warning. BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(offsetof(C, a) == offsetof(A, a)); BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(offsetof(C, b) != offsetof(B, b)); #pragma GCC diagnostic warn "-Winvalid-offsetof" Obviously this is both inconvenient and scary (requires to know a member and to turn off a warning).
