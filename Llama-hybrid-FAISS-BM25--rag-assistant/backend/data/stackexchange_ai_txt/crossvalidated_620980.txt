The ATE is specific to binary treatments, but causal effect estimates are a much broader concept The average treatment effect (ATE) is built specifically for the binary treatment scenario which is common in certain domains (e.g. medicine). The more general quantity of interest is the expected value of a target $Y$ given some treatment $T$ , written as $E(Y\mid do(T=t))$ . When $T$ is binary, the ATE (given as $E(Y\mid do(T=1)) - E(Y\mid do(T=0))$ is a useful concept. But in fact the binary case is just one particular case. How to estimate $E(Y\mid do(T=t))$ depends on $Y$ , $T$ , and the functional dependency between them. The example you gave in the comment is that of a linear function, in which case one could perform linear regression. This is a commonly considered scenario. When interpreting a regression analysis of a continuous treatment and continuous outcome, the slope (in your example it is 2) conveys the causal effect and can be thought of as somewhat "analogous" to the ATE as it describes the change in the effect variable per unit of change in the treatment variable.
