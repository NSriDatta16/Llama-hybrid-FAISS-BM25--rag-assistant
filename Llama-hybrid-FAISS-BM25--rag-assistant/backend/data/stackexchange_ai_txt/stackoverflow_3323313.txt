When I want to use namespace? You should use a namespace whenever it helps to organize your code better. You can group related classes, functions, constants, and types together under a single namespace. When I should use functions/routines inside namespace (not inside class)? Whenever the function does not need to be a member function. Namely, if a function does not need to access any member variables of any class instance, it should be implemented as a non-member function. Herb Sutter's Guru of the Week articles What's In a Class? -- The Interface Principle and Namespaces and the Interface Principle discuss the use of non-member functions and namespaces in an interface.
