Basic text formatting options

I am new to HTML (well, more than new) and I try to format the presented text. The following code is presented: This is another paragraph. This is another paragraph. In the first time, the allign works fine though the face is not. On the other hande, in the second time, the size and the face work ok but align is not. Do I do something work? In general is there any good *and free) resources on line? Thanks in advance, Sun
