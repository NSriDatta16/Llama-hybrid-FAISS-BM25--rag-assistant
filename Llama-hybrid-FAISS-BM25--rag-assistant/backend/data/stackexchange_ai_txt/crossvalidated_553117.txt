In the following link you can find a previous answer to how to determine the correct specification of an ARIMA model ( p , d , q values). If your goal is to obtain a stationary time series , differentiating the time series is a good option (then the integration order d could be 1 or 2, depending on the number of times you need to differentiate to get the stationary time series). In your example, the series obtained after carrying out the first difference still has a serial correlation with lag 1, which indicates that all autocorrelations of higher orders are effectively explained by autocorrelation with lag 1 . Regarding your understanding of ARIMA, maybe you have come to the right conclusion from the wrong background: ARIMA does not eliminate unwanted characteristics (and what would be an unwanted feature anyway?), but specifies different predominant processes in the series through autoregressions and moving averages . Apparently the original series you are showing has a polynomial trend, which you could remove before adjusting an ARIMA model. Hope it helps!
