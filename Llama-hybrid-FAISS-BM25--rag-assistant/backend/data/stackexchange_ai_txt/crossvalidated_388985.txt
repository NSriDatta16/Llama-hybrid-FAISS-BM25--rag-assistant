Yes, you need to have independent observations to apply conventional copulas. If you have serial correlation in data, look for "autocopulas", e.g. here "Autocopulas: investigating the interdependence structure of stationary time series" by Rakonczai et al. The reason is that you're looking for a wrong joint. Consider this, you're trying to recover the joint distribution $F(X,Y)$ with copulas, where $X,Y$ are random variables. However, in case of first order serial correlation in observations (autocorrelation) the joint distribution is $F(X_t,X_{-1},Y_t,Y_{t-1})$ not the one you're trying to recover.
