I am the main Couchio hosting guy. Glad you are enjoying CouchDB. My feeling is, basically, relational databases are flat out better at constantly-changing, one-off queries from large data sets. It still takes forever to churn through all that data. Neither SQL nor NoSQL is a silver bullet there. However, broadly speaking, the NoSQL databases are better if you already know what questions you will ask. In other words, it's not a question of how much the data changes, but how much the queries change. That is the theory. For your specific project, is CouchDB a good fit? My feeling is, there is nothing wrong with making many many indexes on the basic data set. The benefit of index-only queries is, the queries happen very fast. CouchDB in particular only needs to re-index new data, even for queries such as averages, or XOR checksums. So, even if you have a hundred different types of queries you might perform, if you already know what those queries are, hey just write them down. However if you will never stop making brand new queries, CouchDB would have a hard time keeping up.
