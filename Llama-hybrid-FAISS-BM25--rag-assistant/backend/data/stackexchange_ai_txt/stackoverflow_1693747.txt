jQuery selector help?

How to anchor paragraph in other HTML pages and in the same time highlighted the area where the pointed paragraph is located when click the the button in the current page? I made this simple code in JavaScript just doing the anchor thing Current page: New page: O, say can you see by the dawn's early light? I think that "highlighted text" jQuery will be the best method but can't figure out how to do it with more than one html page.
