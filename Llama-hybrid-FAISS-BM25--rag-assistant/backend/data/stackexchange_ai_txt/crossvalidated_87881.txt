Regression for really small data with high degree of multicollinearity and outliers

I'm working on a promotional response analysis. I have a really small real world dataset with 25 observations and 15 variables. The variables have a high degree of multicollinearity and some have outliers . Also, I cannot use machine learning methods because I need interpretable coefficients. Here is what I have tried so far: I used GLM, but all variables seemed insignificant. I know for a fact that the dependent variable is responsive to many independent variables. I used robust regression, but basically the program fails because the software showed an error that stated, "The number of observations must be at least twice the number of coefficients." I would really appreciate if you could suggest some methods/techniques or strategies to solve this problem. Thanks and regards.
