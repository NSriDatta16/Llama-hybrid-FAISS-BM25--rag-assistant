Force positive coefficients for Logistic Regression and LinearSVC

Do you know what is the best way to force positive coefficients with Logistic Regression and Linear SVC using scikit learn? for instance svm = LinearSVC(loss='hinge' ) coefficients = svm.coef_ Is there a way to force them to be positive numbers?
