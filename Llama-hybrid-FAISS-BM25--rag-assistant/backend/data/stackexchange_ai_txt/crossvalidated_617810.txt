What is a feature of an image?

Given an image to train on a CNN what would be considered the features that are the inputs of the model? Would each individual pixel be a feature or would the R,G,B channels be the features? Lets say I have a 28x28 image with R,G,B channels. Would I say the neural network takes in 28x28 = 784 features, 3 features due to r,g,b , or just 1 feature due to it being just 1 image.
