Show ad div depending on which tab is visible

I have two div's that holds banner ads loaded dynamically from an ad server,the main one is "#bannerTop" and the other is "#brokerageBanner". Only one div that holds these ads needs to be visible at a time based on what tab is active. The page has a tab set up for each type of partner, which there are really only two - brokerage partners and all others. I need to show "#brokerageBanner" only when the tab "#BrokContent" is visible. Should I use the appended url "/partners#Brokerage" or the div that holds that content "#BrokContent" to trigger which banner ad is shown? I am having some isues with this: if ($("#BrokContent").is(:visible)) { $("#brokerageBanner").show(); $("#bannerTop").hide(); } else { $("#bannerTop").show(); $("#brokerageBanner").hide(); } thanks
