Inventory control - first order quantity of periodic order quantities model

I Have read " Manufacturing Planning and Control for Supply Chain Management 6th Edition " by F.Robert Jacobs. I found the problem on the Periodic Order Quantities (POQ) . As I know POQ calculation is after calculate the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) . In the book contained an example problem : To calculate EOQ from the above data using the following formula : \begin{align} EOQ= \sqrt{\frac{2C_P\bar{D}}{ C_H }} \end{align} And the results of EOQ is 166 For POQ using the formula : \begin{align} POQ= \frac{EOQ}{\bar{D}} \end{align} And the result of POQ is 1.8 From the above data it can be said that ordering interval is 2 weeks, and this is the data from 12 period (12 weeks) : Question : Can someone tell me, Where the amount of the first order obtained ? From 1st week plus 2nd Weeks (10+10) ? If I have estimation (requirement) for 13th weeks is 70, how much to order ? so for 14th weeks I don't need to order again.
