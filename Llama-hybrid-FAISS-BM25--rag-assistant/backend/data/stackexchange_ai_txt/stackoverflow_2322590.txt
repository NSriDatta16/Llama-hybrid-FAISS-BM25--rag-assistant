There are no conditional comments for Firefox, Opera and Safari. I'm unsure whether you may load stylesheets with Javascript, but I would recommend against it either way. It's common to have a server-side scripting language like PHP determine the client and serve corresponding CSS files. In PHP, the user agent may be identified by parsing the contents of $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . If you're not comfortable with programming in PHP, there are a number of scripts that you could use. This one seems particularly promising.
