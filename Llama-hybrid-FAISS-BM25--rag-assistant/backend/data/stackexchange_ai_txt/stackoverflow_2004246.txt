Magento Store - Extension

I'm using this extension in my Magento store: http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/reviews/module/608/p/2/ I use this block to call the extension on page A: {{block type="mostviewed/list" name="home.mostviewed1.list" alias="product_homepage" template="catalog/product/top_10_full.phtml" }} I would also like to call a modified version of this block and place it on page B. How do I do this. If I modify the code then it changes it for both Page A and B. How can I have slightly different versions of the same extension. I thought about copying it but I don't know what to change in order to be able to call the copied version with a different block name. Or is it possible to send a parameter back when calling the extension. For example this is the piece of code from the extension that will need to differ on each page: $storeId = Mage::app()->getStore()->getStoreId(); $category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load('10'); //THIS IS THE CATEGORY ID TO DISPLAY - PUT CAT ID IN HERE $this->setStoreId($storeId); On page A the CategoryID should be 10 and on Page B it should be 11. Thanks!
