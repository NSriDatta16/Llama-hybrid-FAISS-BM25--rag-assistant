A data driven (and thus probably not so very good) approach Calculate four correlation matrices: One for each layer and one for the pooled data (three lines per sample). If they all look quite similar, run a PCA based on the correlation matrix of the pooled sample and go on with the first few PCs. Instead of comparing the four correlation matrices, you could also consider the four loading matrices of the corresponding PCAs and compare the loadings of the first few PCs. This is much easier if you have lots of variables.
