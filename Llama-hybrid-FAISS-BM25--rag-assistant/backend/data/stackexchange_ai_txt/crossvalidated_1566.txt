I'm not really sure if an implementation exists to address all your needs. For (1), you can use any of the online implementations of SVM such as Pegasos or LASVM. If you want something simpler, you may use Perceptron or Kernel Perceptron. Basically, in all these algorithms, given an already learned weight vector (say w0), you can update w0 incrementally, given a fresh set of new examples. For (2) and (3), I'm not sure if the above approaches would straightaway allow but you can probably borrow some ideas from the literature dealing with unknown classes. I'd suggest taking a look at this .
