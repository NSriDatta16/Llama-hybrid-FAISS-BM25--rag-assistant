You can't do this cross-browser programmatically. You can replace the dropdown with an entirely custom solution not actually displaying a element...but you can't programmatically show it, especially in IE. The closest you can do is move the user to the element via .focus() : $("#person_prefix").focus(); This with some CSS styling for when it's focused ( :focus ) is usually a pretty good way to draw attention to it.
