Interesting question. There is actually a wide literature regarding observational studies not confirmed by successive trials. I'll provide you, just as an example, the role of fatty acids in different conditions, such as diabetes: Fatty acids in diabetes NEJM . Several efforts have been put to improve quality of evidence from observational studies, among which the use of " propensity score matching " are those leading the way at the moment (and I'd encourage you to study them if you're interested in medical research). However, the point is not about if those results are "reliable", but rather how careful you should be when deciding to do something based on data from observational studies, since they are hugely influenced by external and population factors (such as the "self randomization"). In medical guidelines, evidence from only observational studies are usually expressed with the lower level of evidence possible (usually C, or B if there are multiple observational studies), suggesting that you should be careful when actually taking that decision before any RCT have been done to evaluate that result. Also, if they where completely unreliable, no one would do them. The main point of observational studies is not to find straightfowardly the truth, but rather as hypothesis-generating studies , saying "Hey, we found this! Why don't you check if this is actually true?" Hope this was helpful.
