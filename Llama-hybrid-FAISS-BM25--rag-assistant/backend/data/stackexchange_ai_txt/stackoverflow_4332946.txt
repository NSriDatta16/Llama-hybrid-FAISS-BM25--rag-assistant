I think this will be very difficult. I know this doesn't answer you question completely but at least the web pages may be preserved. There are organizations and tools that allow you to recreate web pages from past dates - see for example http://www.mementoweb.org/ . UPDATE: I have just learnt that Memento has won a digital preservation award (http://www.dpconline.org/newsroom)
