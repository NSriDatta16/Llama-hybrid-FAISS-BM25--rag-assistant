C: Allocate memory ahead or on every demand?

I've got a simple (propably) question for you. When creating own dynamic array implementation in C, is it better to allocate memory ahead(let's presume, for 10 elements) when an array is close to reach its current maximum capability, or to realloc memory every time when element count changes? I mean: for performance, elegance or whatever comes to your mind.
