Calculate Fleiss Kappa with annotator replacement

If three annotators, A, B, and C, label 180 data, In the middle of the labeling process, C is replaced with D, and A, B, and D label 200 data. Can it count and average for three labelers as whole 380 data with three annotators with Fleiss Kappa? How many annotators in the matrix for this case can calculate 380 data according to that situation?
