Is the ratio between two correlated time series significant?

I have the following two correlated seasonal time series for the same time period: dat$ratio As can be seen by the above correlations, reqs and ords are highly correlated. Next, here are the histograms of ords, reqs, and the ratio between the two: Googling around to learn about distributions of ratios I came across Cauchy distributions, but my stats background is not strong enough to determine whether I have a Gaussian or Cauchy distribution. Some futher Googling indicates I may have to look at Vector Autoregression. What further statistical analysis can I perform to understand the relationship between reqs and ords?
