Magento build reasonable project turnaround time

As a new project manager joining a team where ecomerce sites are developed using magento, I have very little experience estimating project times. What would a reasonable turnaround time be for a typical magento site with some customisations be? Customisations in terms of custom modules and a completely custom theme. I'm thinking in terms of 1 or 2 developers per project.
