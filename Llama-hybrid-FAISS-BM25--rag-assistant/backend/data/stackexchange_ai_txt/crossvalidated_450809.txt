Quoting directly from the third paragraph in the introduction of this reference paper, which explains the concept quite intuitively: "We define the embedding dimensionality of a dataset as the number of attributes of the dataset (its address space). The intrinsic dimensionality of a phenomenon (and also of the data retrieved from it) is defined as the real number of dimensions in which the points can be embedded while preserving the distances among them. For example, a plane embedded in a 50-dimensional space has intrinsic dimension 2 and embedding dimension 50."
