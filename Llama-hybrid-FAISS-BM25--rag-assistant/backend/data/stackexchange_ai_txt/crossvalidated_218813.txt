Averaging linear regression model using AIC's relative likelihood

I've learned here that when two models have a big relative likelihood, one could compute a weighted average of those models in order to estimate the "unconditional" variable effect. However, some questions remain unclear: What is considered a "big enough" relative likelihood? Can I average over several models? If so, why should I omit any model at all, as an unlikely model would get a near zero weight anyways? What should I do with insignificant effects? should I skip them when averaging? What is considered a "small enough" p-value?
