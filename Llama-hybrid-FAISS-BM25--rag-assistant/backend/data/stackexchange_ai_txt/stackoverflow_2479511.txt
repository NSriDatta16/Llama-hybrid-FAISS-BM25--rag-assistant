The answer below was Mystik's original answer but, try as I might, I couldn't get it to work properly (though I didn't try the second suggestion so it may well work). That may be caused by the fact that I'm running a back level of BIRT (and, no, I'm not allowed to upgrade unfortunately, it's part of a separate product that has its own release cycles). The solution I eventually found was to leave the data value in the grouping line and select the cell ( not the data value), then set the Drop control under Properties , General to be Detail rather then the default None . This brings the data value down to the detail line when rendering the report. And I'm editing this answer rather than adding my own since I don't want to be a rep whore :-) Try following these steps: Create the group just as you have. Then drag the group data item one row down (see below). At this point you can delete the group header row if you like. Then click on the column that has the group data item in it. Once selected, go the to the properties explorer for the control and scroll to the bottom, selecting "advanced". In the advanced list, you will see a property called "Suppress Duplicates". Make this true for the column with the Group data in it and you will be all set.
