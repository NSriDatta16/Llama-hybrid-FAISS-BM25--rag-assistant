Interpretation of R output for mixed ANOVA model

I had to do a mixed ANOVA. How can I interpret the results? Power (high power / low power) is the within factor. interaction (first / second) is the between factor. agent is the subject. The dependent variable is Dominance . This is the output: Error: agent Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) interaction:Power 1 2.51 2.514 1.454 0.233 Residuals 57 98.55 1.729 Error: agent:Power Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) interaction 1 0.85 0.85 0.64 0.427 Power 1 46.63 46.63 35.20 1.85e-07 *** Residuals 57 75.52 1.32 Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Mainly I do not know what the term " Error " means, and how I can interpret the rest according to this term.
