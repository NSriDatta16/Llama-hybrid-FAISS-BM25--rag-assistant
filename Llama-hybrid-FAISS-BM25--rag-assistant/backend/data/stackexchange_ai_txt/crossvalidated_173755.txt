Interpret logistic regression output with multiple categorical & continious variables

I'm trying to analyze some data obtained from a survey asking employers about their difficulty in hiring certain occupations (80 total occupations). But I'm uncertain about the interpretation of my results. Dependent Variable: 0 = not difficult 1 = difficult. Independent Variables: occupation group ( occ.group 1 to 9 different groups) grouped the occupations to cut down on the total number of options area (0 = urban 1 = rural) hourly wage of the occupation ( hr.wage continuous, numeric). The data is structured as such: empnum response soc occ.group area hr.wage 1 123450 1 1 1 1 70.20 2 543210 0 1 1 0 50.10 3 111111 0 1 1 1 71.10 4 222222 1 2 2 1 60.23 5 333333 1 2 4 0 100.57 6 4444444 0 80 9 1 60.18 Model is as follows: logit1 |z|) (Intercept) 0.184978 0.466055 0.397 0.69144 occ.group2 -0.243524 0.528233 -0.461 0.64479 occ.group3 0.281285 0.407879 0.690 0.49043 occ.group4 -0.063578 0.510229 -0.125 0.90084 occ.group5 -0.039797 0.403032 -0.099 0.92134 occ.group6 0.419655 0.475109 0.883 0.37708 occ.group7 -0.898869 0.652530 -1.378 0.16835 occ.group8 -15.015216 394.6834 -0.038 0.96965 occ.group9 -0.370350 0.405532 -0.913 0.36111 area1 0.008863 0.129376 0.069 0.94538 hr.wage 0.010475 0.004028 2.600 0.00931 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1679.4 on 1259 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1638.5 on 1249 degrees of freedom AIC: 1660.5 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 13 I'm trying to get an idea if my interpretations are correct. Because occ.group2 coeff is negative it would have lower odds of being difficult to hire than occ.group1 (reference group) odds are exp(-0.2353) = .79 probability = .4414 An employer with occupation in occ.group2 and area1 = -0.243524 + 0.008863 = exp(-0.234661) = 0.79 odds of difficult. Would that be compared to to occ.group1 (reference group) in the same area1 or would it be area0 . I guess I'm having a hard time interpreting the reference group with two categorical variables. Employer with occupation in occ.group2 and area0 ? Would I add the coefficient for occ.group2 (-0.243524) and the intercept (-0.243524)? That doesn't seem right, but not sure how to deal with multiple reference groups. What about an employer with occ.group1 and area0 ? Would the odds of an employer with occupation in group2 and area1 with a 1 dollar increase in hr.wage = -0.243524 + 0.008863 + 0.010475 = exp(-0.224186) = odds of .799 compared to employer with occupation group1 in area1 with 1 dollar hr.wage increase? Thanks for the explanations and clarification @EdM. I also had a question about doing deviation/effects coding of the occ.group categorical predictor, because I'm not convinced that comparisons between the occ.group is meaningful due to their major differences. I've read that effects coding makes it possible to compare each group to the overall mean response. But again, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding how to interpret the results. I've used the contr.sum and contrasts commands in R to apply effects coding to the occ.group variable and end up with this output. contr.sum(5) contrasts(health.sub$occ.group) = contr.sum(5) Call: glm(formula = response ~ occ.group + area + hr.wage, family = binomial, data = health.sub) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7637 -1.2172 0.8009 1.0462 1.1513 Coefficients: #UPDATED devication/effects coded model based on @EdM 's comment. #`occ.group8` dropped due to limited responses #Other `occ.group`'s were reorganized to more appropriate categories 1-5 Estimate Std.

How would I go about interpreting the odds for an employer with occ.group2 and area0 with an hr.wage = 50.00 given the effects coding? I believe the odds would be calculated as 0.5464 +(-0.5077) + (0.5464 - 0.0034) + (0.0021*50.00)) = exp(0.6937) = odds of 2.001. Which is in comparison to the mean of the mean occ.group logits rather than any specific reference group.
