Yes. You can create a console project, add all refereces you need and then export it (File > Export Template) as a Project Template. After this, your project template will be available in Visual Studio. This VS feature is really useful, you can customize many aspects of you template. I ecourage you spend some time playing with that! Hope this helps!
