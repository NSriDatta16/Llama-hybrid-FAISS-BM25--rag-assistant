You might find it easier to sell them on the Document/View or Document/Presenter patterns. MVC was invented on Smalltalk where everything about the different UI elements had to be coded by the developer (as I understand, never used the thing). Thus the controller element was necessary because didn't have things like TextElement::OnChange. Now days, more modern GUI API's use Document/View but Document/Presenter is something I've seen proposed. You might also consider reading Robert Martin's article on the TaskMaster framework. You might also consider that any C++ developer who is not familiar with these patterns and already understands their purpose and necessity is either a complete newb or a basket-case best avoided. People like that cause more harm than good and are generally too arrogant to learn anything new or they already would have.
