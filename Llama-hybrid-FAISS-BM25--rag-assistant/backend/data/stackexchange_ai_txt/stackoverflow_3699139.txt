LibSVM is a very widely used library and I highly doubt anything is drastically wrong with the code. That said, I think it's great that there are people who are paranoid enough to actually check it for correctness - well done! The solution seems correct according to the working that I give below. What I mean by that is it satisfies the KKT conditions (15.29). It also true that the partial derivatives of the dual vanish at the solution. Here's my working... x1 = (3,1,0) x2 = (3,3,1) x3 = (7,0,9) y1 = -1 y2 = 1 y3 = -1 K = [10 12 21] [12 19 30] [21 30 130] L_dual = a1 + a2 + a3 -5a1^2 + 12a1a2 - 21a1a3 - (19/2)a2^2 + 30a2a3 - 65a3^2) a1 = 0.412 a2 = 0.4444 a3 = 0.0317 Checking KKT: y1.f(x1) = y1 * (y1*a1*K(x1,x1) + y2*a2*K(x1,x2) + y3*a3*k(x1,x3) - rho) = rho + 10*a1 + 21*a3 - 12*a2 ~= 1 (Similar for the x2 and x3) Substituting a2 = a1 + a3 into L_dual: L_dual = 2a1 + 2a3 - 2.5a1^2 + 2a1a3 - 44.5a3^2 dL/da1 = 2 - 5a1 + 2a3 = 0 dL/da3 = 2 + 2a1 - 89a3 = 0
