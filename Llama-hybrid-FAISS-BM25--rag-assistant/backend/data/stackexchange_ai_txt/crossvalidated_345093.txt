How to improve Naive Bayes?

I am solving a problem that address this question "What are the Actions that lead to high or low score?" I have the following Data that consist of text and score , I want to derive the words or Actions from text that lead to high/low score I have huge data , and text length can be a paragraph, sample data like below +----------------------+-------+ | Text | Score | +----------------------+-------+ | Support Team Goal | 90 | | Generate Lead | 80 | | Contact 30 customers | 30 | | Support Team Goal | 30 | +----------------------+-------+ Approach followed: I followed Naive Bayes way. First I classified my Data into High (score(75 and above)) and Low (score below 75) I converted the High to Term Document Matrix and the Low as well I found words appearing only in low and judge they lead to low score (include word if frequency greater than 7 lets say) I found words appearing only in high and judge they lead to high score (include word if frequency greater than 7 lets say in high) I found probability of common words , For words appearing in both high or low, I calculated the probability of the word occurrence to happen in low/high (include word if probability greater than 75%) Note: I worked with bigrams. Not sure if this is the right approach to analyze my problem, or there are better techniques. Please advise
