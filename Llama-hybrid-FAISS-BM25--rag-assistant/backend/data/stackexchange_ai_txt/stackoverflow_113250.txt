Unfortunately, no, there's not really a better way. If you're just tired of making the keystrokes, you can use macros to trim them down. Add the following to your ~/.inputrc : "\C-x6": "\C-a#\C-m^" "\C-x7": "\C-m\C-P\C-a\C-d\C-m" Now, in a new bash instance (or after reloading .inputrc in your current shell by pressing C-x C-r ), you can do the following: Type a bogus command (e.g., ls abcxyz ). Press Ctrl-x, then 6. The macro inserts a # at the beginning of the line, executes the commented line, and types your first ^ . Type your correction (e.g., xyz^def ). Press Ctrl-x, then 7. The macro completes your substitution, then goes up to the previous (commented) line, removes the comment character, and executes it again. It's not exactly elegant, but I think it's the best you're going to get with readline.
