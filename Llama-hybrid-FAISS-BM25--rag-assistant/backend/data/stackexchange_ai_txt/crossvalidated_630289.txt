cointegration tests for time series

To test cointegration relationship for multiple time series, one usually writes the VAR(k) as $$ \Delta y_t = \Pi y_{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\Gamma_j\Delta y_{t-j} + e_t $$ See, e.g., https://www.uh.edu/~bsorense/coint2022.pdf According to the above lecture note and many textbooks, if $\Pi$ has full rank, then all $y_t$ must be stationary. Why? The only answer that comes to me is that we pre-multiply all terms in the equation by $\Pi^{-1}$ , and since all $\Delta y_t$ components are I(0), all $y_t$ components must be I(0). I wonder if this argument is valid or if there is an easier way to understand this. Thank you!
