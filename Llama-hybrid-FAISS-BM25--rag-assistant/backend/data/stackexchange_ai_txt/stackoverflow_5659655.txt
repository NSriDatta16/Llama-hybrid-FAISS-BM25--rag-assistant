clockworkgeek got me started here with that answer, but I needed to also display product quantity, price and then the total cart price as well. The Magento documentation is dense at best, so after searching around, here is the answer to display cart contents in Magento with some table HTML for formatting: getQuote(); //gets the cart contents ?> Product Quantity Price/ea. Total getItemsCollection() as $item) { ?> getName(); ?> getQty(); ?> helper('checkout')->formatPrice($item->getPrice(), 2); ?> getQty()); $total = $floatQty * $item->getPrice(); echo $this->helper('checkout')->formatPrice($total, 2); //multiply the quantity by the price and convert/format ?> helper('checkout')->formatPrice($quote->getGrandTotal()); ?> That may be some very ugly code, including the rough way to find the total for each $item, but it works. I'm sure there's a better way to get the $item total (calcRowTotal never seemed to work), but it gets the job done. And thanks to clockworkgeek for sending me down the right path.
