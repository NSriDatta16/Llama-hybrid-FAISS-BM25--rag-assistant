The predictions for each combination of Treated and Risk.factor are exactly the same under the two models. What I was trying to get at in the comments is that it is the parameterization of the model that is different; what is relative to what. Assuming your first model is in m1 and your second model is in m2 and we have the following prediction data pdat Then we get exactly the same odds for each combination of Trial.arm and Risk.factor with the two models: > exp(predict(m1, pdat)) 1 2 3 4 0.2222222 1.1666667 0.3958333 0.1666667 > exp(predict(m2, pdat)) 1 2 3 4 0.2222222 1.1666667 0.3958333 0.1666667 We can visualise the effects in each model using the effects package library("effects") plot(allEffects(m1)) plot(allEffects(m2)) Apart from the ordering, these are equivalent: One reason for this is the dummy coding used by default in R. These "treatment" contrasts are not orthogonal but also they place the emphasis on a specific level or combination of levels of factors. If we switch to sum-to-zero contrasts, then the parameterization compares a level to the average of the other levels of that factor: op We note now that for both the original and the reversed model the coefficients have the same absolute value, the sign just changes. > rbind(M1 = unname(coef(m1)), M2 = unname(coef(m2))) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] M1 -1.017112 -0.1983077 0.3421487 -0.6308064 M2 -1.017112 -0.1983077 -0.3421487 0.6308064 To some extent, your problem also comes from over-interpreting the main effects of the factors in the presence of an interaction term in which both participate. The "effect" of Risk.factor on the response depends entirely on what level of Treat.arm we are talking about. There is no single "effect" of Risk.factor == Yes in the model, but two effects: Risk.factor == Yes when Treat.arm == Placebo , and Risk.factor == Yes when Treat.arm == Treated The principle of marginality says we should focus on the higher-order term, which makes it difficult (impossible?) to get one's head around what a main effect of a term that is marginal to a higher order interaction.
