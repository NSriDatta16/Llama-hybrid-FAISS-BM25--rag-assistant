SQL query sum at bottom row

I am trying to get the sum of a column at the bottom row. I have tried a few examples by using SUM() and COUNT(), but they have all failed with syntax errors. Here is my current code without any sum or anything: :XML ON USE MYTABLE SELECT sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName as namn,COUNT(*) as cnt FROM sbc.AgentC, sbc.PolicyC WHERE sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid = sbc.PolicyC.PolicyGuid GROUP BY sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid, sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName ORDER BY namn ASC FOR XML PATH ('celler'), ROOT('root') GO The XML output is reformatted to become a regular HTML table. EDIT: Here is the latest code, but it generates a "sum" (same number as the row above) on every other row: :XML ON USE MYTABLE SELECT sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName as namn,COUNT(*) as cnt FROM sbc.AgentC, sbc.PolicyC WHERE sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid = sbc.PolicyC.PolicyGuid GROUP BY sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid, sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName with rollup FOR XML PATH ('celler'), ROOT('root') GO The XML output looks like this: example name one 23 23 example name two 1 1
