Maintenance Plan provides you native tools that will keep your SQL Server up and running. You can schedule tasks such as Index maintenance, database backup, etc through a Maintenance Plan (see SQL Server Agent also). Check the twin site of StackOverflow, ServerFault, for related questions. I have seen gurus at ServerFault responding to queries similar to this. Check out http://sqlserverpedia.com/ you can find useful information in the site. ;-)
