The square in RMSE is used because it always gives a positive value for error, so avoiding errors cancelling each other out, and affords greater weight to values further from the target function, so emphasising points for which the estimator is poor. The square root is used to remove the effects of the squaring. You could look at using the Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) which does not have the distance weighting effect of the RMSE and just takes the average of the absolute value of the errors.
