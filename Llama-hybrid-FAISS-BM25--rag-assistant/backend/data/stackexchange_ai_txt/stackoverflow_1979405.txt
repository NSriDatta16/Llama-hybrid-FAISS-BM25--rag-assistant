How do I get my macro to stop if i cancel save a copy

Greetings one and all - a christmas puzzle for anyone still looking at this site...This works but if i decide to cancel the process (ie not save a file and stop the process at this stage) it doesn't svae the file but the following marco (filltolastrow2) is still activated how can I stop this happening? Public Sub SaveaCopyIncomeSheet() Dim file_name As Variant file_name = Application.GetSaveAsFilename("Overdue Report - Draft", filefilter:="Excel Files(*.xls),*.xls") If file_name <> False Then ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=file_name MsgBox "File Saved!" End If filltolastrow2 End Sub
