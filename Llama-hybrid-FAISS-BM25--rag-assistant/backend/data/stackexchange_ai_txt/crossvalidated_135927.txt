Have you read the Wikipedia articles? Decision theory is a subset of or problem in statistical learning, in my view; both driven by statistics -- data. It concerns the optimal making of decisions such as choosing between alternatives, once or over a period of time (possibly without termination), or deciding when to stop an experiment, etc. Statistical learning theory is a much broader concept. It is the most popular paradigm for machine learning. Maybe you know that?
