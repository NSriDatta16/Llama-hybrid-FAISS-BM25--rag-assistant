Alternative ways for interpretation of odds

I am reading the second edition of Categorical Data Analysis by Alan Agresti, and somehow stuck in the following second paragraph: I don't quite understand why $\beta\pi(\hat{x})(1 - \pi(\hat{x}))$ will give the probability when $x = 26.3$, can anyone enlighten me? Thanks.
