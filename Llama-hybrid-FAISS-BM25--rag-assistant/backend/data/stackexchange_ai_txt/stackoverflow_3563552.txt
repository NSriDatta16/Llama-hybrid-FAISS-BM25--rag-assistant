Looking for Java code beautifier (or maybe not beautify, but something to make code more elegant)

I don't know how to describe it, but I'm looking for a tool that makes suggestions to my code on how to be... more elegant. For example to make a nested if() statement a switch statement. something like this. As I don't know how to describe my problem I don't know what to search for. I thing code beautifier do not specifically change statements, right?
