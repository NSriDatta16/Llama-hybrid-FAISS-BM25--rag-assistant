Is C++ code allowed to call `::operator new()` directly?

According to C++ Standard paragraph 3.7.3/1 objects should be dynamically created with new expression and the C++ runtime should provide an allocation function ::operator new() . Once in a while it is necessary to call ::operator new() directly . Does the C++ Standard allow such calls to ::operator new() function or is this (and related) function for internal use only?
