add custom field to onepage checkout in magento

I'm trying to add custom fields to magento checkout onepage. I followed an example that doesn't work in 1.4.1 because of the move to a flat order table(I think) http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/adding-a-new-tab-under-one-page-checkout-full-working-module/ I can see my custom tab in checkout page with my custom fields but I can't save the fields to the database. How do I add columns to the quote and order tables? should this go to Mymod/sql/mymod_setup/mysql4-install-0.1.0.php or somewhere else? How do I save the field to the db? Do I need to save it to the quote first? Do I use observer or something else? Do I need to have element in my module's config.xml? http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/19344/ Thanks
