Embedding an image with PHP

I'm creating a simple website with php scripts as just kind of a little project and I want to be able to show pictures on my site. I've visited some sites before that show their images like so (hopefully you know what I'm talking about by looking at that picture). Is that program/script/whatever free, and if it is, is it newbie friendly? And are there any other good-looking ways to embed a picture?
