Could it be possible to solve it by this procedure? First create M child processes and execute them in paralel. Each process will be running in a dedicated core of a cluster and will load some information of the array into the RAM of that core. A father process will be the manager of the array, calling (or connecting) the appropiate child process to obtain certain chunks of data. Will this be faster than the HDD storage approach? Or am I cracking nuts with a sledgehammer?
