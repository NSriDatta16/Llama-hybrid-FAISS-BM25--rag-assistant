How to calculate odds ratios for different combinations of categorical predictors in logistic regression?

My dataset has 3 variables: outcome - binary variable (0 / 1) sex - categorical variable (male / female) colour - categorical variable (red / yellow / green) I have the following output from a logistic regression model which has outcome as the dependent variable and sex/colour as predictors (including an interaction): Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.12 0.11 1.09 0.276 colourRED -0.07 0.15 -0.49 0.628 colourYELLOW -0.02 0.15 -0.14 0.887 sexMALE -0.07 0.16 -0.46 0.649 colourRED:sexmMALE 0.34 0.22 1.57 0.117 colourYELLOW:sexmMALE 0.14 0.22 0.66 0.510 I understand that the odds ratio for a RED FEMALE would be exp(-0.07) (reference: GREEN FEMALE), and that I could get 95% confidence intervals using the Wald method with the standard error of 0.15. However, how would I calculate the odds ratio (including 95% Wald intervals) for a RED MALE (reference: RED FEMALE): Would the log odds be -0.07 + 0.34 = 0.27? How could I calculate the standard error for this estimate?
