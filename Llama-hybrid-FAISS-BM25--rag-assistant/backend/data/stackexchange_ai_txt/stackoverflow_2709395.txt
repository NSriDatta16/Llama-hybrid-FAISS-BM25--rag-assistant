What is the difference between an object's scope and its context in javascript?

In the vernacular, scope and context have a lot in common. Which is why I get confused when I read references to both, such as in the quote below from an article on closures: Scope refers to where variables and functions are accessible, and in what context it is being executed. ( @robertnyman ) As far as I can tell, context is just a reference to an object. Can someone please explain what exactly is context , as used, for instance, in the jQuery syntax, $(selector, context) . And is an object's scope the same at it's context ? Update: I found this interesting article that talks about both scope and context in JavaScript. http://www.digital-web.com/articles/scope_in_javascript/
