How to draw from a uniform distribution over a large state space via MCMC

Motivating question I have a high-dimensional state space $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ with an admissible subset $S\subseteq \Omega$ , which is connected. I would like to draw a uniform random sample from $S$ . In my application, it is easy to verify whether a state $\vec x$ is in $S$ , but difficult to find a state in $S$ ad hoc. However, it is known that $\vec 0 \in S$ . Solution idea I think the problem should be relatively easy to solve with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Start at $x_0 = \vec 0$ . Set $i:=0$ . Set $i:=i+1$ . Randomly generate a close-by state $\vec x_i:= \vec X( \vec x_{i-1})$ based on $\vec x_{i-1}$ . Accept the step if $\vec x_i \in S$ , else set $\vec x_i = \vec x_{i-1}$ . Add $\vec x_i$ to the sample. Repeat the procedure after step 2. We may need to through away a large number of steps from the burn-in period. Question I am wondering which properties the random variable $\vec X(\vec x)$ needs to have to lead to a uniform sample over the state space. Does the step distribution need to satisfy detailed balance? Why? Example Draw a uniform sample from the unit disk in 2D and use the bivariate standard normal distribution centred at $\vec x$ for the steps, i.e., $\vec X(\vec x) \sim \vec N(\vec x, \underline{1})$ . I think this should work, but I also think that biasing the steps towards the centre would lead to a different sample. The question is so basic that I would expect to find lecture notes that help me, but so far I was unsuccessful in finding something where the Metropolis algorithm was interpreted in a Bayesian framework with prior and posterior distribution. A corresponding reference might be perfectly fine as an answer.
