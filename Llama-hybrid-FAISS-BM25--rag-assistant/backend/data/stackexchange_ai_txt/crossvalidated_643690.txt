Percentiles of a distribution of weighted summary statistics

Suppose I have a collection of different independent probability distributions, $\{ P_i(X)\}_{i=1}^N$ , each with their own support $I_i$ . I know that the $10^{th}$ percentile of a given distribution is given as $x_i^{10} | 0.1 = \int_{\inf(I_i)}^{x_i^{10}} P_i(x)dx$ and the average (mean) of the $10^{th}$ percentile of the distribution would be $ y_i = \int_{\inf(I_i)}^{x_i^{10}} xP(x) dx$ . I could then take all the mean $10^{th}$ values and create a distribution of those values $Q(Y)$ , the $10^{th}$ percentile of this distribution would be $y_k$ for the largest $k$ that satisfies $0.1 \geq \sum_{i=0}^k Q(y_i)$ . Is there a meaningful way to relate this statistic back to a percentile of the combination of all the distributions, i.e. $P(X) = P_1 * P_2 * \cdots * P_N$ . My intuition would tell me that that $y_k$ would be an upper bound of the $1^{st}$ percentile of $P$ , but I don't know how to prove this right or wrong. If there is anything off in previous statements of this question please correct my misconceptions.
