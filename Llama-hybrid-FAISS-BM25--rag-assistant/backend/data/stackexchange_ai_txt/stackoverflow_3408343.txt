After about a months worth of research there is no OTS program out there that does what this question asks about. We were looking for a tool set that allows for you to define how to validate a requirement. In our case we needed a generic routine to execute SQL Scripts, Load Data, and Run SSIS packages and the only way to do it currently is to write your own orchestration tool. We used .NET to orchestrate but @Sam did provide a useful way to do it with SSIS. Thanks to @JasonHorner advice we are now looking at making it look and feel more like SSISUnit but at a more organized level.
