This is an old question, see e.g. this article for answering different aspects of the problem. It contains a recursive formula for the cumulative distribution function $F_n$ of the longest run for both biased and unbiased coins as well as nice approximate results for the average and variance of this distribution. Logarithms play a central role in these approximations. For instance, the expected length in the unbiased coin case is around $\log_2(n) - 1$ (see page 201).
