Can this task for phrases be called lemmatization?

I want to 'lemmatize' phrases to dictionary entries . For instance, the following collocates can be standardized to the idiom in the aforementioned link leave (one's or its) mark on (someone or something) : leaving their mark on a country left his mark on me leaves their mark on him left its mark on me and etc. One more illustration for be in line with : is in line with be in line with are in line with I don't have a corpus of the standardized phrases as candidates for the process. I have tested using lemmatization approaches in Python and found that lemmatization cannot fully meet the requirements here. I wonder which task in NLP most relates to this problem?
