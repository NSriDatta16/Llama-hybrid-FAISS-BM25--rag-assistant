There are two cases which arise in dealing with model-selection: When the true model belongs in the model space. This is very simple to deal with using BIC . There are results which show that BIC will select the true model with high probability. However, in practice it is very rare that we know the true model. I must remark BIC tends to be misused because of this (probable reason is its similar looks as AIC ) . These issues have been addressed on this forum before in various forms. A good discussion is here . When the true model is not in the model space. This is an active area of research in the Bayesian community. However, it is confirmed that people know that using BIC as a model selection criteria in this case is dangerous. Recent literature in high dimension data analysis shows this. One such example is this . Bayes factor definitely performs surprisingly well in high dimensions. Several modifications of BIC have been proposed, such as mBIC, but there is no consensus. Green's RJMCMC is another popular way of doing Bayesian model selection, but it has its own short-comings. You can follow-up more on this. There is another camp in Bayesian world which recommends model averaging. Notable being, Dr. Raftery. Bayesian model averaging. This website of Chris Volinksy is a comprehensive source of Bayesian model averging. Some other works are here . Again, Bayesian model-selection is still an active area of research and you may get very different answers depending on who you ask.
