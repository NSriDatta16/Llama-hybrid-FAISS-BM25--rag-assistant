Found the answer on "Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework" by Steven Sanderson (page 5) "...in reality developers are encourged to mix presentation code (e.g., manipulating the server-side control tree) with their application logic (e.g., manipulating database data) in these same monstrous code-behind classes. Without better separation of concerns, the end result is often fragile and unintelligible."
