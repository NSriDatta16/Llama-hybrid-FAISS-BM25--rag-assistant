How about -scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: ? If it doesn't work, try to listen to the UITextSelectionDidScroll notification. (Of course, it's undocumented.) Alternatively, an SDK-safe method is measure the time taken for the animation and send a delayed notification at the call site of -scrollRectToVisible: .
