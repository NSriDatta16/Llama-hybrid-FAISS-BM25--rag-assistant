Interpretation of a logistic regression coefficient

I always find it difficult to interpret the coefficients of a logistic regression, especially with transformed variables, so I would like a confirmation of my conclusion or a correction if necessary. I'm trying to predict tumor penetration of the prostate capsule. Here is the description of the variables: Tumour penetration of Prostatic Capsule (0 = No penetration, 1 = Penetration) (Capsule) Results of the ‘Digital Rectal Exam (1 = No Nodule, 2 = Unilobar Nodule (Left), 3 = Unilobar Nodule (Right), 4 = Bilobar Nodule) (Dpros) Prostatic Specific Antigen Value’ in mg/ml (PSA) Tumour volume obtained from ultrasound in cm3 (Vol) Total gleason score (Gleason) Here are the results of the logistic regression I chose: (Intercept) **DprosUnilobar Nodule (Left)** -8.1264570 0.7169127 **DprosUnilobar Nodule (Right)** **DprosBilobar Nodule** 1.6227430 1.5086911 **log.PSA** **square.Vol** 0.5077599 -0.1087285 **Gleason** 0.9273380 I've transformed PSA with log and Vol with sqrt. Here is the interpretation: The log-odds of having a unilobular nodule (left) and having a penetration compared to a no nodule is 0.7169, holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this we get exp(0.7169) [1] 2.049 and it is the odds ratio of penetration for the unilobular nodule (left) compared to no nodule - i.e. the odds of penetration for the unilobular nodule (left) is 104.9 % higher than the odds of penetration in the capsule for no nodule, if the rest remains constant. Or the probability of having penetration into the capsule with a unilateral nodule (left) compared to no nodule is 2.049/(1+2.049)=0.672 so 67.2%, if all else remains constant. Every 1 unit increase in Gleason score is associated with a 0.9273380 increase in log-odds of survival holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this: exp(0.927338) [1] 2.528 Thus, each one-unit increase in the Gleason score is associated with a 152.8% increase in the odds of penetration into the capsule, with the other variables remaining constant. We can also say that for every 1% increase in the Gleason score, the probability increases by about 0.39561/(1+0.39561)=0.2835 28.4% of penetration into the capsule, with the other variables remaining constant. Every 1 unit increase in PSA score is associated with a exp((log(1.01)*0.51))= 1.0020 increase in log-odds of penetration holding the other variables constant. If we exponentiate this: exp(1.0020) 1 2.724 Thus, each one-unit increase in the PSA score is associated with a 172.4% increase in the odds of penetration into the capsule, with the other variables remaining constant. 10% increase in volume, increases the odds by exp(sqrt(10)*-0.11)= 0.71 and thus the probability by 4.15%, if all the other variables are kept fixed
