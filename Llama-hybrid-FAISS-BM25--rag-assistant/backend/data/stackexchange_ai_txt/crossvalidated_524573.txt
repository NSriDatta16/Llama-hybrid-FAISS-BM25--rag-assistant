The “awful-bad-average-good-excellent” rating is totally fine. It’s called an original variable, and there are many models for such a response variable. The simplest one would be an ordinal logistic regression, which is kind of a hybrid of regression and predicting category probability (classification). In a multiclass (multinomial) logistic regression, say with the MNIST digit images, there is no difference in penalty for predicting a high probability of a $1$ digit as a $5$ When the digit is a $2$ , but if $1-5$ are your awful-bad-average-good-excellent categories, it’s worse to call your $2$ (bad) a $5$ (excellent) than a $1$ (awful). Treating the response variables as an ordinal variable rather than purely categorical allows for the parameter optimization to consider this.
