LSTM on 2D Data Event Prediction

I have multiple signals, which I individually windowed and converted into spectrograms using Fourier transforms. On each signal there is an event "X" at one arbitrary point. I am using CNNs to extract features from each Spectrogram window and then I am planning to use those as an input to my LSTM. Essentialy I am trying to build a predictor of the event "X", but I am not entirely sure how to label my data. What do I feed the LSTM other than the CNN feature vectors (i.e. label vectors? If so, what do these labels have to be?) Moreover, what should I expect as an output. Just to save time, I understand LSTM application in a regressive style, i.e. predicting the next number in a sequence, but I can't get my head around what to expect if I am supplying an LSTM with a Feature Vector that is not "tangible". Thank you!
