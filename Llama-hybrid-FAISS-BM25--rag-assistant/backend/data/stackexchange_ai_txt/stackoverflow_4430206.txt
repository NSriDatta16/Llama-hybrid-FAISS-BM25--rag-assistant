I highly recommend Classycle . It works great on my mixed Scala/Java project. It works at the bytecode level and I have never had a Scala-related issue with it. On a small-ish project, you can just write your config file by hand. Our project is large-ish, so I wrote a Scala script that generates the config file. The section of the file generated each package looks like: [agent] = org.nlogo.agent.* excluding org.nlogo.agent.*.* [agent+] = [agent] [api+] [agent-] = org.nlogo.* excluding [agent+] check [agent] independentOf [agent-] This says that org.nlogo.agent may depend on org.nlogo.api (and recursively on org.nlogo.api's allowed dependencies), but on no other package. You can also write rules that check external dependencies, so e.g. here's how I check that we only depend on JOGL from certain particular packages: [JOGL-free-zone] = org.nlogo.* excluding [gl.render] [gl.view] [JOGL] = net.java.games.* javax.media.opengl.* check [JOGL-free-zone] independentOf [JOGL]
