Which CMS, script, etc. should I use?

I have been requested by someone starting a non-profit organization to build their website. They basically want to have users be able sign up, create profiles, send messages, etc. and then have charities be able to do the same, but with different functionality (write blogs, post videos, etc). The users would look over each charity's profile, then determine which one they would like to donate to. The payments would all go directly to the owner of the site, and then be distributed from there. I'm only a front-end programmer, but I know they can't afford to have the functionality of this site coded from scratch. Are there any scripts out there that could be modified to make this work? I would even be willing to pay for a programmer here to develop the site. Just let me know how much you think something like this would cost, and how you would go about implementing it. Thanks so much for any help. I appreciate it!
