SharePoint custom permission based on specific Organization Unit in the AD

Am pretty new to SharePoint, am working on creating a custom permission that I can deploy I sharepoint. I was hoping to create a custom permission that will read Organization Unit inside the active directory and if the user does not belong to a specific organization unit he will be prompted with access denied. Is there a tutorial to do such a thing? or instructions as of where to start from?
