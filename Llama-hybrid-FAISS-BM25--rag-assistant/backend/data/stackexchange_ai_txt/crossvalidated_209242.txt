Some suggestions: Tune your parameters using a rolling window approach (your model must be optimized to predict the next values in the time series, not to predict values among the ones supplied) Try other models (even simpler ones, with the right feature selection and feature engineering strategies, might prove better suited to your problem) Try to learn optimal transformations of the target variable (tune this too, there's a negative linear/exponential tendency, you may be able to estimate it) Spectral analysis perhaps The maxima/minima are equally spaced it seems. Learn where they are given your features (no operator input, make an algorithm discover it to remove bias) and add this as a feature. Also engineer a feature nearest maximum . Dunno, it might work, or perhaps not, you can only know if you test it :)
