Due to the security model of Windows Phone 7 and fact that applications are sandboxed means that it is not possible to create a file system browser on the device. You can only see files / the directory structure within IsolatedStorage and you must create these files yourself. You can, however, use MediaLibrary.Pictures or the PhotoChooserTask to access the images stored on the device. These are the images youu'll see in the Pictures hub and, therefore are outside of the files you specifically put in IsolatedStorage.
