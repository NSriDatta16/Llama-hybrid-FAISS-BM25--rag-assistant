Evaluation of a model of imbalanced data

I've created a model with Random Forest algorithm. There are 45k observations, where 1s I have 12% and the rest are 0s. As far as I know ROC AUC is not the best evaluation metric in such a case. I went with PR AUC and got 59%. How would you assess the results ?
