How do I determine an optimal threshold for a time series forecast?

I have a data set that includes sales dollars by sales order and I want to perform a time series forecast on it. Low dollar sales orders have very little noise and after detrending and doing some prelim analysis and testing it looks like a forecast would work pretty well.The issue is there is a lot of variability in large orders that can skew the time series. I can remove any large outliers, but I wanted to know if there was a way I could optimize the threshold that determines large v. small orders so I can get a reasonable time series that doesn't have too much variance. Any ideas?
