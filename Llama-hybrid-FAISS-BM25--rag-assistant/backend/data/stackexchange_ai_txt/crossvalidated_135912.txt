Say the parents made an a priori prediction that each additional hour increased score by two points. Then the data shows that 5 extra hours resulted in 10 extra points on average. That is an astounding coincidence, unlikely if the the reasoning of the parents is totally invalid. I don't think the confidence interval containing zero or not should have anything to do with how we interpret the result. However, if the claim was made by parents who had seen the data already then it is not justified. The CI is once again irrelevant since the "hypothesis" was generated and tested on the same data. The question does not contain enough information. That's how I would answer, but probably not what the author of the question had in mind.
