It sounds like you would benefit from reading the introductory material: The Objective-C Programming Language and Cocoa Fundamentals Guide . Additionally, you should read up on the basics of object-oriented programming (there are dozens of overviews all over the web and Amazon). Essentially, you're confusing a class (the blueprint for creating an object, in its most basic description) and an instance of a class (an actual "instantiated" object of a given class). Somewhere you're going to have to have a reference from one instance to another (like objectB = [[ClassB alloc] init]) to send a message (like [objectB doSomethingAnObjectOfClassBWouldDo]). You might accomplish this by storing the reference as an instance variable or inside a collection (array, dictionary, etc.) that is an instance variable of the class that needs to "remember" who it needs to talk to. It's important to realize you're trying to walk before you've learned to crawl with this platform. The only cure is to study. A lot. Guided books help.
