Beginner Question: How to automate desk allocation

I am not sure whether this is the right place, but I have my first project and don't know where to begin. I want to get into data science/ practical programming and a family friend gave me my first real project, but I don't W where to start, please point me in the right direction. Their growing company has recently embraced hot-desking, which is currently being managed manually in an excel spreadsheet. The hope is to automate this process such that one can input staff leave and get it a desk allocation, given a current floorplan and preferred clustering of teams. I am so overwhelmed that I am not sure what tool to use. The most direct approach with minimal disruption to their day to day I can see is as follows: a python program that reads a spreadsheet with staff availability/leave and outputs desk allocation in a similar format as their current solution. However, I am still not sure how to start there. Hope you can help me see the first through the trees, A confused newbie.
