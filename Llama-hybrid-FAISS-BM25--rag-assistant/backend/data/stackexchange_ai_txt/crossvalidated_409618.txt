What type of accuracy should I reported in research paper?

I have read some research papers on the classification task of deep learning, and now I am doing my own. After investigating some research paper which also provided the source code for reproducing their research, I saw many of them reported validation accuracy instead of overall accuracy (testing accuracy, in Keras it is the output of model.evaluate()). I think they should report testing accuracy instead of validation accuracy. According to my understanding, the accuracy comes from cross-validation is also validation accuracy, not overall accuracy for testing dataset. My question is, should I report testing accuracy or validation accuracy for benchmarking with other researcher..?
