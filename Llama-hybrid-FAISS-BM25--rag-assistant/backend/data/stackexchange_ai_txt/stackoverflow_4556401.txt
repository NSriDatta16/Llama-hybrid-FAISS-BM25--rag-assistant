How to stop uninterruptible threads in Java

I have a Java application that I CAN'T EDIT that starts a java.lang.Thread that has this run() method: public void run(){ while(true){ System.out.println("Something"); } } At a certain point in time I want to stop it. If I use Thread.interrupt() it doesn't work. If I use Thread.stop() it works, but this method is deprecated (so its use is discouraged as it may be removed from JVM in new releases). How to stop such uninterruptible threads in Java?
