Machine learning binary classifcation models with categorical variables. How to approach it?

I am approaching machine learning and I want to ask you some questions, hoping that they do not sound too trivial. I have a pretty small dataset with $n \simeq 500$ observations and about $p \simeq 20$ non-ordered categorical features. My aim is to perform binary classification. (I mainly will use the R package caret ). In my case, how do I know what are the possible binary classification models to choose and try? More in detail, should I have to exclude any model a priori, due to the fact, for example, that my features are categorical or due to dimensions? Once I have a list of possible models to try, how do I know how to encode categorical features? I appreciate any books, links or articles suggestions to study in deep that; thanks!
