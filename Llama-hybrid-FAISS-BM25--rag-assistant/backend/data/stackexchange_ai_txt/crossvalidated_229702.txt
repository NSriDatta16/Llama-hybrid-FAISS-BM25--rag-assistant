Correlation in Categorical Predictors?

In a follow up to one of the business problem i have discussed here, for one of the logistic regression model, i have 19 predictor variables of which around 8 are categorical with multiple categories. Instead of including all in the model where one could correlate to another, i am thinking of using a chi square test of independence at a given p value. With this i would come to realization if there is any correlation among the categorical predictors. If so i would include the correlated variables one by one in the model and would used the significant one. I have researched on this on SE where they have suggested to use chi- square but unsure if my approach to drop these correlated var is justified.
