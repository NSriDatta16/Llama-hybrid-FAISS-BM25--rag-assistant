The instructions for setting up MinGW in Ganymede are located here . The following are instructions and links on how to install the current version of MinGW. Note that these links may become inaccurate over time as new versions of MinGW components are introduced. Please check the MinGW File Release section for the latest versions. Download and run the MinGW setup program, MinGW-5.1.3.exe. Select download and install the MinGW base tools and the g++ compiler. You may select the Current or Candidate version of these tools. You may also install any of the other available compilers as well. Do not install the MinGW Make feature as the MSYS version of make from step 5 is a more complete implementation of make. The MinGW setup program currently does not install the gdb debugger. To install the debugger, download the file from the following location: gdb-6.6.tar.bz2 Extract the contents of the file gdb-6.6.tar.bz2 to the same location where you installed MinGW. If you want to use Makefile projects, download and run the setup program from the following location: MSYS-1.0.10.exe. MSYS provides an implementation of make and related command line tools. This is not required for other types of projects with the MinGW toolchain, which use CDT's internal build tools to perform the build. Following this process resolved any problems I had.
