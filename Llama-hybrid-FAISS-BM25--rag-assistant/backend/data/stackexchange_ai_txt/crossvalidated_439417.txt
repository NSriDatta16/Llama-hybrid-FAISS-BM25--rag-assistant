How many times would you need to watch a movie to have seen every moment of it (i.e. not blinking)?

Say we blink stochastically for .1 seconds every 4 seconds on average. How many times would we need to watch a 120 minute movie (assuming your eyes are glued to the screen the whole time), to have a 95% chance of seeing the entire movie? How would I solve something like this?
