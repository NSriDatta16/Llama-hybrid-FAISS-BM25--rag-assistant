Here is a machine learning based approach: Train the machine: Remove 1g from the z signal. Buffer the signal. For each buffer determine the corresponding label: 1 for plateau, 0 otherwise. Feed all buffers and labels into a machine learning classifier to train the classifier. For real time processing, construct the buffers, feed them into the machine and obtain the output which will indicate if you're in a plateau or not.
