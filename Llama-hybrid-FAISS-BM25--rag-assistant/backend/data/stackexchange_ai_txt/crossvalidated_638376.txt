If I do a PCA on centered only variables (of the same unit), does it mean that the principal components created expresses themselves with that unit?

This question might look very trivial, but PCA is still nebulous to me. If I have a set of individuals described by 10 variables: $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J$ , all quantitative and having the same unit (let's say: Euro), If I choose to only center them, and ask my PCA to find two components, and that it creates two axes: $PC_1$ summarizing $A, B$ , for example, $PC_2$ summarizing $E, F, J$ does it mean that $PC_1$ unit is euro/euro and $PC_2$ is euro/euro/euro?
