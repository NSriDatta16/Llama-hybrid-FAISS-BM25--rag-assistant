Seeking clarity regarding kernels

With regards to Bayesian statistics, I understand the kernel of a probability density function (pdf) or probability mass function (pmf) to be the form of the pdf or pmf in which any factors that are not functions of any of the variables in the domain are omitted. So to test my understanding, for a Normal distribution we would have: $N(\mu,\sigma^2)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ $\rightarrow$ and its kernel would be $\rightarrow$ $e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ and for a Binomial distribution, we would have: $Bin(n,p) = \left(n \atop x\right)p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$ $\rightarrow$ and its kernel would be $\rightarrow$ $\frac{p^x(1-p)^{n-x}}{x!(n-x)!}$ First, is my definition correct and second, is my understanding correct?
