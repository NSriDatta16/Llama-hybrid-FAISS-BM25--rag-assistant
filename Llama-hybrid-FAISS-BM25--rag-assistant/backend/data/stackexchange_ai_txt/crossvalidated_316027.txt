Quiz master agent using reinforcement learning

I am working on developing a quiz master agent using reinforcement learning. Please verify my approach and provide feedback. Also, please suggest which reinforcement learning methods are suitable to solve this problem ? Assume that Quiz master has 100 questions in question bank. Task : Ask any ten questions to student. Goal : Collect maximum reward by receiving more incorrect answers from student. Action : Publish next question. Reward : +1 if student gives wrong answer. +1 if student doesn't answer. -1 if student gives right answer. State : Answer status(Right answer,Wrong answer,Don't know, Takes time) Student performance status(Low, Average, High)
