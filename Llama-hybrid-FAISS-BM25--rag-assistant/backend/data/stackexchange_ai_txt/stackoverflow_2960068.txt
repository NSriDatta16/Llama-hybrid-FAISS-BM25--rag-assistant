I'm glad you asked that question ;-) To pass the ctrl-tab through the TabControl : Public Class MyTabControl Inherits MicroFour.StrataFrame.UI.Windows.Forms.TabControl Protected Overrides Sub OnKeyDown(ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) If e.KeyCode = Keys.Tab AndAlso e.Control Then e.Handled = False e.SuppressKeyPress = False Else MyBase.OnKeyDown(e) End If End Sub End Class On the advice of someone wiser I have moved the navigation code to my baseform class (code to delete single row with ctrl-Delete in Ultragrid remains in onkeydown of grid subclass) Protected Overrides Function ProcessCmdKey(ByRef msg As System.Windows.Forms.Message, _ ByVal keyData As System.Windows.Forms.Keys) _ As Boolean '-- check for unique keystrokes Select Case keyData Case Keys.Control Or Keys.Tab '-- created to be able to tab out of a Grid control '-- Unfortunately direct at this point still moot for grids on '-- tabcontrols as I have to set focus() to next control '-- explicitly on leaving groupbox containing grid on tabpage Me.SelectNextControl(Me.ActiveControl, True, True, True, True) Case Keys.Control Or Keys.Shift Or Keys.Tab Me.SelectNextControl(Me.ActiveControl, False, True, True, True) Case Keys.Control Or Keys.E End Select Return MyBase.ProcessCmdKey(msg, keyData) End Function I need to explicitly set the focus() to the next control on the Leave of the groupbox containing the Ultragrid as it seems to forget where it is supposed to go based on the form's TabOrderController, but this is a small price to pay. I hope to have that part genericised shortly. Will post further refinements for anyone interested.
