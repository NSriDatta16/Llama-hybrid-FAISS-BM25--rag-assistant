That depends on what you mean by better. If you are paying for the individual servers and hard drives, I might agree with you - but with azure storage you just pay for the size of the space you use. If they choose to spread it across multiple machines to get the best perf (target blob access perf is "Up to 60 MBytes/sec") then it doesn't matter with your bill. Just curious, why do you think having more partions is bad? To me it seems like with file access it is a good thing. If I have 2000 files that I want to provide the most scalable access to, I would think having those 2000 files spread across 2000 machines/hard drives would be the best performing and scalable solution ... not 2 servers/hard drives (and what happens if that doubles to 4000?). I found this blob article pretty informative (especially the area under the Partitions and Scalability and Performance Targets sections toward the bottom): Windows Azure Storage Abstractions and their Scalability Targets
