Nice thinking, J. Random. Of course I don't need every last byte, this is mostly for fun (and bragging rights at lunch). I want to be able to type du at the CD-ROM and have it very close to 4700000000. I looked at the ECMA spec but like most specs it's medium painful and I have no confidence in my ability to get it right. Also it appears not to discuss Rock Ridge extensions, or if it does, I missed it. I like your idea #3 and think I will carry it a bit further: I'll try to build a fairly rich model of what's going on and then use genisoimage -print-size on a number of filesets to estimate the parameters of the model. Then I can use the model to do my estimation. This is a hobby project so it will take a while, but I will get around to it eventually. I will post an answer here to say how much wastage is eliminated!
