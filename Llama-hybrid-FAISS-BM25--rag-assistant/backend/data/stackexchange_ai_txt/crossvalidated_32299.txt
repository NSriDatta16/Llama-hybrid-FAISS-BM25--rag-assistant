In the field of ecological statistics (e.g. mark-recapture) we often have long time series of data, where any individuals may only be exposed to sampling for only a portion of the total time series. In this context we can consider every individual that was exposed to sampling during the course of the experiment, a measure we call the superpopulation. This is different from the population at any given time point, which is the total number of individuals exposed to sampling at that time point. Both of these definitions of a population are finite measures. Aside - I used the term "exposed to sampling" as population heterogeneity is often the rule rather than the exception in ecology. Subpopulations may exist that behave differently and may completely avoid detection by our survey techniques. These individuals thus are not part of our statistical population definition.
