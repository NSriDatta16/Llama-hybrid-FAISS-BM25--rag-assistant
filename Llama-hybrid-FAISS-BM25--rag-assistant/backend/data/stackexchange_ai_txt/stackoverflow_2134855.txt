The basic problem here is, even though you don't use django.contrib.auth that information about the current logged in user is only available in the view and never in the model, because this information is bound to a request. So you will always have to do something like this in the view: def some_view(request): account = get_account_by_request(request) Then you can use the account to filter models. You can always make this approach more elegant by using a middleware or a decorator but beware that it doesn't get too tricky. Your design might break at unexpected points (happened to me) because of too much multiple inheritances with inherited managers and the like. Keep it simple and predictable.
