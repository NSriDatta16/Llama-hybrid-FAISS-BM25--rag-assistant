Delphi: BeginDrag(False) and OnStartDrag

I call BeginDrag(False, 10) in OnMouseDown event. Why OnStartDrag is called immediately? I use OnStartDrag for some "heavy" initialization and I don't want it to be fired even on simple click. Mouse behavior is ok (cursor is changed after mouse move), but event trigerring is to soon! Please help!!!
