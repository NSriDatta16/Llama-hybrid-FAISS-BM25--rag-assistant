Shouldn't the handler be added as event listner for "submit" event? It makes sense the "click" event handler returning false does not prevent default submit behavior, I think. It makes sense, kind of, that the form gets submitted to both targets. edit: added second paragraph. comment: And as Ken says the event listener should be added to the form and not the button. edit 2: So I was wrong. You shouldn't use "return false;" but something like... event.preventDefault ? event.preventDefault() : event.returnValue = false;
