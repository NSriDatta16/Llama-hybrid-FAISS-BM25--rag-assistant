As far as I know it is not possible to create filters for use in C# projects. The projects in C# are organized with the use of actual folders on your hard drive. Sorry. As for why C# and C++ have different options, well that is simply because they are different languages. C# is a more high level language then C++ so (I am only guessing) they went with folders to make it more visible what is going on in the project.
