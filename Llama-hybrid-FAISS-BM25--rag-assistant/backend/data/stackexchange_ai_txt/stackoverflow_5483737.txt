How can I use OpenGL 4 features through WebGL

I want to use some of the features of OpenGL 4 (specifically, tessellation shaders and newer shader language versions) from WebGL. Is this possible, in either a standards-compliant or a hackish way? Is there some magic value I could use instead of, say, gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER to tell the underlying GL implementation to compile tessellation shaders?
