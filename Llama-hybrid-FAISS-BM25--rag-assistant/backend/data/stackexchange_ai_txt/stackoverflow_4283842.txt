Database schema-related problem

I have a kind of theoretical question about databases. To make it more concrete I have thought up an example case. Suppose I have a store with products. I have lots of different products. Not every product has the same applicable properties. For instance, I could define the size of a harddisk in gigabytes, but cannot use that same property on a CPU, simply because it does not apply. What I want is a database where I can add properties to products dynamically. The only thing I can come up with is the following: One product table with an ID, a Name and a Description. One properties table with an ID, Product_ID, Property and a Value. This way I would potentially get a gigantic, I-suppose-not-so-efficient, table of properties. This has been bugging me for a long time now. Does anyone know a better solution to my problem?
