Forecasting Multiple (few hundreds) uni-variate time series with inflated zeros

I am a novice seeking help to gain experience in Data Science. Let us take a scenario where a big company would like to forecast its sales (a specific product) across different stores in different geographic locations. As an Analyst, a task is given to forecast a few hundred series (sales) for the next 3 months. Since, we are forecasting sales across different geographic locations, the nature of the series would not be same for all of them. There would hundreds of models to check with. What are the suggested approaches for this scenario with your experience in this field? Also, how important it is know the nature of each series in this scenario?
