That is a very open apples-to-oranges type of question. You are asking 1. the average request load for a production application 2. what is considered fast These don't neccessarily relate. Your average # of requests per second is determined by a. the number of simultaneous users b. the average number of page requests they make per second c. the number of additional requests (i.e. ajax calls, etc) As to what is considered fast.. do you mean how few requests a site can take? Or if a piece of hardware is considered fast if it can process xyz # of requests per second?
