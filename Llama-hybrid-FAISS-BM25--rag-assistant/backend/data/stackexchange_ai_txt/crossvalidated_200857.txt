What stat test to use and help with code in R (for a beginner)?

i am just wandering what test to use for the following trial: I have a one treatment at 9 different rates (untreated, 100g, 200g etc) and I want to see how 4 continuous dependent variables and 2 categorical dependent variables respond. Should I do a pca first and see what response variable I should focus on? Can you do this for the 9 different treatment rates? I do not know if it is a one-way manova that I need to preform, or multiple regression? I get confused with the R code when I have to seperate the treatments (DV) into the different rates to be compared to the IV. Thanks for the help!
