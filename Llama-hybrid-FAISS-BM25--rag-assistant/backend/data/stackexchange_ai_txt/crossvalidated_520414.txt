Is it normal that machine learning analysis lasts many hours?

I'm using 5 algorithms for machine learning analysis of my data, (coxph, coxtime, rfsrc, deephit, deepsurv) My dataset contains 40 features and 1700 observations. I used nested cross-validation (inner folds = 10, outer folds = 3) and benchmarking for optimizing hyperparameters and comparing algorithms accuracy. Hyperparameters to be optimized included number of nodes of layers, epochs, dropout, alpha for neural network, and mtry, nodesize for rfsrc. I used random_search method. For termination rule, I've chosen 60 iteration. I have started analysis at 9:00 am and now it is 2:00pm, but my computer is still analysing. my OS is windows 10, CPU intel corei7 8550U 1.8-1.99 GHz, RAM 12GB. I'm using R 4.0.3 and mlr3proba package. Is it normal for machine learning analysis to last many hours? Honestly I have read in literature that it may takes for hours, but I don't know does it apply for complexity of my analysis? or there is a problem ?
