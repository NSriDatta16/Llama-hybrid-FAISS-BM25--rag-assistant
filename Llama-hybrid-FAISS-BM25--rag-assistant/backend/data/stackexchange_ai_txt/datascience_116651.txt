Orange: Predictive Model for Future Wifi Speed

I would like to use Orange to create a model that will allow me to predict future WiFi speeds using average quarterly WiFi speed from the last few years. The data sets I am using include the average upload speed, download speed, and lat ms of every country. My project requires that I use three different models. I have chosen to use Linear Regression, kNN, and Neural Network. How would I go about creating this model?
