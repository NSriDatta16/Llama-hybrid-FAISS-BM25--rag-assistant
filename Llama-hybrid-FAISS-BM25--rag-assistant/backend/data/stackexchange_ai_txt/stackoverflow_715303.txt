If I'm following correctly, you should be able to place something similar to the following script inside the "circle_mc" clip where your shape tween is. This will allow you to create multiple instances of the clip that do the same action. I've uploaded a test for you to check out. If that's not at all what you meant, let me know. You could also create an external class to use as the base class of your graphics and put the code in there. var hasRolledOver:Boolean = false; this.onPress = function():Void { this.startDrag(); } this.onRelease = function():Void { this.stopDrag(); } this.onRollOver = function():Void { if (!hasRolledOver) { this.gotoAndPlay(2); hasRolledOver = true; } } this.onRollOut = function():Void { this.stop(); } http://typeoneerror.com/media/as/test.fla.zip
