We're working on a new cookie manager for Opera Dragonfly 1.0. It is close to being finished, but will likely not be enabled until the next version of Opera is released (due to a bug when deleting cookies). The new version will show more information (all the various fields) and give you more control. You can also edit and delete cookies from within Opera itself (right click, edit site preferences, then select the cookie tab). This works well, but doesn't allow you to add cookies.
