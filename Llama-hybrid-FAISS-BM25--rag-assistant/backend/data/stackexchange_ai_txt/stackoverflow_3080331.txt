Some questions about Django localisation

I intend to localise my Django application and began reading up on localisation on the Django site. This put a few questions in my mind: It seems that when you run the 'django-admin.py makemessages' command, it scans the files for embedded strings and generates a message file that contains the translations. These translations are mapped to the strings in the file. For example, if I have a string in HTML that reads "Please enter the recipients name", Django would consider it to be the message id. What would happen if i changed something in the string. Let's say I added the missing apostrophe to the word "recipient". Would this break the translation? In relation to the above scenario, Is it better to use full fledged sentences in the source (which might change) or would I be better off using a word like "RECIPIENT_NAME" which is less likely to change and easier to map to? Does the 'django-admin.py makemessages' command scan the Python sources as well? Thanks.
