which paper(s) to cite when stating that out-of-sample validation is better than in-sample val

Validating a model (meaning, computing metrics on the prediction) using the training samples is, well, rubbish. Out-of sample validation should be preferred. This is well known by statisticians and machine learning practicionners. However, I can hardly state it like this in a paper without a good authoritative source. Especially when the intended public is in medical field which still uses in-sample validation extensively... What would be the best paper to cite in this case?
