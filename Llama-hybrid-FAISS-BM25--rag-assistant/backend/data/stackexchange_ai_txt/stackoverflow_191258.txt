A Turing machine is Turing-complete, but that doesn't mean you should want to use one for production code. Trying to do anything non-trivial with templates is in my experience messy, ugly and pointless. You have no way to "debug" your "code", compile-time error messages will be cryptic and usually in the most unlikely places, and you can achieve the same performance benefits in different ways. (Hint: 4! = 24). Worse, your code is incomprehensible to the average C++ programmer, and will be likely be non-portable due to wide ranging levels of support within current compilers. Templates are great for generic code generation (container classes, class wrappers, mix-ins), but no - in my opinion the Turing Completeness of templates is NOT USEFUL in practice.
