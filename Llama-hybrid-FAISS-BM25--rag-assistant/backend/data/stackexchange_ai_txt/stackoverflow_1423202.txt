Authentication component options for large .NET websites

What do large websites built in .NET use for their login components? I will be implementing the login and membership features of a large .NET web application. As I see it, there are 4 options: Leverage the default Microsoft Membership Provider Build a custom Membership Provider Use a different 3rd Party Component Build an entirely custom login/authentication framework I am trying to optimize for reliability, so I would like to know if sites like MySpace or PlentyOfFish have already established a best practice in this area. The real motivation for this question is I want to validate that the MS Membership Provider strategy will scale well. I know StackOverflow uses OpenID, but I don't think that would be a good solution for what I am working on as a lot of my prospective users will be non-technical. Feel free to pitch why OpenID should be considered if you believe strongly in it.
