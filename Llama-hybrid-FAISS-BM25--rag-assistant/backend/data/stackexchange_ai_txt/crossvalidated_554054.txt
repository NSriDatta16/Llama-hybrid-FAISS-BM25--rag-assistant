Why do we trust credibility intervals to contain the true parameter?

I understand confidence intervals and to what extent they can be trusted (and why). However, I’m not so sure how to motivate why I should trust credibility intervals except insofar as they can also claim good pre-data probability of containing the true parameter. So, to the Bayesian folks — how do you convince yourself that, say, 99% credibility intervals are sufficient to bracket the true parameter in the vast majority of cases? Note: I’m asking this from a viewpoint of a frequentist view of probability and that all models should be verifiable/testable.
