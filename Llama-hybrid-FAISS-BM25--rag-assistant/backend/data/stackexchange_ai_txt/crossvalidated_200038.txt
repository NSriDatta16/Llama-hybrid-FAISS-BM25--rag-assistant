How to train convolutional neural networks with multi-channel images?

I have $m$ labeled images, each with 224x224 pixels and 5 different image channels. What is the best way to train a CNN architecture using this data when $m$ is small (less than 2000)? Is it possible to consider each channel as a separate image or is it better to input all $n$ channels into the input layer at the same time?
