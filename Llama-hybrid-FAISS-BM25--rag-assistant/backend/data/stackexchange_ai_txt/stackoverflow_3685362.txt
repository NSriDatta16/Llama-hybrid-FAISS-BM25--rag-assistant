Any time you are using catalog/product objects, there is in fact a memory leak, and your app will not be able to export everything at once. This is most likely the reason for the structure of the core Dataflow module. In the past, I have used two solutions: Break the export up into chunks, as DataFlow does. Write your own wrappers for the data, rather than using Magento's If you take the implicit third option of fixing Varien's memory leak, please remember to contribute it back as a bugfix. :) Hope that helps!
