How can i rush the product to the market to meet deadline

I client of mines do not care about elegant and well structured code. I am writing the applications from scratch with minimal 3rd party tools. I am using l2s, Recatcha, tinymce, lucene, and structure map. I would like to quickly get the clients product to the market as fast as possible while sacrificing elegant code. Are there any tools out there that will enable me to rush the product to the market?
