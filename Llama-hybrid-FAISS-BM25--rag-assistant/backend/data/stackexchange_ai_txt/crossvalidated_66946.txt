How are the standard errors computed for the fitted values from a logistic regression?

When you predict a fitted value from a logistic regression model, how are standard errors computed? I mean for the fitted values , not for the coefficients (which involves Fishers information matrix). I only found out how to get the numbers with R (e.g., here on r-help, or here on Stack Overflow), but I cannot find the formula. pred If you could provide online source (preferably on a university website), that would be fantastic.
