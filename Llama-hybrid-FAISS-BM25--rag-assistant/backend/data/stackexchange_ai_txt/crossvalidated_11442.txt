Simon Jackman has some working code for fitting ANOVA and regression models with JAGS (which is pretty like BUGS), e.g. two-way ANOVA via JAGS (R code) or maybe among his handouts on bayesian analysis for the social sciences . A lot of WinBUGS code, including one- and two-way ANOVA, seem to be available on the companion website for Bayesian Modeling Using WinBUGS: An introduction .
