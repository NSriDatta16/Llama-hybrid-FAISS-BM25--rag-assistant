Removing Multi-Collinearity Reduces F1 score

I was trying to build a classification model and I found that the features were highly correlated. I tried run a random forest model on the features and got an F1 score of 0.44 but when I removed the MultiCollinearity using VIF I saw that my F1 score reduces to 0.28. What could be the possible reasons for that?
