There is no single magic bullet to estimate treatment effects in the context of confounding (note: "selection bias" can mean something else ). There is also no agreement in the field about the best method, and the best method for a given problem may differ from the best method for another (and neither will be immediately apparent). My understanding is that some of the best performing methods are the "multiply robust" methods, which include targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) with a BART propensity score. I describe these methods with references in this post . These methods are multiply robust in that there are numerous forms of misspecification that they are robust to (i.e., they will give you an unbiased or low-error estimate even if you get some things wrong about the relationships among variables). The more standard doubly robust methods are those that give you two chances to correctly specify a model in order to arrive at an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. Augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) with parametric outcome and propensity score models is one such example; if either the outcome model or propensity score model is correct, the effect estimate is unbiased. Multiply robust methods are robust to these misspecifications but also to misspecifications of the functional form of the relationship between the covariates and the treatment or outcome. They gain this property through flexible nonparameteric modeling of these relationships. Such methods are highly preferred because they require fewer untestable assumptions to get the right answer, in contrast to propensity score matching or regression, which require strong assumptions about functional form. I would check out the best performers of the annual Atlantic Causal Inference Conference competition, as these represent the cutting edge of causal inference methods and are demonstrated to perform well in a variety of conditions. TMLE and BART were two of the best performers, and are both accessible and easy to use. I'm not going to write off the other methods you mention, but they do require many assumptions that cannot easily be assessed or they have been demonstrated to perform poorly in a number of contexts. They are still the standards in the health sciences, but that is slowly changing as the advanced methods become better studied and more accessible.
