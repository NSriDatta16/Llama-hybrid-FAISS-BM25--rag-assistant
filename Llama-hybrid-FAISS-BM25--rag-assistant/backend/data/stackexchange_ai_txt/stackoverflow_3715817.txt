How to do I use a web proxy with Perl's WWW::Mechanize?

I'm trying to use WWW::Mechanize with a proxy server, but seems like I cant get it to work. Since Mechanize is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent, I've been reading about the proxy thing over link text I have a list of proxies, for example: 74.87.151.157:8000 69.171.152.25:3128 190.253.82.253:8080 189.11.196.221:3128 41.234.205.201:8080 I have no idea how to use them. Thanks,
