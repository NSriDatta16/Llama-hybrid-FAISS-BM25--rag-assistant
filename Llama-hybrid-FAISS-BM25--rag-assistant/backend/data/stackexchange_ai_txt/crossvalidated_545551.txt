Some extra comments to the post above. When dealing with time-series an R squared (or adjusted R^2) would always be greater if explanatory variables were not differenced. However, when it goes to out-of-time fit, the error term would be significantly higher for non-differenced time series. This happens because of trends presented in the data and generally well-known issue. But it is a good way showing why this measure should probably, be last on the list when choosing most appropriate time-series model.
