As Marc says, you first need to define "better". "Statistical significance" is only applicable if you want to say whether the 4.5 and the 4.8 averages are statistically significantly different from each other. (It may be that the amount of information you have, and the kind of information, doesn't allow you to actually say that the two recipes do in fact have different average ratings.) It gets even more complicated: "statistically significantly different" is not "practically significantly different". Are the ratings on the same website or on two different sites? If they're on two different sites, the raters and therefore how hard or easy they rate things could be completely different. Even on the same website, different recipes might appeal to very different cooks who rate on different scales. What about time: what if one recipe was mostly rated 5 years ago when it first came out, but the other is mostly rated in the last six months? Does that matter to you? What if one recipe is considerably harder to get right? (So that average cooks are more likely to mess it up or figure it's too hard.) Etc.
