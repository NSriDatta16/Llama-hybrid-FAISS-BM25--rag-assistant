Rows Into Columns and Grouping

I have a query that looks like this: SELECT OrganizationName, OrganizationID, ReceivableStatus, InvoiceFee FROM v_InvoicesFreelanceOutstanding ORDER BY OrganizationID The data from that might look like this: OrganizationName OrganizationID ReceivableStatus InvoiceFee ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Company A 139 60-90 days 672.00 Company A 139 60-90 days 1800.00 Company A 139 over 90 days 1440.00 Company B 264 Current 3559.38 Company B 264 60-90 days 3785.50 Company C 271 60-90 days 446.25 Company C 271 over 90 days 637.50 Company C 271 over 90 days 1126.25 What I want to eventually display is something like this (for the data above): Company Current 30-60 days 60-90 days over 90 days Total ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Company A 0 0 2472.00 0 2472.00 Company B 3559.38 0 3785.50 0 7344.88 Company C 0 0 446.25 1763.75 2210.00 My SQL-fu is not enough to get me past this: SELECT MAX(OrganizationName) as OrganizationName, OrganizationID, ReceivableStatus, SUM(InvoiceFee) as TotalDue FROM v_InvoicesFreelanceOutstanding GROUP BY OrganizationID, ReceivableStatus Which shows something like this (again, from the data above): OrganizationName OrganizationID ReceivableStatus TotalDue ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Company A 139 60-90 days 2472.00 Company A 139 over 90 days 1440.00 Company B 264 Current 3559.38 Company B 264 60-90 days 3785.50 Company C 271 60-90 days 446.25 Company C 271 over 90 days 1763.75 What then? Any help would be appreciated. Note that the statuses shown in the 2nd table ( Current , 30-60 days , 60-90 days , over 90 days ) are the only ones I'm expecting to come up under ReceivableStatus . EDIT : Sorry for not including this. I am aware of PIVOT but I couldn't get it to do what I want.
