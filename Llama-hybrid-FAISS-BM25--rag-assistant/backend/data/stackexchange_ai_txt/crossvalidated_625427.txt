How to do a Markov process that generates "loopable" sequences?

I have a data set of sequential events that I could train a higher order Markov model on so that it generates sequences of events that are similar to the input set. The properties of the generated sequence I am looking for: it is finite it needs to be "loopable", meaning that the transition from the last event to the first event must follow the transition probabilities of the model I know this makes it a whole different beast from a simple Markov process. What are good ways to solve this? Does a problem like this perhaps already have a good name I could google for? (I did try things like "Markov chain constraints" but it mostly leads me to scientificy papers that take me a lot of time to understand if they even try to address my specific problem.)
