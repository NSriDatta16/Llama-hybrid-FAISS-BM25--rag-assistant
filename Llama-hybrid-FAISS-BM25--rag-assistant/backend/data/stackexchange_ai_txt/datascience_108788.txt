When you only have time as explanatory variable, you can only derive a linear time trend in the targets. Given a standard linear model you will need to estimate one model per target. df = data.frame(x=c(2017,2018,2019,2020,2021),y=c(0.65,0.69,0.78,0.81,0.85)) reg = lm(y~x,data=df) summary(reg) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -1.042e+02 1.093e+01 -9.532 0.00245 ** x 5.200e-02 5.416e-03 9.601 0.00240 ** The regression result in my example tells you that when $x$ (years) go up by one unit, $y$ (the "indicator") will go up by 0.0052 on average. When you plot the results, it will look like below. pred = predict(reg,newdata=df) plot(df $x,df$ y,ylab="y",xlab="time") lines(df $x,df$ y) lines(df$x,pred,col="red") So you can capture a linear time trend (red line) in the target, but nothing else. From your description it is not clear if the "indicators" relate to each other and can probably be used as explanatory variables as well.
