False. There is an easy test: Assume the bias in the original set creation algorithm is "creates sets whose arithmetic average is significantly lower than expected average". Obviously, shuffling the result of the algorithm will not change the averages and thus not remove the bias. Also, regarding your clarification: How would you shuffle the set? Using the same bad output from the bad RNG that created the set in the first place? Or using a better RNG? Which raises the question why you don't use that directly.
