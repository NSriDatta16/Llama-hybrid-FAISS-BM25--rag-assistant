See How to build stand-alone SOAP web services using Delphi? In particular, People in Indy 10 and IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge with CBuilder 2009 posted modified version. For example, IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge.pas is by Jochanan van der Niet. According to Robert Petek , I used Delphi 2009 with Indy 10 and modified IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge.pas a bit. It looks the problem is in the TIdHTTPAppRequest.GetStringVariable function where Content property is filled with FRequestInfo.UnparsedParams. This is empty when it gets a POST command. I've debugged the code and saw the contents is in the FRequestInfo.PostStream. Try to set the result for the Content property to the PostStream contents when FRequestInfo.CommandType is hcPOST. You will also need to fix the result value for the ContentLength property. It worked for me.
