How to cancel 'seeking' state of Flex3 VideoDisplay class

I have a VideoDisplay instance playing some video. When I click on the video slider (also my component) the property videoDisplay.playheadTime is set and the videoDisplay.state goes from 'playing' into a 'seeking' state for a brief moment (the videoDisplay seeks for a new position and then plays the video again). Intended bevaiour. But if I'm (or any random user) fast enough, I can set the playheadTime again while the player is still in 'seeking' state. When repeated several times every click is enqueued and the videoDisplay jump on every place of the video I have clicked(this is happening in an interval about 10-15 second after my last click). When I use live dragging the videoDisplay , overwhelmed by seekings, goes into 'error' state. My question is - is there any way to cancel seeking state of the VideoDisplay class? For example player is in 'seeking' state, I set playheadTime , and the player forgets about last seeking and try to find the new place of the video. I will downvote pointless answers like 'Use the Flex4 VideoPlayer class'!
