Creating images (and also stopping/restarting) is only possible for EBS-based AMI instances, not for instance-store images, which boot from local and non-persistent storage. Bundling from the console is possible only for Windows-based machines that are instance-store instances (don't remember why, it's somehow related to the AMI-tools).
