Wilcoxon test to support logistic regression

I want to test the hypothesis that IV 2 (post-test value) is a better predictor for the criteria (no success vs. success) than IV 1 (pre-test value). Those IVs are indicators for static vs. dynamic learning. I conducted a logistic regression analysis for both IVs seperately and it seems that IV 2 is indeed the better predictor. Now I would like to support this finding with the wilcoxon-test. I seperated the data into the groups "no success" and "success", but I'm not quite sure how to go from here because I have trouble to understand which procedure is correct to test my hypothesis... Do I have to compute a variable with a hypothetic value of 0 ---> wilcoxon test with IV 1 and the hypothetic value variable, repeat this step with the IV 2 Or do I have to follow the usual procedure and just compare IV 1 and IV 2? What is the right procedure to complement the logistic regression analysis? Thanks for any advice!
