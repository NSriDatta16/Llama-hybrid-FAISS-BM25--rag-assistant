Think Python would be my first choice for teaching programming. The book is free, python is free, and some really good IDE's are free - Stani's Python editor or Wing IDE 101 . This provides a really good environment and set of resources for teaching programming to kids in that age range. If programming is a bit much for the younger kids, PyGame can be used to get simple graphics on the screen fast - and that is a great way to hold onto attention span. EDIT: I just ran across a great book for introducing computer programming to kids (and other beginners): Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners . This book uses Python as the programming language, and the projects are all simple games. Overall, this is a great book for introducing kids to computer programming.
