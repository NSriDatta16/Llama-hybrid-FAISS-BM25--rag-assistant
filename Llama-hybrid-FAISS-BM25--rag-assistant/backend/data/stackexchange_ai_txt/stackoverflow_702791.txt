a) .ascx can't be accessed directly becasue the default handler is the class System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler .asmx files can be called directly, they are webmethods (though you usually have to make POST request, unless you specify to allow GET's in the web.config b) The .ashx extention is defined in a config file it's just not the web.config, its in the machine.config http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bya7fh0a.aspx Why use .ashx: The difference is that the .NET class that handles a .ashx reads the Page directive in the .ashx file to map the request to a class specified in that directive. This saves you from having to put an explicit path in the web.config for every handler that you have, which could result in a very long web.config. -- c) Global.asax: i don't use gloabl.asax, i rather use the very elegant HttpModule solution, but it's probably setup for legacy sites that had global.asax files.
