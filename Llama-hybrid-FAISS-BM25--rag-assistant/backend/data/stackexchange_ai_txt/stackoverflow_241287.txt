I wouldn't recommend evaluating user-contributed PHP-code -- even within a runkit sandbox. PHP is a very complex language, and it's closely tied to its environment. Without knowing the specifics, I would anticipate that there are numerous holes that people could leverage to break out of the sandbox. There are other languages, that you can embed, than javascript. Lua is a popular choice for these kinds of things. There is even a php extension in pecl , with bindings for it. If you're going the runkit route anyway, you could look into a shared memory solution, such as memcache , for exchanging data between processes.
