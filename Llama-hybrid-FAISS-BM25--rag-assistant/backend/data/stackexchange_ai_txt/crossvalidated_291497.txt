Saving plot .pdf to working directory in R for a Mac

I am working on a MacBook Pro OSX 10.12.5 and R 3.4.0. I have run a simple linear regression (and lmer plots, but one step at a time) utilizing the effects package. It is a common issue that R will crash when trying to utilize any GUI commands on a Mac. I was using the grab application then converting to a pdf but that is cumbersome. I am looking for something that will save my plot as a .pdf to my working directory as a work around to the Mac bug. I have seen packages like knir however, that is not helpful or I am doing something wrong. is there an elegant solution? example of my plot code below: eff.IV thanks in advance.
