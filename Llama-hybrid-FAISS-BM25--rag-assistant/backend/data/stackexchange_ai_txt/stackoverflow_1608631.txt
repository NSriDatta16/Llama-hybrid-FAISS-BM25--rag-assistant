How to have an image top left and bottom right

Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong here? What I have are quote images. I want to wrap the text in between these quotes. The open quote is fine and displays correctly. The image is top left and the text wraps around and below it. The closing quote however will not render properly. It goes below the paragraph tag. Thanks adfda lskg;alsjglkajg jlg; ;lkj g;lk aglkj;lgkjlkjg alkjs glkjhaslkj hjkas hglkj asg hagl .post p { line-height: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 20px 0; } Anyone??
