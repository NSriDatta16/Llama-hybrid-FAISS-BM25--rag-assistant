You've completely misunderstood what you need, but luckily you mentioned MIDI. You need to use the multi-byte encoding that MIDI defines, which is somewhat similar to UTF-8 in that less than 8 bits of data are placed into each octet, with the remaining providing information about the number of bits used. See the description on wikipedia . Pay close attention to the fact that protobuf uses this encoding, you can probably reuse some of Google's code.
