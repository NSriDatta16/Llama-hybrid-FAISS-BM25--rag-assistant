From my experience it doesn't make any difference. They all generally use the same set of algorithms behind the scene for the encryption of the traffic and thus it is the implmentation of those algorithms that are more likely to make a difference. The only consideration I would make would be if the client machines have the Certifying authorities certificate installed. This generally leads to Verisign or a large one being chosen but that was a few years ago now, I believe the coverage is now a lot better.
