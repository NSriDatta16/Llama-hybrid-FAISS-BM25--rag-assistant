Estimation of the covariance matrix

Assume we have $n$ iid random vectors $y_1, y_2, â€¦, y_n$, normally distributed with zero mean and unknown covariance matrix $M$. Each vector is of size $p$. I know a lot of methods that provide a sparse estimation of the true unknown covariance matrix. My question: Consider the case when $p\gg n$. Is it possible to have an estimate covariance matrix which is better than the true one? I mean by better that I can use the new estimate covariance instead of the true one (assumed to be known now) in specific applications such as hyperspectral image detection, classification, etc. For example: Take the article of Ledoit and Wolf entitled "A well-conditioned estimator for large-dimensional covariance matrices" . They developed a new estimator which is the weighted average between the sample covariance and the identity matrix. They mentioned in the article that the new estimator is more accurate than either of them (page 2). So if we consider that the true covariance matrix, which is unknown, is indeed the identity (just create this hypothesis), we can expect that the new estimator of Ledoit and Wolf is better. Is it not logical what I am assuming? Any help will be very appreciated!
