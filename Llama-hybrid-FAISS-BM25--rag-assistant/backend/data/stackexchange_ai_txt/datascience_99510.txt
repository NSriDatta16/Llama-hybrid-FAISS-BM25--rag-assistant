$\gamma$ is a hyperparameter of the reinforcement learning algorithm, so you can apply technics for hyperparameter optimization like grid search or bayesian optimization. There is no general recommendation possible because it depends on the problem you want to solve. But you probably will need a value near 1 if your rewards are quite sparse
