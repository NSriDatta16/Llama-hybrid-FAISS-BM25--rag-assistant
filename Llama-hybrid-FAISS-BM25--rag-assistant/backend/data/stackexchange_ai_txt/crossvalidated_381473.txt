This sounds like a within-subjects test, to me. If you want to compare differences within a single sample, I recommend a paired-samples (some times called dependent samples) t -test. It tests whether the difference between two sets of scores from the same cases are different from 0 on average. If you want to compare more than 2 distributions of scores simultaneously, a repeated measures ANOVA would be appropriate, with your within-subjects factor being the item response code (e.g., a, b, c, etc. in your example above). These tests are fairly robust to violations of their assumptions, but if your data are truly ordinal (i.e., scale of 1-5) alternative, non-parametric tests may be more appropriate.
