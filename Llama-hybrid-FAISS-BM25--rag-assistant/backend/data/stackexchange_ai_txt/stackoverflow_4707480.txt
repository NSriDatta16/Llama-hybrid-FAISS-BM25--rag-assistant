App crashes after 4 minutes

I'm getting a strange crash during an arc4random call that only appears after about 4 minutes of the app running, and it doesn't do it every time. Here's the crash log: Incident Identifier: 25C8C57F-0434-40B2-A2E8-FE88F58ABF60 CrashReporter Key: 8683ce910e9db4ba69f61266b606396f941d08ee Hardware Model: iPhone2,1 Version: ??? (???) Code Type: ARM (Native) Parent Process: launchd [1] Date/Time: 2011-01-16 18:46:45.170 +0000 OS Version: iPhone OS 4.2.1 (8C148a) Report Version: 104 Exception Type: 00000020 Exception Codes: 0x8badf00d Highlighted Thread: 0 Application Specific Information: failed to resume in time Elapsed total CPU time (seconds): 5.930 (user 5.380, system 0.550), 100% CPU Elapsed application CPU time (seconds): 4.790, 81% CPU Thread 0: 0 libSystem.B.dylib 0x31168006 pthread_mutex_lock + 50 1 libSystem.B.dylib 0x3118cb10 arc4random + 24 2 0x0000f658 -[BasicGameLayer updateBoard] (BasicGameScreen.mm:318) 3 0x00010790 -[BasicGameLayer handleTouches:withEvent:] (BasicGameScreen.mm:238) 4 0x0000e504 -[BasicGameLayer ccTouchesBegan:withEvent:] (BasicGameScreen.mm:276) Line 318 of BasicGameScreen.mm is an opening brace. I'm assuming the compiler is removing whitespace so I think the line it's crashing on is int selection = arc4random() % 16;
