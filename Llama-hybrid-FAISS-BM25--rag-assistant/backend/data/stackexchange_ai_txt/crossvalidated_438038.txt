What is a unit increase in logistic regression on standardized data?

I am confused about the unit increase on a dataset that has been standardized to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. E.g. the temperature went from 0 to 100 deg initially, and from -1.5 top 1.5 after standardization. What does the unit increase mean in coefficient analysis for logistic regression now? Is this unit still one unit in the non-standardized data, such as temperature goes from 99 to 100, or is it some relative measure, such as temperature goes from -1.5 to -0.5?
