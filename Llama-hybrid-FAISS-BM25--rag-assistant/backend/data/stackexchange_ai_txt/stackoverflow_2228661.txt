Draw and manipulate shapes at run time

What's the best way to draw shapes interactively at run time using Delphi? I need to be able to select, drag and resize the shapes. This will be used to mark up existing images and documents. This looks like a good starting point , but I'm wondering if there's a more complete library (preferably free) available that will save some time. Update: If you're going with a custom solution from scratch, I've seen another example on Delphi Central that might be an even better starting point .
