The level of coverage for a region of code should be directly proportional to a combination of the likelihood of change and the amount of functionality that depends on it. For example, we have some fairly complex parsing logic at the core of our base control classes. We unit-test the absolute piss out of it because it has to handle input which comes from systems outside our influence (high possibility of change) + ALL of our UI controls depend on it to be stable. The slightest tweak in the base ripples and magnifies through layers of inheritance and dependency.
