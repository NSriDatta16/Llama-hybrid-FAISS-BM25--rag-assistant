GEE and Mixed Model Coefficients are not usually thought of as the same. An effective notation for this is to denote GEE coefficient vectors as $\beta^{(m)}$ (the marginal effects) and mixed model coefficient vectors as $\beta^{(c)}$ (the conditional effects). These effects are obviously going to be different for non-collapsible link functions since the GEE averages several instances of the conditional link across several iterations. The standard errors for the marginal and conditional effects are also obviously going to be different. A third and oft overlooked problem is that of model misspecification. GEE gives you tremendous insurance against departures from model assumptions. Because of robust error estimation, GEE linear coefficients using the identity link can always be interpreted as an averaged first order trend. Mixed models give you something similar, but they will be different when the model is misspecified.
