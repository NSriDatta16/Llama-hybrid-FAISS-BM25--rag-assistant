Weighted Linear Regression in Java

Does anyone know of a scientific/mathematical library in Java that has a straightforward implementation of weighted linear regression? Something along the lines of a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the corresponding coefficients: linearRegression(x,y,weights) This seems fairly straightforward, so I imagine it exists somewhere. PS) I've tried Flannigan's library: http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/Regression.html , it has the right idea but seems to crash sporadically and complain out my degrees of freedom?
