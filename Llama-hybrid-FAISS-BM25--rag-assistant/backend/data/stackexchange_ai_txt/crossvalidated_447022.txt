Differences do make it stationary when a level/step shift indicator is introduced to reflect a deterministic effect at period 23 . No need to segment the data ...just use a comprehensive hybrid model found via http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . Here is a useful model using AUTOBOX (a time series forecasting package that I have helped to develop) (0,1,0)(1,0,0)4 with a level shift ( i.e. intercept change at period 23 and a pulse at period 22 .The Actual/Fit and Forecast is here . The Residuals are here with acf here suggesting model sufficiency . The model includes simple differencing and an intercept adjustment at period 23 along with a simple pulse and a seasonal ar component. Quite simple but powerful and elegant. Your comment "I also tried tsoutliers package to look for interventions, but it gives me errors " suggests to me possible serious software limitations or a possible "user error" which I can't immediately detect . The Actual/Cleansed graph is illuminating. while the forecast graph illustrates the 95% prediction limits using monte-carlo resampling. EDITED TO SHOW EXPLICITELY HOW A FORECAST IS MADE: The model can be expanded via algebra to present how a prediction can be seen as a "regression type model" . Here is a one-period out forecast computation where differences and autoregressive lag structure is incorporated..
