Add CMS link to nav - Force Active State

so i added this: getUrl('blog')?>"> __('Blog') ?> and also tried this: getRequest()->getAlias(Mage_Core_Model_Url_Rewrite::REWRITE_REQUEST_PATH_ALIAS) == 'blog') { echo 'class="active"'; } else { echo 'class="blog"'; } ?>> getUrl('blog')?>"> __('Blog') ?> in top.phtml. the link appears as expected. but it does not display the active state of the button (the rectangle around the text) like the native links do. here is the page: http://pro-tools-training.com/new-magento2/index.php/ (click all the links in the nav and you'll see they all hold the active state except Blog)
