Nested design -- adonis function in vegan R package

I am using the adonis function in the vegan package to determine differences in dissimilarities in a community (PCB congeners) between several different factors. ## Adonis Model pcbtest3 BASIN has 3 levels, FISH_CLASS has two levels and REACH has two levels. I would like to use this procedure to run a model where BASIN is nested and directly test for community similarities between factors, FISH_CLASS and REACH . Does using adonis() within vegan seem reasonable?
