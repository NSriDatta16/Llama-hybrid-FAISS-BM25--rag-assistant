Git has very strong conventions on log messages, but the rules are simple: First line is a summary of the commit First line may have a scope description prefix "module:" Second line is empty Then follows a discussion in paragraphs, as long as it needs be As a start you should use these conventions, as the presentation tools even rely on them (The second line being empty is important, and in many situations, you will only see the first line summary.) With git, commits should be small so the first answer is of course, you shouldn't modify many things in one commit. You should have three commits, not one. But, you can write a whole essay in the commit log, and there you can describe their changes in all detail (motivation, discarded designs, ideas). If the three changes truly belong together, this text will make it clear why. I found more instructions describing the same Git Commit message conventions, with examples for which git commands depend on the particular format. (Most of it is all based on an existing convention: Patches sent by emails.)
