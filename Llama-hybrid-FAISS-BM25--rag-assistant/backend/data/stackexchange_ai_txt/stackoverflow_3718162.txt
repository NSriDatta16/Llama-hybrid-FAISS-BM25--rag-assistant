fast retrieval of (void *) memory block

I have a system that returns a void* to a memory block. This memory block stores contiguous data records of different types(int,char,double etc.) and gives the number of bytes of each field in each record.I essentially look up the type of the record and get the value of the record. To retrieve all the records, I do switch(type) { case 'int' : \*(int*)(ptr+index) case 'char': \*(char*)(ptr+index) } When I have to go through 300000 records this is taking a lot of time.Is there a faster way to go through all the records?
