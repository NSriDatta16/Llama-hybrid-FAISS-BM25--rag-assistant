I currently have an activity that does not have an xml layout file. All items are added when needed. I am not in need to add a image to it and it doesnt seem to do anything... ImageView iv = new ImageView(this); iv.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.FIT_CENTER); Bitmap bm = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/Pics/Pic_1.jpg"); iv.setImageBitmap(bm); ll.addView(iv); The image is in the correct folder...11 at the end is the Linear view i am adding the image view too...am i missing something?
