Testing Composite WPF applications

How do I go about testing Composite WPF applications? I was looking at the Composite Application Library and the Stock Trader reference implementation for examples, but I don't understand how their tests are organized. I have several modules that are compiled to DLLs and referenced by my main shell. What do I need to do to test the individual modules? Can everything be done through unit tests? Do I need to provide a mock shell?
