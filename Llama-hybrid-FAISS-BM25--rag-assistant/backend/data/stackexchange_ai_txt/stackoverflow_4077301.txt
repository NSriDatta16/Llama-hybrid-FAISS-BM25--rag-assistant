Sounds like the movie file is corrupt. Have you checked the size is as it should be? Have you tried other files? Where are you playing from? IsoatedStorage or from within the XAP? You can also try playing the file with the MediaPlayerLauncher to confirm that it is complete and not corrupt. If it plays fine with the launcher please provide an exmaple of what you're actually trying to do in code.
