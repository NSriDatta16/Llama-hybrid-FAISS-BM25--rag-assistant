collection of features resulting 50% accuracy, how to explain that?

If there are 14 peoples, each of them has its own distinct theory base on some fact (there are no correlation between their theory) for predicting tomorrow will it rain or not. each of them do a vote on it, and the majority vote win and make decision of tomorrow will it be rain or not. after one month of predicting the next day weather, the accuracy is average 50% of days in that month is correct. Then, what kind of reasoning (for further analysis) I can give out to explain that these 14 theories end up like the probability of flipping a coin?
