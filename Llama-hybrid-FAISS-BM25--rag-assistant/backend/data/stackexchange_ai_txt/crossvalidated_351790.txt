What does the result of a fitted cox ph model tell me?

I am currently experimenting with survival analysis in R. One important Model is the Cox Proportional Hazard Model . Using the default lung data the R enviroment provides, I would like to play with the model, using the mlr-package . My code: data("lung") # get data lung = na.omit(lung) # remove rows with missing values lung$status = (lung$status == 2) # convert to logical n = nrow(lung) lung.train = sample(n, size = 0.8*n) lung.test = setdiff(1:n, train.set) # cox proportional hazard coxph.lrn = makeLearner("surv.coxph") coxph.tsk = makeSurvTask(data = lung, target = c("time", "status")) coxph.mod = train(coxph.lrn, coxph.tsk, subset = lung.test) coxph.tsk.pred = predict(coxph.mod, task = coxph.tsk, subset = lung.test) The output of coxph.tsk.pred will be the following: Prediction: 35 observations predict.type: response threshold: time: 0.00 id truth.time truth.event response 4 2 210 TRUE 1.1528966 21 13 301 TRUE 0.1532789 30 20 12 TRUE 1.9269353 31 21 473 TRUE -0.3327164 35 24 53 TRUE 2.0432497 41 29 460 TRUE 0.3784922 ... (#rows: 35, #cols: 4) Question 1: What does response tell me? Assumption: exp(response) is the risk ratio between an individual and the average individual. Is this correct? Question 2: I can use the concordance index to measure the performance of models predictions, using performance(coxph.tsk.pred, measures = cindex) # output: 0.79 What does the 0.79 tell me? Assumption: Cindex compares, if two individuals are concordant and outputs 1, if the are. In this case in my understanding cindex should compare the predicted risk of patients and have a look, if a patient with higher risk dies earlier than one with lower risk. This model seems to predict that correctly in ~80% of the cases. Is my assumption correct?
