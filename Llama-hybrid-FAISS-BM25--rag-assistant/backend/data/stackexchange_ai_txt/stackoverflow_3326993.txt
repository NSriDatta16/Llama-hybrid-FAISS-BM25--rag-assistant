XMLRPC problem with a Rails app

I'm trying to access an XMLRPC API (for the Magento PHP app) from my Rails application. I'm using a gem however whenever I try to connect on my local machine (Snow Leopard) I get this error: no such file to load -- xmlrpc This is triggered by a line require 'xmlrpc' Is there a specific Ruby XMLRPC gem I need to install? Sorry for the stupid question...
