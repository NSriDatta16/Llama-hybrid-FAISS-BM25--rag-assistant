In Windows->Preferences->Android->Build you can just change your DEBUG KEYSTORE. The Keystore you specify there, is not for signing an app for release, but just for debugging. Like the default debug keystore, the custom debug keystore needs to have the following: Keystore password: "android" Key alias: "androiddebugkey" Key password: "android" Except for the name of the keystore itself, information about the organizational units and the key behind the alias, all data have to be same as the default debug keystore
