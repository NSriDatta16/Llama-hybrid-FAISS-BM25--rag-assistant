If it's really important, you could work around it by defining a string containing the script URL in front of each script tag: SCRIPT_URL = "http://www.bar.com/script.js" Inside the script file you can then access the URL alert("my URL is "+SCRIPT_URL); Not too elegant but should work. You could also, if you have a server-side language like PHP and don't mind sending JS files through the interpreter (Big performance caveat!), do something like this within the JS file: var my_url = " " but that should really, really be the last resort.
