What kind of approach should I apply for face validation with using deep learning?

My research task is face recognition in cars with using deep learning method. Actually, in example we set an driver randomly and then the question is: Is this person driver or not? So i created an custom dataset that includes 47 different persons's faces when they are driving cars. Every person's have 3000 face images and I used MTCNN for detect faces from images. But I'm confused; is the problem multi-class classification or binary? I mean the result is binary (driver or not) but we'll set driver after created this model. for that I can not divide the dataset like driver and others. When I researched I found that one-class classification approach. Deep One-Class Classification Is this help me or not, I don't get it. What I should do?
