POST data, Sessions and other forms transmitted to another website

I am an affiliate of an online store, and I promote it through my own website which is targeted for a specific language. One of the issues i'm having with my affiliated site, is that he would not translate his website to the language I am promoting it in. Meaning, when I redirect to his website with my referral code, the visitor is suddenly seeing English text as the affiliated site is not supporting the visitor's language. I thought I would replicate his entire website (Magento based) and translating it all. But the problem is that I don't and can't handle the actual payment processing, so I need to transfer all POST data, Session info and everything relevant to the action script on the affiliated website without showing it to the visitor. Is that possible? Can anyone think of a better way to accomplish what i'm trying to do here? Thanks,
