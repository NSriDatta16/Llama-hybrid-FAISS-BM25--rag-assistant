In the comments, you remark that you would use a linear regression to model this for a continuous $y$ variable. This sounds like a reasonable idea, particularly since linear regression allows for nonlinear basis functions that introduce curvature (e.g., polynomials or splines) and interactions between variables. Since you have a binary $y$ , however, it is reasonable to model a slightly different way. A typical approach might be to use a generalized linear model like a logistic regression. A nice property of generalized linear models is that all of the tricks you can apply to the features in linear models also apply to generalized linear models. For the ordinal $y$ , similar logic applies to a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression. While you have commented that you seems to be more interested in correlation than regression, correlation is almost a special case of linear regression, so an extension to a regression framework seems acceptable.
