two ways to compute average prices

I am doing some simple math computation. I have three variables: Goods, total price, and total unit (See below). All I wanted to do is to compute the average price per unit. Method 1 I computed price per unit for each goods: total_price/total_unit. This gives me the column "price_per_unit_per_goods". Then I compute the the average price per unit by sum the 5 numbers of price_per_unit_per_goods and divide the sum by 5. So (196.0784+1000+714.2857+655.7377+2380.952)/5 = 989.4108. Method 2 I just did sum of total price divided by sum of total unit. So (10000+20000+30000+40000+50000)/(51+20+42+61+21) = 769.2308 My question. Why is the average price per unit not the same using these two methods (989.4108 vs. 769.2308)? Any explanations (with references) would be greatly appreciated!
