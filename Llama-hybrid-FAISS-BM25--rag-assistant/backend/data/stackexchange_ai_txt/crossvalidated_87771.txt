Rationale behind Good–Turing frequency estimation?

Good–Turing frequency estimation is a smoothing estimator for estimating a multinomial distribution. It seems very convoluted. From mathematical statistics point of view, what is the rationale behind the construction of Good–Turing frequency estimation? Is it a shrinkage estimator ? Is it based on the posterior distribution with respect to some prior distribution on the parameters, in Bayesian inference view? Is it not additive smoothing , is it? What type of smoothing is it?
