This is exactly the way to go, the way I (and some other colleagues) read it. They detail the data generation process in section 4.2 (Data generation). The VAE1 is only there to get the most important features of the photos into a latent space that is then translated into a different latent (discovered with VAE2) space via Mapping T. There is a twist on the VAE1, though, as they use a GAN to align the domains of the latent spaces. They use the Pascal VOC 2012 Dataset if I recall.
