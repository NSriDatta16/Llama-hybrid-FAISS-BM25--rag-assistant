you can certainly use SPP to transfer file between your applications (assuming you are sending and receiving at both ends using your application). From the code snippet it is difficult to tell what is wrong with your program. I am guessing that you will have to close the stream as an indication to the other side that you are done with sending the data .. Note even though you write the whole file in one chunk, SPP / Bluetooth protocol layers might fragment it and the other end could receive in fragments, so you need to have some protocol to indicate transfer completion.
