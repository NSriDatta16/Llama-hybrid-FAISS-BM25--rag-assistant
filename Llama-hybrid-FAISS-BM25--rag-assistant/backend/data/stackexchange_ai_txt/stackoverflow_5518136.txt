It's probably easiest to use the scanf -family for this, but it depends a little on how your data is organized. Let's say you have three columns of numeric data, and you want to sum up the third column, you could loop over a statement like this: ( file is a FILE* , and is opened using fopen , and you loop until end of file is reached) int n; fscanf(file, "%*d,%*d,%d", &n); and sum up the n s. If you have other kinds of data in your file, you need to specify your format string accordingly. If different lines have different kinds of data, you'll probably need to search the string for separators instead and pick the third interval. That said, it's probably easier not to use C at all, e.g. perl or awk will probably do a better job, :) but I suppose that's not an option.
