The error message is giving you all the info you need. Read it. You are trying to create a variable of type BBranch , but your class BBranch is an abstract class, just like BNode , from which it is inheriting from. I smell this is a homework question, so I'll encourage you to go back to your textbook and read about abstract classes, how are they used and more importantly, what is needed to end the "abstractness" .
