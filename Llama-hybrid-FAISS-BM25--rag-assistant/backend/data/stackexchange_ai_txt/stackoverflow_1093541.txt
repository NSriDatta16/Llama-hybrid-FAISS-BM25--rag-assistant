Well, the query and table design themselves are likely not the cause. Though the query could use some help(like adding the "in list" into the join predicate as to eliminate a late-side filter, though i'd guess the optimizer returns the same plan regardless) My guess is this is a symptom of other issues, index\table fragmentation or out of date stats. Are these tables often deleted from? It might help to defrag the tables and indexes, otherwise you may be a victim of pages that are only 10% or less full, which would cause alot of disk I/O. Note: with an integer seed for a primary key, you don't often see alot of fragmentation unless you get alot of deletes & updates to rows.
