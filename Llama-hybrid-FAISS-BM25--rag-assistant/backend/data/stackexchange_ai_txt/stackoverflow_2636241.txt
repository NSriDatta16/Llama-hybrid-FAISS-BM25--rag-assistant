The standard term for this process is "character segmentation" - segmentation is the image processing term for breaking images into grouped areas for recognition. "Arabic character segmentation" throws up a lot of hits in google scholar if you want to learn more. I'd encourage you to look at Tesseract - an open source OCR implementation , especially the documents . Feature as defined in the glossary has a bit on this, but there is a ton of information here. Basically Tesseract solves the problem (from How Tesseract Works ) by looking at blobs (not letters) then combining those blobs into words. This avoids the problem you describe, while creating new problems. For arabic (as you point out) Tesseract doesn't work. I don't know much about this area but this paper seems to imply Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a useful technique. This tries to stretch the words to match them to known words, and again works in word rather than letter space.
