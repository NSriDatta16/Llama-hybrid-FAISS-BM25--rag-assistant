Specifying ASP.NET MVC attributes for auto-generated data models

I'm very new to ASP.NET MVC (as well as ASP.NET in general), and going to gain some knowledge for this technology, so I'm sorry I can ask some trivial questions. I have installed ASP.NET MVC 3 RC1 and I'm trying to do the following. Let's consider that I have a model that's completely auto-generated from a table using the "LINQ to SQL Classes" template in VS2010. The template generates 3 files (two .cs files and one .layout file respectively), and the generated partial class is expected to be used as an MVC model. Let's also consider, a single DB column, that's mapped into the model, may look like this: [global::System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute(Storage = "_Name", DbType = "VarChar(128)")] public string Name { get { return this._Name; } set { if ( (this._Name != value) ) { // ... generated stuff goes here } } } The ASP.NET MVC engine also provides a beautiful declarative way to specify some additional stuff, like RequiredAttribute , DisplayNameAttribute and other nice attributes. But since the mapped model is a purely auto-genereated model, I've realized that I should not change the model manually, and specify the fields like: [Required] [DisplayName("Project name")] [StringLength(128)] [global::System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute(Storage = "_Name", DbType = "VarChar(128)")] public string Name { ... though this approach works perfectly... until I change the model in the DBML-designer removing the ASP.NET MVC attributes automatically. So, how do I specify ASP.NET MVC attributes for the DBML models and their fields safely? Thanks in advance, and Merry Christmas. Update #1: While expecting for responses, I have found such stuff: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx - does not work for me MetadataType and client validation in ASP.NET MVC 2 - the mine seems to be a duplicate of the one http://goneale.com/2009/03/04/using-metadatatype-attribute-with-aspnet-mvc-xval-validation-framework/ - promises the most for me
