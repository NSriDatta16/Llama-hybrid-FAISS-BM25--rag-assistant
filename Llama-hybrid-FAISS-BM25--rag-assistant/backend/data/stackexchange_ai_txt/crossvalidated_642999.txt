I assume es are log odds ratios, since using raw odds ratios as input wouldn't really make sense. So the results are also given in terms of log odds ratios and differences thereof. So, based on the output, studies from group A have a log odds ratio that is on average $0.53$ points lower than the average log odds ratio of studies from the reference group (which is estimated to be $-0.44$ ). One can exponentiate this value (i.e., $\exp(-0.525) = 0.59$ ) which then gives you the ratio of the two (average) odds ratios. So the odds ratio of group B is on average $41\%$ lower (i.e., $1-0.59=0.41$ ) than the average odds ratio of the reference group.
