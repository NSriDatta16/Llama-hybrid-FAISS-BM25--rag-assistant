Best way to get client's connection speed using java

I want to know what is the best way to calculate the download speed of the clients using Java. I have searched on the internet and found that I have to download a file from the server and calculate the time before and after the download completes and to make it more specific - repeat this action for 3 times so I can have an average time. For me, the problem above doesn't work well, for localhost I got the results let's say close to reality but from server the results are a lot lower. I made a page filled with js,css(the size that I want to test), before enters calculate the startDate from the extended Action class(using struts) and on the 'onLoad()' event I made an ajax submit in which I got the endDate.StartDate-EndDate gave me the time...I forgot to mention, I set also that my jsp page isn't cached. Do you know other solutions? Thanks, Luisa
