Are average online ratings of products (say out of 5) assumed to be on a linear scale as understood by the user?

Suppose 2 washing machines A & B are rated as 3.5 and 4.0 (out of 5) respectively, vs another 2, C & D, that are rated as 4.2 and 4.7 respectively. Can I make some useful inference based on the differences among these average ratings on some portal like Amazon? In other words, can I say that B is as much "better" than A, as is D "better" that C? Or is there some psychological/statistical/marketing theory about the difference in product ratings becoming a finer indicator as the average rating comes closer to the upper limit? Assume that the number of ratings to each product is approximately equal and statistically significant (e.g. about 200 ratings for each product).
