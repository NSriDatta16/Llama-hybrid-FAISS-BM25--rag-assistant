I think the problem is that you are trying to convince your students that by taking your class, they can do data science similar to the level of modern data science, i.e., fancy stuff like image processing, face recognition. You hear this saying most of the time, "by taking this class, you will..." What you need to teach them is the love for data and the courage to look through a bunch of data, messing around with them to hopefully make some sense out of them. The moment they can do that, you can call them data scientists and you should feel proud of yourself for now having a new generation of data scientists. After that, if they are very serious about data science, they can go on taking other intense courses that deal with math, statistics, and computer science (programming experience like you said). I was in the situation similar to your students. I had no CS background but wanted to break into data science and AI by taking some online classes with fancy promises. I ended up wasting tons of money yet found myself in immense frustration (oh, I need to take this class to know this algorithm, oh they are talking about neural networks now so I have to sign up for the other class, etc.) TL;DR. Tools just account for 1% of the problem you have. With your background, you should have no problem in figuring out the above tasks in Excel in a week.
