I think the best way to think about this question is through the competitive market place. If you dump deep learning, and your competitors use it, AND it happens to work better than what you used, then you'll be beaten on the market place. I think that's what's happening, in part, today, i.e. deep learning seems to work better than anything for the whole lot of problems on market place. For instance, online language translators using deep learning are better than the purely linguistic approaches that were used before. Just a few years ago this was not the case, but advances in deep learning brought those who used to the leadership positions on the market. I keep repeating "the market" because that's what's driving the current surge in deep learning. The moment business finds something useful, that something will become wide spread. It's not that we , the committee, that decided that deep learning should be popular. It's business and competition. The second part, is that in addition to actual success of ML, there's also fear to miss the boat. A lot of businesses are paranoid that if they miss out on AI, they'll fail as businesses. This fear is being fed by all these consulting houses, Gartners etc., whispering to CEOs that they must do AI or die tomorrow. Nobody's forcing businesses to use deep learning. IT and R&D are excited with a new toy. Academia's cheering, so this party's going to last until the music stops, i.e. until deep learning stops delivering. In the meantime you can dump it and come up up with a better solution.
