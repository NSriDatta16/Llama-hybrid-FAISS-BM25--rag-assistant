You can't get an optimal formula if you haven't quantified what is better. You need to figure out how do you want to weigh consistency against average. For example one option would be to estimate the score that the player will hit a given percentage of games. This requires some kind of model of the probability distribution of the players score. For instance, if we assume that the players scores follow the normal distribution, then your given formula calculates what score the player will surpass about 70% of the time.
