Comparing average success rates of varying sample sizes

I have the following data frame: False True Total Cases Success % surgeon_id 0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.000000 2 1.0 6.0 7.0 85.714286 3 7.0 33.0 40.0 82.500000 4 10.0 39.0 49.0 79.591837 5 22.0 75.0 97.0 77.319588 6 61.0 67.0 128.0 52.343750 7 1.0 19.0 20.0 95.000000 8 23.0 53.0 76.0 69.736842 9 5.0 34.0 39.0 87.179487 10 20.0 65.0 85.0 76.470588 11 8.0 23.0 31.0 74.193548 12 7.0 24.0 31.0 77.419355 13 25.0 62.0 87.0 71.264368 16 8.0 20.0 28.0 71.428571 17 18.0 78.0 96.0 81.250000 18 13.0 63.0 76.0 82.894737 19 14.0 39.0 53.0 73.584906 20 18.0 59.0 77.0 76.623377 21 5.0 11.0 16.0 68.750000 22 0.0 1.0 1.0 100.000000 24 0.0 1.0 1.0 100.000000 25 13.0 57.0 70.0 81.428571 28 0.0 7.0 7.0 100.000000 30 52.0 49.0 101.0 48.514851 31 6.0 12.0 18.0 66.666667 32 15.0 55.0 70.0 78.571429 41 0.0 1.0 1.0 100.000000 43 2.0 6.0 8.0 75.000000 The "false" column equals the number of failed cases, while the "True" column equals the number of passing cases. I computed the "Success %" column by df[True]/(df[False]+df[True) * 100 . Is there a way to statistically compare the success rates of the surgeon ids even though each surgeon id has completed a different number of total cases? I would like to draw a conclusion that some surgeon ids have a higher success rate than others. Also, could I compare a surgeon id's success rate to the overall average success rate? I know you can use a t-test to compare means of different sample sizes, but I am not sure how to apply that method in this situation.
