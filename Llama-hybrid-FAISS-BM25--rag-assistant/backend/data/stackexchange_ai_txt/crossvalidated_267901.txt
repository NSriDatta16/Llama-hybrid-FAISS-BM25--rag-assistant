It's due to the Bonferroni correction, which controls family-wise error rates. But, like all efforts to control that error rate, the cost is reduced statistical power. Applying the correction reduces the chance of a false positive and increases the chance of getting a false negative, which is consistent with what you have observed. For interpretation, overall your data suggests that there is some statistically significant difference in number of vegans by eye color, but the pairwise comparisons of each category (using the Bonferroni correction) can't tell you which specific categories differ from each other.
