How to use the given FFT function in C?

Sorry this is the first time for me to ask question here, I've given a FFT function void fft_1d(int n, float xr[256], float xi[256], int ntype) { /* compute the FFT of a complex signal xr and xi are the real and imaginary parts respectively xr and xi contain the signal as input and the FT as output n is the number of points, it should be a power of 2 ntype is set to 1 for forward transform and -1 for inverse transform */ And I have been told to extend this function to do the 2D (DFT) of the given image. My problem is: I can get every itensity value of the given image but how can I deal with the complex components (real part /imaginary part) of the fft_1d? In other words, what should I put in the parameters float xr[256] and float xi[256] in order to do the 2D (DFT) of the image? Thanks for your attention!
