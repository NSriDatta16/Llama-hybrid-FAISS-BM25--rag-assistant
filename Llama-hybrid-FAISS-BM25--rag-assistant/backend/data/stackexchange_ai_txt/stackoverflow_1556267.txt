pureMVC: unique mediator for each tab in an interface

I am building a tabbed interface for switching between various similar layers. Each layer will have a number of graphs. By dragging with the mouse the graphs can be rearranged or even moved between layers. My question is, is it best practice to register a unique mediator for each layer that keeps track of the layers content / organization, or should i keep track of it all with one central mediator. some considerations: the layer contents and organization will be saved(in a db) so that it can be restored when a user comes back to the app. the layers themselves are functionally identical. the user can add and remove layers at will. thanks!
