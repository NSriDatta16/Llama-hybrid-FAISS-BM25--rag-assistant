Should I use regex or machine learning?

I am thinking of two use cases: You submit a resume in PDF format to a web site and it extracts your contact information, job titles, etc. You receive an email from a friend that says, "let's have lunch next Tuesday" and your email program detects it and asks if you want to save a new calendar entry for "lunch on Tuesday". I can see how this can be done with both ML and with (very sophisticated) regex. What approaches are typically used for these scenarios? I'm assuming that the same approach can be applied to both of the scenarios above?
