Other than bmp's (if you see someone using them over the wire, prepare your shotgun), images are mostly already compressed, including jpeg's, png's and gif's. I use this in my static subdomains, compiled from some online resources (which can be found easily Googling): # Insert filter SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # *.cache.js and *.cache.css files are only checked after 6 month (e.g. jQuery.1.4.2.cache.js) FileETag None ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault "access plus 6 month" #AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/css text/javascript # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Don't compress images #SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary The only special thing I've added is that I cache *.cache.js and *.cache.css files for 6 months, since they rarely change. E.g. jqueryui.cache.css
