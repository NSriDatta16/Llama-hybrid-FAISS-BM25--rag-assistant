If you have access to the application bundles (in other words, you own the applications so the iTunes bundles are in ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications), you can unzip these .ipa bundles and take a look at their Info.plist files. You should look to see if there are any URL schemes defined by looking for any values in an array at ["CFBundleURLTypes"]["CFBundleURLSchemes"]. You can take a gander at http://iosdevelopertips.com/cocoa/launching-your-own-application-via-a-custom-url-scheme.html for a more in-depth explanation. Even if you determine that the applications are built to handle special URL schemes on the devices, you likely won't be able to determine what you would actually need to provide in a URL to get the applications to do anything useful. In other words, even if you knew that the TomTom app handled URL requests of the type "tomtom://", you wouldn't know what to do with that. It could expect all kinds of different information in an arbitrary arrangement in the URL. Barring access to the application bundles, I suppose you could attempt to contact TomTom or Navigon directly. You'd likely need to contact them anyway to determine how exactly to use any URL handlers that you discover from digging though the IPA bundles.
