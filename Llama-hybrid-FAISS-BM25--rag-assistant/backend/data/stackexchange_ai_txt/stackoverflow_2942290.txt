How to emulate a real http request via cfhttp?

I need to emulate a real http request via cfhttp. I was getting rss feed with ColdFusion, but tonight they started to block my request and send an index page in response instead of rss fead. I added useragent for cfhttp, but it doesn't help. Opera, Firefox and Chrome open feed correctly from the same computer.
