Data modelling is the correct term for this. There are logical data models which represent the entities of the problem domain in abstract terms and physical data models which are optimised for implementing using one particular DBMS, taking account of its strengths and quirks. ERDs are used to document both. Modelling software, such as Erwin, can generate the table definition code from the ER diagram. The science behind modelling is normalisation. This is a set of techniques for organising attributes (columns) into entities (tables) according to the dependencies between attributes. There are many text books and blogs covering this. The craft of data modelling lies in defining what are the "things" that are included - the ontology. What level of abstraction is appropriate? Do we separate apples from oranges, consider them both to be fruit, or produce, or simply product. The answer will vary depending on the problem being solved. This skill is acquired as domain expertise. There will always be trade-offs in whatever approach is taken. A search for "industry data models" will return offerings from many well-known providers. A data model encodes the business rules of the domain it covers. Do these pre-packaged models are, at best, a starting point as they do not reflect the specific custom requirements of any particular implementation. If you have a specific question, concrete question Database Administrators would be a good place to ask.
