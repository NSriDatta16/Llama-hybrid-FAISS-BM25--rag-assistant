Best way to randomly select rows *per* column in SQL Server

A search of SO yields many results describing how to select random rows of data from a database table. My requirement is a bit different, though, in that I'd like to select individual columns from across random rows in the most efficient/random/interesting way possible. To better illustrate: I have a large Customers table, and from that I'd like to generate a bunch of fictitious demo Customer records that aren't real people. I'm thinking of just querying randomly from the Customers table, and then randomly pairing FirstNames with LastNames, Address, City, State, etc. So if this is my real Customer data (simplified): FirstName LastName State ========================== Sally Simpson SD Will Warren WI Mike Malone MN Kelly Kline KS Then I'd generate several records that look like this: FirstName LastName State ========================== Sally Warren MN Kelly Malone SD Etc. My initial approach works, but it lacks the elegance that I'm hoping the final answer will provide. (I'm particularly unhappy with the repetitiveness of the subqueries, and the fact that this solution requires a known/fixed number of fields and therefore isn't reusable.) SELECT FirstName = (SELECT TOP 1 FirstName FROM Customer ORDER BY newid()), LastName= (SELECT TOP 1 LastNameFROM Customer ORDER BY newid()), State = (SELECT TOP 1 State FROM Customer ORDER BY newid()) Thanks!
