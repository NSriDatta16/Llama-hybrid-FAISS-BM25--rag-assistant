How to include the effect of the spatial autocorrelation in random forest algorithm?

I have spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in my observations and I want to use two species distribution models Random forests and logistic regression, I’m planning to include the SAC as an autocovariate « autocov» estimated through the auto-logistic regression (Augustin et al 1996). Now how to include the SAC in the random forests? Can I reuse the same variable « autocov », estimated in the auto-logistic model, as a new covariate in RF?
