Strategies for Honeycomb & backward compatibility

So we've seen the preview sdk and the neat new stuff like ActionBar and Fragments. Making a lot of method calls will be unavoidable to make use of these, so what strategies are there for maintaining 1 version of the app, which will let me use all the snazzy new stuff but also work on devices running 2.3 or below? My app targets 1.5 - 2.3 at the moment.
