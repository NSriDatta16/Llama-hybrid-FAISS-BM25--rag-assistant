strange bug in jQueryUI draggable

i've found a bug in jQueryUI draggable.... check it out on their demo page here if you drag the object down far enough so that the page scrolls downwards, the draggable object loses it's position relative to the cursor. any ideas what's causing the bug, and how to remedy it? thanks :)
