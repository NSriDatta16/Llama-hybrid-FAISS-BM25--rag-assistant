You might also consider the R language, which is cross-platform, open source, and highly capable in a wide variety of dimensions: incredibly varied and complete statistical analysis, plotting capabilities and support for MySQL (and other) database interfaces. You can submit SQL commands to your backend database and manipulate (including date arithmetic), analyze and plot/chart your data in R. Highly recommended. R is an interpreted language, and thus easy to experiment with. I know it also has integration available with Python and I believe Ruby as well. Another reason that you might find this intriguing is that R is very capable in a vector/matrix sense, akin to Matlab / Octave. Pay special attention to the "data frame" related features of R, as you can retrieve tabular query data as an R data frame, and do calculations on all or specific elements of the frame very easily (for example, calculating means/averages over ranges of dates, etc. http://www.r-project.org/ Take a look at this if you're interested: cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf Cheers, Leo
