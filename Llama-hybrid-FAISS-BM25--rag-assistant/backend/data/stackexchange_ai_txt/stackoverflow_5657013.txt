you'll need to load that array into your $_SESSOIN['cart_contents'] which may have been done. secondly, your inner foreach is acting on the values of that array which are not arrays. I'm fairly certain that the inner foreach is causing your woes. Also, your Array may just be for illustrating what's in $_SESSION['cart_contents'], but adding quotation marks instead of square brackets around the keys will make it more uniform and easier to read. Update: after seeing the reformatted code, thanks @AgentConundrum, now I can more clearly see the issue. Try adding an if(is_array($valuez)) around your inner foreach.
