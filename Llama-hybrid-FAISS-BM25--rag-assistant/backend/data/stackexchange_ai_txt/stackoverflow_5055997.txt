Gather the count of a specific object from NSMutableArray

Hey guys & girls, Im wondering how I can find the object count of a specific type of object in an array. For example, i have 6 'clouds' in NSMutableArray at random locations, I also have 4 'dragons' in this NSMutableArray. How can i gather the integer 6? I was thinking something along the lines of: int z = [[SomeClass *clouds in _somearray] count]; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thnx, Oliver.
