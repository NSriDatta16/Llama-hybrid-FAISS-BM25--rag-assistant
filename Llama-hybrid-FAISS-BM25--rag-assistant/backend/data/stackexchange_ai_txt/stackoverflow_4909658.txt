magento modern - display of attributes in TAB

If you go here: http://pro-tools-training.com/new-magento/index.php/video-1/youtube.html and click " BUZZ/INFO " tab, you see the following text: BUZZ Why does the attribute name appear and why does it bump my text to the center???? How to fix?? I just want to show whatever I place in the attribute text box, not the name and not center justified.
