Implementing a slide effect for a UIView

All, I'm trying desperately to write a method that will animate adding a subview in a kind of "slide up" effect, where the view slides onto the screen from a particular point. I can get a UIImageView to work, but I'm having a heck of a time applying it to a UIPickerView. What happens is, the UIPickerView only moves and animates for about 1/4 of it's height. The UIImageView truly starts w/ a height of 0 and slides up onto the screen. Here is my code so far: + (void) slideupView:(UIView*) view duration:(CGFloat) duration completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished)) completion { CGRect endBounds = view.bounds; CGRect startBounds = endBounds; startBounds.size.height = 0; view.bounds = startBounds; view.contentMode = UIViewContentModeTop; view.clipsToBounds = YES; view.layer.anchorPoint = CGPointMake(0.5, 1.0); CGPoint pos = view.layer.position; pos.y += (endBounds.size.height / 2); view.layer.position = pos; [UIView animateWithDuration:duration delay:0.0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction animations:^{ view.bounds = endBounds; } completion:completion]; } From the things I've read, it sounds like the encouraged approach is to use the bounds rectangle instead of the frame since the frame approach won't work if you've modified the transform. I've ALSO read that one can't change the height of a UIPickerView, so I'm wondering if that's the reason for this problem. Admittedly, I haven't tried it on any other UIView subclass. Any thoughts? Is there a better approach? I just want to animate a view onto the screen, similar to presenting a modal view controller's view, except that I don't want it to cover the entire screen. I just want a slide up effect, like when the keyboard appears on the screen. Thanks! Justin
