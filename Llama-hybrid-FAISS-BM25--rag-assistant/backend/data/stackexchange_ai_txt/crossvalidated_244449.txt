How to combine various discrete probabilities?

See following link for a live example of sentiment analysis http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html If I have a document having following three sentences This movie doesn't care about cleverness, wit or any other kind of intelligent humor. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. There are slow and repetitive parts, but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting. * After analysis I get the result as shown below for each sentence, which shows the probability of that sentence being Very Negative, Negative , Neutral, Positive, Very Positive. [0.0906, 0.8188, 0.0708, 0.0161, 0.0038] For example: text: Sentence 1 scoreDistr: [0.0906, 0.8188, 0.0708, 0.0161, 0.0038] text: Sentence 2 scoreDistr: [0.025, 0.0337, 0.038, 0.0271, 0.8762] text: Sentence 3 scoreDistr: [0.2019, 0.6905, 0.084, 0.0129, 0.0106] How can I combine these three sentence probability and come up with a score which can be applied at the document level ? So basically how can I combine these probability to know the overall sentiment of three sentences together whether the overall document is Very Negative, Negative, Neutral , Positive or Very Positive. scoreDistr: [0.0906, 0.8188, 0.0708, 0.0161, 0.0038] scoreDistr: [0.025, 0.0337, 0.038, 0.0271, 0.8762] scoreDistr: [0.2019, 0.6905, 0.084, 0.0129, 0.0106]
