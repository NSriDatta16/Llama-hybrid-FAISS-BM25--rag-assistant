Mmm. The question is wrong. I mean on an in-use volume that the entries left-over in the MFT, from files which once existed but now are gone, those entries are cleaned up. It sounds a lot like you're asking for a program that will zero-out parts of the MFT that don't currently represent actual files. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that no company is going to touch that one even with a stick. NTFS is poorly documented at best NTFS is a moving target, and the MFT is one of those "hands off" areas that are subject to change without notice Overwriting presumably unused areas of this block offers zero benefit to the average user Zeroing out the "free" space means zapping every bit that you don't think microsoft is using for anything important, a tenuous prospect at best. A mistake in this operation (which is surprisingly likely) means losing files at best, losing the whole filesystem at worst In other words, the project would be expensive and time consuming to build, would be riddled with uncertainty about its safety, and would not offer enough (any?) benefit to customer to convince them to use it. I can't imagine such a thing exists, nor do I expect that it ever will.
