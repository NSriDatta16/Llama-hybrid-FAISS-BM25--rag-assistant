Checking my understanding of Bayes factor hypothesis testing

I am new to Bayesian statistics. I am trying to understand my course notes on this topic. Here are the notes: I will try to explain what these notes are saying and hopefully someone can correct my misunderstandings. The opening two lines are relatively straightforward, because in Bayesian statistics we conceive of $\theta$ as a random variable, and we select whichever hypothesis has the higher probability, conditional on the data we've observed. Regarding the Bayes factors, the Bayes factor against $H_0$ is $$B = \frac{\frac{P(\theta \in \Theta_1 | y)}{P(\theta \in \Theta_0 | y)}}{\frac{P(\theta \in \Theta_1)}{P(\theta \in \Theta_0)}}.$$ (I found the $B_{10(y)}$ notation very confusing.) We choose $H_1$ if $B > 1$ , or $\log_{10} B > 0$ . Intuitively we are looking for the alternative hypothesis to gain on the null hypothesis when we update for the observed data. Regarding the table of values given, I think I am supposed to reject $H_0$ for all these values. I found the table confusing because I guess my reflexes are more frequentist so when I read "evidence against $H_0$ is poor " I imagine something like a $p$ -value of $0.09$ , which is supposed to imply a level of evidence against $H_0$ that is non-zero but still too weak to reject $H_0$ . However with this Bayes factor method, we more readily reject $H_0$ because we just require $H_1$ to be "better" (according to the definition of $B$ ) than $H_0$ . Am I making sense? I appreciate any help.
