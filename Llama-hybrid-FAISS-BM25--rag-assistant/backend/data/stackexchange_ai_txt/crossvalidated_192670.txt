neural networks - Inputting a time series to a classification NN

I have a simple ANN that does the job of classification between two labels-: Sick Healthy What I want to do is that input patient data ie. heart rate(ECG), EEG, etc which will be in the form of a time series. How is that done in a neural network ? Is the time series unrolled into a input vector if so do each neuron handles one sample of that time series ? Basically how is the input transformation done ? To better understand this take the example of the traditional IRIS classification example. Lets say that instead of inputting petal length or sepal length you would input 4 time series in place of them and get a classification class as output. Note I am not trying to do time series forecasting.
