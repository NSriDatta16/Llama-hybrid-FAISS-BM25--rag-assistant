Convert a double to a String in Java and vice versa without losing accuracy

A String representation of a double is written to and read from a file by a C# application. The C# application converts the double to a string using the following fragment: value.ToString("R", NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo); The C# application converts the string to a double using the following fragment double num = double.Parse(s, NumberStyles.Float, (IFormatProvider) NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo); If that same file were to be written to and read from by a Java application, how would you go about converting the types without losing data?
