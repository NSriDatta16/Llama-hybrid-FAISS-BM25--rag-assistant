Put a logging into a separate project is perfectly fine.However it really depends on the scope of your project.I normally setup my project like this YourProject.Web(web project) YourProject.Core(all the business logic) YourProject.Web.Tests(Watin tests) YourProject.Web.Core.UnitTests(Unit tests) YourProject.Web.Core.IntegrationTests(Integration tests) I suggest you to download some open source Project from asp.net to see how the project have been organized.
