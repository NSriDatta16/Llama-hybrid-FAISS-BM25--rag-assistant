Merging two variables to create frequency table

I have another newbie question; lets say I have a set of numbers graph_val and I need to create a frequency table of them against this scale 1 2 3 4 5 9 "Very Poor" "Poor" "Average" "Good" "Very Good" "Don't Know" Essentially what I want to know is how do I get a table into this format: "Very Poor" "Poor" "Average" "Good" "Very Good" "Don't Know" 2 1 1 1 0 1 or at the very least: 1 2 3 4 5 9 2 1 1 1 0 1 And I can add the labels in later using names.arg with barplot 2. I've been on this for most of the day, after this its clear sailing for the rest of my automation job. I thought I was on the right track with tabulate but couldn't quite get there.
