There is several ways: 1) Always generate a random filename, for every attachment ( Negative here is that you will use "more" storage space 2) Generate a hash like SH-256 of the content of the file, and give it a name after this ( Negative here is hashing can take a while, depending on file size) Depending on what your doing, i would off course save the original filename somewhere so it can be found based on the filename in the email. Perhaps also if you choose the hashing method, you should store what emails that file is attached to.
