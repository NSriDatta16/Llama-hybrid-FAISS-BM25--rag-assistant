Few main variables in the best model still show multicollineairty. Should I remove them despite their importance?

I have a binary logistic regression with 5 IVs and all of their 2-way interactions. I have reduced/removed multicollinearity between main variables and their interactions by centering the main variables. I have found one of the best models according to LRT. The model also accords reasonably with theory. Everything is fine. However, one of the odds ratios is very large and its 95% CI is strangely super-broad. I think this is caused by a new case of multicollinearity. This OR is for a main variable which is highly correlated (> 0.8) with a couple of other main variables, according to the correlation matrix. What do you suggest me to do with this new source of multicollinearity which happens to be one of the main variables in this research? Should I remove it from the model and analyze it in isolation? Should I report it as is, but discuss that the very large OR is a case of multicollinearity? Should I report it as is, but add its isolated analysis as well? Do you have any other suggestions that is routinely done in the case of a resisting multicollinearity? Many thanks in advance.
