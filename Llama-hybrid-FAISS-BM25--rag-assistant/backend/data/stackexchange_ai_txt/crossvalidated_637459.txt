Consider the mapping from the variable $Y_n$ to the estimates $\hat{X}_n = f(Y_n)$ . The probability to estimate correctly will depend on the true value of $X_n$ $$P(\hat{X}_n = X_n | X_n) = P(f(Y_n+X_n) = X_n)$$ For some values $X_n$ these probabilities can have a lower bound above zero. For example, if we have consider a set of equidistant values $x = \lbrace -1, -1+d, -1+2d, \dots, 1 \rbrace$ , then if the true value is $X_n = -1$ or $X_n = 1$ , then the probability of estimating correct will be approaching 0.5 (namely if $Z_n for $X_n = -1$ and $Z_n > 0$ for $X_n = 1$ , which happens with 0.5 probability, then the estimate will be correct). However, despite that we have these lower bound with some values of $X_n$ , if we consider an average of guessing correct, then we need to use $$P(\hat{X}_n = X_n) = \sum_{\forall x} P(\hat{X}_n = X_n | X_n = x) P(\hat{X}_n = x)$$ This average should approach zero when we keep adding numbers. At least for the example with the distribution being an equidistant set of equally probable values, case we can show this. For the values on the edges, the probability $P(\hat{X}_n = X_n | X_n = x)$ approaches 0.5, but for the other values it approaches zero. Below we show an image related to the example above. The points in the image are thousand points sampled as $$\begin{array}{} X_n &\sim& \text{discrete uniform from -1 to 1} \\ Z_n &\sim& N(0,1) \\ Y_n &:=& X_n+Z_n\end{array}$$ in the background of the scatterplot we show a blue region where the estimates are correct. For the example this is a simple region, for other discrete variables this might be more complex (especially when certain values can occur more likely than other values, such that the priors for vakues are unequal) What we see when we increase $n$ is that this region becomes more thin and covers a smaller part of the domain. For the example case you can compute exactly the probability of the event $\hat{X}_n = X$ and show that it decreases to zero. More generally, we can see intuitively that the image of $f(Y_n)$ get's crowded with more numbers and the area that maps to the correct number becomes smaller. The blue region is like a small strip that runs from $Y_n = -\infty$ to $Y_n = \infty$ , is cut into pieces, and placed onto the area. The pieces of the strip get more thin when $n$ increases.
