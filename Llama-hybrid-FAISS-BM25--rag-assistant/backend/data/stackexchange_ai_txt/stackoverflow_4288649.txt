Google storage (curl + PHP + create a dummy _$folder$)

Can anyone enlighten me how to create a _$folder$ using Google storage API? Here is the class that I have so far (I managed to list/filter files), but no success with creating a 'directory'. http://guy.codepad.org/lEO4J6hL When I try to create a test_$folder$, this is what I send to the server: PUT /test_$folder$ HTTP/1.1 Host: static.hotelpublisher.com.commondatastorage.googleapis.com Date: Mon, 29 Nov 2010 19:45:49 GMT Content-Length: 0 Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-MD5: 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg== Authorization: GOOG1 GOOGRVMFQJPKHRXAU3F6:gtzlxexMjBOafn5tOZKF7UZGv1I= x-goog-acl: public-read This is what I get in return: MalformedHeaderValue An HTTP header value was malformed. mon, 29 nov 2010 19:34:23 This is done following the Google provided documentation, thus I don't see why this does not work.
