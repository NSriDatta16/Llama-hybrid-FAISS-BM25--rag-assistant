SQL Agent Command Line Not Saved

I have a SSIS package I am trying to schedule. I create a new job under SQL Server Agent. On the Command line tab of the jobstep, I choose "Edit the command-line manually". The changes are retained as I switch from tab to tab within the job step but whenever I exit and save the job, the changes are lost. Any ideas what's going on? I'm on SQL Server 2008.
