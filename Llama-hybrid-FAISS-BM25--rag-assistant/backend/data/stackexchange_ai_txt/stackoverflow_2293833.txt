While MFC and lots of software written for Windows used the "C" convention for classes, you generally don't find the latter in software written for UNIX platforms. I think it was a habit very strongly encouraged by Visual C++. I remember that Visual C++ 6.0 would prefix a "C" to any classes that one created with the class wizard.
