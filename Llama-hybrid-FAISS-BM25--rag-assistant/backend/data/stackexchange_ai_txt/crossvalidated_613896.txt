Cointegration $p$-value and VECM loading forces show low correlation

After having read about VEC model (VECM), I thought that cointegration and VECM loading forces were strongly, not to say numerically correlated. I thought that the more we have cointegration, the less is the coint. $p$ -value, the higher are the loading forces $\alpha_i$ . To confirm that, I plotted a point cloud of 100 pairs of stocks showing one of their 2 cointegration $p$ -values (x_axis=avg(coint p-value), y_axis=average(abs(vecm_forces)) We see a little bit of a relationship: the higher the $p$ -value, the less is likely the pair is to be cointegrated, the smaller are the $\alpha_i$ s. However, I find the correlation very low compared to what I expected. Especially, those 2 things mean basically the same thing, right? Whether or not the pairs are returning fast to the equilibrum. With this said, how to interpret a pair that has a low coint $p$ -value but a low force? Do I do well when I average the 2 loading forces and the 2 coint $p$ -values? Maybe I should take respectively max and the min of them? Should I compare the loading forces themselves, or would their $t$ -values be more easy to interpret ( $t$ -value of the loading force shows a stronger correlation with coint. $p$ -value)? I want basically to find a strong correlation between both things so that the second dimension disappear, because they mean the same thing (unless I'm wrong and I'm missing some interpretation?). The goal is in the end to sort the pairs with a certain homogenous unity that represent the "speed" at which they go back to their equilibrium in a context of pair trading strategy.
