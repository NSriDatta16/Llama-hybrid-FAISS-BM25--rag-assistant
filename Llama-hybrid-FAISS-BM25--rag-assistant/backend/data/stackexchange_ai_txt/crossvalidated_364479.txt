Some basic concepts are valid through years :) and are used in many solutions and naturally contributing to naming of these solutions... N-gram is a basic concept of a (sub)sequnece of consecutive words taken out of a given sequence (e.g. sentence). k-skip-n-gram is a generalization where 'consecutive' is dropped. It is 'just' subsequence of the original sequence, e.g. every other word of the sentence is 2-skip-n-gram. word2vec is more complicated beast, the buzzword :) here is 'embeddings', here is the original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf . It uses the concept of consequtive words and 'skip' and 'gram' made its way to the name of the algorithm. BTW there are two alternative ones used by word2vec solution: skip-gram and CBOW.
