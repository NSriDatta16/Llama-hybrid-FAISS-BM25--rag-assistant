javascript long list of parameter; looking for alternative

I'm writing a javascript function that has a pretty long list of parameters: FormatGrid(ID, BackColor, SideColor, HiddenColor, SmallTextClass....) It works well but it's getting somewhat painful when calling this function to remember each parameter and the order they go in because the function takes a total of 9 parameters (and I might add 2 more). I'm wondering if there's an elegant solution to this. Thanks for your suggestions.
