File upload and storage handling in a web application

I am currently using php and ajax file upload to develop a web application. in a web application involves getting the files uploaded from user, e.g email client, photo gallery. This is the scenario that i got stuck. When user uploads some files but close the browser without submit, i want to delete those files and only move the relevant files. I have tried leave the stuff in tmp/ folder and been given a temp name by apache but when i do the upload i have to move the file immediately otherwise the file cannot be found in the later stage by referencing to the temp filename. The reason that i leave it in a /tmp/ is that i will want to setup a cron job and delete files in those folder to free up server space. Am i doing the right thing? or is there a standard industry approach used by hotmail, google etc?
