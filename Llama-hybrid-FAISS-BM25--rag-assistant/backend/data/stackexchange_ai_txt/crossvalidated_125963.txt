It is possible to disregard variables with some missing data from the analysis if you find substitutes for them. For example, if variable $X$ has some missing observations, but its non missing observations pairwise correlates with variable $Y$, then $X$ could be replaced by $Y$. It is also important to have a theoretical justification to carry on such replacement, in order to avoid spurious correlation. There are many techniques to find correlated variables such as pairwise correlation (Pearson, Spearman), variance inflation factor (VIF), principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, etc. If variable $Z$ has 95% of missing data, then there is not enough information even for an exploratory analysis. Better disregard it right away.
