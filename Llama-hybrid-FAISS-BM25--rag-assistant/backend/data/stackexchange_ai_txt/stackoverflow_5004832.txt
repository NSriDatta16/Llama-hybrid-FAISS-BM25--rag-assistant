Visual Studio 2010 Pro - SuppressMessage

Is the option to SupressMessage not available in VS 2010 Pro? When I right click on the warning in the warning list there is no option to suppress. I also tried it with errors and there was no option. I then tried to create my own GlobalSuppression.cs file but have no idea what category the warning should be classified under. Right now I'm doing this, which works, but I would prefer to use a GlobalSuppression file #pragma warning disable 0649,0169 [Import(AllowRecomposition = false)] private IModuleManager _moduleManager; [Import(AllowRecomposition = false)] private IRegionManager _regionManager; [Import(AllowRecomposition = false)] private IRibbonService _menuService; #pragma warning restore 0649,0169 These are the warnings from the output window that I want to suppress: warning CS0649: Field 'Shell._moduleManager' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null warning CS0169: The field 'Shell._regionManager' is never used warning CS0649: Field 'Shell._menuService' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null The reason why I want to suppress is that my solution uses Prism / MEF so those variables are assigned at runtime.
