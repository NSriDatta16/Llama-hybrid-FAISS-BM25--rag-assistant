How to have a user-movable MKPlacemark?

I would like to emulate the 'Drop Pin' feature in the Maps application. I have a mapview in my controller that I am able to add a MKPlacemark to. It doesn't respond to user action though. Can I emulate the dropped pin with stock classes or do I need to subclass an MKAnnotation View? EDIT2: Here's the code I'm trying, which I think should work. It drops the pin, and I can change the color but it can't be moved. - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id )annotation { MKPinAnnotationView *pinView = [[MKPinAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:nil]; [pinView setDraggable:YES]; [pinView setAnimatesDrop:YES]; [pinView setPinColor:MKPinAnnotationColorGreen]; return pinView; }
