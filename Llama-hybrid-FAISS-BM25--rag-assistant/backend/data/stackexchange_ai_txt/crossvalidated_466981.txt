Phillips-Perron test: if $H_0$ has been rejected then one cannot assume that the time series has a unit-root (then it is stationary); This is not entirely correct. Lack of a unit root does not imply stationarity. It only implies lack of a very special kind of nonstationarity, namely, the unit-root kind. Other kinds of nonstationarity are, for example, level shifts, shifts of variance, and other. The PP test might not be sensitive to them. How should I consider or interpret such result? On the face value, and provided the test results are correct, you have a time series that does not have a unit root but is not stationary either. Perhaps it can be characterized by one of the kinds of nonstationarity mentioned above, or yet another kind. I wonder if one can evaluate the importance and the strength of such unit-root; for instance, in the question the user @ferdi deals with the variance ratio test to argue the framework to evaluate the importance of a unit root in a time series. The answer by Ferdi you quote seems to use some nonstandard/nonstatistical terminology, or at least one that is not widespread. I am not exactly sure what is meant there, but it reminds me of something related I heard in a lecture by prof. Ruey S. Tsay. He noted that a time series $x_t$ could be a sum of a stationary process $y_t$ and a unit-root process $z_t$ : $$ x_t:=y_t+z_t. $$ If the variance of the stationary process $y_t$ is large (say, $100$ ), while the variance of the error term in the unit-root process $z_t$ is small (say, $0.01$ ), then $x_t$ might behave essentially as a stationary process in a finite sample. It would be very hard to detect the presence of a unit root unless the sample size is very large. Surely, asymptotically $y_t$ would dominate $z_t$ , and $x_t$ would show its unit root. But for a fixed period of time that we care about, $y_t$ dominates. Hence, in practice we might treat $x_t$ as stationary. (And in the long run we are all dead.) Perhaps this is similar to what Ferdi meant in his answer.
