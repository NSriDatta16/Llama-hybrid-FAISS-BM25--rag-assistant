If you have a Poisson process, then each $X_i$ has an exponential distribution (and their sum a Gamma distribution). You can then use Bayesian methods to look at possible values of $\theta$. For example, the conjugate prior for an exponential distribution is also a Gamma distribution, which you may find helpful incorporating your prior information and observed data to get a credible interval for $\theta$.
