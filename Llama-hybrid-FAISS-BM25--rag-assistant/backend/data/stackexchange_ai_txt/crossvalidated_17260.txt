You definitely have to associate a numerical value to the class "visited five and more times a month". By the way, I would calculate the mean and the standard deviation in the usual way. In fact, $x_i$ are your values and $p_i$ are their empirical frequency estimated on the sample. In your case $$x_0=0 \ x_1=1 \ x_2=2 \ x_3=3 \ x_4=4 \ x_5=6$$ (you should decide $x_5$) $$p_0=0.05 \ p_1=0.07 \ p_2=0.33 \ p_3=0.22 \ p_4=0.15 \ p_5=0.18 $$ Thus $$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=0}^{5}x_i p_i$$ and $$\sigma=\sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{5}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 p_i}$$ It could be interesting to delete $x_0$ and $p_0$ and rescale all $p_i$ in order their sum is 1. So you can calculate the average number of visits to the supermarket for a person that visits the supermarket.
