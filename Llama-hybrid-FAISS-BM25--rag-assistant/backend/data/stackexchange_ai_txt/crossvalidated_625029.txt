Order of independent and dependent variable in Breusch-Pagan test

I've been working on my master thesis, and I've been using R to test heteroskedasticity with Breusch-Pagan test. The code is rather simple: model_1 And the results are, respectively: model_1: BP = 0.52928, df = 1, p-value = 0.4669 model_2: BP = 4.6722, df = 1, p-value = 0.03065 And this really surprised me, because I thought that for a Pearson correlation with one dependent variable and one independent variable, the order in which one defines the variables should not affect the results of the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity. Could somebody please explain why those results differ? I don't know which value to report. If there is heteroscedasticity when I calculate a Pearson correlation, I would use a wild bootstrap method. Thank you! Edit: Added residuals plot
