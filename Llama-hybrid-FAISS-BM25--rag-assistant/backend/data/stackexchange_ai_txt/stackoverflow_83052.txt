You cannot handle just feature creep - you need to organise your whole development process in an proper way. However from your description it seems that you just code what other people ask for and could not re-organise the process. In this scenario your best way to manage the requests effectively by havign a tracking/ticketing system which would allow you to receive requests from other people, prioritise them, estimate them, agree the implementation schedule and track the time you actually spend working on them. When you will be able to prove with the real-world figures that 'this small button' would take 2-3 days instead of 5 seconds the customer probably believe it should be you will be in much better position to negotiate. If you will be able to clearly show that the project go-live date will be delayed by two weeks because of the new features you might see those requests simply vanishing. You have to remember however that 'feature creep' is not always a negative thing. As application matures and grows your customers priorities are changing as well. Failing to acknowledge that could mean that your finished product will not be what they want. Try checking if they would accept trading a new feature for an old one from original specification which is not yet implemeted.
