2000 users isn't too bad but with 10 mil related items you really should consider putting this into a database. DBs do all the storage, persistence, indexing, caching etc. that you need and they perform very well. They also allow for better scalability into the future. If you suddenly need to deal with two million users and billions of settings having a good db in place will make scaling a non-issue.
