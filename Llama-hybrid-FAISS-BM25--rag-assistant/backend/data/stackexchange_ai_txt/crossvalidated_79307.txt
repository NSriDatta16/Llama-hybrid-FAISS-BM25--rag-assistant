All three series look stationary; the second & third look over-differenced (the strong negative auto-correlation at the first lag is a tell-tale sign). Recall that the sign of a non-stationary series is strong auto-correlations that take a long time to die out with increasing lag. Plotting residuals is also a good idea—say a quantile–quantile plot & a time series plot of standardized residuals—to check their distribution & spot outliers. There are no clear signs of auto-correlation in your original time series, suggesting you needn't fit an ARMA model unless you have good reason to. That's not to say there is no auto-correlation, just that if there is it's weak to moderate & its nature can't be determined from such a short series (36 observations?). A white noise model about the mean might be appropriate, perhaps a Gaussian or perhaps a t-distribution with 5–10 degrees of freedom.
