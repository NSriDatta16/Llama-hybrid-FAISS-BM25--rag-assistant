As @ChristianHenning has pointed out in the comments, the mixing of components makes likelihood analytically intractable. On the other hand, Bayesian methods are not applicable due to the combinatorial explosion of the terms in the expanded likelihood. See, e.g., the discussion and references in these notes . Furthermore, the multimodal nature of the likelihood makes it difficult to use direct numerical maximization or some simpler Monte Carlo algorithms, such as Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings.
