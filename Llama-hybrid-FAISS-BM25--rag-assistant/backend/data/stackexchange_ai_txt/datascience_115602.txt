Regression Algorithm while passing in future values?

Very similar to this question here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/406416/including-future-values-in-a-regression Is it possible to pass future (expected) values into a regression algorithm in order to tune the results. For example, training & predicting stock market prices but with 3 predictions, 1 if macroeconomic factor increases by x% (such as inflation or interest rates), 1 if it decreases by x% and 1 if it stays the same? What regressions machine learning algorithms allow us to pass in the future expected values to see multiple "what-if" predictions? EDIT: To explain a bit further. I would like to predict Time-Series based data while passing in an additional independent variables (other than time). Is this possible & if so, which algorithms allow it?
