At this point Slickspeed is becoming totally unimportant, selectors are too fast anyway. Also just so you know, Sly by Herald Kirschner, a member of the Mootools dev team just released Sly, a selector engine that beats Sizzle. The stuff about animations being the defining factor for NOT choosing mootools that was left by one of the posters was basically ass backwards, Mootools has been the king of animations for years now. Whatever you pick it will all work. Mootools has a more classical feel that I think keeps me organized, jQuery is more function based and does not venture into classes that much. An one augments native types and the other doesn't, a different strategy but that is it. Daniel
