Correlation between linear regression coefficients

Can we get correlation between linear regression coefficients? I have real data (time series) with different realizations representing the same phenomenon: $\{x_j(t)\} = x_1(t), \dots, x_N(t)$. I model each one with a linear regression model: $f_j(t)=\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^dc_{ij}\phi_i(t)$, $(j = 1, \dots, N$). $\phi_i(t)$ are Legendre polynomials and are orthogonal. After estimating the $c_{ij}$ I found correlations between these coefficients wrt $j$, i.e. if I plot (see fig. below) the different $c_{ij}$ function of $j$ I find that $c_{mj}$ and $c_{lj}$, for example, are linear combinations of each other. This happens for all coefficients. Is this normal? What does it mean?
