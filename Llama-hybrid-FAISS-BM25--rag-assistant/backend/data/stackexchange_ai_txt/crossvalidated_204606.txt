One particular equation of a VAR model targets the conditional mean (and the conditional distribution, if you are taking on distributional assumptions on model errors) of a univariate time series $X_{i,t}$ for $i \in 1,\dotsc,k$ and the conditioning is on past values of all the $k$ time series. In the context of the $k$-variate random process, this is also a marginal model because it targets only one time series out of $k$. So it is both a conditional and a marginal model - from certain perspectives. (You could always pick some other variable or a different lag that is not in the model, then with respect to that particular variable/lag the model would not be conditional.)
