You've got some overlap between CONTINUOUS_VALUE and IDENTIFIER (the chars in IDENTIFIER are a subset of CONTINUOUS_VALUE. There's probably a couple of ways to solve this. One way would be to start CONTINUOUS_VALUE with the '=' and then strip it out of the text. In CSharp it would look like this: CONTINUOUS_VALUE : '=' ~( ALL_WS )+ { Text = Text.Substring(1, Text.Length - 1); } ; Then just take the '=' out of the commandParam rule. The 2nd way would be to make IDENTIFIER and CONTINUOUS_VALUE parser rules (lower-case at least the first letter), then you have context to figure out which one should match. You might be able to make them fragments as well and reference them in commandParam, but I'm not sure if you can nest fragments or not since you already have the ALL_WS fragment. Also, don't you need some sort of separator between the NameValue pairs?
