How to re-scale probabilities based on new cutoff point?

Suppose in a risk analysis study one component that needs to be estimated is probability of a binary event. We use a classification method, SVM for example, and achieve very good classification accuracy by adjusting the cutoff probability to, for example, 0.2 (instead of 0.5). Now, we want to use the probabilities (not predicted classes) in the risk analysis. Obviously, the non-scaled probabilities will not be useful (as 0.2 is our actual 50%). Is there a method to re-scale probabilities based on cutoff points?
