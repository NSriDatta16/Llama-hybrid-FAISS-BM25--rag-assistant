THey are sed in different circumstances - B-trees are used when the tree nodes need to be kept together in storage - typically because storage is a disk page and so re-balancing could be vey expensive. RB trees are used when you don't have this constraint. So B-trees will probably be faster if you want to implement (say) a relational database index, while RB trees will probably be fasterv for (say) an in memory search.
