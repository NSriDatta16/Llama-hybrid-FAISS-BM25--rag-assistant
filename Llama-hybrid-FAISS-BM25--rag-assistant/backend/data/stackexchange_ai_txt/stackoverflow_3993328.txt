You might want to start off with Developing a Model-View-Controller Component - Part 1 tutorial and work your way through that by hand. Using Apache Ant to learn how write an extension is like taking a canon to shoot fish in the barrel. It can be done but probably not the best way of doing it. The Joomla! MVC pattern is very peculiar and difficult to understand. I don't quite understand it myself. I was advised on the developer email list to look at how other components are put together. Guess what? All the other developers do it differently, with some of the bigger components looking like spaghetti code in their organization. The bulk of your component code should be in the controller, either as part of the controller class or a separate class file that's imported in. You don't need a separate library directory unless you're working on a big component with multiple class files. This Joomla! thread might be applicable.
