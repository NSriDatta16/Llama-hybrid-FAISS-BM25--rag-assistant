Add a component into Jframe or JLabel created by Netbeans

I'm using Netbeans. I use Netbeans to create a Jframe and drag and drop a JLabel to Jframe. I want to add a JLinkButton (I use zfqjava JLinkbutoon) to Jframe and to JLable by using code(but not drap and drop) but it doesn't work. Here is my code to add JLinkButton to JFrame this.getContentPane().add(linkButton); and here is my code to add JLinkButton to JLabel lblbackground.add(linkButton);
