Off hand, setting the http.agent system property to "" might do the trick (I don't have the code in front of me). You might get away with: System.setProperty("http.agent", ""); but that might require a race between you and initialisation of the URL protocol handler, if it caches the value at startup (actually, I don't think it does). The property can also be set through JNLP files (available to applets from 6u10) and on the command line: -Dhttp.agent= Or for wrapper commands: -J-Dhttp.agent=
