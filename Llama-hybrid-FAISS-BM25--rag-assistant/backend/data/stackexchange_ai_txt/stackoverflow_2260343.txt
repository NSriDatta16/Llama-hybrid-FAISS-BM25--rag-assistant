c++ accessed url log

im now currently developing a standalone c++ program that would list all the access URL in a browser and its corresponding response time.... at this point of time, i can already sniff all out and in going packets. i am using winpcap for this... retrieved packets were filtered to by only those 'tcp port 80(http) or 443(https)'... and know i want to read some http headers. the problem i have is that usually ip are fragmented. I want to know how to reassemble this and how to have some details about the http.. Note: i want to implement that of WIRESHARK.. in every packet/frame, it has a 'REASSEMBLED TCP SEGMENT' any idea or tutorials how i can easily attain this?!.. thanks alot!
