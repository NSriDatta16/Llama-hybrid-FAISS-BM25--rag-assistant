Stan is a popular and powerful MCMC sampler and their documentation about diagnostics mentions: In the plot, the points representing the values of $n_{\rm eff}/N$ are colored based on whether they are less than 0.1, between 0.1 and 0.5, or greater than 0.5.. These particular values are arbitrary in that they have no particular theoretical meaning, but a useful heuristic is to worry about any $n_{\rm eff}/N$ less than 0.1. One important thing to keep in mind is that these ratios will depend not only on the model being fit but also on the particular MCMC algorithm used. One reason why we have such high ratios of $n_{\rm eff}/N$ is that the No-U-Turn sampler used by rstan generally produces draws from the posterior distribution with much lower autocorrelations compared to draws obtained using other MCMC algorithms (e.g., Gibbs). Where $N$ is the total number of samples. So yes, a comparitively low $N_{\rm eff}$ is generally bad. I imagine your p -value is for whether the parameter's 95% excludes 0, but if you only have a small number of effective samples, you could have a deceivingly small range of values and this small range could give your p test overconfidence.
