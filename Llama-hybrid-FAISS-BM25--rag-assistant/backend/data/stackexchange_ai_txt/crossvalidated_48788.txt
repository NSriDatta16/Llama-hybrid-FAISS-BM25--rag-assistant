A couple of uses that spring to mind: Spam detection: It may be stretching the definition, but spam and not-spam can be considered topics. You might also classify by emotion, trustworthiness, etc. Navigation: Since long before computers existed, libraries have categorized books by topic. It makes them easier to find. The same goes for any document store. Further processing. Automatic methods like machine learning often work much better if the domain on which they operate can be narrowed (for instance, machine translation might be tuned for news or for scientific articles). Information retrieval: A search engine user might like to filter search results by topic (using a 'faceted search' pattern). It might also be used as a keyword in the inverse index representation of the document (that is, to enrich the flat text). Suggested content: Track the topics for the content that a user visits and then suggest new content that matches this 'signature'. You can also use this signature as way to visualize user preferences to interested parties.
