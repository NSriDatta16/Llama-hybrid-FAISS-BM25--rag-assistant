In their privacy policy Google say they adhere to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles which says: Organizations must take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. If your application has to meet specific compliance rules that deal with storage of data then you probably can't use google app engine because you don't have control over what google do internally. This is probably the same for other shared hosting providers.
