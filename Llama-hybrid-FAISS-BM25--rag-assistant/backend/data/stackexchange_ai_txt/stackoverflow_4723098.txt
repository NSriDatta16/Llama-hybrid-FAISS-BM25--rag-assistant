Is there a way to pause a ActiveX Control (MapPoint) or run DoDragDrop async?

I currently working on a application with a MapPoint-Control, which gives me a hard time. After starting a DoDragDrop from the thread, which mappoint also uses, i always get after a few secondes a dialog from mappoint saying my form doesn't react. The MapPoint-Control is a ActiveX-Control, using the control MapPoint starts in the background and runs in a different thread. I think Mappoint trys to update the control but gets a timeout. Is there a way to run DoDragDrop in a different thread, so MapPoint get response from the mainthread. Or is it possible to tell MapPoint my form is currently paused. Or can I somehow pause MapPoint? I have tried to run the DoDragDrop with the form control and with the MapPoint-Control
