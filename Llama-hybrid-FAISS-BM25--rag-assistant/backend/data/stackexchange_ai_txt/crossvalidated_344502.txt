If I had your problem and my favorite piece of software , I would develop two daily models for the two regimes of observed data. The first model would predict the missing observations using approaches described here .. Forecast customer's spending and elsewhere ( see my previous posts on daily data ). Then I would take the data from the second regime and reverse the order so that the missing past would be predicted from the future ( so to speak ! ) How to treat days when shops are closed in sales time series? and Regression on default data and backward extrapolation . I would then average these two sets of forecasts to create pseudo data for the missing/omitted period. As a coup de gras , I would then model the entire data set and use the estimated values for the missing period as my final estimates for the omitted data. I owe this insight to a T.W Anderson https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=q43sWofxF-2b5wKbqYKgDQ&q=t.+w.+anderson&oq=t.+w.+anderson&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l9.1358.7732.0.8947.17.16.0.0.0.0.85.1110.15.16.0..2..0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.16.1198.6..46j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i20i264k1j0i46k1.88.N5aeGxP-0n8 a guiding light in my pursuit of time series solutions/procedures/theory. In direct response to your question about 5,000 individual time series , I can only suggest forecasting some aggregate and then pro-rationing the estimates/fitted values in order to estimate sub-count data used to form the aggregate.
