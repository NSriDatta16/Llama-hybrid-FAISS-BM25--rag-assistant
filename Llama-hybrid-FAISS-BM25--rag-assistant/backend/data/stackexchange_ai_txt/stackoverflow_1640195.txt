I may be wrong but range(1:int(n)) doesn't look like syntactically correct and parenthesis don't match. You may want to calculate the average of numbers in the range of 0 to n. In that case, I would replace your code like this: def average(n): if n >= 0: avg = sum((range(int(n))))/float(n) print avg
