New Paragraph Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some Title1 New Paragraph Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content New Paragraph Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some sample content Some Title1 I want to apply underline and bold italics to someTitle1 and someTitle2 such that they don't apply to whole range; and remain limited to these two text lines only. Any Help? Thanks
