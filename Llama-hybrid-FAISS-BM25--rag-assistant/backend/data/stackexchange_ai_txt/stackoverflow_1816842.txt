I would not recommend #2. You will do much better off with a load balancer. Pay attention to session state management. Unless you configure the load balancer to keep each user on the same web server, you will have to use the session state server or database. Also, check your code's usage of Application and Cache variables. These will be different on every web server. If those values are static, you may not have a problem. But if they can change, you can end up with different values on each web server. There used to be a problem with ViewState in 1.x, as explained here . I'm not sure if this problem still exists. Then, there are some changes that you need to make to the Machine Key in web.config, as explained here .
