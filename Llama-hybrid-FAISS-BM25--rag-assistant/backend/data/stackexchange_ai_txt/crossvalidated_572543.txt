Two-stage approaches (i.e., deciding whether to treat variance as (un)equal) Following up a little bit on the discussion in the comments (i.e., using var.test() to decide whether to use var.equal = FALSE or not). As a general principle, using statistical tests to decide which test to use (a two-stage approach) works surprisingly poorly (e.g. Campbell and Dean 2014; Campbell 2021); it's best to decide in advance on principled grounds. Ruxton (2006) says The problem with this flexible approach [i.e., using a test of homogeneity of variance to decide which version of the t-test to use] is that the combination of this preliminary test plus whichever of the subsequent tests is ultimately used controls Type I error rates less well than simply always performing an unequal variance t-test on every occasion (Gans 1992; Moser and Stevens 1992), this is one reason why it is generally unwise to decide whether to perform one statistical test on the basis of the outcome of another (Zimmerman 2004 and references therein). There are further reasons for not recommending preliminary tests of variances (e.g., Markowski CA and Markowski EP 1990; Quinn and Keough 2002, p. 42). Hence, I suggest avoiding preliminary tests and adopting the unequal variance t-test unless an argument based on logical, physical, or biological grounds can be made as to why the variances are very likely to be identical for the 2 populations under investigation. Box-Cox transformation Another approach that would be reasonable if you had decided on it in advance would be to do a Box-Cox procedure to decide how to transform the data: m1 This shows that the optimal response transformation is near lambda = 1/2, i.e. taking the square root of the response. summary(m2 |t|) (Intercept) 5.7122 0.1651 34.599 With this model the effect looks not-quite-significant at the p=0.05 level. Furthermore, the model diagnostics look OK. par(las=1, bty = "l") par(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(m2) In this simple a model the diagnostic plots don't tell us very much, but we can conclude (top right) that the residuals are very close to Normal (although this is the least important of the assumptions of the linear model); (bottom left) that, after transforming, the variances are almost identical between groups; (bottom right) that there are no particularly influential points (the Cook's distance = 0.5 contour is barely visible on the plot).
