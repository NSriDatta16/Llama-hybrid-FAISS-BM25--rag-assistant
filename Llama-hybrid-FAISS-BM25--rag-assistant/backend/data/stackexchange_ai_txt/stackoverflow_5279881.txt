Different cultures use different thousands and decimal separators. en-US (US English) uses "," and "." but de-DE (German German) uses "." and ",". This means that when reading from or writing to strings you need to use the proper culture. When persisting information for later retrieval that generally means CultureInfo.InvariantCulture . When displaying information to the user that generally means CultureInfo.CurrentCulture . You haven't provided the code that reads from the CSV file, but I imagine you're doing something like double.Parse(field) for each field. If the field has the value "5.0" and you parse it when the current culture is de-DE "." will be considered a thousands separator and the value gets read as 50.0 in en-US terms. What you should be doing is double.Parse(field, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) . All of the Parse , TryParse , Format , and many ToString methods accept an IFormatProvider . Get in the habit of always providing the appropriate format provider and you wont get bitten by internationalization issues.
