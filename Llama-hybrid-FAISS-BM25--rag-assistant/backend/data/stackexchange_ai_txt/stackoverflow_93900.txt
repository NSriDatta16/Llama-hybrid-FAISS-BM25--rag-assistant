Can't add server to a moved workspace

I have this workspace downloaded off the web and I try running it on a tomcat server from a fresh installation of Eclipse Ganymede. This particular project came with its own workspace. When I select Tomcat v6.0 I get a message Cannot create a server using the selected type Older tomcat versions are available, though. I guess I have to recreate some configuration setting. The question is which one? This seems to be some odd error as creating a new dynamic web project lets me configure tomcat for both of them
