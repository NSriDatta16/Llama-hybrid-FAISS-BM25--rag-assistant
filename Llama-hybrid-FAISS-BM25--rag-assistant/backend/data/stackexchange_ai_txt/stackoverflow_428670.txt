Windows .Net controls - Creating property templates

Assume that all text box controls in my .Net Windows application created by dragging a TextBox control onto the Form editor should have the following default properties (some text box instances can override these properties) : Text Align: Centre Resize : As per content Dock: Left, Top and Right Now, it becomes cumbersome and manually boring task to set these properties every time it is needed. Is there any way by which these properties can be defaulted at an "Assembly level". I know that User controls will solve the problem, but that I believe that it is a costly solution, and I think that there should be a simpler and more elegant solution for this problem. Thanks
