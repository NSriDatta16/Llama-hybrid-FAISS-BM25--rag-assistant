Compare variances between 2 time series groups

I have a set of 40 subjects that performed a task while the variables of interest were being recorded at regular time intervals (0, 1, 2,.... 10 seconds). The task was performed twice, once with and once without the aid of computer feedback. For most of the variables, the distribution across subjects at each time point is a normal distribution. But for a few, they are heavily skewed. I'd like to know if the variance of the collected variables between the subjects was significantly different during the feedback-assisted task. What is the best way to do this?
