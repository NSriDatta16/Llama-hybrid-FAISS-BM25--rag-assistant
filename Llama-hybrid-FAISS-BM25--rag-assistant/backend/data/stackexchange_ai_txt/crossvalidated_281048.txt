problem with linear regression

I made a linear regression multiple model, I've got all the parameters insignificant with high p value, I get this result: The variables are time series. Rates except Polity which is natural number from (-10 to 2) I tried also a simple regression with each explicative variable, it's also not significant What could be the cause of such a result ? How to fix that ?
