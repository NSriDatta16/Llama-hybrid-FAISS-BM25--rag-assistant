Calculate centroid in PCA

If I understand correctly in order to calculate a centroid in PCA I can calculate the mean of X points and Y points (e.g., PC1 and PC2). When I run a simple PCA (code below) I donâ€™t get the centroid of each group (species). Unfortunately, I do not know how to continue from this point as I am new in R. Therefore, how can I calculate the centroid of each group and plot it? require(ggplot2) pca Thanks a lot.
