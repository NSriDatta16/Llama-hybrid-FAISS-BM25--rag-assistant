Can we force a fitted distribution to have the same mean as the data?

I have some rainfall data that I am fitting with a Weibull distribution. The mean of the rainfall data is 0.62, but the mean of the best-fit Weibull distribution is 0.69. As a result, when I simulate data from the fitted Weibull distribution, the simulated rainfall is slightly too high, on average. Would forcing the Weibull distribution to have the same mean be a reasonable thing to do, and if so, how would I go about it? Update: more details - I am using maximum likelihood estimation to fit hourly precip. data, from which I have removed the zeros and standardized by the seasonal mean and standard deviation.
