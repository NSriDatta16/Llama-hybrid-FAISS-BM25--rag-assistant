SVM: Representer Theorem or KKT conditions?

If we need to solve the SVM problem in its primal formulation, is it correct to use a predictor derived from the Representer Theorem written as: $f(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{l} \alpha_i K(\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}) + b$ with $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}$ , or a predictor derived from the KKT optimality conditions: $f(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{l} \alpha_i y_i K(\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}) + b$ with $\alpha_i \geq 0$ ?
