silverlight 3 datagrid drag-drop column vertically

Is it possible to allow a datagrid column to be dragged vertically and dropped into an area above the datagrid which triggers it to group by that column? If so, how would i best implement this into a silverlight 3 application? Heres an example of what it could look like: http://www.syncfusion.com/content/en-US/products/feature/windows-forms/grid/img/windows-forms-grid-dragcolumnintogrouparea.png
