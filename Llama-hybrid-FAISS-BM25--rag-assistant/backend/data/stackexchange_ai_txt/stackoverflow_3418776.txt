How to perform an action after a moving UIImage reaches a specific point

i am trying out a pong game to start out developing games on the the iphone and i've got everything moving but i need to implement the scoring and make the ball return to the center of the screen this is the code i have currently in the touchesBegan method: if(ball.center.y >=444) { computerScore=computerScore+1; computerScoreLabel=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", computer]; ball.center.x=151; ball.center.y=222; } if(ball.center.y it builds correctly and runs, but when i try the game on the simulator it just makes the ball move around and when it passes the specific points it just bounces off and the score doesn't change
