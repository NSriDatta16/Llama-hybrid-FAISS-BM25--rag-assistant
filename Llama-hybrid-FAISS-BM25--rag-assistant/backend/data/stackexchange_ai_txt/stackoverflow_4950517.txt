No, the fragment operations will be performed anyway, but their result will be squashed by your zero color mask. If you don't want some fragment operations to be performed - use the proper shader program which has an empty fragment shader attached and set the draw buffer to GL_NONE. There is another way to disable fragment processing - to enable GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD, but you won't get even the depth values in this case :)
