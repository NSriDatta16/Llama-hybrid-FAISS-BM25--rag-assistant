Is this more suited for key value storage or a tree?

I'm trying to figure out the best way to represent some data. It basically follows the form Manufacturer.Product.Attribute = Value. Something like: Acme.*.MinimumPrice = 100 Acme.ProductA.MinimumPrice = 50 Acme.ProductB.MinimumPrice = 60 Acme.ProductC.DefaultColor = Blue So the minimum price across all Acme products is 100 except in the case of product A and B. I want to store this data in C# and have some function where GetValue("Acme.ProductC.MinimumPrice") returns 100 but GetValue("Acme.ProductA.MinimumPrice") return 50. I'm not sure how to best represent the data. Is there a clean way to code this in C#? Edit: I may not have been clear. This is configuration data that needs to be stored in a text file then parsed and stored in memory in some way so that it can be retrieved like the examples I gave.
