Jquery UI - Sortable & Draggable revert speed

i have a problem with the revert speed. Here is a working example http://www.jsfiddle.net/V9Euk/94/ Change something in the sortable list ... the speed is fast (revert 100). But when you drop the "four" into the sortable list, the speed is slow. But why? oO kind reagards Peter
