Apologies that this is a bit off tangent, but I've always wondered what percentage of EA like modelling tools get used properly through a project. Of the instances I've used it was difficult to keep full round-tripping going and it was more used as a conceptual architecture tool to get the message across to the team. So a diagram tool with organized files normally work fine and gets my pretty diagrams. @Adrian what do you term as 'real' work here?
