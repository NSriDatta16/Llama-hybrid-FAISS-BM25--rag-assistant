Predictive model from sequential data R

I have a prediction problem as follows: My predictors are sequences and my outcome variable a binary. Example data: sequences of 100 values and 1 outcome variable. set.seed(1) data = matrix(sample(seq(-10, 10, 0.1), 20000, replace = T) , 20, 100) data = as.data.frame(data) data$outcome = sample(c(0,1), 20, replace = T) Now I want to see how well the sequences predict the outcome. If I do a normal classification such as (without any data split for this illustration): library(caret) pred_model = train(outcome ~ . , data = data , method = "svmLinear") ... I neglect the fact that the 100 predictors need to be in that sequence rather than non-ordered. My question is: which algorithms can I use that can map a sequence to a single value? In principle, I could treat the sequence as a time series, but then too: which algorithms can predict an outcome based on a time series. I guess this is a common problem in disciplines other than mine, so any pointers would be much appreciated. (Preferably, I'd look for an implementation in R)
