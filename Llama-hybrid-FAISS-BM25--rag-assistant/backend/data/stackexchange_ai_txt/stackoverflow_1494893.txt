Good looking reporting + charts solution for ASP.NET?

I am developing an ASP.NET MVC website which will include reports and charts based on the data entered by our users. Reports must be easily printable and exportable to PDF and XLS. Ideally, Reports should also contain inline charts. I've played a bit with Crystal Reports and it does seem fit for the job except that the charts look horrible. That's about the same visual quality I get in my charts: http://www.builderau.com.au/resources/images/ReportingB.gif For instance, pie charts look blocky (no antialiasing) and there doesn't seem to be any way to have some nice looking color gradients. I was rather expecting something like this, especially since it seems to be crystal reports as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CrystalReports2008.png Is there any way to make my charts look like that? If not, what other options are there? Please note that CR Chart Plus seems to do what I am looking for, but it definitely exceeds my budget for this program feature. I'm looking for a cheaper way, such as somehow embedding ASP.NET Charting Controls within a Crystal Report.
