The output you've shown is for exploratory factor analysis, not PCA. There are many tutorials out there that explain the relationship between PCA and factor analysis. In both PCA and exploratory factor analysis, every variable will have some loading on every component. The varimax rotation you've used attempts to find a solution with a few large loadings and most of the rest as close to 0 as possible (I'm simplifying, but that's the general idea). Your software is only showing you loadings over a particular value (probably >0.35 ), but in reality there's a loading in every cell of your table.
