I've been experimenting, and think I've found the way: 1) Tortoise-move the file using the right-click-drag context menu (or whatever SVN method you want). 2) Use the windows filesystem to move it back. 3) Drag-move the file in Eclipse to update all the references. 4) Commit - it shows as a delete/add, but it saves the history, and it does change the package references in one commit (keeping each commit buildable). Old question, but I keep returning to it, so this is my documentation!
