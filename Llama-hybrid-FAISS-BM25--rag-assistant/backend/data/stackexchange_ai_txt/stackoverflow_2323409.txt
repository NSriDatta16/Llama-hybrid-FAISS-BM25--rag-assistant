Combining jQuery Sortable and Drop Event

Basically I have a draggable list which is connected with a sortable list. Works great except I need some sort of Drop event which I can use to change the list item after its dropped into the sortable list. This works with .draggable -> .droppable but is there a fix for draggable -> .sortable?
