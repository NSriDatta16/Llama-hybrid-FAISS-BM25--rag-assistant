err.rate randomForest R

OOB error rate in the documentation is defined as (classification only) vector error rates of the prediction on the input data, the i-th element being the (OOB) error rate for all trees up to the i-th. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf I need help in understanding this. I have 500 trees, and generally the error rate decreases as the number of trees increases. Why would this decrease as the number of trees increases? When I print model$err.rate[,1] , and we see the 500 oob error values, is this specifically for the last prediction, or is it some average? When you print(Forest) and it returns the OOB estimate of error rate, how does this single value relate to the 500 values printed previously, and how does the confusion matrix relate?
