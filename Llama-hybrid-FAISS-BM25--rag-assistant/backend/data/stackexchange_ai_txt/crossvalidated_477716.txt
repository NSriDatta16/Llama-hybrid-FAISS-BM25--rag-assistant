You interpret the coefficients in the same way as if you do it without regularization. For example, if you run logistic regression and your coefficient for variable x1 is 0.5, then that means the odds ratio is 1.64 and that variable is positively associated with your outcome. glmnet by default standardizes the variables and that is mentioned in the documentation when (standardize = TRUE). The coefficients you get after that from your model are actually rescaled back to the original scale. A good piece of read about this can be seen here
