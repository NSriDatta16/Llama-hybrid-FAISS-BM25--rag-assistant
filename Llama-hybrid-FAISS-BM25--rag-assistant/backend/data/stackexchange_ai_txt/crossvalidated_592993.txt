How to find significance for Gini coefficient changes?

I'm using the Gini coefficient to evaluate the performance of a model. Making some changes (feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.) I created variant models with different Gini coefficients. How can I prove that the improvement in the Gini coefficient is indeed statistically significant? NB: This question was also asked in the Data Science StackExchange.
