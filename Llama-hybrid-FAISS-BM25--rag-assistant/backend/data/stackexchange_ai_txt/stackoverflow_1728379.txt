Migrate Java Applet to what/where?

I am reviewing currently a medium size code base (around 30K LOC) which uses a huge Applet and interfaces with other systems. It's a tool to create custom labels, so we need drag-n-drop and other related UI components. To which technogly will you migrate given the code base is in Java. Applet -- No Java FX -- Adoption rate is too low GWT -- Refactoring is not easy Any ideas/suggestions.
