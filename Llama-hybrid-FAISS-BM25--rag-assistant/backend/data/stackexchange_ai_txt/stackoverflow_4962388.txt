Rails suddenly needs an template.. when its there?

I've been setting up views acquiesced with AJAX all afternoon, and suddenly one of them snags and gives me this error : ActionView::MissingTemplate (Missing template tabs/tabs_result.erb in view path app/views:vendor/plugins/rails-ckeditor/app/views): Strange.. my routes organization.resources :tabs, :collection => {:tabs_result => :get} produces this route: tabs_result_organization_tabs GET /organizations/:organization_id/tabs/tabs_result(.:format) I've never needed an action in the controller so I just skip that. I have a file here /tabs/tabs_result.js.haml And I call it with this line : = link_to tab.title, tabs_result_organization_tabs_path(organization, tab), :class => 'show-result' Anyone know why that error is popping up ? I thought I would also point out that if I renamed the file it tabs_result.js.erb even though its not, and I don't want it to be, it gives me this error : ActionController::UnknownAction (No action responded to tabs_result. Actions: create, destroy, edit, edit_order, new, show, update, and update_order):
