How to get bind a (WPF or Infragistics) DataGrid to a List > or List ?

I need to bind a collection of strings inside a collection of strings to a DataGrid (Infragistics). However, when I bind it like this: to either this: public List TheCollection or this: public List > TheCollection I get this: What kind of .NET types do I need to use so that it displays this collection within a collection as a grid , i.e. like this: bank11 1111111 bank12 2222222 I can't use custom objects since this is being used by a module that can't have any references to other modules and has to accept simple .NET types.
