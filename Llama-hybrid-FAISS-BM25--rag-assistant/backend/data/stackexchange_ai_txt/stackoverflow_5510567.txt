Ant build in linux

I'm trying to run an ant build in linux and I'm getting odd results. I can't seem to get anything to run without specifying each and every library on the classpath, so I systematically added every jar in the "lib" and "ant/dep/lib" locations to the classpath explicitly. It runs a bit without any issues (it's a setup batch, so in the first phase of the script, it uses a lot of "input" tasks), then I receive the message that org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.PropertyFile was not found. Looking around, I discovered it was located in ant-nodeps.jar and I had added it to the class path, but no change. Complete failure due to missing libraries I can understand, but why would the build partially function if I was sure I was including every library (including ant-nodeps.jar)? The script file to launch it is as follows: #!/QOpenSys/usr/bin/bsh ANT_HOME=dep/ant PARAMS="-Dant.home=$ANT_HOME -Dsystem.type=as400 -Dis-as400=y" LIBS="lib/ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar:lib/ant-launcher.jar:lib/ant.jar:lib/catalina-ant.jar:lib/catalina-deployer.jar:lib/commons-net-2.2.jar:lib/el-api.jar:lib/ganymed.jar:lib/jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar:lib/jasper-el.jar:lib/jasper.jar:lib/jsp-api.jar:lib/log4j-1.2.16.jar:lib/mail.jar" ANTLIBS="$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-antlr.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-jai.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-starteam.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-bcel.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-javamail.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-stylebook.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-bsf.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-jdepend.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-swing.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-log4j.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-jmf.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-testutil.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-oro.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-jsch.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-trax.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-regexp.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-junit.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-weblogic.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-apache-resolver.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-launcher.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-commons-logging.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-netrexx.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/xercesImpl.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-commons-net.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant-nodeps.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/xml-apis.jar" java -classpath $LIBS:$ANTLIBS $PARAMS org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher -buildfile install/install.xml Any help would be appreciated, even if only suggestions for what to try. EDIT: In light of oers observation, I realized that there are shell scripts for ant afterall (have pity, I'm no expert in linux), so I'm going to attempt to use it to launch ant rather than try to do the same thing myself. I'll let everyone know of my progress and/or if I was able to fix it doing it that way.
