There have been two publications recently providing compelling results using gradient-free optimization for Reinforcement Learning: "Simple random search provides a competitive approach to reinforcement learning" and "Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning" . I implemented both methods for a simulated robotics task and am seeing very good results especially with Random Search, which confirms the good scores the author of the paper observed. GA isn't performing as well, also confirming the observation of the authors seeing it perform astoundingly well in Atari games and much worse in simulated Robotics environments. Anyway, it's 2018 and it's looking like gradient-free optimization methods have a bright future.
