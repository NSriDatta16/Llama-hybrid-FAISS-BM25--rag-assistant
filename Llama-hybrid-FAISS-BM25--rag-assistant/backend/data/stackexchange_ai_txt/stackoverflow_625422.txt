If you've really installed them, then the compiler shouldn't need to find the source code. The compiler only needs the DCU files. But if you've taken these components from Delphi 7, then you need to have the source code, because Delphi 7 DCU files are not compatible with Delphi 2009. (The only two versions ever that can use each other's DCU files are Delphi 2006 and Delphi 2007, and then only with certain restrictions.) Trying to use DCU files from the wrong Delphi version will cause Delphi to try to recompile the units. The solution is not just to provide the path to the source code, though. If the units files haven't been compiled yet (and they obviously haven't if they're of the wrong Delphi version), then you haven't really installed anything. Installing components in Delphi has never involved dragging and dropping. Installing a component means installing the package that contains that component, and installing a package often means opening the DPK project file and then choosing the "install" command in the IDE.
