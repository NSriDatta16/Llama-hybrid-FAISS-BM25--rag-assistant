Picking the smallest number of i. i. d. exponential variables to satisfy a condition

The lifetime of a brand of lamp is exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda=0.01\;h^{-1}$. How many lamps are needed so that there's a 95% probability that a room is lit for 1,000 hours, if a) when a lamp burns, the next one is used? b) all lamps are turned on simultaneously? a) The lifetimes $X_1,â€¦,X_n$ are independent, and I know that the sum of i. i. d. exponential variables has a gamma distribution. $$X_1+...+X_n\triangleq Y\overset\perp\sim \mathrm{Gamma}(n,\lambda)\\ \mathbb P(Y\ge 1000) \ge 0.95\\ \mathbb P(2\lambda Y\gt 2000\lambda) \ge 0.95\\ 2\lambda Y\triangleq T\sim \mathrm{Gamma}(n,0.5)\equiv \mathrm{\chi^2}(2n)\\ \mathbb P(T\gt 20) \ge 0.95\quad,$$ and a chi-squared table (and the restriction that $2n$ is even) gives $n=16$. Is there a way to answer this without a table (or just a normal table)? b) Since the previous item uses one lamp at a time, I assume one is enough to light the room. Therefore, I need the largest lifetime to be 1,000 h or more. $$\max\{X_1,...,X_n\}\triangleq Z\\ \begin{align}\mathbb P(Z\ge1000) &= 1-\mathbb P(Z\le1000) =\\ &=1 - \mathbb P(X_1\le1000,...,X_n\le1000)\overset{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}=\\ &=1 - [\mathrm{cdf_{Exp(0.01)}}(1000)]^n = 1 - (1-e^{-0.01\cdot1000})^n \end{align}\\ 1 - (1-e^{-10})^n \ge 0.95\\ (1-e^{-10})^n \le 0.05\\ n\log(1-e^{-10}) \le \log 0.05\\ n\log[(1-e^{-10})^{-1}] \ge \log 20\\ 4.5401\cdot10^{-5}\cdot n\ge 2.9957\\ n\ge 65983.9\quad,$$ and so I need 65,984 lamps, a suspiciouly large number, even though I want one of them to last ten times its average lifetime. Is something wrong?
