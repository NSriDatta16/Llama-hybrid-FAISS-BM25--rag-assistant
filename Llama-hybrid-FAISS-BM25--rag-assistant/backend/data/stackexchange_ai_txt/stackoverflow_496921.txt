How can I change the color of a substring of a LinkButton's label in Flex 3?

I'm trying to figure out the most elegant way to change the color of just one character of the label on a LinkButton control. Given something like this: myLinkButtonStyle { textRollOverColor: #FFFFFF; } ... what'd be the most appropriate, most "Flex-appropriate" (if you will) way to change, for example, the word "Label" from white to red on rollover only? Seems like this ought to be relatively simple, and I'm sure there's probably a TextRange in there somewhere, but I figured I'd ask the question here first before heading down a blind (or badly hacked) alley. Thanks in advance!
