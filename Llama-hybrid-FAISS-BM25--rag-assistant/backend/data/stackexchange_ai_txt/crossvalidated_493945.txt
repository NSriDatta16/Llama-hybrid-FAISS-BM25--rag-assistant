How do you test for a "moderator" with ANOVA?

I am trying to understand the terminology, and the appropriate test. What is the difference between a moderator, and just another factor, with ANOVA? The first factor is a consumer's market confidence (very low, low, average, high, very high). The question is whether "a consumer's market confidence is moderated by gender" (male, female). The target is spending (continuous). Does a post-hoc test tell you whether gender is a moderator? I know post-hocs will tell you which levels are significant. I assume this is set up in R as anova(spending ~ confidence + gender, data = SomeData) What is the difference between gender being a moderator, as opposed to another factor? An example coding in R would be informative here. Thanks.
