I think your question points out the fundamentally organic nature of feature creep, and in understanding that nature, you will be empowered to meditate on the larger question. Think of it like a garden: If you plant one thing and plant it well, say, a chrysanthemum, you aren't done at simply planting the seed. In fact you'll need to ensure that the soil is well tended, that the area is sufficiently protected, that the season is right, etc. As your chrysanthemum (your one thing ) grows, so too will other competitive plants - some that need to be weeded out and others that may actually compliment the original one thing . In fact, these other organisms may in some cases prove vital for the survival of your one thing . Like those features that YAGN , a bit of vigilance is required to determine which weeds represent feature creep and which represent vital and complimentary functions. Regardless, having done it well means simply that your chrysanthemum is hearty, healthy, and on-time. :-)
