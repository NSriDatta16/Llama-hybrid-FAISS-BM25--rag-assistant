(edit: for now the Browser Capability Project is closed, i.e. atm this answer is not an option) All you need is get_browser() and a recent browscap.ini that maps the user-agent string to a browser/version and its capabilities. You can get a usually very up-to-date browscap.ini version from http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp
