You will have to process your new data in the same way that you processed the original data. Regarding PCA, you will need to apply the weights from the original PCA to the new data, and not do a new PCA on the new data. Using the original weights will ensure that all data, new and old, are comparable and have been treated similarly. Regarding clustering, how to assign new data points to 'old' clusters (in respect to their locations, cutoffs, etc) depends on the type of clustering you did, but the same rule applies as for PCA - do your cluster assignment using the information (cluster locations, cutoffs, etc) obtained from clustering on the original data.
