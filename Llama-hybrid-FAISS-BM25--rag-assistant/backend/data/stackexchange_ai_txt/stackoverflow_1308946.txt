Should I use Query Hint Fast number_rows / FASTFIRSTROW?

I was reading over the documentation for query hints: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181714(SQL.90).aspx And noticed this: FAST number_rows Specifies that the query is optimized for fast retrieval of the first number_rows. This is a nonnegative integer. After the first number_rows are returned, the query continues execution and produces its full result set. So when I'm doing a query like: Select Name from Students where ID = 444 Should I bother with a hint like this? Assuming SQL Server 2005, when should I? -- edit -- Also should one bother when limiting results: Select top 10 * from Students OPTION (FAST 10)
