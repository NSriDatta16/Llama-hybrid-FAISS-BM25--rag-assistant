Embedding a Jar into a C# Form

Ok this situation is a bit difficult. But I am trying to embed a Java Jar into a C# form. Not as a new window or new process. The Jar will be a game that uses the LWJGL library. The C# Form will be a "wrapper" for it with tools and more. Anyone have any ideas? Is this even possible?
