Image preprocessing are the steps taken to format images before they are used by model training and inference. This includes, resizing, orienting, and color corrections. Preprocessing is required to clean image data for model input. For example, fully connected layers in convolutional neural networks required that all images are the same sized arrays. Image preprocessing may also decrease model training time and increase model inference speed.
