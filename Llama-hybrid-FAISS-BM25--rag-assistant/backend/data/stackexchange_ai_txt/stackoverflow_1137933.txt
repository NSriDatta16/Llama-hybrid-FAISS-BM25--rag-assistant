This article describes how to use JSR 256 on Sony Ericson phones to read the battery level, network coverage and a few other interesting sensor data. It is support from JP8.3 and onward. The code that does the trick: SensorInfo[] batteryInfo = SensorManager.findSensors("battery_charge", null); SensorConnection sensor = (SensorConnection)Connector.open(batteryInfo[0].getUrl()); Data data[] = sensor.getData(1); String batteryLevel = "Current charge level: "+data[0].getIntValues()[0];
