As @whuber mentioned, this is censored data. The lifelines python library is a very good one for survival analysis. It has excellent documentation that is a good place to start learning about the topic. Here are some excerpts from the docs: The individuals in a population who have not been subject to the death event are labeled as right-censored, i.e., we did not (or can not) view the rest of their life history due to some external circumstances. All the information we have on these individuals are their current lifetime durations (which is naturally less than their actual lifetimes). A common mistake data analysts make is choosing to ignore the right-censored individuals. We will see why this is a mistake next. Furthermore, if we instead simply took the mean of all lifespans, including the current lifespans of right-censored instances, we would still be underestimating the true average lifespan. Another package option is scikit-survival . One final note: consider whether the event foo can only happen once to each population unit (like death), or if it can recur (like pregnancy). If the latter is true, you might have to look into methods for recurrent event analysis.
