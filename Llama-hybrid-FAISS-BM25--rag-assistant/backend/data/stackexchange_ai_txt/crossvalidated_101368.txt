One could construct a polarization index; exactly how one defines it depends on what constitutes being more polarized (i.e. what, exactly do you mean, in particular edge cases, by more or less polarized?): For example, if the mean is '4', is a 50-50 split between '3' and '5' more, or less polarized than 25% '1' and 75% '5'? Anyway, in the absence of that kind of specific definition of what you mean, I'll suggest a measure based off variance: Given a particular mean, define the most polarized possible split as the one that maximizes variance*. *(NB that would say that 25% '1' and 75% '5' is substantially more polarized than 50-50 split of '3's and '5's; if that doesn't match your intuition, don't use variance) So this polarization index is the proportion of the largest possible variance ( with the observed mean ) in the observed variance. Call the average rating $m$ ($m=\bar x$). The maximum variance occurs when a proportion $p=\frac{m-1}{4}$ is at $5$ and $1-p$ is at $1$; this has a variance of $(m-1)(5-m) \cdot \frac{n}{n-1}$. So simply take the sample variance and divide by $(m-1)(5-m) \cdot \frac{n}{n-1}$; this gives a number between $0$ (perfect agreement) and $1$ (completely polarized). For a number of cases where the mean rating is 4, this would give the following: You might instead prefer not to compute them relative to the biggest possible variance with the same mean, but instead as a percentage of the biggest possible variance for any mean rating . That would involve dividing instead by $4 \cdot \frac{n}{n-1}$, and again yields a value between 0 (perfect agreement) and $1$ (polarized at the extremes in a 50-50 ratio). This would yield the same relativities as the diagram above, but all the values would be 3/4 as large (that is, from left to right, top to bottom they'd be 0, 16.5%, 25%, 25%, 50% and 75%). Either of the two is a perfectly valid choice - as is any other number of alternative ways of constructing such an index.
